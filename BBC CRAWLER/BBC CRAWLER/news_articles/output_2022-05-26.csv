""When I did my first movie, Tim Burton was getting ready to do Batman and he was interested in me because he wanted it to be edgy and real. ""I thought, 'Batman? That's a stupid idea', even though he had just done one of my favourite movies of all time, Beetlejuice. So yes, I regret not auditioning for that'.""

Wales' Covid laws end as hospital mask rule axedMasks will no longer be legally required in health and social care as all rules end on Monday.,"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford removes all remaining Covid restrictions in Wales The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in Welsh health and social care services from Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed the ending of the last of Wales' Covid rules, which have been in place in some form since March 2020. Ministers said the public health situation had continued to improve over the last few weeks. Wales was the last part of the UK with Covid restrictions still in place. However most of the rules that affected people's day to day lives, such as wearing face masks in shops and on public transport and self-isolation rules,ended in March. It will no longer be a legal requirement to wear a mask in hospitals from Monday - but guidance will remain The number of people estimated to have Covid-19 in Wales has fallen for the sixth week in a row. However the Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Guidance will remain in place strongly recommending the use of face coverings in health settings to help protect the most vulnerable. Wales' Covid laws and mass testing to be axed What are the latest Covid rules for Wales? What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now? Announcing the decision in a news conference, Mr Drakeford said authorities were planning to deal with Covid like ""any other seasonal illness"" from now on. But he warned measures were in reality ""on hold"" in case of another wave - with two new variants already being monitored by health officials. ""We have learned, time and again, that this virus can behave in ways that are neither expected nor predictable,"" he said. He said that the Welsh government was ""ready to bring back testing and contact tracing"", should that be needed. Booster vaccines are already being made available for the autumn, and ministers are encouraging people to get a flu jab later this year. Early indications were that ministers would be advised to offer an annual Covid jab in future years, the first minister added, possibly only to older age groups and the most vulnerable. Broader mask rules were scrapped earlier in the year Despite the changes to rules on face masks, Helen Whyley, director of nurses union RCN Wales, asked people to continue wearing them in healthcare settings if asked. She said: ""The legal requirement may be removed, however health and social care professionals across settings are still asking people to think carefully about wearing a mask when attending appointments or visiting friends and family. In some circumstances staff may ask you to wear a mask. ""I am encouraging everyone to be respectful with these requests to help keep the people of Wales safe and health care services recover from the pandemic."" Care Forum Wales said the decision was a ""step towards the normality everyone wants"" but admitted there would be a mixture of emotions. ""It's impossible to estimate the level of trauma people have gone through in the sector,"" chief executive Mary Wimbury toldRadio Wales Breakfast. ""It's going to have to be risk assessed for each sector. ""Sometimes you're going into people's homes where there is a lot of people in and out throughout the day, not wearing masks, and it's going to be great for staff not to have to [wear them] throughout the summer. ""Equally there is going to be vulnerable people you are still visiting and they will want you to wear masks. ""We understand why the restrictions have continued, but it is all about balance."" Newport's Lucy Taylor said she remained cautious and still wore her mask at work Lucy Taylor, from Newport, has cystic fibrosis and shielded during the pandemic. The 29-year-old said it had taken her a long time to be able to venture out and she continued to wear her mask at work. She said: ""It's better for me to live normally again. ""I think if I don't do that I'll just go back into my shell and I'm going to be so scared of going out, that I'm not going to want to go out."" Alex Osbourne has been shielding for the past two years due to her MS Alex Osbourne, from Caerphilly, works for the charity Disability Wales and has been shielding since the start of the pandemic due to her multiple sclerosis (MS). ""I'm quite anxious about this,"" she said, of the final rule being dropped. ""Masks made me feel a bit safer. I have to go to hospital quite a lot so the idea that they won't be worn there anymore is really stressful. ""I understand people don't want to wear them anymore, but it's very stressful for people like me with no immune system who don't have that same confidence as everyone else to start mixing again."" There were an estimated 52,900 people with the virus, according to the weekly swab survey of thousands of households in Wales by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said this was one in 55 people - or 1.74% of the population, in the week ending 21 May,  a reduction for a sixth successive week. Daily estimates have infections highest in those in their early 40s and lowest in those over 80. Latest hospital figures in Wales showed on Thursday there were only 25 acute patients with Covid who were being actively treated for the virus. According to Digital Health and Care Wales figures, 85% of patients who tested positive for Covid were in hospital to be treated for something else. Looking at patients testing positive for Covid in all hospitals, the average in the last week has dropped by 27% to 215 - the lowest average since last August. Welsh Conservative shadow health minister Russell George said he was delighted that Covid regulations were ending. He said: ""Not only do we need to remember all those who lost lives and loved ones to lockdowns and the virus itself, but learn the lessons about how we can counter another pandemic and assess the impact of deploying harsh emergency restrictions on our population. ""But none of us will ever get the answers we deserve without the Wales-specific public inquiry everyone in the country wants apart from, not surprisingly, the Labour government who run scared of scrutiny."" Answering journalists' questions, Mr Drakeford again rejected such an investigation, saying he was ""confident"" the UK inquiry, chaired by Baroness Hallett, was ""sensitive to the needs of Wales"". A Welsh-only probe ""would not provide the answers people rightly would expect from an inquiry"", he added. Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said he shared the ""nervousness among health professionals about the removal of the need to wear masks in health and care settings, because of vulnerability of so many in the sector"". ""[The] Welsh government must make sure they monitor very carefully the extent to which people follow the guidance for people to continue wearing them in these settings,"" he added. Now that the Covid regulations are going, Mr ap Iorwerth said, ""we owe it to our hard-working staff"" to ""bring our health service on to a more sustainable footing, by reducing waiting times, speeding up the patient journey, and joining up health with social care"". Although the requirement to wear a face covering in health and social care was not part of the original legislation, coronavirus rules in Wales have existed in some form since March 2020. The law was used to impose strict curbs on people's day to day lives, including three stay-at-homelockdowns,restrictions on traveland on whatbusinesses could and could not do. In Wales masks became obligatory in all indoor public places in September 2020. Powers under public health legislation meant the rules could be imposed quickly, without always having to go to the Senedd for a vote first. Welsh ministers added and removed measures as the Covid situation changed. Initially the rules were largely the same across the UK, although this changed as England reopened in the summer of 2020, and differences developed between the different nations. Mr Drakeford's approach to sometimes ease restrictions slower than in England, and to impose restrictions during the first Omicron wave in the autumn, had been criticised by the Welsh Conservatives for being too stringent or for not moving fast enough to lift rules. But the Welsh government has said it had the public's support for how it managed the regulations. While the requirement to self-isolate has ended in law, and only LFTs and not PCR tests are now available to the general public, routine contract tracing has continued in Wales. Under the Welsh government's Covid-19 strategy, it will end in June. It ended in England on 24 February. In Friday's news conference, Mr Drakeford said Wales has a stock of 90 million lateral flow tests, and a decision is still to be made on whether to offer those stocks for free in the winter. The decision was whether to keep free tests over the summer - they are due to end at the end of June - or to hold stocks back for the winter, he added. Discussions are still going on with the UK government to see if further purchases of LTF tests will happen on a UK-wide basis, he said.

BBC to move CBBC and BBC Four online,"The Beaker Girls was broadcast on CBBC last year The BBC has announced that it plans to stop airing CBBC and BBC Four as traditional broadcast channels. Director-general Tim Davie announced the content of these networks will continue to be produced and made available for online platforms. This means they would only be available on BBC iPlayer, with Radio 4 Extra moving to BBC Sounds, rather than via their traditional broadcast outlets. He added that the corporation's two news channels will be merged into one. Tim Davie said: ""We are moving decisively to a largely on-demand world"" The corporation currently has two different news networks for UK and World audiences, and the changes are part of cost-saving measures, which the BBC said are part of a plan to create a ""modern, digital-led and streamlined organisation"". The changes announced on Thursday would mean cuts of Â£200m a year and the reorganisation of services which prioritise digital platforms. But CBBC, BBC Four will stay on linear TV and Radio 4 Extra will stay on the radio airwaves for at least three years. Mr Davie also announced changes to local radio and regional news, which will see TV news programmes in Oxford and Cambridge merged with the BBC's Southampton and Norwich operations. BBC plans to axe local TV news bulletin BBC One regional programme We Are England will also end after its second series later this year. In January, the latest licence fee settlement was announced which will keep it at Â£159 a year for two years and then rise in line with inflation. Overall, the plans could mean up to 1,000 job losses in the publicly-funded part of the corporation over the next few years. Mr Davie said the BBC would consult with trade unions on the proposals. In a statement, he said the BBC must ""evolve faster and embrace the huge shifts in the market around us"". ""This is our moment to build a digital-first BBC,"" he said. ""Something genuinely new, a Reithian organisation for the digital age, a positive force for the UK and the world. ""Independent, impartial, constantly innovating and serving all. A fresh, new, global digital media organisation which has never been seen before."" The director-general told staff that too many BBC resources are currently focused on broadcast output rather than online, adding: ""We are moving decisively to a largely on-demand world."" The newly merged news channel will mean a single, 24-hour broadcast, simply called BBC News, serving UK and international audiences and offering greater amounts of shared content. Plans to stop scheduling separate content for Radio 4 Long Wave Additional online news services for Sunderland, Bradford, Wolverhampton and Peterborough, creating 100 new job posts Alternative funding for some performance groups such as the BBC's orchestras The end of bespoke television operations in Oxford and Cambridge, which will merge with the wider regional 18:30 news programmes Requesting Ofcom to remove regulatory restrictions on iPlayer to expand boxsets and archive content - with an ambition to reach 75% of BBC viewers through iPlayer each week Shifting a number of World Service languages to being digital only Reviewing commercial options for audio production, which could mean some podcasts are produced by the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios This announcement amounts to an ambitious, even radical, acceleration of the BBC's pivot to digital services. It is an attempt to ward off two threats: the first, financial; the second, technological. Financially, the two-year freeze in the licence fee - amid a cost-of-living crisis - forces the BBC to find further savings. Technologically, future licence fee payers are primarily digital creatures. Yet the BBC is still mostly consumed through TVs and radios, and spends most of its money on services that reach people through those traditional means. There will be a big impact on what shows people watch and listen to. Some of that is positive: new dramas, TV formats and podcasts that are widely enjoyed. But some is negative: shows treasured by people who have paid their licence fee for years will go. Which shows remains unclear, though the recent licence fee freeze does give the BBC some cover for those hard choices. Earlier on Thursday, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries issued the BBC with a legal direction ordering it to ""promote equality of opportunity"" for people from working-class backgrounds. The stipulation came as part of the mid-term review into the corporation's royal charter and includes a target for 25% of staff to be from low socio-economic backgrounds. The BBC said this direction affirms targets the corporation has already set itself. The BBC has also been asked to ensure 50% of radio and 60% of TV production spend is outside London by the end of 2027. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said the BBC's funding model is ""completely outdated"" The corporation must also deliver 1,000 apprenticeships per year by 2025 and ensure that 30% of those are from low socio-economic groups. In a statement, the BBC's chairman, Richard Sharp, said: ""The mid-term review is built into our Charter. We welcome it and we will engage fully and constructively. We look forward to working with government and Ofcom."" Ms Dorries has previously said she wants to find a new funding model for the BBC before the current licence fee deal expires in 2027, as she says it is ""completely outdated"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said on Thursday: ""The prime minister is firmly of the view that the BBC is a world-class broadcaster, but like other broadcasters one that needs to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape.""

"People gambling to pay energy bills - union leaderAll UK households are to get an energy bill discount of Â£400, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announces.Wales politics","This video can not be played Cost of living: 'Even Boris (Johnson's) friends will get Â£400 - do they need it?' People are gambling to try to pay off soaring gas and electric bills, a trade union leader has warned on the day extra help with charges was unveiled. All UK households will get anenergy bill discount of Â£400this autumn, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced. Earlier, the Wales TUC's Shavanah Taj said pensioners were ""being forced to return to work"" to make ends meet. She said teaching staff were working extra shifts in shops and hospitality to cope with the cost of living crisis. How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Live page: Millions to get support with energy bills Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year One woman from Wrexham said she had been left with only Â£12.36 to last her until 18 June, forcing her to skip meals. Carole Anne Wilson, 57, who lives alone, was forced to retire in 2019 after being diagnosed with a series of illnesses and receives Universal Credit. Asked about Mr Sunak's measures, she said: ""There's just not enough being done... there's no where for me to turn."" After mounting pressure on UK ministers to do more to help people with the cost of living, Mr Sunak told MPs the poorest households would get a one-off payment of Â£650. There will also be a Â£300 one-off payment for 8 million pensioner households. Homes not connected to the gas grid - thought to be about 19% of homes in Wales - will receive Â£400, Mr Sunak said. The Â£15bn package of new measures will be partly funded through a 25% windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits which have soared in recent months. ""We have a collective responsibility to help those who are paying the highest price for the high inflation we face,"" the chancellor said. ""That is why I'm targeting this significant support to millions of the most vulnerable people in our society."" This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says eight million households will get Â£1,200 in support, when combining measures announced on Thursday and before. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the measures ""barely scratch the surface"". Mr Sunak's statement came hours after Wales TUC general secretary Ms Taj addressed an inquiry into the cost of living by the Senedd's economy committee. She said while people on the very lowest incomes were being hit hardest by price rises, she was also hearing examples of how public sector workers were ""very much now being squeezed"". ""We've heard over the last couple of days [about] people who work even, for example, in schools, teaching staff, teaching assistants, taking on additional jobs in the evening, working extra hours in the hospitality sector, taking on additional shifts in retail as well in big supermarkets and so forth as well,"" she said Shavanah Taj says she is hearing worrying stories every day about the impact of rising prices Ms Taj said she worried about rising debt levels. ""Over the last couple of days, we've actually been hearing from people who were saying that they are dealing with personal cases from [trade union] members who've begun gambling as a means to try and pay off a gas or electric bill."" Pensioners, she said, were ""being forced to return to work actually, because their pensions are now not worth what it was that they thought it was going to be because of the cost of living crisis"". The Treasury said the Welsh government would receive an extra Â£25m of funding to use as it decides as a result of other measures in the chancellor's package that are for England only. Earlier this week, UK energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing it to Â£2,800 a year. Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April. The prices of food, fuel and other goods have also surged, pushing inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to a 40-year high of 9%. Ms Wilson said she has been struggling to cope with soaring food costs, relying on her adult daughter to help her out. ""I was feeding myself (in) January, February, March, and then since March my daughter's providing me with three meals a week,"" she said. ""I don't have breakfast, I don't have lunch. It's gone from being able to just about support myself with what I have left, to basically having nothing."" She added that the UK government did not understand the cost of living crisis as ""they don't feel the pinch because they've got the money"". Reacting to the chancellor's statement, Mr Drakeford complained that the UK government had ""finally acted on calls for a windfall tax"" after ""defending the huge profits of oil and gas companies for so long"". ""This has taken months - months where people across the country have been worried about the rising cost of living and making ends meet,"" he said, onTwitter,external. ""Whilst this U-turn and increased support for those on lower incomes is welcome, the measures announced today barely scratch the surface. ""We will continue to do all we can to protect people in Wales from the cost of living crisis, and to push the UK government to do more."" Disability Wales' worker Kat Watkins said her bill had doubled since April from Â£67 a month to Â£139 Kat Watkins has a brittle bone condition and uses an electric wheelchair and other equipment to maintain her quality of life. The Disability Wales' worker, said her bill had doubled since April from Â£67 a month to Â£139. ""Electricity basically means I can live my life, because without it I can't move around because my electric wheelchair wouldn't charge, I wouldn't be able to breathe at night because I wouldn't have my ventilator to keep me alive,"" she said. ""I have a personal assistant and they live with me. If I chose not to heat my house for myself that's fine, but because I have people with me . I need to keep my house warm for them too, so gas is also important."" Rob James is offering cut price meals for people struggling to afford food The Ivor Hael Hotel in Tonypandy initially offered free meals to the homeless and vulnerable at Christmas time, but will start providing meals at low cost for people in the community who cannot afford to eat, with pub ""classics"" offered for 50 to 80p. Those eligible will get a voucher and then be able to pick up their food which is prepared by staff at the pub. Rob James, the manager, said the staff noticed a drop in some of their regular customers who could not afford to eat out. ""The staff are there, the gas is on, the electrics are on, why not try to help people in need and people who are struggling"", he said. ""So we've come up with the idea of why not try and get meals into these people's bellies, because we hear stories of people missing meals.""

"LiveLiveShelling in Kharkiv kills eight including babyEight people, including a five-month-old baby, die and 17 are wounded in attacks on Ukraine's second city.Europe","Ukrainian troops could withdraw from their final pockets of resistance in the eastern Luhansk region, an official there says Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian forces in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk as it tries to capture the Donbas region Civilians in Severodonetsk ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" said governor Serhiy Haidai Earlier Ukrainian officials said Russian-backed forces had taken control of the city of Lyman in the eastern Donetsk region The Pentagon says it is ""mindful"" of Ukrainian requests for long-range weapons, something Russian state TV called a red line The Moscow-backed branch of Ukraine's Orthodox Church severs ties with Russia, saying its leaders have failed to condemn the war We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine war for now, but will be resuming on Saturday. Thanks for joining us. Our editors today were Thom Poole, Chris Giles and James Clarke. Our writers were James FitzGerald, Emily McGarvey, Robert Greenall, Jeremy Gahagan, Leo Sands and Yaroslav Lukov. You can read more of one of our main stories today - the possible withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk -here. If you're just joining us, or need a quick recap, here's the latest with what's been happening in Ukraine on Friday: Russia captures Lyman  Luhansk  Long-range weapons  Church schism This video can not be played 'Switch off the TV': Former Russian-state TV journalist's plea to Russia A journalist who quit her job at Russian state-controlled TV channel back in March over the invasion of Ukraine has told Russian audiences to switch off their television sets. ""Just don't listen, find other sources of information,"" Zhanna Agalakova said in an interview with BBC Newsnight. ""It blows my mind how they do it,"" she added. ""How they brainwash their population"" If you're in the UK you can watch the full interview tonight (Friday 27 May) on BBC Two at 22:30 BST. Some more now on Ukraine's request that the US start supplying it with powerful long-range weapon systems to enhance its military capabilities against Russia. On Friday a Pentagon spokesperson announced that ""decisions...haven't been made yet"" but the US is ""mindful"" of the request. The comment comes after CNN published a report that the US was preparing to send Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine. In the past Washington officials had denied the request fearing such long-range weapons could be used to attack targets inside Russia and end up widening and prolonging the conflict. A presenter on Russian state TV responded to the report by claiming the US would be crossing a red line and deliberately provoking Russia if it supplied Ukraine with the weapons. The evacuees left the city in an armoured vehicle Ukraine's police have taken to safety 31 residents - including 13 children - of Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk, in what the top regional official describes as one of the most ""difficult evacuations"" in recent days. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai says the officers were initially sent to evacuate seven people, who had previously agreed to leave but - after ""a few hours of persuasion"" - ended up picking up 31 residents. Haidai also says that one vehicle that delivered humanitarian aid to Lysychansk was damaged because of the fighting in the area. Russian forces have been slowly advancing on the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Local officials say two-thirds of Severodonetsk is now surrounded. Ukraine is hugely significant for the Russian Orthodox Church, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has declared its ""full autonomy and independence"" from the under Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), condemning the stance Russian religious leaders have taken on the war in Ukraine. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,"" the UOC-MP said in a statement after a council meeting in Kyiv, referring to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Kirill has openly voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine launched on 24 February. It is the second schism in Ukraine in recent years, with part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church breaking away from Moscow in 2019. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was then granted a degree of independence, or the tomos, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Talks on the unification of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between the UOC-MP and the OCU have so far brought no breakthrough. Ukraine is hugely significant for the ROC, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there.  Russian forces will not capture Luhansk in the coming days but Ukraine may have to evacuate some of its forces there for their own protection, the region's governor has saidon Telegram,external. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat,"" Serhiy Haidai wrote. In an evening military report he also described how dangerous everyday life was in the Ukrainian-controlled areas of Luhansk. Remaining civilians ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" he said. Haidai added that Russian forces have been continuing to target the city of Severodonetsk, where fighting has broken out on the outskirts of the city. Earlier we reported that the US is preparing to offer Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine, according to reports in US media. Last Saturday Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his request for Western and Nato countries to supply the weaponry. ""I can honestly say our expectations are very high and we have been waiting a long time ... and I hope for a positive response that will allow us to acquire MLRS weapons,"" he said during a press conference in Kyiv. Thanks to this system, ""Ukraine will be able to take steps to liberate its country,"" he added. The powerful M270 system can launch rockets further than any weapons Ukraine currently possesses. What weapons has the US given to Ukraine? Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Fire crews deal with a fire after shelling at Bakhmut in the Donbas region There is no doubt Ukraine is suffering setbacks in eastern Ukraine. The assessments from President Zelensky sound increasingly bleak. He says Russia is reducing cities to ashes. Earlier this week he said between 50 and 100 Ukrainians were losing their lives every day in the Donbas. Ukraine is certainly outnumbered and outgunned â with relentless Russian artillery bombardments being used to brutal effect over a much smaller area than during the first phase of the war. One Ukrainian official estimated that in some areas of Donbas their forces are outnumbered seven to one. Today UK PM Boris Johnson acknowledged that Russia was making slow but palpable progress in the region. He called for more military support â including providing Ukraine with long range rocket launchers â which the US is now considering too. There has been a lag between some Western promises of weapons and the time it takes to deliver them and to train Ukrainian forces. They could make a difference. But Russia still has much larger stockpiles of artillery ammunition. A senior official of one Nato country said it was âcriminalâ that the West had more limited stocks. Ukraine and Belarus last met in a qualifying game for Euro 2016 - Ukraine won 3-1 in Lviv Teams from Ukraine and Belarus will be kept apart in international football tournaments and European club competitions until further notice, governing body Uefa says. Uefa suspended Russia - and Russian clubs - from its tournaments
following the invasion of Ukraine, but has allowed Belarus to continue competing
despite that country's support of the invasion. Belarus have already been ordered to play home matches behind closed doors on
neutral territory, and now Uefa says it will not permit any meetings between
teams from Belarus and Ukraine to ensure the safety and security of everyone
involved. The news comes the week beforeUkraine's footballers bid to qualify for the World Cup- they play Scotland next Wednesday in a match delayed by the war, with the winners then playing Wales four days later for a spot in the finals in Qatar. Action against sportspeople and teams from Russia and Belarus has been a bone of contention in recent months. The International Olympic Committee's executive board recommended in February that athletes and teams from the two nations should not
be allowed to take part in international competitions. But international tennis ruling bodies have saidno ranking points will be awarded at Wimbledon this yearafter championship organisers said they would exclude Russian and Belarussian players. The French Open, currently taking place, does feature stars from the two countries. More now on thisnews we brought you earlier. Shaun Pinner, 48, and another Brit, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, were captured in April while defending Ukraine's south-eastern port of Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands. In footage later shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, has lived in Ukraine since 2018. Also in April, Russia released a video of a man who it said he was called Andrew Hill and that he had surrendered to Russian troops. The man, who was seen wearing a military camouflage uniform, said he was from Plymouth, and had children and a partner. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Moscow to treat captured British fighters ""humanely and compassionately"". The Moroccan national was shown in Russian custody by state-run media in April, calling himself Sadun Brahim. He is believed to have studied in Kyiv before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war must be protected ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine: On the ground  Elsewhere  Two UK citizens and a Moroccan, who fought on the Ukrainian side in the country's eastern Donbas region, may face the death penalty, Russian-backed rebels are quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Viktor Gavrilov, an official at the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic's (DNR) prosecutor general's office,  says a criminal investigation ""has been completed"" and - taking into account that a war is going on - the accused may be given capital punishment. Gavrilov identified the two captured Brits as Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill, while the Moroccan national was named as Sadun Brahim. The DNR reportedly introduced the death penalty on the territory seized from Ukraine in 2014. In a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says the pair discussed American military support for Kyiv. Kuleba says ""heavy weapons"" are top of Ukraine's agenda and wrote that ""more are coming our way"" following the call. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said. The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause were sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine. He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with
Ukraine. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg holds up Sweden and Finland's membership applications Talks aimed at overcoming Turkey's objections to Sweden and Finland joining Nato have broken up with no sign of progress. A senior Turkish official said talks between the countries made little headway and told Reuters news agency ""it is not an easy process"". Negotiations will continue but no date has been set for them, the source added. All 30 Nato members, including Turkey, need to approve the applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western security alliance. But Turkey has challenged both after accusing the two countries of harbouring individuals linked to Kurdish terrorists, a claim denied by Sweden and Finland. Some analysts view Turkey's stance as an attempt to win concessions from other Nato members. A Ukrainian official has been giving more details about the fighting in the city of Severodonetsk. The head of the Severodonetsk district administration, Roman Vlasenko, told the BBC's World At One programme that Ukrainian forces needed more heavy weaponry to drive the Russians out of the city. He said Russian forces did not have a numerical advantage but had more heavy weapons. ""Arms are reaching the front in many areas of Luhansk and
Donetsk regions,"" Vlasenko said. ""But for the counter-offensive to be quick and effective we
need more of them."" He said Russian forces were in the suburbs and trying to take the city from three sides, but had been repulsed from central areas twice in the last three days. This video can not be played District head Roman Vlasenko says troops need more weapons or Russia will overpower them. Russia requires substantial financial resources in order to continue supporting both its economy and its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, the country's finance minister says. ""Money for a special operation"" means ""huge resources"" are needed, Anton Siluanov says at a university event. Moscow officials insist on referring to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" He adds the Russian government will be spending 8 trillion roubles (Â£95.8bn) in the form of an economic stimulus package this year. ""Huge funds. We need these resources to support the economy, support our citizens."" The Russian economy has fared poorly in the last few months afterbeing hammered by Western sanctions, with some forecasts projecting its GDP to shrink by between 8.5% and 15% this year. Up to 90% of the city has been damaged by shelling Russian forces have taken over two-thirds of the perimeter of the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the governor of Luhansk region says. But Serhiy Haidai says the city is not completely surrounded, denying reports by officials from the pro-Moscow self-declared Luhansk People's Republic that Ukrainian forces are cut off there. Severodonetsk is the most easterly major population centre in the Donbas still controlled by Ukraine. Earlier we reported that 60% of the city's housing stock is completely destroyed and up to 90% of buildings are damaged. At least 1,500 people have died there since the invasion began in February. Russia appears to have gained control of most of Lyman in Donetsk region - one of several key locations in eastern Ukraine under intense bombardment. Moscow says its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia now controls more than 90% of Luhansk and has made significant advances in Donetsk since its invasion on 24 February. See the latest maps and charts here Â© 2025 BBC.

Wales' Covid laws end as hospital mask rule axedMasks will no longer be legally required in health and social care as all rules end on Monday.Wales politics,"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford removes all remaining Covid restrictions in Wales The wearing of face masks will no longer be legally required in Welsh health and social care services from Monday. First Minister Mark Drakeford confirmed the ending of the last of Wales' Covid rules, which have been in place in some form since March 2020. Ministers said the public health situation had continued to improve over the last few weeks. Wales was the last part of the UK with Covid restrictions still in place. However most of the rules that affected people's day to day lives, such as wearing face masks in shops and on public transport and self-isolation rules,ended in March. It will no longer be a legal requirement to wear a mask in hospitals from Monday - but guidance will remain The number of people estimated to have Covid-19 in Wales has fallen for the sixth week in a row. However the Welsh government said the NHS continued to experience ""emergency and pandemic pressures"". Guidance will remain in place strongly recommending the use of face coverings in health settings to help protect the most vulnerable. Wales' Covid laws and mass testing to be axed What are the latest Covid rules for Wales? What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now? Announcing the decision in a news conference, Mr Drakeford said authorities were planning to deal with Covid like ""any other seasonal illness"" from now on. But he warned measures were in reality ""on hold"" in case of another wave - with two new variants already being monitored by health officials. ""We have learned, time and again, that this virus can behave in ways that are neither expected nor predictable,"" he said. He said that the Welsh government was ""ready to bring back testing and contact tracing"", should that be needed. Booster vaccines are already being made available for the autumn, and ministers are encouraging people to get a flu jab later this year. Early indications were that ministers would be advised to offer an annual Covid jab in future years, the first minister added, possibly only to older age groups and the most vulnerable. Broader mask rules were scrapped earlier in the year Despite the changes to rules on face masks, Helen Whyley, director of nurses union RCN Wales, asked people to continue wearing them in healthcare settings if asked. She said: ""The legal requirement may be removed, however health and social care professionals across settings are still asking people to think carefully about wearing a mask when attending appointments or visiting friends and family. In some circumstances staff may ask you to wear a mask. ""I am encouraging everyone to be respectful with these requests to help keep the people of Wales safe and health care services recover from the pandemic."" Care Forum Wales said the decision was a ""step towards the normality everyone wants"" but admitted there would be a mixture of emotions. ""It's impossible to estimate the level of trauma people have gone through in the sector,"" chief executive Mary Wimbury toldRadio Wales Breakfast. ""It's going to have to be risk assessed for each sector. ""Sometimes you're going into people's homes where there is a lot of people in and out throughout the day, not wearing masks, and it's going to be great for staff not to have to [wear them] throughout the summer. ""Equally there is going to be vulnerable people you are still visiting and they will want you to wear masks. ""We understand why the restrictions have continued, but it is all about balance."" Newport's Lucy Taylor said she remained cautious and still wore her mask at work Lucy Taylor, from Newport, has cystic fibrosis and shielded during the pandemic. The 29-year-old said it had taken her a long time to be able to venture out and she continued to wear her mask at work. She said: ""It's better for me to live normally again. ""I think if I don't do that I'll just go back into my shell and I'm going to be so scared of going out, that I'm not going to want to go out."" Alex Osbourne has been shielding for the past two years due to her MS Alex Osbourne, from Caerphilly, works for the charity Disability Wales and has been shielding since the start of the pandemic due to her multiple sclerosis (MS). ""I'm quite anxious about this,"" she said, of the final rule being dropped. ""Masks made me feel a bit safer. I have to go to hospital quite a lot so the idea that they won't be worn there anymore is really stressful. ""I understand people don't want to wear them anymore, but it's very stressful for people like me with no immune system who don't have that same confidence as everyone else to start mixing again."" There were an estimated 52,900 people with the virus, according to the weekly swab survey of thousands of households in Wales by the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The ONS said this was one in 55 people - or 1.74% of the population, in the week ending 21 May,  a reduction for a sixth successive week. Daily estimates have infections highest in those in their early 40s and lowest in those over 80. Latest hospital figures in Wales showed on Thursday there were only 25 acute patients with Covid who were being actively treated for the virus. According to Digital Health and Care Wales figures, 85% of patients who tested positive for Covid were in hospital to be treated for something else. Looking at patients testing positive for Covid in all hospitals, the average in the last week has dropped by 27% to 215 - the lowest average since last August. Welsh Conservative shadow health minister Russell George said he was delighted that Covid regulations were ending. He said: ""Not only do we need to remember all those who lost lives and loved ones to lockdowns and the virus itself, but learn the lessons about how we can counter another pandemic and assess the impact of deploying harsh emergency restrictions on our population. ""But none of us will ever get the answers we deserve without the Wales-specific public inquiry everyone in the country wants apart from, not surprisingly, the Labour government who run scared of scrutiny."" Answering journalists' questions, Mr Drakeford again rejected such an investigation, saying he was ""confident"" the UK inquiry, chaired by Baroness Hallett, was ""sensitive to the needs of Wales"". A Welsh-only probe ""would not provide the answers people rightly would expect from an inquiry"", he added. Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said he shared the ""nervousness among health professionals about the removal of the need to wear masks in health and care settings, because of vulnerability of so many in the sector"". ""[The] Welsh government must make sure they monitor very carefully the extent to which people follow the guidance for people to continue wearing them in these settings,"" he added. Now that the Covid regulations are going, Mr ap Iorwerth said, ""we owe it to our hard-working staff"" to ""bring our health service on to a more sustainable footing, by reducing waiting times, speeding up the patient journey, and joining up health with social care"". Although the requirement to wear a face covering in health and social care was not part of the original legislation, coronavirus rules in Wales have existed in some form since March 2020. The law was used to impose strict curbs on people's day to day lives, including three stay-at-homelockdowns,restrictions on traveland on whatbusinesses could and could not do. In Wales masks became obligatory in all indoor public places in September 2020. Powers under public health legislation meant the rules could be imposed quickly, without always having to go to the Senedd for a vote first. Welsh ministers added and removed measures as the Covid situation changed. Initially the rules were largely the same across the UK, although this changed as England reopened in the summer of 2020, and differences developed between the different nations. Mr Drakeford's approach to sometimes ease restrictions slower than in England, and to impose restrictions during the first Omicron wave in the autumn, had been criticised by the Welsh Conservatives for being too stringent or for not moving fast enough to lift rules. But the Welsh government has said it had the public's support for how it managed the regulations. While the requirement to self-isolate has ended in law, and only LFTs and not PCR tests are now available to the general public, routine contract tracing has continued in Wales. Under the Welsh government's Covid-19 strategy, it will end in June. It ended in England on 24 February. In Friday's news conference, Mr Drakeford said Wales has a stock of 90 million lateral flow tests, and a decision is still to be made on whether to offer those stocks for free in the winter. The decision was whether to keep free tests over the summer - they are due to end at the end of June - or to hold stocks back for the winter, he added. Discussions are still going on with the UK government to see if further purchases of LTF tests will happen on a UK-wide basis, he said.

The New Jersey-born actor said in 2016 that he regretted turning down the chance to audition for Tim Burton's Batman film. ""When I did my first movie, Tim Burton was getting ready to do Batman and he was interested in me because he wanted it to be edgy and real. ""I thought, 'Batman? That's a stupid idea', even though he had just done one of my favourite movies of all time, Beetlejuice. So yes, I regret not auditioning for that'.""

Ancient DNA reveals secrets of Pompeii victims,"Remains of two individuals found in the Casa del Fabbro, or House of the Craftsman, in Pompeii, captured in a photograph taken in 1934 Researchers studying human remains from Pompeii have extracted genetic secrets from the bones of a man and a woman who were buried when the Roman city was engulfed in volcanic ash. This first ""Pompeian human genome"" is an almost complete set of ""genetic instructions"" from the victims, encoded in DNA extracted from their bones. Ancient DNA was preserved in bodies that were encased in time-hardened ash. The findings are published inthe journal Scientific Reports.,external The two people were first discovered in 1933, in what Pompeii archaeologists have called Casa del Fabbro, or The Craftsman's House. They were slumped in the corner of the dining room, almost as though they were having lunch when the eruption occurred - on 24 August 79AD.One recent study,externalsuggested that the huge cloud of ash from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius could have become lethal for the city's residents in less than 20 minutes. The two victims the researchers studied, according to anthropologist Dr Serena Viva from the University of Salento, were not attempting to escape. ""From the position [of their bodies] it seems they were not running away,"" Dr Viva toldBBC Radio 4's Inside Science.""The answer to why they weren't fleeing could lie in their health conditions."" Clues have now been revealed in this new study of their bones. Ancient child grave was Africa's earliest funeral Bodies of rich man and slave discovered in Pompeii Vast Roman settlement found by HS2 archaeologists ""It was all about the preservation of the skeletons,"" explained Prof Gabriele Scorrano, from the Lundbeck GeoGenetics centre in Copenhagen, who led the study. ""It's the first thing we looked at, and it looked promising, so we decided to give [DNA extraction] a shot."" Dr Serena Viva studies one of the Pompeii skeletons Both the remarkable preservation and the latest laboratory technology allowed the scientists to extract a great deal of information from a ""really small amount of bone powder"", as Prof Scorrano explained. ""New sequencing machines can [read] several whole genomes at the same time,"" he said. The genetic study revealed that the man's skeleton contained DNA from tuberculosis-causing bacteria, suggesting he might have had the disease prior to his death. And a fragment of bone at the base of his skull contained enough intact DNA to work out his entire genetic code. This showed that he shared ""genetic markers"" - or recognisable reference points in his genetic code - with other individuals who lived in Italy during the Roman Imperial age. But he also had a group of genes commonly found in those from the island of Sardinia, which suggested there might have been high levels of genetic diversity across the Italian Peninsula at the time. Prof Scorrano said there would be much more to learn in biological studies of Pompeii - including from ancient environmental DNA, which could reveal more about biodiversity at the time. ""Pompeii is like a Roman island, "" he added. ""We have a picture of one day in 79AD."" Dr Viva added that every human body in Pompeii was ""a treasure"". ""These people are silent witnesses to one of the most well-known historical events in the world,"" she said. ""To work with them is very emotional and a great privilege for me.""

LiveLiveFighting in Donbas at maximum intensity - minister26 minutes ago,"Ukrainian troops could withdraw from their final pockets of resistance in the eastern Luhansk region, an official there says Russia is trying to encircle Ukrainian forces in Severodonetsk and Lysychansk as it tries to capture the Donbas region Civilians in Severodonetsk ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" said governor Serhiy Haidai Earlier Ukrainian officials said Russian-backed forces had taken control of the city of Lyman in the eastern Donetsk region The Pentagon says it is ""mindful"" of Ukrainian requests for long-range weapons, something Russian state TV called a red line The Moscow-backed branch of Ukraine's Orthodox Church severs ties with Russia, saying its leaders have failed to condemn the war We're pausing our live coverage of the Ukraine war for now, but will be resuming on Saturday. Thanks for joining us. Our editors today were Thom Poole, Chris Giles and James Clarke. Our writers were James FitzGerald, Emily McGarvey, Robert Greenall, Jeremy Gahagan, Leo Sands and Yaroslav Lukov. You can read more of one of our main stories today - the possible withdrawal of Ukrainian forces from the big eastern city of Severodonetsk -here. If you're just joining us, or need a quick recap, here's the latest with what's been happening in Ukraine on Friday: Russia captures Lyman  Luhansk  Long-range weapons  Church schism This video can not be played 'Switch off the TV': Former Russian-state TV journalist's plea to Russia A journalist who quit her job at Russian state-controlled TV channel back in March over the invasion of Ukraine has told Russian audiences to switch off their television sets. ""Just don't listen, find other sources of information,"" Zhanna Agalakova said in an interview with BBC Newsnight. ""It blows my mind how they do it,"" she added. ""How they brainwash their population"" If you're in the UK you can watch the full interview tonight (Friday 27 May) on BBC Two at 22:30 BST. Some more now on Ukraine's request that the US start supplying it with powerful long-range weapon systems to enhance its military capabilities against Russia. On Friday a Pentagon spokesperson announced that ""decisions...haven't been made yet"" but the US is ""mindful"" of the request. The comment comes after CNN published a report that the US was preparing to send Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine. In the past Washington officials had denied the request fearing such long-range weapons could be used to attack targets inside Russia and end up widening and prolonging the conflict. A presenter on Russian state TV responded to the report by claiming the US would be crossing a red line and deliberately provoking Russia if it supplied Ukraine with the weapons. The evacuees left the city in an armoured vehicle Ukraine's police have taken to safety 31 residents - including 13 children - of Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk, in what the top regional official describes as one of the most ""difficult evacuations"" in recent days. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai says the officers were initially sent to evacuate seven people, who had previously agreed to leave but - after ""a few hours of persuasion"" - ended up picking up 31 residents. Haidai also says that one vehicle that delivered humanitarian aid to Lysychansk was damaged because of the fighting in the area. Russian forces have been slowly advancing on the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Local officials say two-thirds of Severodonetsk is now surrounded. Ukraine is hugely significant for the Russian Orthodox Church, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has declared its ""full autonomy and independence"" from the under Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), condemning the stance Russian religious leaders have taken on the war in Ukraine. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,"" the UOC-MP said in a statement after a council meeting in Kyiv, referring to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Kirill has openly voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine launched on 24 February. It is the second schism in Ukraine in recent years, with part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church breaking away from Moscow in 2019. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was then granted a degree of independence, or the tomos, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Talks on the unification of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between the UOC-MP and the OCU have so far brought no breakthrough. Ukraine is hugely significant for the ROC, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there.  Russian forces will not capture Luhansk in the coming days but Ukraine may have to evacuate some of its forces there for their own protection, the region's governor has saidon Telegram,external. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat,"" Serhiy Haidai wrote. In an evening military report he also described how dangerous everyday life was in the Ukrainian-controlled areas of Luhansk. Remaining civilians ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" he said. Haidai added that Russian forces have been continuing to target the city of Severodonetsk, where fighting has broken out on the outskirts of the city. Earlier we reported that the US is preparing to offer Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine, according to reports in US media. Last Saturday Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his request for Western and Nato countries to supply the weaponry. ""I can honestly say our expectations are very high and we have been waiting a long time ... and I hope for a positive response that will allow us to acquire MLRS weapons,"" he said during a press conference in Kyiv. Thanks to this system, ""Ukraine will be able to take steps to liberate its country,"" he added. The powerful M270 system can launch rockets further than any weapons Ukraine currently possesses. What weapons has the US given to Ukraine? Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Fire crews deal with a fire after shelling at Bakhmut in the Donbas region There is no doubt Ukraine is suffering setbacks in eastern Ukraine. The assessments from President Zelensky sound increasingly bleak. He says Russia is reducing cities to ashes. Earlier this week he said between 50 and 100 Ukrainians were losing their lives every day in the Donbas. Ukraine is certainly outnumbered and outgunned â with relentless Russian artillery bombardments being used to brutal effect over a much smaller area than during the first phase of the war. One Ukrainian official estimated that in some areas of Donbas their forces are outnumbered seven to one. Today UK PM Boris Johnson acknowledged that Russia was making slow but palpable progress in the region. He called for more military support â including providing Ukraine with long range rocket launchers â which the US is now considering too. There has been a lag between some Western promises of weapons and the time it takes to deliver them and to train Ukrainian forces. They could make a difference. But Russia still has much larger stockpiles of artillery ammunition. A senior official of one Nato country said it was âcriminalâ that the West had more limited stocks. Ukraine and Belarus last met in a qualifying game for Euro 2016 - Ukraine won 3-1 in Lviv Teams from Ukraine and Belarus will be kept apart in international football tournaments and European club competitions until further notice, governing body Uefa says. Uefa suspended Russia - and Russian clubs - from its tournaments
following the invasion of Ukraine, but has allowed Belarus to continue competing
despite that country's support of the invasion. Belarus have already been ordered to play home matches behind closed doors on
neutral territory, and now Uefa says it will not permit any meetings between
teams from Belarus and Ukraine to ensure the safety and security of everyone
involved. The news comes the week beforeUkraine's footballers bid to qualify for the World Cup- they play Scotland next Wednesday in a match delayed by the war, with the winners then playing Wales four days later for a spot in the finals in Qatar. Action against sportspeople and teams from Russia and Belarus has been a bone of contention in recent months. The International Olympic Committee's executive board recommended in February that athletes and teams from the two nations should not
be allowed to take part in international competitions. But international tennis ruling bodies have saidno ranking points will be awarded at Wimbledon this yearafter championship organisers said they would exclude Russian and Belarussian players. The French Open, currently taking place, does feature stars from the two countries. More now on thisnews we brought you earlier. Shaun Pinner, 48, and another Brit, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, were captured in April while defending Ukraine's south-eastern port of Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands. In footage later shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, has lived in Ukraine since 2018. Also in April, Russia released a video of a man who it said he was called Andrew Hill and that he had surrendered to Russian troops. The man, who was seen wearing a military camouflage uniform, said he was from Plymouth, and had children and a partner. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Moscow to treat captured British fighters ""humanely and compassionately"". The Moroccan national was shown in Russian custody by state-run media in April, calling himself Sadun Brahim. He is believed to have studied in Kyiv before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war must be protected ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine: On the ground  Elsewhere  Two UK citizens and a Moroccan, who fought on the Ukrainian side in the country's eastern Donbas region, may face the death penalty, Russian-backed rebels are quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Viktor Gavrilov, an official at the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic's (DNR) prosecutor general's office,  says a criminal investigation ""has been completed"" and - taking into account that a war is going on - the accused may be given capital punishment. Gavrilov identified the two captured Brits as Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill, while the Moroccan national was named as Sadun Brahim. The DNR reportedly introduced the death penalty on the territory seized from Ukraine in 2014. In a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says the pair discussed American military support for Kyiv. Kuleba says ""heavy weapons"" are top of Ukraine's agenda and wrote that ""more are coming our way"" following the call. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said. The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause were sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine. He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with
Ukraine. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg holds up Sweden and Finland's membership applications Talks aimed at overcoming Turkey's objections to Sweden and Finland joining Nato have broken up with no sign of progress. A senior Turkish official said talks between the countries made little headway and told Reuters news agency ""it is not an easy process"". Negotiations will continue but no date has been set for them, the source added. All 30 Nato members, including Turkey, need to approve the applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western security alliance. But Turkey has challenged both after accusing the two countries of harbouring individuals linked to Kurdish terrorists, a claim denied by Sweden and Finland. Some analysts view Turkey's stance as an attempt to win concessions from other Nato members. A Ukrainian official has been giving more details about the fighting in the city of Severodonetsk. The head of the Severodonetsk district administration, Roman Vlasenko, told the BBC's World At One programme that Ukrainian forces needed more heavy weaponry to drive the Russians out of the city. He said Russian forces did not have a numerical advantage but had more heavy weapons. ""Arms are reaching the front in many areas of Luhansk and
Donetsk regions,"" Vlasenko said. ""But for the counter-offensive to be quick and effective we
need more of them."" He said Russian forces were in the suburbs and trying to take the city from three sides, but had been repulsed from central areas twice in the last three days. This video can not be played District head Roman Vlasenko says troops need more weapons or Russia will overpower them. Russia requires substantial financial resources in order to continue supporting both its economy and its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, the country's finance minister says. ""Money for a special operation"" means ""huge resources"" are needed, Anton Siluanov says at a university event. Moscow officials insist on referring to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" He adds the Russian government will be spending 8 trillion roubles (Â£95.8bn) in the form of an economic stimulus package this year. ""Huge funds. We need these resources to support the economy, support our citizens."" The Russian economy has fared poorly in the last few months afterbeing hammered by Western sanctions, with some forecasts projecting its GDP to shrink by between 8.5% and 15% this year. Up to 90% of the city has been damaged by shelling Russian forces have taken over two-thirds of the perimeter of the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the governor of Luhansk region says. But Serhiy Haidai says the city is not completely surrounded, denying reports by officials from the pro-Moscow self-declared Luhansk People's Republic that Ukrainian forces are cut off there. Severodonetsk is the most easterly major population centre in the Donbas still controlled by Ukraine. Earlier we reported that 60% of the city's housing stock is completely destroyed and up to 90% of buildings are damaged. At least 1,500 people have died there since the invasion began in February. Russia appears to have gained control of most of Lyman in Donetsk region - one of several key locations in eastern Ukraine under intense bombardment. Moscow says its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia now controls more than 90% of Luhansk and has made significant advances in Donetsk since its invasion on 24 February. See the latest maps and charts here Â© 2025 BBC.

Police accused of delay in storming Texas school,"People have been laying flowers near the school campus in Uvalde as tributes Police were urged to charge into a deadly school shooting in the US state of Texas by onlookers, witnesses say, with one suggesting he considered doing so himself as he became frustrated. Officials say gunman Salvador Ramos, 18, was inside the school in Uvalde for up to an hour before he was killed. Nineteen children and two adults died, while 17 others were injured. Eyewitness Juan Carranza told the Associated Press that women shouted at officers to ""go in there"". But the 24-year-old, who witnessed the scene at the Robb Elementary School from outside his house, said police did not enter. Javier Cazares, whose daughter was killed in the attack, told the news agency he suggested running in with other onlookers because the police ""weren't doing anything"". Authorities said the gunman locked himself in a classroom which officers then struggled to gain access to. Steven McCraw, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, told a news conference on Wednesday that the gunman was on site for between 40 minutes and an hour before law enforcement were able to ""contain"" him. US Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz, meanwhile, told CNN that dozens of officers responded to the shooting and ""didn't hesitate"". ""They entered that classroom and they took care of the situation as quickly as they possibly could,"" he said. Texas victims: 'The sweetest little boy I've ever known' America's bitter debate that never goes away It has also emerged that the attacker sent messages on social media about the shooting minutes before it happened. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Ramos had promised to shoot his grandmother in private messages sent 30 minutes before the attack. A later message declared he had done so, and in a final one sent 15 minutes before the shooting, he announced he would target an elementary school. According to CNN, the private messages were sent to a 15-year-old girl in Germany who Ramos had met online. In a statement, Meta, Facebook's parent company, said the ""private one-to-one text messages"" were ""discovered after the terrible tragedy occurred"". It added that it was ""closely co-operating"" with investigators. This video can not be played Watch: Texas governor heckled by rival over gun laws Tuesday's events in Uvalde - an unassuming town some 80 miles (129km) from San Antonio - brought the discussion around gun control once again to the fore, even as members of the small community sought to make sense of the tragedy. Many there expressed divided attitudes about guns. ""As a kid, I remember my uncles teaching me and training me on how to hold a gun,"" Carlos Velasquez, a local resident, told the BBC. ""The juxtaposition of good safety with what just happened is so nuanced. It's not just a clean-cut thought - it's a really sticky situation and sticky conversation to have now,"" he said. Others, however, were shocked that Ramos was able to carry out an attack with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle. ""This kid was just 18. You have to be 21 to drink. How?"" asked Sandra Parra, who lives down the street from the school. ""I hope there are changes,"" she said, referring to gun laws in Texas. ""I don't have a gun myself, but if I did, it would be for protection,"" she added. It is legal to buy a gun at 18 in Texas, and according to US media, the attacker bought his soon after his birthday. Described as a loner from a ""fraught home life"", the gunman shot his grandmother before fleeing the scene in a battered truck carrying firearms and copious ammunition. He then drove erratically across town and crashed his car into a ditch near Robb Elementary School. An officer engaged with him, but failed to stop him from entering the school. He then proceeded to shoot 19 children and two teachers dead, before officers converged on the classroom and a border patrol officer who had responded while nearby killed him, according to Mr Abbott. Mr Abbott said there had been no history to suggest the gunman could be a danger apart from the social media messages sent before the killings. Speaking on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said the idea that a teenager was able to legally purchase weapons that were ""designed and marketed to kill, is just wrong"". ""I'm just sick and tired of what's going on and what continues to go on,"" he said, calling for ""action"" on gun control. His comments followed an incident at Mr Abbott's news conference, where the governor's Democratic challenger for office, Beto O'Rourke, heckled the Republican for not doing enough on gun control. In response, Mr Abbott accused Mr O'Rourke of grandstanding. According to the Texas Politics Project, only 43% of Texans support stricter gun laws. Nationally, the figure is 53% in support, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center poll. As more details of the mass shooting emerged, the Uvalde community grieved. The children killed were aged between seven and 10 years old. Teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia also died in the attack. More than a dozen people were also wounded. Vigils took place for the victims of the shooting, while people have been laying flowers near the school campus as tributes. ""The normality is not here anymore,"" Ms Parra said. ""Uvalde will be known for its mass shooting,"" said Mr Velazquez. ""That's really unfortunate.""

Sunak confirms U-turn on windfall tax,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says eight million households will get Â£1,200 in support, when combining measures announced on Thursday and before The government has U-turned on its opposition to a windfall tax on oil and gas firms, announcing it will introduce a levy to help tackle rising bills. Ministers had rejected the idea - put forward by opposition parties - that would see a one-off charge imposed on the company's record profits. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said his levy would ""tax extraordinary profits fairly and incentivise investments"". Labour's Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had ""finally come to his senses"". The chancellor said new tax would raise Â£5bn over the course of the next year, allowing the government to ""help families with the cost of living"", while avoiding ""having to increase our debt burden further"". He added: ""There is nothing noble in burdening future generations with ever more debt today because politicians of the day were too weak to make the tough decisions."" LIVE: Sunak unveils more cost of living help How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year The new tax will help funda Â£15bn package from the government, which includes a Â£650 one-off payment for eight million low income households, and a change to the Â£200 loan scheme for energy bills for all homes in the autumn - increasing it to Â£400 without the need to pay it back. But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said the measures were ""too little, too late"". The plans received a mixed reaction from the Conservative backbenchers, with some calling it ""tripe"" and others saying it did not go far enough. The government faced accusations that it had timed the announcement to distract fromthe release of the Sue Gray reportinto lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street during the pandemic. But the claims were denied by No 10. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"". Households across the country have faced soaring costs in recent months as the prices of food, fuel and energy have all rocketed, with inflation hitting a 40-year high. The government has been under growing pressure to act, especially afterenergy regulator Ofgem warned of an additional rise to bills of Â£800 in the autumn. The Liberal Democrats first put forward the idea of a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies - which have peaked as the economy restarted after the pandemic - in November, with Labour outlining its own version in January. The SNP has also called for such a measure. The parties said the money raised could go towards helping those households hardest hit by the cost of living increases. Initially, the idea was rejected by ministers, including Boris Johnson, who warned it could ""deter"" investment. But both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak subsequently softened their stance, and now the policy U-turn has been confirmed. Making a statement in the Commons, the chancellor said the inflation faced by the UK was causing ""acute distress for the people of this country"" and he knew people were worried. But, Mr Sunak added: ""This government will never stop trying to help people, to fix problems where we can, to do what is right - as we did during the pandemic."" He confirmed the government would introduce a ""temporary targeted energy profits levy"" charged at a rate of 25% on profits of oil and gas companies to fund ""significant support for the British people"". However, he said his ""sensible middle ground"" plan included a new investment allowance, so ""for every pound a company invests they will get back 90% in tax relief - the more the company invests the less tax they will pay"". Mr Sunak said: ""We should not be ideological about this, we should be pragmatic. ""It is possible to both tax extraordinary profits fairly and incentivise investments."" The chancellor said the tax would then be removed when energy prices returned to normal levels. Shadow chancellor Ms Reeves said the government had been ""dragged kicking and screaming"" to its new policy position. She added: ""The chancellor has finally come to his senses, U-turned, and adopted Labour's plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits to lower bills."" But Ms Reeves claimed the government ""still have no long term plan to grow our economy and pull us out of the mess they've got us into"". What does this change of tack signal? The cabinet was split on whether to bring in a windfall tax Analysis by David Wallace Lockhart, BBC political correspondent Ministers have been facing calls to do more to help with the cost of living for quite some time. So why today? As recently as the weekend, Downing Street sources were indicating there would be no imminent announcement on windfall taxes. And it was only a couple of weekends ago Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng called it a ""bad idea"". So why the change of heart? Well, ministers have been clear for some time that more help is on the way. And they did get a clearer idea of future energy prices this week. But - to be more cynical - the government had a particularly uncomfortable day on Wednesday with the publication of the Sue Gray report into Downing Street gatherings. Boris Johnson has made it clear that he's desperate to stop talking about parties. An announcement of billions of pounds of assistance for households certainly helps to move the agenda on. Downing Street deny that the timing of this has anything to do with Partygate. But plenty of opposition MPs won't buy that argument. The package of measures announced by Mr Sunak was attacked by many of his opponents for not going far enough. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey criticised the government for failing to cut taxes for workers, pointing to the new health and social care levy introduced in April amid the cost of living crisis. He tweeted: ""Sunak's like a thief who steals your car and then wants you to be grateful when he returns the steering wheel."" The SNP's Kirsty Blackman said the government had ""listened to a certain extent"", but had ""failed"" on a number of measures, especially her party's call to uprate benefits in line with inflation. She told the BBC the one-off payment was ""kicking the can down the road"" and those hit hardest could face more difficulties in the future. When it came to Mr Sunak's own benches, Conservatives appeared split on both the policies and how to fund them. Richard Drax accused the chancellor of ""throwing red meat to the socialists by raising taxes on businesses"", adding a windfall tax was ""not the Conservative way"" of doing things. Another backbench Tory, Craig Mackinlay, said he was ""appalled that a Conservative chancellor could come up with this tripe"", calling the tax ""outrageous"" and ""inherently wrong"". Former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, however, called the chancellor's statement ""a good start and welcome"", but added: ""More needs to be done.

Bills help will have minimal inflation impact - Sunak,"This video can not be played BBC Political Editor Chris Mason asks the chancellor why he uses âenergy profits levy"" phrase - and not say windfall tax. Rishi Sunak says new measures to ease the cost of living crisis will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation. The chancellor told the BBC he had struck the ""right balance"" between supporting people and pushing prices ""excessively"" higher. Earlier, Mr SunakannouncedÂ£15bn to reduce energy bills, partly funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas firms. He denied the announcement was rushed out to divert attention from areportinto rule-breaking parties in No 10. He said he had chosen to set out the measures this week because Ofgem, the energy regulator,had released their forecastof expected energy price rises. ""That meant we could scale and size our policies effectively,"" he said. How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Sunak confirms U-turn on windfall tax Chris Mason: What was behind Sunak's mini Budget? The chancellor's decision to impose a 25% levy on oil and gas firms came after weeks of government ministers repeatedly rejecting the idea. The windfall tax plan - put forward by Labour, the Liberal Democrats and SNP - would see a one-off charge imposed on the companies' record profits. Mr Sunak avoided calling his measure a windfall tax, instead referring to it as a ""temporary, targeted energy profits levy"". ""These are windfall profits and they will be taxed,"" he said, but added that the levy would also include incentives to encourage businesses to invest. He noted that opposition parties had made similar proposals, but said: ""I think they were blunt instruments."" ""We have designed something that will continue to incentivise and encourage investment,"" he told BBC political editor Chris Mason. Households have come under pressure in recent months as food and energy costs have risen, with inflation hitting a 40-year high. Under Mr Sunak's new measures, every household will get an energy bill discount of Â£400. Eight million households on means-tested benefits will also get a payment of Â£650 paid into their account in two lump sums. In addition to a windfall tax, the extra support will be funded by around Â£10bn of extra borrowing. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously suggested providing more support could risk an ""inflationary spiral"" as giving people more money could lead to further price rises. But Mr Sunak said he had targeted support at the most vulnerable households in order to avoid ""fuelling inflation and making the situation worse"". ""That is something that I do watch and I worry about."" This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"". Asked if he was worried about a recession Mr Sunak said he was concerned about inflationary pressures but confident about the future of the economy. Responding to his announcement in Parliament, shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had ""finally come to his senses"". But his method of partly funding support through a windfall tax was criticised by some Conservative backbenchers. Richard Drax accused the chancellor of ""throwing red meat to socialists"". And Craig Mackinlay described the tax as ""tripe"".

P&O boss 'incredibly sorry' for impact of sackings,"This video can not be played P&O boss Peter Hebblethwaite spoke to the BBC's Transport Correspondent Katy Austin The boss of P&O Ferries has said he is ""incredibly sorry"" for the impact felt by hundreds of staff who were recently sacked by the company without notice. But Peter Hebblethwaite insisted the decision was ""the route we only deemed possible"". P&O Ferries sacked almost 800 seafarers in March and replaced them with foreign agency workers paid less than the minimum wage. The move sparked outrage andled to calls for Mr Hebblethwaite to resign. At the time, P&O Ferries said the decision would ensure the future of the business. When asked how he would feel if he was sacked in the same way, Mr Hebblethwaite told the BBC it is ""not pleasant being made redundant"". ""I'm incredibly sorry, on the decision we took had a material impact on a number of our ex-employees. And I do regret that,"" he added. However, the P&O Ferries boss insisted the move was ""the route we only deemed possible for us to take"", and part of ""a difficult decision and repositioning for a better future"". P&O brings back passengers on cross-Channel route P&O Ferries hits back at new staff pay cut claim Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? When P&O Ferries previously made redundancies due to economic pressures caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the business had consulted unions before, but decided not to when it sacked hundreds more 10 weeks ago. Mr Hebblethwaite denied the decision to sack staff meant the firm was taking part in a race to the bottom on pay and standards, saying P&O needed to modernise and become competitive. He claimed it had issued the biggest redundancy package in maritime history. When pushed on how he justified ignoring the legal requirement to consult staff in advance of redundancy, and on the details of how and when the decision was made on how staff were to be sacked, the P&O Ferries boss declined to comment due to an ongoing investigation by the insolvency service. He also refused to comment on whether the flag status of P&O Ferries' ships meant the company could get round UK workers' rights. It was put to Mr Hebblethwaite that the decision had resulted in a huge reputational hit, but he said that was not what the P&O was experiencing, adding the firm had ""seen really encouraging bookings coming through"". When challenged on pay levels, and the fact that seafarers on Dover to Calais route were being paid well below the UK National Minimum Wage, he said the firm's wages were consistent with international standards, adding the crewing model was consistent with 80% of global shipping. However, he said if the law was changed in the UK, as per the government's ambitions to pay seafarers working in and out of British ports the minimum wage, the company ""will absolutely do what we are required to do by law"". The chief executive also said the firm was ""trying very hard"" to return items to former workers, but admitted some possessions were still missing after being left on the ships when sacked workers were escorted off. This was the first time Peter Hebblethwaite has taken questions from the media, on camera, since the shock dismissal of 786 seafarers. We learned a bit about his background. He trained as an accountant and worked in retail and hospitality operations before joining P&O Ferries in 2019. Mr Hebblethwaite on the one hand expressed regret over the impact on sacked workers, but on the other hand was bullish about the company's future. He confirmed some sacked workers still haven't had personal belongings returned but insisted this was a small number and efforts continued to locate missing items - although he couldn't guarantee they would all be found. He described plans to give the business a ""glorious"" future, and believes customers will return. The company expects to take delivery of new high-tech ships next year. P&O clearly wishes to move on. But the events of 17 March did not only affect workers who lost their jobs, and prompt outrage from politicians and unions. They also clearly caused reputational damage to the business. Real anger still exists among sacked workers about how they have been treated. And it seems unlikely the difficult questions will disappear, even as P&O looks to the future. Separately, Mr Hebblethwaite apologised to customers about the impact of ferries being out of service, particularly on the busy Dover-Calais crossing. P&O Ferries services were suspended after the mass sackings and several of the company's vessels failed safety inspections before being cleared to re-enter service. The reduced ferry capacity was a contributing factor in particularly long lorry queues building up on the way to Dover before Easter. Mr Hebblethwaite spoke to the BBC for an exclusive interview aboard the Pride of Kent, which was passed fit to sail at the fourth attempt. Admitting it took ""longer than they would have liked"" to get its ships back into service, the chief executive said it had been ""a difficult couple of months"". ""I want to say sorry to our customers for the delay in us getting back into service, but it was important that safety was right. We are being held to a high standard,"" he said.

The teachers who died trying to save their pupils,"Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles ""We have a wonderful year ahead of us!"" This sweet and simple line, written by fourth-grade teacher Eva Mireles at the start of the school year, is haunting now. On Thursday, the last day of school, she and fellow teacher Irma Garcia should be packing up their shared classroom at Robb Elementary in the small Texan town of Uvalde, and preparing for the summer break. Instead, their families are making funeral arrangements, after they were gunned down in a mass shooting, which also killed 19 of their young students. AS IT HAPPENED:Texas primary school shooting leaves 21 dead VICTIM PROFILES:Texas victims: 'They were sweet kids and lovable' In the days since Tuesday's attack, Mrs Garcia and Ms Mireles' bravery has been praised - they were seen trying to shelter their students from the bullets. Mrs Garcia was found by officers ""embracing children in her arms pretty much until her last breath,"" her nephew John Martinez told the New York Times. ""She sacrificed herself protecting the kids in her classroom. She was a hero,"" he wrote on a fundraising page. Just two days later her family suffered another tragedy whenMrs Garcia's husband, Joe Garcia, died of a heart attack. Mr Martinez wrote that he ""passed away due to grief"". Mrs Garcia and Ms Mireles had been a teaching team for five years, and had 40 years of experience between them. A photo taken last month shows the pair in their classroom watching over students as they work on iPads, one giggling - he probably knows the photo is being taken. ""Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia were two of the greatest teachers Uvalde, [Texas] has ever known,"" Natalie Arias, an education specialist who lives in Uvalde wrote. ""Their classroom was full of fun, growth, giggles, teamwork, and, most of all, love."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As the outpouring of grief continues, there is also anger that yet another deadly school shooting has been allowed to happen. It is legal to buy a gun at 18 in Texas, and according to US media, the attacker bought his - two AR-15 style semi-automatic rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition -  last week, the day after his birthday. America's bitter debate that never goes away Where does US gun control go from here? ""I'm furious that these shootings continue, these children are innocent, rifles should not be easily available to all,"" Eva Mireles' aunt, Lydia Martinez Delgado, said in a statement. ""This is my hometown, a small community of less than 20,000. I never imagined this would happen, especially to loved ones,"" she wrote. Ms Mireles' husband, Ruben Ruiz, is a school police officer. Two months ago he conducted an active shooter drill -which is common in US schools- at Uvalde High School. Little did he know that just weeks later, his own wife would be a victim to one. The Washington Post reports that Mr Ruiz rushed to Robb Elementary when he heard the news, and had to be held back by other officers as he desperately tried to get to his wife. At least 185 children, educators and other people have been killed in US school attacks since the 1999 Columbine High massacre,according to data by the Washington Post,external. There is even a unique memorial in Kansas for ""fallen educators"" that honours ""those who lost their lives in the line of duty."" Those words, more familiar when talking about soldiers, used here to describe murdered teachers. Now there are two more names to inscribe on the wall of remembrance. A teacher for 17 years, Ms Mireles described her love of running and hiking in a short biography posted on the school district's website. She also said she had ""a supportive, fun, and loving family"" - her husband, her college graduate daughter and ""three furry friends"". Her daughter Adalynn Ruiz wrote a heart-breaking tribute to her ""sweet mommy"" onTwitter,external. ""I'm so happy that people know your name and that beautiful face of yours and they know what a hero looks like,"" she said. ""Eva Mireles, 4th grade teacher... who selflessly jumped in front of her students to save their lives"". Ms Mireles was trained in special education, and was remembered by one parent, Audrey Garcia (no relation to Irma Garcia) for going ""above and beyond"" as a teacher. It was only a few years ago that schools in the Uvalde area started to integrate children with developmental disabilities into regular classrooms, and Ms Mireles was one of the teachers who taught them. ""She was a beautiful person & dedicated teacher. She believed in Gabby & went above & beyond to teach her"", Ms Garciawrote on Twitter,external. Mrs Garcia was a veteran teacher of 23 years - all of which were at Robb Elementary, and was the school's teacher-of-the-year in 2019. ""I am so excited to begin this new school year already!"" she wrote in her biography on the district's website. Authorities told her family that Mrs Garcia was seen by a friend in law enforcement trying to protect her students from the gunfire. ""I want her to be remembered as someone who sacrificed her life and put her life on the line for her kids,"" John Martinez, her nephew, told the Washington Post. ""They weren't just her students. Those were her kids, and she put her life on the line, she lost her life to protect them. That's the type of person she was."" Mrs Garcia was married and had four children - two boys and two girls ranging from 12 to 23 years old. Her Facebook page is an album of family memories and pride for her children. ""Thank you Jesus for my amazing husband and my babies,"" she wrote under one photo of a family fishing trip. The teacher's social media also shows her dedication to her career and students. ""Learned so many new ways to challenge my future students to be independent learners,"" she wrote in one post that showed certificates for a teaching course. Allow Twitter content?

How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you,"Eight million people are receiving the final instalment of cost of living payments totalling Â£900. Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February. However, the payments have not tackled the extent of the financial problems many people face, a group of MPs says. It is available to households who receive these benefits,external: universal credit income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance income support working tax credit child tax credit pension credit The final instalment of Â£299 follows two others last year, of Â£301 and Â£300. To qualify, people need to have claimed a benefits payment between 13 November 2023 and 12 December 2023. Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner householdsdo not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit. Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, orreport it here,external. The payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL. The 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits have the reference HMRC COLS. Cost of living payments do not affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive. Households thatreceive the winter fuel payment,external- which is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra payment of between Â£150 and Â£300 during the winter. Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits. A Â£150 payment was also made to up to six million people receiving disability benefits, between 20 June and 4 July. All cost of living payments go straight into recipients' bank accounts.

What happens if I can't afford to pay my mortgage? Payments were not enough for many people, MPs on the Commons Work and Pensions Committee said in a report published in November. It said payments were not enough for those with extra costs associated with their disabilities. Disability charity Scope says some people cannot afford to power vital equipment. There was particular concern for some larger families. The report said the payments have had an important impact, but the system was relatively unsophisticated, meaning some of those in need slipped through the net. It said that in future, the government should consider increasing benefits rather than giving ad-hoc payments.

"Ancient DNA reveals secrets of Pompeii victimsIt is an almost complete set of ""genetic instructions"" from people who died when Mount Vesuvius erupted.","Remains of two individuals found in the Casa del Fabbro, or House of the Craftsman, in Pompeii, captured in a photograph taken in 1934 Researchers studying human remains from Pompeii have extracted genetic secrets from the bones of a man and a woman who were buried when the Roman city was engulfed in volcanic ash. This first ""Pompeian human genome"" is an almost complete set of ""genetic instructions"" from the victims, encoded in DNA extracted from their bones. Ancient DNA was preserved in bodies that were encased in time-hardened ash. The findings are published inthe journal Scientific Reports.,external The two people were first discovered in 1933, in what Pompeii archaeologists have called Casa del Fabbro, or The Craftsman's House. They were slumped in the corner of the dining room, almost as though they were having lunch when the eruption occurred - on 24 August 79AD.One recent study,externalsuggested that the huge cloud of ash from the eruption of Mount Vesuvius could have become lethal for the city's residents in less than 20 minutes. The two victims the researchers studied, according to anthropologist Dr Serena Viva from the University of Salento, were not attempting to escape. ""From the position [of their bodies] it seems they were not running away,"" Dr Viva toldBBC Radio 4's Inside Science.""The answer to why they weren't fleeing could lie in their health conditions."" Clues have now been revealed in this new study of their bones. Ancient child grave was Africa's earliest funeral Bodies of rich man and slave discovered in Pompeii Vast Roman settlement found by HS2 archaeologists ""It was all about the preservation of the skeletons,"" explained Prof Gabriele Scorrano, from the Lundbeck GeoGenetics centre in Copenhagen, who led the study. ""It's the first thing we looked at, and it looked promising, so we decided to give [DNA extraction] a shot."" Dr Serena Viva studies one of the Pompeii skeletons Both the remarkable preservation and the latest laboratory technology allowed the scientists to extract a great deal of information from a ""really small amount of bone powder"", as Prof Scorrano explained. ""New sequencing machines can [read] several whole genomes at the same time,"" he said. The genetic study revealed that the man's skeleton contained DNA from tuberculosis-causing bacteria, suggesting he might have had the disease prior to his death. And a fragment of bone at the base of his skull contained enough intact DNA to work out his entire genetic code. This showed that he shared ""genetic markers"" - or recognisable reference points in his genetic code - with other individuals who lived in Italy during the Roman Imperial age. But he also had a group of genes commonly found in those from the island of Sardinia, which suggested there might have been high levels of genetic diversity across the Italian Peninsula at the time. Prof Scorrano said there would be much more to learn in biological studies of Pompeii - including from ancient environmental DNA, which could reveal more about biodiversity at the time. ""Pompeii is like a Roman island, "" he added. ""We have a picture of one day in 79AD."" Dr Viva added that every human body in Pompeii was ""a treasure"". ""These people are silent witnesses to one of the most well-known historical events in the world,"" she said. ""To work with them is very emotional and a great privilege for me.""

Energy bills set to rise by Â£800,"The typical household energy bill is set to rise by about Â£800 a year in October, the energy regulator warns. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley said the energy price cap, which limits how much providers can raise prices, is expected to increase to Â£2,800 a year, due to continued volatility in gas prices. Mr Brearley said the price rises were a ""once in a generation event not seen since the oil crisis in the 1970s"". He added the number of households in fuel poverty may double to 12 million. A household is in fuel poverty when it has to spend 10% or more of its disposable income on energy. How high could my energy bills go? Energy firms warn against extending windfall tax Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? The energy price cap already rose sharply in April to Â£1,971, meaning that homes using a typical amount of gas and electricity are now paying an extra Â£700 per year on average. Mr Brearley told the business select committee of MPs that Ofgem was only part way through reviewing prices ahead of setting the next cap in October, but added: ""We are expecting a price cap in the region of Â£2,800."" It means the typical household bill could rise by Â£800 per year. Ofgem's price cap covers England Wales and Scotland. Northern Ireland does not have a price cap, but households have also been witnessing sharp price rises. Mr Brearley said that conditions in the global gas market had ""worsened"" following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, which has led to concerns about potential supply issues. He warned that the price cap could rise beyond Â£2,800 if Russia - one of the world's largest exporters of natural gas - decided to disrupt supplies. ""We are really managing between two versions of events,"" he said. ""One where the price falls back down to where it was before, for example if there's peace in Ukraine, but one where prices could go even further if we were to see, for example, a disruptive interruption of gas from Russia."" Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia, it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased. ""The price changes we have seen in the gas market are genuinely a once-in-a-generation event not seen since the oil crisis of the 1970s,"" Mr Brearley told the Business select committee. But the Ofgem boss apologised for regulatory shortcomings and admitted had financial controls been in place sooner for suppliers, fewer firms would have gone bust due to being unprepared for the sharp rise in wholesale prices. We are all getting used to bill shocks when it comes to paying for gas and electricity - but this could be the biggest of all. Regulators do not usually give such early indications of the costs to come, which makes the seriousness of the situation all the more obvious. Some 23 million households have their domestic energy bill governed by the price cap. In April, they typically started paying Â£700 a year more. In October, according to Mr Brearley, it could be a further annual rise of Â£800. The trouble is, the old way of tackling this is as a billpayer was to shop around for a better tariff. That option is no longer available. Analysts say the average price of the cheapest 10 fixed tariffs on the market is Â£3,685 a year - clearly a poor financial choice. So that leaves people to budget and use savings as best they can, and leaves ministers under even greater pressure to offer more support, especially during the colder, darker, more expensive months ahead. Later on Tuesday, the Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng told MPs people will have to ""wait and see what's forthcoming"" from the chancellor and the prime minister on further help on energy bills as he said economic growth was the ""time honoured way"" to help people. Mr Kwarteng said the government had put forward Â£9.1bn in support for energy bills, including council tax and energy bill rebates, and an extension of the Warm Home Discount. He added that the government had been waiting to see where gas prices were heading before making a decision on further assistance. ""What we see now isn't the full picture. Both the prime minister and the chancellor say there is more to do, and we have to see what is forthcoming"", Mr Kwarteng told the committee. The Labour committee chairman, Darren Jones, asked the business secretary if he thought ""bill payers are happy with that answer? Just wait and see?"". Mr Kwarteng acknowledged it was ""a difficult time"" and ""people are under huge stress"" but added that ""nobody is suggesting that the government can pay the entirety of the energy bill"". ""What we are committed to is giving support, and that's what we're doing,"" he said. Asked by Mr Jones what he thought about the prospect of a one-off windfall tax on oil and gas companies, Mr Kwarteng said he didn't think it supported investment. In response to Ofgem's price cap forecast, Downing Street acknowledged that energy prices were a ""significant challenge"", but said the government was ""actively looking at what more could be done in this space"". Meanwhile, Labour's shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves questioned: ""How many more alarm bells does the chancellor need to hear before he acts? ""The government have got to get a grip on this crisis and to protect families and our economy."" Ms Reeves repeated her party's call for a windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits to help lower bills for households. Recently, Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years.

World Bank boss warns of recession,"The head of the World Bank has warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could cause a global recession as the price of food, energy and fertiliser jump. David Malpass told a US business event on Wednesday that it is difficult to ""see how we avoid a recession"". He also said that a series of coronavirus lockdowns in China is adding to concerns about a slowdown. His comments are the latest warning over the rising risk that the world economy may be set to contract. ""As we look at the global GDP... it's hard right now to see how we avoid a recession,"" Mr Malpass said, without giving a specific forecast. ""The idea of energy prices doubling is enough to trigger a recession by itself,"" he added. Last month, the World Bank cut its global economic growth forecast for this year by almost a full percentage point, to 3.2%. Recession fears cast shadow over Davos gathering Ukraine war to cause 'worst price shock in 50 years' GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, measures the size of an economy. Gauging its expansion or contraction is one of the most important ways of measuring how well or badly an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks. It helps businesses to judge when to expand and recruit more workers or invest less and cut their workforces. Governments also use it to guide decisions on everything from tax to spending. It is a key gauge, along with inflation, for central banks when considering whether or not to raise or lower interest rates. Mr Malpass also said that many European countries were still too dependent on Russia for oil and gas. That's even as Western nations push ahead withplans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. He also told a virtual event organised by the US Chamber of Commerce that moves by Russia to cut gas supplies could cause a ""substantial slowdown"" in the region. He said higher energy prices were already weighing on Germany, which is the biggest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. Developing countries are also being affected by shortages of fertiliser, food and energy, Mr Malpass said. Mr Malpass also raised concerns about lockdowns in some of China's major cities - including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai - which he said are ""still having ramifications or slowdown impacts on the world"". ""China was already going through some contraction of real estate, so the forecast of China's growth before Russia's invasion had already softened substantially for 2022,"" he said. ""Then the waves of Covid caused lockdowns which further reduced growth expectations for China,"" he added. Also on Wednesday, China's premier Li Keqiang said the world's second largest economy had been hit harder by the latest round of lockdowns than it had been at the start of the pandemic in 2020. He also called for more action by officials to restart factories after lockdowns. ""Progress is not satisfactory,"" Mr Li said. ""Some provinces are reporting that only 30% of businesses have reopenedâ¦ the ratio must be raised to 80% within a short period of time."" Full or partial lockdowns were imposed in dozens of Chinese cities in March and April, including a long shutdown of Shanghai. The measures have led to a sharp slowdown in economic activity across the country. In recent weeks, official figures have shown thatlarge parts of economy have been impacted, from manufacturers to retailers.

Charity warns on 'negative budgets',"Further support with the cost of living is urgent as income is failing to cover basic living costs for many people, a charity has warned. Citizens Advice said 46% of its debt clients had a so-called negative budget, up from 36% three years ago. That means they do not have enough money to meet essential living costs. One mother-of-two said her teenage daughter did not want to ask her for money to buy sanitary products. Extra support is expected soon. Citizens Advice debt advisers have called for a return of the Â£20-a-week boost to Universal Credit, but Treasury chief secretary Simon Clarke has ruled that out, describing it as ""a temporary response to the pandemic"" which would not return. Other measures could be outlined within hours, which could include help for vulnerable households. Many people seeking help from Citizens Advice are already in a difficult financial state. Their budgets are in the red, with income failing to cover daily living costs, even before paying bills such as credit card repayments. Their situation has been made worse by prices rising at the fastest rate for 40 years, and particularly surging energy bills. Among them is a mother-of-two, who we are not naming owing to her vulnerability. She is unable to work and has borrowed from family and friends, but has found it tough to budget, and is seeking official relief from her debts - all of which she said was having an impact on her children. ""We are eating sandwiches and things like that because I don't want to use the oven,"" she said. ""We live off the basics with food shopping, but it is not all healthy. ""My daughter does not like to ask me for money. She worries that it is worrying me. ""With sanitary towels, she won't tell me that she needs them. When she needs them she gets them from school. But they are a necessity. It should not be down to the school; they are there only for an emergency."" Money advice supervisor Christopher Whitehead says food vouchers are often needed The people who work at North Tyneside Citizens Advice are used to such stories, where more women than men seek debt and benefits advice, and contact with people aged in their early 20s is rising. Most people in the area have a low income, but it is very mixed, with pockets of deprivation and also of wealth. Even so, in the first three months of this year, there was an 89% rise in clients who needed charitable support compared with a year earlier. In other words, the need for food and fuel vouchers or welfare support almost doubled in a year. Sometimes staff even have to source second hand ovens for families so they can cook the food they are given. 'I'm in work but I need to use a food bank' Cost of living: What are Rishi Sunak's options? Money advice supervisor Christopher Whitehead, 39, first started in debt advice in 2007 as the financial crisis of that time took hold. ""It was about credit card, store card, and catalogue debt back then. Now it is about people not being able to afford the essentials. There are debts on council tax, energy and rent which are day-to-day costs you should be able to meet,"" he said. When somebody has a negative budget, it means they have nothing left, or have to borrow, after paying their living costs. And those costs don't include unsecured debt repayments such as credit cards. On the quayside, just a few hundred yards from the Citizens Advice office, David Thompson is fishing, and is one of those struggling to pay the bills. The 46-year-old has five children and four grandchildren and gets Universal Credit - which he calls ""Universal Crisis"". David Thompson says food, energy and clothing are all costing more ""It is getting worse and worse, but you have just got to make do with what you have got. It is a struggle. You are worrying before you get paid, then when you get paid you worry how far it is going to go,"" he said, ""It is supposed to last a month, but you are skint after a week or two."" As typical household energy bills are rising, and areset to go up again in October, he said that any extra support given by the government was never going to match the rate of price rises at the moment. ""This is one of the worst times. I remember when the shipyards went down, and the miners' strikes. People are more well-off now than the 80s and the 90s, but things are a lot more expensive,"" he said. It is not only those receiving benefits who are struggling with rising prices and potential debts. The rate of people in debt who have a negative budget is rising fastest among those who are not on benefits, Citizens Advice said. Whatever people's circumstances, whether in-work or not, Citizens Advice is urging anyone who is worried they could be facing a spiral of debt to get in touch for help. ""You have to speak out. You can't just struggle,"" said the mother referred to earlier. ""If I hadn't, I would be in a big black hole now."" Advisers are able to do benefit checks and sometimes to find and apply for grants from benevolent funds run by former employers. However, the charity is warning that there are limits to the support it can offer, so further assistance from ministers is vital. Developments such as social tariffs from energy companies would also help, they said. So far, government support has been a mix of broad, general assistance to help everyone, such as council tax rebates, and more targeted policy - such as allowing those on universal credit to take home more of what they earn. The Treasury said it had already put together a Â£22bn package of support for people facing the rising cost of living, and the government is set to outline further help. The government is expected to scrap a plan to give people Â£200 off bills from October which would be repaid over five years. Instead, the BBC understandsthat sum will be increased and possibly doubled, and will not need to be paid back. Additional help for those on the lowest incomes is also expected.

"Every household to get Â£400 energy bill discountThe poorest will also get a lump-sum of Â£650 to help with the cost of living, Rishi Sunak says.BusinessComments","This video can not be played BBC Political Editor Chris Mason asks the chancellor why he uses âenergy profits levy"" phrase - and not say windfall tax. Every household in the UK is to get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this October as part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. The poorest households will also get a payment of Â£650 to help with the cost of living, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said. It follows warnings that millions could be left struggling if energy prices rise again in October as expected. Mr Sunak said he had offered ""significant support"" for households who were facing ""acute distress"". The package of new measures, worth Â£15bn in total, will also offer more targeted help to pensioners and the disabled. The cost will be partly offset by 25% windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months. It comes a day afterSue Gray's critical report into lockdown parties in Downing Streetand follows intense pressure on the government to do more to help people with the cost of living crisis. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the support was a ""genuinely big package"". ""Put these benefit increases alongside the tax rises just implemented, and Mr Sunak is engaging in some serious redistribution from rich to poor - albeit against a backdrop of rising inequality."" How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Live page: Millions to get support with energy bills Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year Mr Sunak said the government had ""a collective responsibility to help those who are paying the highest price for the high inflation we face."" The chancellor also announced: Eight million households on means-tested benefits will get Â£650 paid directly into their bank accounts in two lump sums - one in July, the other this autumn There will be separate one-off payments of Â£300 to pensioner households and Â£150 to individuals receiving disability benefits - groups who are ""most vulnerable to rising prices"" The emergency Household Support Fund, which is allocated by councils in England, will be extended by Â£500m to Â£1.5bn. The devolved governments will receive equivalent funding. Earlier this week,UK energy regulator Ofgem saidthe typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing it to Â£2,800 a year. Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April. Households will still face rises in bills even with the further government support. Mr Sunaktold the BBC the new measures will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation. The prices of food, fuel and other goods have surged in recent months, pushing inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to a 40-year high. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"". Mr Sunak blamed the war in Ukraine, recent lockdowns in China and the post-pandemic recovery for the surging prices. But he said the situation had ""evolved and become more serious"" pushing the government to act. Under the new measures, the government will scrapa plan to give everyone in England, Scotland and Wales Â£200 off bills from Octoberwhich would be repaid over five years. Instead, that sum will be doubled to Â£400 and will not need to be paid back. Direct debit and credit customers will have the money credited to their accounts, while customers with pre-payment meters will have the money applied to their meter or paid via a voucher. While the Â£400 discount should be UK wide, the lack of an Executive at Stormont in Northern Ireland means people there must wait before they find out when will they receive the discount. The measures add to around Â£17bn of support already given by the government, including one-off Â£150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales. The government had until now rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profits, saying it could deter investment in the UK. But Mr Sunak said the oil and gas sector was ""making extraordinary profits"" and that he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"". He said the tax would raise about Â£5bn this year and be scrapped when oil and gas prices - which have surged recently - return to normal levels. However, in seeking a ""sensible middle ground"" energy suppliers will be able to apply for tax relief of 90p for every pound they invest in UK oil and gas projects. Mr Sunak also said he believed there was a case for taxing electricity suppliers more, announcing a consultation on the idea. How will the Â£5bn windfall tax on energy firms work? What help will I get with my bills? Is the UK doing as much on bills as other countries? Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""After five months of being dragged kicking and screaming, the chancellor has finally come to his senses, U-turned, and adopted Labour's plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits to lower bills."" But business lobby group the CBI warned the windfall tax would be damaging to investment needed for Britain's ""energy security and net zero ambitions"". Oil giant BP said the new tax was ""a multi-year proposal"" rather than a ""one-off tax"". ""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it warned. Zoe, a single mum who lives on The Wirral with her four year old daughter, and who receives universal credit will get Â£400 off her energy bills and also the Â£650 one-off payment. She said she was ""over the moon that the government is finally making us feel like we're being listened to"". ""My big worry was going through the summer holidays with a young one and obviously not having the money to take them out too much,"" she told the BBC. ""With that payment coming through that has lifted a lot of stress and anxiety, because I was really panicked about this."" Debt charity Turn2Us called the support package ""a much-needed step in the right direction in making sure people on the lowest incomes are able to weather this financial crisis"". But Michael Clarke, its head of information programmes, added: ""For people who are in crisis currently, one-off payments will only act as a sticking plaster until longer term investment is made to boost their overall income."" Think tank the Resolution Foundation, which campaigns to end poverty, called the measures ""progressive"", adding that twice as much of the Â£15bn package would go to low-income households than high income ones. Chief executive Torsten Bell said: ""The decision to provide one-off payments this year to poorer households, pensioners and those with a disability is a good attempt to target those with higher energy bills - although the relative lack of support for larger families stands out.""

The teachers who died trying to save their pupilsEva Mireles and Irma Garcia were seen trying to shelter their students from the gunfire.US & Canada,"Irma Garcia and Eva Mireles ""We have a wonderful year ahead of us!"" This sweet and simple line, written by fourth-grade teacher Eva Mireles at the start of the school year, is haunting now. On Thursday, the last day of school, she and fellow teacher Irma Garcia should be packing up their shared classroom at Robb Elementary in the small Texan town of Uvalde, and preparing for the summer break. Instead, their families are making funeral arrangements, after they were gunned down in a mass shooting, which also killed 19 of their young students. AS IT HAPPENED:Texas primary school shooting leaves 21 dead VICTIM PROFILES:Texas victims: 'They were sweet kids and lovable' In the days since Tuesday's attack, Mrs Garcia and Ms Mireles' bravery has been praised - they were seen trying to shelter their students from the bullets. Mrs Garcia was found by officers ""embracing children in her arms pretty much until her last breath,"" her nephew John Martinez told the New York Times. ""She sacrificed herself protecting the kids in her classroom. She was a hero,"" he wrote on a fundraising page. Just two days later her family suffered another tragedy whenMrs Garcia's husband, Joe Garcia, died of a heart attack. Mr Martinez wrote that he ""passed away due to grief"". Mrs Garcia and Ms Mireles had been a teaching team for five years, and had 40 years of experience between them. A photo taken last month shows the pair in their classroom watching over students as they work on iPads, one giggling - he probably knows the photo is being taken. ""Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia were two of the greatest teachers Uvalde, [Texas] has ever known,"" Natalie Arias, an education specialist who lives in Uvalde wrote. ""Their classroom was full of fun, growth, giggles, teamwork, and, most of all, love."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As the outpouring of grief continues, there is also anger that yet another deadly school shooting has been allowed to happen. It is legal to buy a gun at 18 in Texas, and according to US media, the attacker bought his - two AR-15 style semi-automatic rifles and 375 rounds of ammunition -  last week, the day after his birthday. America's bitter debate that never goes away Where does US gun control go from here? ""I'm furious that these shootings continue, these children are innocent, rifles should not be easily available to all,"" Eva Mireles' aunt, Lydia Martinez Delgado, said in a statement. ""This is my hometown, a small community of less than 20,000. I never imagined this would happen, especially to loved ones,"" she wrote. Ms Mireles' husband, Ruben Ruiz, is a school police officer. Two months ago he conducted an active shooter drill -which is common in US schools- at Uvalde High School. Little did he know that just weeks later, his own wife would be a victim to one. The Washington Post reports that Mr Ruiz rushed to Robb Elementary when he heard the news, and had to be held back by other officers as he desperately tried to get to his wife. At least 185 children, educators and other people have been killed in US school attacks since the 1999 Columbine High massacre,according to data by the Washington Post,external. There is even a unique memorial in Kansas for ""fallen educators"" that honours ""those who lost their lives in the line of duty."" Those words, more familiar when talking about soldiers, used here to describe murdered teachers. Now there are two more names to inscribe on the wall of remembrance. A teacher for 17 years, Ms Mireles described her love of running and hiking in a short biography posted on the school district's website. She also said she had ""a supportive, fun, and loving family"" - her husband, her college graduate daughter and ""three furry friends"". Her daughter Adalynn Ruiz wrote a heart-breaking tribute to her ""sweet mommy"" onTwitter,external. ""I'm so happy that people know your name and that beautiful face of yours and they know what a hero looks like,"" she said. ""Eva Mireles, 4th grade teacher... who selflessly jumped in front of her students to save their lives"". Ms Mireles was trained in special education, and was remembered by one parent, Audrey Garcia (no relation to Irma Garcia) for going ""above and beyond"" as a teacher. It was only a few years ago that schools in the Uvalde area started to integrate children with developmental disabilities into regular classrooms, and Ms Mireles was one of the teachers who taught them. ""She was a beautiful person & dedicated teacher. She believed in Gabby & went above & beyond to teach her"", Ms Garciawrote on Twitter,external. Mrs Garcia was a veteran teacher of 23 years - all of which were at Robb Elementary, and was the school's teacher-of-the-year in 2019. ""I am so excited to begin this new school year already!"" she wrote in her biography on the district's website. Authorities told her family that Mrs Garcia was seen by a friend in law enforcement trying to protect her students from the gunfire. ""I want her to be remembered as someone who sacrificed her life and put her life on the line for her kids,"" John Martinez, her nephew, told the Washington Post. ""They weren't just her students. Those were her kids, and she put her life on the line, she lost her life to protect them. That's the type of person she was."" Mrs Garcia was married and had four children - two boys and two girls ranging from 12 to 23 years old. Her Facebook page is an album of family memories and pride for her children. ""Thank you Jesus for my amazing husband and my babies,"" she wrote under one photo of a family fishing trip. The teacher's social media also shows her dedication to her career and students. ""Learned so many new ways to challenge my future students to be independent learners,"" she wrote in one post that showed certificates for a teaching course. Allow Twitter content?

MP loses appeal against harassment conviction,"Claudia Webbe was found guilty last year of harassing Michelle Merritt An MP has lost an appeal against her conviction for harassing a woman who was having a sexual relationship with her then partner. Claudia Webbe, MP for Leicester East, wasgiven a suspended prison sentencefor harassing Michelle Merritt between September 2018 and April 2020. Her appeal was dismissed at Southwark Crown Court on Thursday. However the 10-week suspended sentence she received in November was reduced to community service. Judge Deborah Taylor and two magistrates ruled this should amount to 80 hours - a reduction from the 200 hours she was originally ordered to complete. A trial at Westminster Magistrates' Court heard Webbe was jealous of Ms Merritt's relationship with Lester Thomas. The 57-year-old - who represents her constituency as an independent after being expelled from Labour - made numerous calls to Ms Merritt in a campaign of harassment over the course of 18 months. Her trial heard on one occasion she made an ""angry"" call, used a derogatory term and added: ""You should be acid."" It also heard how Webbe threatened to send naked images of Ms Merritt to her family and a recording of a call in which she was heard shouting ""get out of my relationship"". The appeal hearing heard Ms Merritt had reported being ""threatened by a public figure with acid"", but received 17 further phone calls lasting 14 seconds or less from Webbe after the MP was warned by police to stop contacting her. The judge said the court found Webbe had not ""made a threat to throw acid over"" Ms Merritt but that a string of silent phone calls and threats to reveal naked pictures of her had been ""a course of conduct which amounted to harassment"". Webbe said she split up with Lester Thomas in March 2022 The appeal heard since the trial, Ms Merritt's phone had been examined and downloaded by police, revealing sexual messages between her and Mr Thomas. Webbe's barrister Helen Law suggested Ms Merritt had ""lied"" or ""misled"" the magistrates' court when she said she and Mr Thomas were just ""good friends"". But prosecutor Susannah Stevens said: ""What was going on between Michelle Merritt and Lester Thomas is actually unhelpful to the appellant's case because Claudia Webbe's suspicions as to all of that provide her not with a defence but with a motivation."" The MP said she had split up with Mr Thomas in March this year after learning of the messages he had shared with Ms Merritt. By Tony Roe, BBC East Midlands political editor The decision to overturn the custodial element of Claudia Webbe's sentence is significant as it means voters won't get a chance - for now - to say if she should be sacked as an MP, in what's called a recall petition. We will now have to see if Parliament's Standards Committee decides to act on the conviction. If she were to be suspended from Parliament for at least 10 days, that then is another route for a recall petition which would put Webbe's future in the hands of the voters of Leicester East. Webbe entered the Commons in 2019, winning the seat formerly held by Keith Vaz. Following her failure to overturn the conviction, she said she was ""deeply shocked"". She said: ""As I said in court and repeat now, I have never threatened violence nor would I."" Webbe's former party urged her to quit as an MP in the wake of the verdict. A Labour spokesman said: ""The allegations in this case were extremely serious. ""The Labour Party rightly expects elected representatives to maintain the very highest standards at all times. ""Ms Webbe should now resign so the people of Leicester East can get the representation they deserve."" Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external.

BBC to move CBBC and BBC Four onlineDirector-general Tim Davie says the move is part of a raft of cost-saving measures.Entertainment & Arts,"The Beaker Girls was broadcast on CBBC last year The BBC has announced that it plans to stop airing CBBC and BBC Four as traditional broadcast channels. Director-general Tim Davie announced the content of these networks will continue to be produced and made available for online platforms. This means they would only be available on BBC iPlayer, with Radio 4 Extra moving to BBC Sounds, rather than via their traditional broadcast outlets. He added that the corporation's two news channels will be merged into one. Tim Davie said: ""We are moving decisively to a largely on-demand world"" The corporation currently has two different news networks for UK and World audiences, and the changes are part of cost-saving measures, which the BBC said are part of a plan to create a ""modern, digital-led and streamlined organisation"". The changes announced on Thursday would mean cuts of Â£200m a year and the reorganisation of services which prioritise digital platforms. But CBBC, BBC Four will stay on linear TV and Radio 4 Extra will stay on the radio airwaves for at least three years. Mr Davie also announced changes to local radio and regional news, which will see TV news programmes in Oxford and Cambridge merged with the BBC's Southampton and Norwich operations. BBC plans to axe local TV news bulletin BBC One regional programme We Are England will also end after its second series later this year. In January, the latest licence fee settlement was announced which will keep it at Â£159 a year for two years and then rise in line with inflation. Overall, the plans could mean up to 1,000 job losses in the publicly-funded part of the corporation over the next few years. Mr Davie said the BBC would consult with trade unions on the proposals. In a statement, he said the BBC must ""evolve faster and embrace the huge shifts in the market around us"". ""This is our moment to build a digital-first BBC,"" he said. ""Something genuinely new, a Reithian organisation for the digital age, a positive force for the UK and the world. ""Independent, impartial, constantly innovating and serving all. A fresh, new, global digital media organisation which has never been seen before."" The director-general told staff that too many BBC resources are currently focused on broadcast output rather than online, adding: ""We are moving decisively to a largely on-demand world."" The newly merged news channel will mean a single, 24-hour broadcast, simply called BBC News, serving UK and international audiences and offering greater amounts of shared content. Plans to stop scheduling separate content for Radio 4 Long Wave Additional online news services for Sunderland, Bradford, Wolverhampton and Peterborough, creating 100 new job posts Alternative funding for some performance groups such as the BBC's orchestras The end of bespoke television operations in Oxford and Cambridge, which will merge with the wider regional 18:30 news programmes Requesting Ofcom to remove regulatory restrictions on iPlayer to expand boxsets and archive content - with an ambition to reach 75% of BBC viewers through iPlayer each week Shifting a number of World Service languages to being digital only Reviewing commercial options for audio production, which could mean some podcasts are produced by the corporation's commercial arm, BBC Studios This announcement amounts to an ambitious, even radical, acceleration of the BBC's pivot to digital services. It is an attempt to ward off two threats: the first, financial; the second, technological. Financially, the two-year freeze in the licence fee - amid a cost-of-living crisis - forces the BBC to find further savings. Technologically, future licence fee payers are primarily digital creatures. Yet the BBC is still mostly consumed through TVs and radios, and spends most of its money on services that reach people through those traditional means. There will be a big impact on what shows people watch and listen to. Some of that is positive: new dramas, TV formats and podcasts that are widely enjoyed. But some is negative: shows treasured by people who have paid their licence fee for years will go. Which shows remains unclear, though the recent licence fee freeze does give the BBC some cover for those hard choices. Earlier on Thursday, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries issued the BBC with a legal direction ordering it to ""promote equality of opportunity"" for people from working-class backgrounds. The stipulation came as part of the mid-term review into the corporation's royal charter and includes a target for 25% of staff to be from low socio-economic backgrounds. The BBC said this direction affirms targets the corporation has already set itself. The BBC has also been asked to ensure 50% of radio and 60% of TV production spend is outside London by the end of 2027. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries has said the BBC's funding model is ""completely outdated"" The corporation must also deliver 1,000 apprenticeships per year by 2025 and ensure that 30% of those are from low socio-economic groups. In a statement, the BBC's chairman, Richard Sharp, said: ""The mid-term review is built into our Charter. We welcome it and we will engage fully and constructively. We look forward to working with government and Ofcom."" Ms Dorries has previously said she wants to find a new funding model for the BBC before the current licence fee deal expires in 2027, as she says it is ""completely outdated"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said on Thursday: ""The prime minister is firmly of the view that the BBC is a world-class broadcaster, but like other broadcasters one that needs to adapt to a rapidly changing landscape.""

Every household to get Â£400 energy bill discount,"This video can not be played BBC Political Editor Chris Mason asks the chancellor why he uses âenergy profits levy"" phrase - and not say windfall tax. Every household in the UK is to get an energy bill discount of Â£400 this October as part of a package of new measures to tackle soaring prices. The poorest households will also get a payment of Â£650 to help with the cost of living, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said. It follows warnings that millions could be left struggling if energy prices rise again in October as expected. Mr Sunak said he had offered ""significant support"" for households who were facing ""acute distress"". The package of new measures, worth Â£15bn in total, will also offer more targeted help to pensioners and the disabled. The cost will be partly offset by 25% windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits, which have soared in recent months. It comes a day afterSue Gray's critical report into lockdown parties in Downing Streetand follows intense pressure on the government to do more to help people with the cost of living crisis. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies think tank, said the support was a ""genuinely big package"". ""Put these benefit increases alongside the tax rises just implemented, and Mr Sunak is engaging in some serious redistribution from rich to poor - albeit against a backdrop of rising inequality."" How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Live page: Millions to get support with energy bills Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year Mr Sunak said the government had ""a collective responsibility to help those who are paying the highest price for the high inflation we face."" The chancellor also announced: Eight million households on means-tested benefits will get Â£650 paid directly into their bank accounts in two lump sums - one in July, the other this autumn There will be separate one-off payments of Â£300 to pensioner households and Â£150 to individuals receiving disability benefits - groups who are ""most vulnerable to rising prices"" The emergency Household Support Fund, which is allocated by councils in England, will be extended by Â£500m to Â£1.5bn. The devolved governments will receive equivalent funding. Earlier this week,UK energy regulator Ofgem saidthe typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing it to Â£2,800 a year. Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April. Households will still face rises in bills even with the further government support. Mr Sunaktold the BBC the new measures will have a ""minimal impact"" on inflation. The prices of food, fuel and other goods have surged in recent months, pushing inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to a 40-year high. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"". Mr Sunak blamed the war in Ukraine, recent lockdowns in China and the post-pandemic recovery for the surging prices. But he said the situation had ""evolved and become more serious"" pushing the government to act. Under the new measures, the government will scrapa plan to give everyone in England, Scotland and Wales Â£200 off bills from Octoberwhich would be repaid over five years. Instead, that sum will be doubled to Â£400 and will not need to be paid back. Direct debit and credit customers will have the money credited to their accounts, while customers with pre-payment meters will have the money applied to their meter or paid via a voucher. While the Â£400 discount should be UK wide, the lack of an Executive at Stormont in Northern Ireland means people there must wait before they find out when will they receive the discount. The measures add to around Â£17bn of support already given by the government, including one-off Â£150 council tax rebates for most homes in England and Wales. The government had until now rejected the idea of a windfall tax on energy firms' profits, saying it could deter investment in the UK. But Mr Sunak said the oil and gas sector was ""making extraordinary profits"" and that he was ""sympathetic to the argument to tax those profits fairly"". He said the tax would raise about Â£5bn this year and be scrapped when oil and gas prices - which have surged recently - return to normal levels. However, in seeking a ""sensible middle ground"" energy suppliers will be able to apply for tax relief of 90p for every pound they invest in UK oil and gas projects. Mr Sunak also said he believed there was a case for taxing electricity suppliers more, announcing a consultation on the idea. How will the Â£5bn windfall tax on energy firms work? What help will I get with my bills? Is the UK doing as much on bills as other countries? Rachel Reeves, Labour's shadow chancellor, said: ""After five months of being dragged kicking and screaming, the chancellor has finally come to his senses, U-turned, and adopted Labour's plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits to lower bills."" But business lobby group the CBI warned the windfall tax would be damaging to investment needed for Britain's ""energy security and net zero ambitions"". Oil giant BP said the new tax was ""a multi-year proposal"" rather than a ""one-off tax"". ""Naturally we will now need to look at the impact of both the new levy and the tax relief on our North Sea investment plans,"" it warned. Zoe, a single mum who lives on The Wirral with her four year old daughter, and who receives universal credit will get Â£400 off her energy bills and also the Â£650 one-off payment. She said she was ""over the moon that the government is finally making us feel like we're being listened to"". ""My big worry was going through the summer holidays with a young one and obviously not having the money to take them out too much,"" she told the BBC. ""With that payment coming through that has lifted a lot of stress and anxiety, because I was really panicked about this."" Debt charity Turn2Us called the support package ""a much-needed step in the right direction in making sure people on the lowest incomes are able to weather this financial crisis"". But Michael Clarke, its head of information programmes, added: ""For people who are in crisis currently, one-off payments will only act as a sticking plaster until longer term investment is made to boost their overall income."" Think tank the Resolution Foundation, which campaigns to end poverty, called the measures ""progressive"", adding that twice as much of the Â£15bn package would go to low-income households than high income ones. Chief executive Torsten Bell said: ""The decision to provide one-off payments this year to poorer households, pensioners and those with a disability is a good attempt to target those with higher energy bills - although the relative lack of support for larger families stands out.""

"How plans to tackle cost of living will affect youThe chancellor says the new support will help with soaring bills, so how will you be impacted?BusinessComments","Eight million people are receiving the final instalment of cost of living payments totalling Â£900. Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February. However, the payments have not tackled the extent of the financial problems many people face, a group of MPs says. It is available to households who receive these benefits,external: universal credit income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance income support working tax credit child tax credit pension credit The final instalment of Â£299 follows two others last year, of Â£301 and Â£300. To qualify, people need to have claimed a benefits payment between 13 November 2023 and 12 December 2023. Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner householdsdo not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit. Anyone who thinks they should have received the help but did not should contact the office that pays their benefit or tax credits, orreport it here,external. The payment reference on a recipient's bank account is their National Insurance number, followed by DWP COL. The 1.1 million people who receive only working tax credit or child tax credit, rather than any of the other benefits have the reference HMRC COLS. Cost of living payments do not affect the tax you pay, or the benefits or tax credits you receive. Households thatreceive the winter fuel payment,external- which is paid to nearly all homes with at least one person of pension age - received an extra payment of between Â£150 and Â£300 during the winter. Lower-income pensioners who claim pension credit get the money in addition to the support provided for those on benefits. A Â£150 payment was also made to up to six million people receiving disability benefits, between 20 June and 4 July. All cost of living payments go straight into recipients' bank accounts.

It said payments were not enough for those with extra costs associated with their disabilities. Disability charity Scope says some people cannot afford to power vital equipment. There was particular concern for some larger families. The report said the payments have had an important impact, but the system was relatively unsophisticated, meaning some of those in need slipped through the net. It said that in future, the government should consider increasing benefits rather than giving ad-hoc payments.

Universal credit fraud costs taxpayers over Â£5bn,"Universal credit fraud is at a record high of 13% of all spending on the benefit, costing the taxpayer Â£5.6bn. It marks an increase of almost three-quarters on pre-pandemic fraud levels, and a slight rise on the previous year. From the start of the pandemic, the government eased certain conditions to allow unprecedented numbers of people to access financial help. Fraud levels across all benefits were 3%, which the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) said was ""unacceptable"". The DWP statistics show one in four claims for universal credit was overpaid - either because of error or fraud. Total spending on benefits in the year to April 2022 went up by 2.1% or Â£4.1bn, mainly because of a rise in the number of universal credit claimants, and an inflation-linked increase to the payments. Removing Â£20 uplift 'has made every day a worry' Universal credit is the main benefit payment for working-age people. It was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for those who are unemployed or low-paid, in a bid to make the system simpler. It's claimed by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales, 40% of whom are in work. Claimants received an extra Â£20 per week from April 2020 to October 2021. Universal credit fraud was already rising before the pandemic started. But an unprecedented spike in applications at the beginning of lockdown in 2020 meant some benefit rules were relaxed to ensure that people were paid quickly. This in turn led to widespread fraud, including by organised crime groups. In December 2021, the DWP announced it was tospend more than Â£500m over the next three years tackling fraud,including hiring about 2,000 fraud investigators. Earlier this month, the DWP set itself a target of cutting Â£2bn in fraud over the next three years. Part of these plans include forcing banks to share more data with the department, for instance to check if a claimant's savings are too large to qualify for benefits. ""It's unacceptable to see that fraud rose as a result of callous criminals exploiting measures to help those in need during the pandemic. Our new fraud plan will root these crooks out of the system, while protecting it from new threats in the future,"" a DWP spokesperson said of the newly released figures. Last November, a group of MPs said that while they could understand why the DWP had chosen to relax the rules, ""the amount of taxpayers' money being lost is simply unacceptable"".

"Police accused of delay in storming Texas schoolThe gunman was inside the Texas school for between 40 minutes and an hour, officials say.","People have been laying flowers near the school campus in Uvalde as tributes Police were urged to charge into a deadly school shooting in the US state of Texas by onlookers, witnesses say, with one suggesting he considered doing so himself as he became frustrated. Officials say gunman Salvador Ramos, 18, was inside the school in Uvalde for up to an hour before he was killed. Nineteen children and two adults died, while 17 others were injured. Eyewitness Juan Carranza told the Associated Press that women shouted at officers to ""go in there"". But the 24-year-old, who witnessed the scene at the Robb Elementary School from outside his house, said police did not enter. Javier Cazares, whose daughter was killed in the attack, told the news agency he suggested running in with other onlookers because the police ""weren't doing anything"". Authorities said the gunman locked himself in a classroom which officers then struggled to gain access to. Steven McCraw, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, told a news conference on Wednesday that the gunman was on site for between 40 minutes and an hour before law enforcement were able to ""contain"" him. US Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz, meanwhile, told CNN that dozens of officers responded to the shooting and ""didn't hesitate"". ""They entered that classroom and they took care of the situation as quickly as they possibly could,"" he said. Texas victims: 'The sweetest little boy I've ever known' America's bitter debate that never goes away It has also emerged that the attacker sent messages on social media about the shooting minutes before it happened. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Ramos had promised to shoot his grandmother in private messages sent 30 minutes before the attack. A later message declared he had done so, and in a final one sent 15 minutes before the shooting, he announced he would target an elementary school. According to CNN, the private messages were sent to a 15-year-old girl in Germany who Ramos had met online. In a statement, Meta, Facebook's parent company, said the ""private one-to-one text messages"" were ""discovered after the terrible tragedy occurred"". It added that it was ""closely co-operating"" with investigators. This video can not be played Watch: Texas governor heckled by rival over gun laws Tuesday's events in Uvalde - an unassuming town some 80 miles (129km) from San Antonio - brought the discussion around gun control once again to the fore, even as members of the small community sought to make sense of the tragedy. Many there expressed divided attitudes about guns. ""As a kid, I remember my uncles teaching me and training me on how to hold a gun,"" Carlos Velasquez, a local resident, told the BBC. ""The juxtaposition of good safety with what just happened is so nuanced. It's not just a clean-cut thought - it's a really sticky situation and sticky conversation to have now,"" he said. Others, however, were shocked that Ramos was able to carry out an attack with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle. ""This kid was just 18. You have to be 21 to drink. How?"" asked Sandra Parra, who lives down the street from the school. ""I hope there are changes,"" she said, referring to gun laws in Texas. ""I don't have a gun myself, but if I did, it would be for protection,"" she added. It is legal to buy a gun at 18 in Texas, and according to US media, the attacker bought his soon after his birthday. Described as a loner from a ""fraught home life"", the gunman shot his grandmother before fleeing the scene in a battered truck carrying firearms and copious ammunition. He then drove erratically across town and crashed his car into a ditch near Robb Elementary School. An officer engaged with him, but failed to stop him from entering the school. He then proceeded to shoot 19 children and two teachers dead, before officers converged on the classroom and a border patrol officer who had responded while nearby killed him, according to Mr Abbott. Mr Abbott said there had been no history to suggest the gunman could be a danger apart from the social media messages sent before the killings. Speaking on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said the idea that a teenager was able to legally purchase weapons that were ""designed and marketed to kill, is just wrong"". ""I'm just sick and tired of what's going on and what continues to go on,"" he said, calling for ""action"" on gun control. His comments followed an incident at Mr Abbott's news conference, where the governor's Democratic challenger for office, Beto O'Rourke, heckled the Republican for not doing enough on gun control. In response, Mr Abbott accused Mr O'Rourke of grandstanding. According to the Texas Politics Project, only 43% of Texans support stricter gun laws. Nationally, the figure is 53% in support, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center poll. As more details of the mass shooting emerged, the Uvalde community grieved.

Billionaireâs stake in BT faces security probe,"The government is to examine French billionaire Patrick Drahi's increased stake in BT over national security concerns, the telecoms giant has said. Mr Drahi's company, Altice,increased its investment from 12% to 18% in December, prompting speculation the firm could face a takeover bid. The Business Secretary will now probe the move using new powers under the National Security and Investment Act. BT said it would co-operate with the review. In a statement, BT said that business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was exercising his ""call-in power"" under the National Security and Investment Act 2021. Billionaire Patrick Drahi raises BT stake to 18% The new legislation came into force earlier this year, giving the government powers to scrutinise, impose conditions on, or block acquisitions on national security grounds. BT is in the middle of a transformational programme to build a national broadband fibre network, a strategy crucial both to the company and the government, which says it wants to boost regional growth. Shares in BT fell 4% in morning trading in London. Mr Drahi, who also owns auction house Sotheby's, first began buying BT shares last June. His purchase of just over 12% of the company, worth Â£2.2bn at the time, made him the largest shareholder. He now owns 18% of BT - 12% short of 30% at which point the takeover rules would force him to make an offer for the whole company. Mr Drahi's stake-building in BT sparked rumours about other possible bidders. When news emerged of Mr Drahi's increased stake in December, Altice said it did ""not intend to make an offer for BT"". Under British takeover rules, that barred Mr Drahi from making such a move for six months. Karen Egan, a telecoms analyst at Enders Analysis, says that explains the timing of this probe. ""That was December, and we're now almost in June, so it's no surprise we're seeing this now,"" Ms Egan said. She said that the government was attempting to ""get ahead of the situation"" and send a message to Mr Drahi ""not to assume"" that a bid would be allowed. ""The new bill is designed to protect assets exactly like BT,"" she said. ""The government is quite sensitive over this, primarily on security grounds. It's very unlikely that they'd be happy with Mr Drahi taking over BT."" Born in Morocco to a Jewish family in 1963 French, Israeli and Portuguese citizenship Based in Switzerland Founded Altice, a French multinational telecoms group Owns Sotheby's auction house Worth $6.7bn (Â£5.3bn), and is one of the world's top 400 billionaires, according to Forbes Billionaire Patrick Drahi raises BT stake to 18% UK companies 'perform better' with overseas owners Death toll rises as governor confirms hydrants issue 'impaired' LA wildfires fight 'I have nothing to go back to' - reporter tells of LA fires heartbreak Reeves pledges to 'make UK better off' on China visit LA fires: How three days of devastation unfolded What's the latest on the Los Angeles wildfires and what caused them?

People gambling to pay energy bills - union leader,"This video can not be played Cost of living: 'Even Boris (Johnson's) friends will get Â£400 - do they need it?' People are gambling to try to pay off soaring gas and electric bills, a trade union leader has warned on the day extra help with charges was unveiled. All UK households will get anenergy bill discount of Â£400this autumn, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announced. Earlier, the Wales TUC's Shavanah Taj said pensioners were ""being forced to return to work"" to make ends meet. She said teaching staff were working extra shifts in shops and hospitality to cope with the cost of living crisis. How plans to tackle cost of living will affect you Live page: Millions to get support with energy bills Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year One woman from Wrexham said she had been left with only Â£12.36 to last her until 18 June, forcing her to skip meals. Carole Anne Wilson, 57, who lives alone, was forced to retire in 2019 after being diagnosed with a series of illnesses and receives Universal Credit. Asked about Mr Sunak's measures, she said: ""There's just not enough being done... there's no where for me to turn."" After mounting pressure on UK ministers to do more to help people with the cost of living, Mr Sunak told MPs the poorest households would get a one-off payment of Â£650. There will also be a Â£300 one-off payment for 8 million pensioner households. Homes not connected to the gas grid - thought to be about 19% of homes in Wales - will receive Â£400, Mr Sunak said. The Â£15bn package of new measures will be partly funded through a 25% windfall tax on oil and gas firms' profits which have soared in recent months. ""We have a collective responsibility to help those who are paying the highest price for the high inflation we face,"" the chancellor said. ""That is why I'm targeting this significant support to millions of the most vulnerable people in our society."" This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says eight million households will get Â£1,200 in support, when combining measures announced on Thursday and before. Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford said the measures ""barely scratch the surface"". Mr Sunak's statement came hours after Wales TUC general secretary Ms Taj addressed an inquiry into the cost of living by the Senedd's economy committee. She said while people on the very lowest incomes were being hit hardest by price rises, she was also hearing examples of how public sector workers were ""very much now being squeezed"". ""We've heard over the last couple of days [about] people who work even, for example, in schools, teaching staff, teaching assistants, taking on additional jobs in the evening, working extra hours in the hospitality sector, taking on additional shifts in retail as well in big supermarkets and so forth as well,"" she said Shavanah Taj says she is hearing worrying stories every day about the impact of rising prices Ms Taj said she worried about rising debt levels. ""Over the last couple of days, we've actually been hearing from people who were saying that they are dealing with personal cases from [trade union] members who've begun gambling as a means to try and pay off a gas or electric bill."" Pensioners, she said, were ""being forced to return to work actually, because their pensions are now not worth what it was that they thought it was going to be because of the cost of living crisis"". The Treasury said the Welsh government would receive an extra Â£25m of funding to use as it decides as a result of other measures in the chancellor's package that are for England only. Earlier this week, UK energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing it to Â£2,800 a year. Bills had already risen by Â£700 on average in April. The prices of food, fuel and other goods have also surged, pushing inflation - the rate at which prices rise - to a 40-year high of 9%. Ms Wilson said she has been struggling to cope with soaring food costs, relying on her adult daughter to help her out. ""I was feeding myself (in) January, February, March, and then since March my daughter's providing me with three meals a week,"" she said. ""I don't have breakfast, I don't have lunch. It's gone from being able to just about support myself with what I have left, to basically having nothing."" She added that the UK government did not understand the cost of living crisis as ""they don't feel the pinch because they've got the money"". Reacting to the chancellor's statement, Mr Drakeford complained that the UK government had ""finally acted on calls for a windfall tax"" after ""defending the huge profits of oil and gas companies for so long"". ""This has taken months - months where people across the country have been worried about the rising cost of living and making ends meet,"" he said, onTwitter,external. ""Whilst this U-turn and increased support for those on lower incomes is welcome, the measures announced today barely scratch the surface. ""We will continue to do all we can to protect people in Wales from the cost of living crisis, and to push the UK government to do more."" Disability Wales' worker Kat Watkins said her bill had doubled since April from Â£67 a month to Â£139 Kat Watkins has a brittle bone condition and uses an electric wheelchair and other equipment to maintain her quality of life. The Disability Wales' worker, said her bill had doubled since April from Â£67 a month to Â£139. ""Electricity basically means I can live my life, because without it I can't move around because my electric wheelchair wouldn't charge, I wouldn't be able to breathe at night because I wouldn't have my ventilator to keep me alive,"" she said. ""I have a personal assistant and they live with me. If I chose not to heat my house for myself that's fine, but because I have people with me . I need to keep my house warm for them too, so gas is also important."" Rob James is offering cut price meals for people struggling to afford food The Ivor Hael Hotel in Tonypandy initially offered free meals to the homeless and vulnerable at Christmas time, but will start providing meals at low cost for people in the community who cannot afford to eat, with pub ""classics"" offered for 50 to 80p. Those eligible will get a voucher and then be able to pick up their food which is prepared by staff at the pub. Rob James, the manager, said the staff noticed a drop in some of their regular customers who could not afford to eat out. ""The staff are there, the gas is on, the electrics are on, why not try to help people in need and people who are struggling"", he said. ""So we've come up with the idea of why not try and get meals into these people's bellies, because we hear stories of people missing meals.""

Man's double hand transplant is 'space-age stuff',"Steven Gallagher laughed when it was first suggested he could have a double hand transplant. But five months on from pioneering surgery that could have cost him all use of his hands, he is now pain-free and enjoying ""a new lease of life"". Steven, 48, developed an unusual rash on his cheeks and nose about 13 years ago, and pains in his right arm. Doctors initially thought it waslupus,externaland thencarpal tunnel syndrome,external, and the father-of-three had an operation. But when the pain returned in both arms, he was referred to a specialist who confirmed he hadscleroderma,external, an autoimmune disease that causes scarring of the skin and internal organs. The condition affected areas including his nose, mouth and hands. About seven years ago, his fingers started curling in until they were in a fist position. He was suffering ""horrendous"" pain. ""My hands started to close, it got to the point where it was basically two fists, my hands were unusable,"" he recalled. ""I couldn't do a thing apart from lift things with two hands. ""I could not grab anything, it was a struggle to get dressed and things like that."" Doctors hail first face and double hand transplant Quadruple amputee given double hand transplant UK's first double hand transplant operation 'tremendous' success Steven, from Dreghorn in North Ayrshire, was forced to give up his work as a roof tiler. He was referred to Professor Andrew Hart, a consultant plastic and hand surgeon based in Glasgow, who first raised the possibility of a double hand transplant. ""At the time I laughed and thought, that's space-age kind of things,"" he said. Steven can now hold his pet dog again After further conversations with Prof Hart, Steven also spoke to Professor Simon Kay, a consultant plastic surgeon at Leeds Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust who led the UK's first double hand transplant operation in 2016. Both outlined the risks involved. ""They were really understanding and really open about what might happen, that I could lose my hands altogether,"" he recalled. ""They said it was unlikely but it was a risk. ""My wife and I spoke about it and came to the agreement to go for it. I could end up losing my hands anyway, so it was just a case of letting them know I was going to go with it."" Steven, who has three daughters aged 12, 24 and 27, had to undergo psychological evaluation to ensure he was prepared for the transplant. He is believed to be the first person in the world with his condition to have the surgery. It involved a 30-strong team of professionals from many disciplines and was carried out in Leeds over a 12-hour period in December 2021 after a suitable donor was found. ""After the operation, I woke up and it was quite surreal,"" Steven said. ""These hands are amazing, everything has happened so quickly. From the moment I woke up from the operation I could move them."" After spending four weeks in Leeds General Infirmary following the operation, Steven now makes regular visits to hospitals in Glasgow for physiotherapy and monitoring. Although dexterous tasks such as doing up buttons are still beyond him, his improving condition means he can do things like stroke his dog, turn on the tap and fill a glass of water. ""It has given me a new lease of life,"" he added. ""I'm still finding things hard just now but things are getting better every week with the physio and the occupational therapists. Everything is just slowly getting better. ""The pain is the big thing. Before the operation it was horrendous, I was on so much pain relief it was unbelievable, but now I've no pain at all."" Prof Kay said the operation had been a ""huge team effort"" and a hand transplant was ""very different from a kidney or other organ transplant"". ""Hands are something we see every day and we use them in so many ways,"" he explained.

NI Assembly recalled amid row over Brexit deal,"Michelle O'Neill, with Finance Minister Conor Murphy, says voters expect members in the chamber Northern Ireland's Assembly will meet on Monday after a successful petition to recall members back to Stormont. The Democratic Unionist Party has blocked the establishment of the assemblysince Sinn FÃ©in emerged as the largest party in this month's election. The DUP has refused to support the election of a new speaker or first and deputy first minister until there is ""action"" on the NI Protocol. It comes as a US delegation is in Belfast meeting the five main parties. The delegation's leader Congressman Richard Neal had been criticised for sayingthe protocol dispute was ""manufactured"", which the DUP said was ""one-sided"". However, the DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the US politicians had shown ""a greater understanding of unionist concerns"" in a meeting with him on Thursday. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Claims about Northern Ireland's Brexit fact-checked ""If their public response echoes what they said to us in the meeting, then some progress will have been made,"" he added. Mr Neal said the meeting went ""pretty well"" with the DUP leader. ""The conversations we had probably 25 years ago were considerably more strenuous than the one we had today,"" he said. He said the argument of the US delegation was ""negotiate a solution to a satisfactory outcome"". Unionist politicians have been protesting against the protocol, which was part ofthe UK government's Brexit deal with the EU. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says US politicians showed an understanding of unionist concerns, including that the protocol undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK Designed to ensure free trade could continue across Ireland's land border post-Brexit, it has also resulted in additional checks being placed on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey has previously described this as undermining Northern Ireland's position in the UK. For unionists this US fact finding mission will be remembered for two words, manufactured and planters. Both caused offence when used by Congressman Neal to describe the protocol row and unionists living in Northern Ireland. He may have rowed back from the remarks behind closed doors but there was no sense of a climbdown when Congressman Neal appeared in front of the cameras. ""No harm intended"" was as close as he came. But for the other Stormont parties, the DUP's outrage at Congressman Neal was manufactured to deflect from the party's Executive boycott. The US visitors may not have found too many new facts about the protocol but they did discover where all the pressure points are. The Stormont recall petition was proposed by Sinn FÃ©in on Wednesday in a bid to see a new speaker elected. That election, which required cross-community support, is the first act that must happen after an election before the assembly can carry out any other business. There are concerns that without a functioning government in Northern Ireland, the cost of living crisis cannot be addressed by politicians. On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announceda Â£1,000 payment for Northern Ireland's most vulnerable households, including a one-off cost of living payment. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem The petition needed 30 signatures to pass, and received the backing of Alliance and SDLP. Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) have now been summoned to the Stormont chamber on Monday by current Speaker Alex Maskey to debate the ""urgent appointment"" of ministers. Sinn FÃ©in's would-be first minister, Michelle O'Neill, said voters expected politicians to be in the assembly chamber. Richard Neal, leading a delegation of US politicians, at Stormont with outgoing Speaker Alex Maskey Speaking after meeting the US delegation at Stormont, Ms O'Neill said: ""They expect us to be putting money into peoples pockets but the DUP are blocking all that. ""It's important we attempt to elect a speaker."" However Sir Jeffrey dismissed the recall as a Sinn FÃ©in ""stunt"". ""If they think that pulling a stunt like this next Monday is going to change things, then they really don't understand unionism and our determination to stand our ground until we get the decisive action that is required to move us all forward."" Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie confirmed his party would be at Stormont on Monday, ""because that's our job"". ""The people of Northern Ireland are suffering, we have the power to help them, and the way to do that is to get both the assembly and the executive up and running,"" he said. Mr Beattie said he felt US representatives would emerge from Thursday's meetings ""understanding the unionist position"". He added: ""We were all in agreement to a degree that this is not a crisis, this is a problem and a problem to be solved."" Alliance MP Stephen Farry said there were ""genuine"" problems with the protocol, but unionism was not ""helping itself"" by walking away from solutions offered. ""The solution here has to be about partnership between the UK and the European Union, and we deeply understand the frustrations that the EU has with the approach that the UK has taken, but we also feel that creativity is required to get this over the line. ""We need to see more progress."" On Wednesday night, the American delegation was hosted by Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who said the UK and the US were united in their shared commitment to the Good Friday Agreement. DUP Mayor of Derry Graham Warke asked if the US visitors ""could be careful with their words"" Earlier, the UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, on a visit to County Antrim, said issues with the protocol were ""soluble"" but cannot be allowed to drift. Businesses in Northern Ireland think the protocol can work- and want it to, the UK's biggest business association has said. Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, said: ""If you're a manufacturer you have access to dual markets. That is a very big deal in the context of the overall Brexit fall out.""

"How plans to tackle cost of living will affect youThe chancellor says the new support will help with soaring bills, so how will you be impacted?Business","Eight million people are receiving the final instalment of cost of living payments totalling Â£900. Those on means-tested benefits including universal credit will be paid directly, without the need to make a claim, by 22 February.

Those who received a payment for an assessment period ending between these dates are also eligible. Pensioner households may be able to have a new pension credit claim backdated. An estimated 850,000 pensioner householdsdo not claim pension credit, which is a gateway to these extra payments. People are not eligible if they receive new-style employment and support allowance, contributory employment and support allowance, or new-style jobseeker's allowance - unless they get universal credit.

There was particular concern for some larger families. The report said the payments have had an important impact, but the system was relatively unsophisticated, meaning some of those in need slipped through the net.

Billionaireâs stake in BT faces security probeThe UK is using new powers to investigate Patrick Drahi's 18% holding in the telecoms giant.Business,"The government is to examine French billionaire Patrick Drahi's increased stake in BT over national security concerns, the telecoms giant has said. Mr Drahi's company, Altice,increased its investment from 12% to 18% in December, prompting speculation the firm could face a takeover bid. The Business Secretary will now probe the move using new powers under the National Security and Investment Act. BT said it would co-operate with the review. In a statement, BT said that business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng was exercising his ""call-in power"" under the National Security and Investment Act 2021. Billionaire Patrick Drahi raises BT stake to 18% The new legislation came into force earlier this year, giving the government powers to scrutinise, impose conditions on, or block acquisitions on national security grounds. BT is in the middle of a transformational programme to build a national broadband fibre network, a strategy crucial both to the company and the government, which says it wants to boost regional growth. Shares in BT fell 4% in morning trading in London. Mr Drahi, who also owns auction house Sotheby's, first began buying BT shares last June. His purchase of just over 12% of the company, worth Â£2.2bn at the time, made him the largest shareholder. He now owns 18% of BT - 12% short of 30% at which point the takeover rules would force him to make an offer for the whole company. Mr Drahi's stake-building in BT sparked rumours about other possible bidders. When news emerged of Mr Drahi's increased stake in December, Altice said it did ""not intend to make an offer for BT"". Under British takeover rules, that barred Mr Drahi from making such a move for six months. Karen Egan, a telecoms analyst at Enders Analysis, says that explains the timing of this probe. ""That was December, and we're now almost in June, so it's no surprise we're seeing this now,"" Ms Egan said. She said that the government was attempting to ""get ahead of the situation"" and send a message to Mr Drahi ""not to assume"" that a bid would be allowed. ""The new bill is designed to protect assets exactly like BT,"" she said. ""The government is quite sensitive over this, primarily on security grounds. It's very unlikely that they'd be happy with Mr Drahi taking over BT.""

Police urged to end US school shooting - witnesses,"People have been laying flowers near the school campus in Uvalde as tributes Police were urged to charge into a deadly school shooting in the US state of Texas by onlookers, witnesses say, with one suggesting he considered doing so himself as he became frustrated. Officials say gunman Salvador Ramos, 18, was inside the school in Uvalde for up to an hour before he was killed. Nineteen children and two adults died, while 17 others were injured. Eyewitness Juan Carranza told the Associated Press that women shouted at officers to ""go in there"". But the 24-year-old, who witnessed the scene at the Robb Elementary School from outside his house, said police did not enter. Javier Cazares, whose daughter was killed in the attack, told the news agency he suggested running in with other onlookers because the police ""weren't doing anything"". Authorities said the gunman locked himself in a classroom which officers then struggled to gain access to. Steven McCraw, the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, told a news conference on Wednesday that the gunman was on site for between 40 minutes and an hour before law enforcement were able to ""contain"" him. US Border Patrol Chief Raul Ortiz, meanwhile, told CNN that dozens of officers responded to the shooting and ""didn't hesitate"". ""They entered that classroom and they took care of the situation as quickly as they possibly could,"" he said. Texas victims: 'The sweetest little boy I've ever known' America's bitter debate that never goes away It has also emerged that the attacker sent messages on social media about the shooting minutes before it happened. Texas Governor Greg Abbott said Ramos had promised to shoot his grandmother in private messages sent 30 minutes before the attack. A later message declared he had done so, and in a final one sent 15 minutes before the shooting, he announced he would target an elementary school. According to CNN, the private messages were sent to a 15-year-old girl in Germany who Ramos had met online. In a statement, Meta, Facebook's parent company, said the ""private one-to-one text messages"" were ""discovered after the terrible tragedy occurred"". It added that it was ""closely co-operating"" with investigators. This video can not be played Watch: Texas governor heckled by rival over gun laws Tuesday's events in Uvalde - an unassuming town some 80 miles (129km) from San Antonio - brought the discussion around gun control once again to the fore, even as members of the small community sought to make sense of the tragedy. Many there expressed divided attitudes about guns. ""As a kid, I remember my uncles teaching me and training me on how to hold a gun,"" Carlos Velasquez, a local resident, told the BBC. ""The juxtaposition of good safety with what just happened is so nuanced. It's not just a clean-cut thought - it's a really sticky situation and sticky conversation to have now,"" he said. Others, however, were shocked that Ramos was able to carry out an attack with an AR-15 style semi-automatic rifle. ""This kid was just 18. You have to be 21 to drink. How?"" asked Sandra Parra, who lives down the street from the school. ""I hope there are changes,"" she said, referring to gun laws in Texas. ""I don't have a gun myself, but if I did, it would be for protection,"" she added. It is legal to buy a gun at 18 in Texas, and according to US media, the attacker bought his soon after his birthday. Described as a loner from a ""fraught home life"", the gunman shot his grandmother before fleeing the scene in a battered truck carrying firearms and copious ammunition. He then drove erratically across town and crashed his car into a ditch near Robb Elementary School. An officer engaged with him, but failed to stop him from entering the school. He then proceeded to shoot 19 children and two teachers dead, before officers converged on the classroom and a border patrol officer who had responded while nearby killed him, according to Mr Abbott. Mr Abbott said there had been no history to suggest the gunman could be a danger apart from the social media messages sent before the killings. Speaking on Wednesday, US President Joe Biden said the idea that a teenager was able to legally purchase weapons that were ""designed and marketed to kill, is just wrong"". ""I'm just sick and tired of what's going on and what continues to go on,"" he said, calling for ""action"" on gun control. His comments followed an incident at Mr Abbott's news conference, where the governor's Democratic challenger for office, Beto O'Rourke, heckled the Republican for not doing enough on gun control. In response, Mr Abbott accused Mr O'Rourke of grandstanding. According to the Texas Politics Project, only 43% of Texans support stricter gun laws. Nationally, the figure is 53% in support, according to a 2021 Pew Research Center poll. As more details of the mass shooting emerged, the Uvalde community grieved. The children killed were aged between seven and 10 years old. Teachers Eva Mireles and Irma Garcia also died in the attack. More than a dozen people were also wounded. Vigils took place for the victims of the shooting, while people have been laying flowers near the school campus as tributes. ""The normality is not here anymore,"" Ms Parra said. ""Uvalde will be known for its mass shooting,"" said Mr Velazquez. ""That's really unfortunate.""

World Bank boss warns of global recession threat,"The head of the World Bank has warned that Russia's invasion of Ukraine could cause a global recession as the price of food, energy and fertiliser jump. David Malpass told a US business event on Wednesday that it is difficult to ""see how we avoid a recession"". He also said that a series of coronavirus lockdowns in China is adding to concerns about a slowdown. His comments are the latest warning over the rising risk that the world economy may be set to contract. ""As we look at the global GDP... it's hard right now to see how we avoid a recession,"" Mr Malpass said, without giving a specific forecast. ""The idea of energy prices doubling is enough to trigger a recession by itself,"" he added. Last month, the World Bank cut its global economic growth forecast for this year by almost a full percentage point, to 3.2%. Recession fears cast shadow over Davos gathering Ukraine war to cause 'worst price shock in 50 years' GDP, or Gross Domestic Product, measures the size of an economy. Gauging its expansion or contraction is one of the most important ways of measuring how well or badly an economy is performing and is closely watched by economists and central banks. It helps businesses to judge when to expand and recruit more workers or invest less and cut their workforces. Governments also use it to guide decisions on everything from tax to spending. It is a key gauge, along with inflation, for central banks when considering whether or not to raise or lower interest rates. Mr Malpass also said that many European countries were still too dependent on Russia for oil and gas. That's even as Western nations push ahead withplans to reduce their dependence on Russian energy. He also told a virtual event organised by the US Chamber of Commerce that moves by Russia to cut gas supplies could cause a ""substantial slowdown"" in the region. He said higher energy prices were already weighing on Germany, which is the biggest economy in Europe and the fourth largest in the world. Developing countries are also being affected by shortages of fertiliser, food and energy, Mr Malpass said. Mr Malpass also raised concerns about lockdowns in some of China's major cities - including the financial, manufacturing and shipping hub of Shanghai - which he said are ""still having ramifications or slowdown impacts on the world"". ""China was already going through some contraction of real estate, so the forecast of China's growth before Russia's invasion had already softened substantially for 2022,"" he said. ""Then the waves of Covid caused lockdowns which further reduced growth expectations for China,"" he added. Also on Wednesday, China's premier Li Keqiang said the world's second largest economy had been hit harder by the latest round of lockdowns than it had been at the start of the pandemic in 2020. He also called for more action by officials to restart factories after lockdowns. ""Progress is not satisfactory,"" Mr Li said. ""Some provinces are reporting that only 30% of businesses have reopenedâ¦ the ratio must be raised to 80% within a short period of time."" Full or partial lockdowns were imposed in dozens of Chinese cities in March and April, including a long shutdown of Shanghai. The measures have led to a sharp slowdown in economic activity across the country. In recent weeks, official figures have shown thatlarge parts of economy have been impacted, from manufacturers to retailers.

'She won't ask me for money for period products',"Further support with the cost of living is urgent as income is failing to cover basic living costs for many people, a charity has warned. Citizens Advice said 46% of its debt clients had a so-called negative budget, up from 36% three years ago. That means they do not have enough money to meet essential living costs. One mother-of-two said her teenage daughter did not want to ask her for money to buy sanitary products. Extra support is expected soon. Citizens Advice debt advisers have called for a return of the Â£20-a-week boost to Universal Credit, but Treasury chief secretary Simon Clarke has ruled that out, describing it as ""a temporary response to the pandemic"" which would not return. Other measures could be outlined within hours, which could include help for vulnerable households. Many people seeking help from Citizens Advice are already in a difficult financial state. Their budgets are in the red, with income failing to cover daily living costs, even before paying bills such as credit card repayments. Their situation has been made worse by prices rising at the fastest rate for 40 years, and particularly surging energy bills. Among them is a mother-of-two, who we are not naming owing to her vulnerability. She is unable to work and has borrowed from family and friends, but has found it tough to budget, and is seeking official relief from her debts - all of which she said was having an impact on her children. ""We are eating sandwiches and things like that because I don't want to use the oven,"" she said. ""We live off the basics with food shopping, but it is not all healthy. ""My daughter does not like to ask me for money. She worries that it is worrying me. ""With sanitary towels, she won't tell me that she needs them. When she needs them she gets them from school. But they are a necessity. It should not be down to the school; they are there only for an emergency."" Money advice supervisor Christopher Whitehead says food vouchers are often needed The people who work at North Tyneside Citizens Advice are used to such stories, where more women than men seek debt and benefits advice, and contact with people aged in their early 20s is rising. Most people in the area have a low income, but it is very mixed, with pockets of deprivation and also of wealth. Even so, in the first three months of this year, there was an 89% rise in clients who needed charitable support compared with a year earlier. In other words, the need for food and fuel vouchers or welfare support almost doubled in a year. Sometimes staff even have to source second hand ovens for families so they can cook the food they are given. 'I'm in work but I need to use a food bank' Cost of living: What are Rishi Sunak's options? Money advice supervisor Christopher Whitehead, 39, first started in debt advice in 2007 as the financial crisis of that time took hold. ""It was about credit card, store card, and catalogue debt back then. Now it is about people not being able to afford the essentials. There are debts on council tax, energy and rent which are day-to-day costs you should be able to meet,"" he said. When somebody has a negative budget, it means they have nothing left, or have to borrow, after paying their living costs. And those costs don't include unsecured debt repayments such as credit cards. On the quayside, just a few hundred yards from the Citizens Advice office, David Thompson is fishing, and is one of those struggling to pay the bills. The 46-year-old has five children and four grandchildren and gets Universal Credit - which he calls ""Universal Crisis"". David Thompson says food, energy and clothing are all costing more ""It is getting worse and worse, but you have just got to make do with what you have got. It is a struggle. You are worrying before you get paid, then when you get paid you worry how far it is going to go,"" he said, ""It is supposed to last a month, but you are skint after a week or two."" As typical household energy bills are rising, and areset to go up again in October, he said that any extra support given by the government was never going to match the rate of price rises at the moment. ""This is one of the worst times. I remember when the shipyards went down, and the miners' strikes. People are more well-off now than the 80s and the 90s, but things are a lot more expensive,"" he said. It is not only those receiving benefits who are struggling with rising prices and potential debts. The rate of people in debt who have a negative budget is rising fastest among those who are not on benefits, Citizens Advice said. Whatever people's circumstances, whether in-work or not, Citizens Advice is urging anyone who is worried they could be facing a spiral of debt to get in touch for help. ""You have to speak out. You can't just struggle,"" said the mother referred to earlier. ""If I hadn't, I would be in a big black hole now."" Advisers are able to do benefit checks and sometimes to find and apply for grants from benevolent funds run by former employers. However, the charity is warning that there are limits to the support it can offer, so further assistance from ministers is vital. Developments such as social tariffs from energy companies would also help, they said. So far, government support has been a mix of broad, general assistance to help everyone, such as council tax rebates, and more targeted policy - such as allowing those on universal credit to take home more of what they earn. The Treasury said it had already put together a Â£22bn package of support for people facing the rising cost of living, and the government is set to outline further help. The government is expected to scrap a plan to give people Â£200 off bills from October which would be repaid over five years. Instead, the BBC understandsthat sum will be increased and possibly doubled, and will not need to be paid back. Additional help for those on the lowest incomes is also expected.

"Family worries ignored, says Arthur and Star review","Star Hobson (L) and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes (R) were both murdered by their parents' partners in separate cases in 2020 Family concerns for Star Hobson and Arthur Labinjo-Hughes were too often ""disregarded and not taken sufficiently seriously"", says a report on how professionals failed to protect them. Arthur, aged 6 from Solihull, and Star, 16 months from Bradford, were murdered by their parents' partners in 2020. Both ""suffered horrific and ultimately fatal abuse"", said Annie Hudson, who chaired the review. Their deaths reflect ""fault lines"" in child protection in England, she added. Arthur and Star's stories are not isolated incidents, the Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panel said. Arthur Labinjo-Hughes: A life cut short by cruelty Star Hobson birthday brings it all back, say family Family angry and frustrated over Star review The ""wider problems"" the report highlights include poor information sharing between professionals and weak decision making. The report urges the government to strengthen the child protection system at a national and local level. Its publication follows Monday's ""once-in-a-generation""Independent Review of Children's Social Carewhich called for a total reset of council-run children's services across England. This video can not be played Watch: We lost hope with social services, say family of murdered toddler Star was loved by the many members of her extended family ""At the moment, each professional who comes into contact with a child holds one piece of the jigsaw of what is happening in a child's life,"" said Ms Hudson. ""Our proposed reforms would bring together experts from social work, police and health into one team so that they can have a better picture of what is happening to a child, listening carefully to relatives' concerns and taking necessary actions to protect children."" As part of the review, the panel interviewed just under 80 professionals in Bradford, Birmingham and Solihull as well as the children's family members, including Star's mother and her mother's partner. The current system is not ""broken"", Ms Hudson said in the report: ""Every day, many thousands of children are protected from harm by conscientious, committed and capable social workers, police officers, health, educational and many other professionals."" However, these multi-agency arrangements ""are not yet fit for purpose everywhere"" and, as a consequence, hundreds of children are seriously harmed, she added. The review highlighted specific failings in each of the two cases. Arthur was murdered in June 2020by his stepmother Emma Tustin at their home in Solihull, West Midlands. His father Thomas Hughes, 29, was found guilty of his son's manslaughter. The report found concerns about bruising, raised by family members, were not always taken seriously and his voice was not always heard. Too many assessments relied on the perspective of his father, now in jail for manslaughter, it added. 'Pivotal' moment to save Arthur missed Thomas Hughes completely let his son down, police said Star was murdered by her mother's girlfriend at her home in West Yorkshire, in September 2020. Star's mother Frankie Smith, 20, wasfound guilty of causing or allowing the youngster's death. The report said concern from a family member was explained away as being malicious and rooted in a dislike of her mother's same-sex relationship - and this view was ""too easily accepted"", says the review. It added that Bradford children's social care was ""in turmoil"" in 2020 and this contributed to ""superficial"" assessments that failed to address the concerns of Star's wider family. Star's great-grandfather, David Fawcett, said the report was ""a lot to take in"" but the family were ""just hoping something will come out of this... We don't want things happening to other children like what happened to Star."" ""If social services had done their job in their first place, I think Star... would still be with us,"" he said. Alicia Szepler, Star's aunt, added: ""If they'd [the authorities] have all just listened to each other and worked together then they might have actually found the truth of what was happening, the bigger picture."" Star's aunt, Alicia Szepler, and great-grandfather David Fawcett, said the last thing they want is for another case similar to Star's The report found child protection work is inherently complex, but the current system does not give professionals the best opportunity ""to get to the truth of what life is like for children"". It also identifies a reliance on quickly pulling together a team from overstretched agencies every time there is a child protection concern, which is ""certainly inefficient and often ineffective"". Its recommendations include: Dedicated child protection teams of police, healthcare staff and social workers to investigate allegations of serious harm to children in every council area A national child protection board to co-ordinate policy Ensuring all child protection assessments include input from all relevant professionals, family members and other significant adults Despite his difficult childhood, Arthur was happy before moving in with his dad and his partner The review was commissioned in December 2021 by Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi. He thanked Star and Arthur's families for their contributions to the report and promised ""a bold implementation plan later this year"". ""We must waste no time learning from the findings of this review - enough is enough,"" he added. Part of the tragedy that lies behind the deaths of Star and Arthur is that many of the failings outlined in this report have been highlighted before in other horrific cases that have made headlines. Reports into the murder of Victoria Climbie and the death of Peter Connelly - Baby P - also pointed to manipulative parents or carers not being challenged enough, wider families not being listened to, poor information-sharing and weak decision-making. It is important to say that responsibility for what happened to all these children lies with the people who abused them. We will also never hear of the many, many children who are protected from harm. Today's report recommends new teams that will bring concentrated expertise into child protection investigations, but for this to work other system-wide problems that are highlighted will need to be tackled. This includes the high turnover of social workers, many burnt-out by the pressures of child protection. Wide-ranging plans for the reform of children's social carehave also been published this week. They aim to shift the focus from crisis intervention to early help for families. And whilst the distressing deaths of children like Star and Arthur may focus our minds on the problems of protecting children right now, past experience suggests it will take long-term investment and commitment at a national level to make sure change really happens. Theresa Patten, chief executive of Bradford District Care Foundation Trust, said: ""We're so deeply sorry for what happened."" She added: ""There were things that were missed in the story of Star's life and death and we have to use those to build our commitment to absolutely not let this sort of thing happen again."" Solihull Council has not commented on the report yet. NSPCC chief executive Sir Peter Wanless said Arthur and Star's deaths ""have left a lasting scar on the nation"". ""Now, we must ensure the memory of Arthur and Star acts as a catalyst for the fundamental changes necessary to prevent further deaths.""

Welsh plant critical to microchip shortage - boss,"The factory produces parts found in all sorts of electronic gadgets A south Wales factory could prove ""critical"" to addressing the global shortage of semiconductors. Welsh company IQE produces wafers for a range of electronic devices around the world. Apple iPhones are understood to be among the devices that use parts made at the plant in Newport. The company's new chief executive, Americo Lemos, said ""time is of the essence"" to expand capacity once funding is in place. He has begun discussions with Welsh and UK governments about funding its expansion, while private backing is also being pursued. Why is there a chip shortage? The humble mineral that transformed the world Chip shortage could last into 2023, says car boss ""Newport is critical. We are building products here that go all around the globe [for] different types of technologies, different types of end-product that really enhance people's lives,"" said Mr Lemos. ""And this is what I'm excited about. As we grow the site here, with the right investment level, we will be able to proliferate our product all around the world."" Silicon semiconductors are used to build cutting edge electronics - from 5G phones to robotics Semiconductors, also known as microchips or chips, allow electricity to flow through devices and are the fundamental components of everything from smart phones to the vast data centres powering the internet. However, supplies have been restricted since the Covid pandemic, with some manufacturers cancelling or delaying products as they wait for the vital components to be produced. IQE's Newport site, based at the former LG factory in Duffryn, has vast unoccupied areas which the company says can be quickly utilised to expand production. Mr Lemos said he hoped government funding would come quickly. ""The semiconductor shortage has impacted a very large part of the economy, like the automotive [sector] and all those areas of our daily lives,"" he said. ""Therefore, the cost of not having those products is much higher than the investment needed to make it happen."" The Welsh government welcomed IQE's plans to expand, adding: ""There needs to be a clear and coherent approach to the semiconductor industry in the UK, this will need governments to work together and with the sector."" IQE boss America Lemos is ""excited"" for the future of the company in south Wales Newport is home to several companies that are collectively known as the semiconductor cluster. IQE, established in the 1980s, produces a type of epitaxy wafer in Newport which is a vital component of compound semiconductors.

Government set to U-turn on windfall tax,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak says eight million households will get Â£1,200 in support, when combining measures announced on Thursday and before The government has U-turned on its opposition to a windfall tax on oil and gas firms, announcing it will introduce a levy to help tackle rising bills. Ministers had rejected the idea - put forward by opposition parties - that would see a one-off charge imposed on the company's record profits. But Chancellor Rishi Sunak said his levy would ""tax extraordinary profits fairly and incentivise investments"". Labour's Rachel Reeves said Mr Sunak had ""finally come to his senses"". The chancellor said new tax would raise Â£5bn over the course of the next year, allowing the government to ""help families with the cost of living"", while avoiding ""having to increase our debt burden further"". He added: ""There is nothing noble in burdening future generations with ever more debt today because politicians of the day were too weak to make the tough decisions."" LIVE: Sunak unveils more cost of living help How would a windfall tax on energy firms work? Typical energy bill set to rise by Â£800 a year The new tax will help funda Â£15bn package from the government, which includes a Â£650 one-off payment for eight million low income households, and a change to the Â£200 loan scheme for energy bills for all homes in the autumn - increasing it to Â£400 without the need to pay it back. But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokeswoman Christine Jardine said the measures were ""too little, too late"". The plans received a mixed reaction from the Conservative backbenchers, with some calling it ""tripe"" and others saying it did not go far enough. The government faced accusations that it had timed the announcement to distract fromthe release of the Sue Gray reportinto lockdown-breaking parties in Downing Street during the pandemic. But the claims were denied by No 10. This video can not be played Rachel Reeves says the Conservative windfall tax is a ""policy that dare not speak its name"". Households across the country have faced soaring costs in recent months as the prices of food, fuel and energy have all rocketed, with inflation hitting a 40-year high. The government has been under growing pressure to act, especially afterenergy regulator Ofgem warned of an additional rise to bills of Â£800 in the autumn. The Liberal Democrats first put forward the idea of a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas companies - which have peaked as the economy restarted after the pandemic - in November, with Labour outlining its own version in January. The SNP has also called for such a measure. The parties said the money raised could go towards helping those households hardest hit by the cost of living increases. Initially, the idea was rejected by ministers, including Boris Johnson, who warned it could ""deter"" investment. But both Mr Johnson and Mr Sunak subsequently softened their stance, and now the policy U-turn has been confirmed. Making a statement in the Commons, the chancellor said the inflation faced by the UK was causing ""acute distress for the people of this country"" and he knew people were worried. But, Mr Sunak added: ""This government will never stop trying to help people, to fix problems where we can, to do what is right - as we did during the pandemic."" He confirmed the government would introduce a ""temporary targeted energy profits levy"" charged at a rate of 25% on profits of oil and gas companies to fund ""significant support for the British people"". However, he said his ""sensible middle ground"" plan included a new investment allowance, so ""for every pound a company invests they will get back 90% in tax relief - the more the company invests the less tax they will pay"". Mr Sunak said: ""We should not be ideological about this, we should be pragmatic. ""It is possible to both tax extraordinary profits fairly and incentivise investments."" The chancellor said the tax would then be removed when energy prices returned to normal levels. Shadow chancellor Ms Reeves said the government had been ""dragged kicking and screaming"" to its new policy position. She added: ""The chancellor has finally come to his senses, U-turned, and adopted Labour's plan for a windfall tax on oil and gas producer profits to lower bills."" But Ms Reeves claimed the government ""still have no long term plan to grow our economy and pull us out of the mess they've got us into"". What does this change of tack signal? The cabinet was split on whether to bring in a windfall tax Analysis by David Wallace Lockhart, BBC political correspondent Ministers have been facing calls to do more to help with the cost of living for quite some time. So why today? As recently as the weekend, Downing Street sources were indicating there would be no imminent announcement on windfall taxes. And it was only a couple of weekends ago Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng called it a ""bad idea"". So why the change of heart? Well, ministers have been clear for some time that more help is on the way. And they did get a clearer idea of future energy prices this week. But - to be more cynical - the government had a particularly uncomfortable day on Wednesday with the publication of the Sue Gray report into Downing Street gatherings. Boris Johnson has made it clear that he's desperate to stop talking about parties. An announcement of billions of pounds of assistance for households certainly helps to move the agenda on. Downing Street deny that the timing of this has anything to do with Partygate. But plenty of opposition MPs won't buy that argument. The package of measures announced by Mr Sunak was attacked by many of his opponents for not going far enough. Lib Dem leader Sir Ed Davey criticised the government for failing to cut taxes for workers, pointing to the new health and social care levy introduced in April amid the cost of living crisis. He tweeted: ""Sunak's like a thief who steals your car and then wants you to be grateful when he returns the steering wheel."" The SNP's Kirsty Blackman said the government had ""listened to a certain extent"", but had ""failed"" on a number of measures, especially her party's call to uprate benefits in line with inflation. She told the BBC the one-off payment was ""kicking the can down the road"" and those hit hardest could face more difficulties in the future. When it came to Mr Sunak's own benches, Conservatives appeared split on both the policies and how to fund them. Richard Drax accused the chancellor of ""throwing red meat to the socialists by raising taxes on businesses"", adding a windfall tax was ""not the Conservative way"" of doing things. Another backbench Tory, Craig Mackinlay, said he was ""appalled that a Conservative chancellor could come up with this tripe"", calling the tax ""outrageous"" and ""inherently wrong"". Former party leader Sir Iain Duncan Smith, however, called the chancellor's statement ""a good start and welcome"", but added: ""More needs to be done. ""Our response to this economic crisis should have three goals at its centre: adequate financial support for the poorest, helping those who are able into work, and reducing the burden of taxation.""

How would a windfall tax work?,"The windfall tax on oil and gas companies will increase in November, and will remain in place until March 2030. The levy was introduced as a response to soaring energy company profits, and was designed to help fund a scheme to limit household gas and electricity bills. However, firms in the sector have warned that the increase will hit jobs and investment. A windfall tax is a levy imposed on companies that have benefited from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Global oil and gas prices started to rise in late 2020 as demand increased with the lifting of Covid restrictions, but they soared in 2022 following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The increase in prices led to bumper profits for energy companies, leading to calls for a windfall tax. The Energy Profits Levy - the formal name for the windfall tax -was introduced in May 2022 by the then Chancellor, Rishi Sunak,external. The government said the money raised would fund support for households facing rising energy bills. The levy applies to profits made from extracting UK oil and gas. It was initially set at 25% and was due to expire at the end of 2025. In January 2023 the then Chancellor Jeremy Hunt increased the levy to 35%. In the spring 2024 Budget,Hunt announced it would remain in place until March 2029because the continuing war in Ukraine was extending energy firms' windfall profits. The new Labour government saidit would increase the levy to 38% on 1 November,external. The tax will remain in place until 31 March 2030, unless - as originallyset out by the previous government- oil and gas prices drop below a certain level for six months. A separate levy was also brought in on ""extraordinary returns"" from low-carbon electricity generating firms in the UK. Larger operators started payingthe Electricity Generator Levy,externalon 1 January 2023. It was hoped this would raise about Â£14bn over six years. Among the UK energy giants, BP reported a record profit of $27.7bn in 2022. While this fell to$13.8bn in 2023, it was still the firm's second highest annual profit in a decade. Shell's profits of $39.9bn in 2022 were the highest in its 115-year history. Its 2023profits were $28.2bn. BP says its UK businesses account for less than 10% of global profits, while Shell makes about 5% of its revenue in the UK. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea were already taxed differently before the levy was introduced In the financial year 2022-2023, the first year of its operation,the levy raised Â£2.6bn,external. In the following 12-month periodit raised Â£3.6bn,external. BP said its North Sea business paid $2.2bn in UK tax for its North Sea operations in 2022, of which $700m was due to the levy. In 2023 it paid $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn), including $720m under the levy. Shell said it paid Â£178m in UK windfall tax for 2022. In 2023, it paid Â£1.1bn in overall tax in the UK, Â£240m of which was a result of the levy. Oil and gas firms operating in the North Sea are taxed differently to other companies. They pay 30% corporation tax on their profits and a supplementary 10% rate on top of that. In contrast, other firms with profits over Â£250,000 a year pay 25% corporation tax. When the windfall tax is added, it means the overall tax rate faced by oil and gas companies operating in the UK is 75%, rising to 78% in November. However, oil and gas firms have been able to reduce the amount of UK tax they pay by factoring in losses or spending on things like decommissioning North Sea oil platforms. BP,externalandShell,externalboth received more money back from the UK government than they paid in tax every year from 2015 to 2020 (except Shell in 2017). Energy firms have also been able to reduce the amount of windfall tax they pay through certain investment allowances. However, the government has said it will remove some of these allowances from 1 November. Further details on the changes to the windfall levy will be set out in the Budget on 30 October. What might be in the Budget? The industry body Offshore Energies UK (OEUK) said the proposed changes to the windfall taxwill sharply reduce investment in the sector, putting thousands of jobs at risk. OEUK says the expected tax paid by oil and gas producers would ""increase in the very short term"" by Â£2bn, and would later result in a Â£12bn loss. In August, 42 companies wrote to the government toexpress their ""grave concern"" over the changes. The Treasury said the government was committed to a ""constructive dialogue"" with the oil and gas industry about the levy. But it also said it wanted North Sea oil and gas producers ""to contribute their fair share towards our energy transition"" away from fossil fuels. Where does the UK get its energy from?

Chancellor setting out measures to help with energy bills,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out measures to address the rising cost of living, as the government seeks to draw a line under Partygate One-off payments of different amounts will be given to the most vulnerable - the elderly, those with disabilities, and those with the lowest incomes All households will receive a Â£400 discount on energy bills Eight million of the lowest income families will also get a one-off payment of Â£650, Sunak says He confirms a temporary windfall tax on oil and gas giants to fund the payments - a move called for by the Lib Dems and Labour There will be a one-off disability cost of living payment of Â£150, and pensioners will get Â£300 The UK's energy regulator Ofgem says typical household energy bills are set to rise by Â£800 in October, to Â£2,800 a year Edited by Chris Giles We're about to wrap up our live coverage.

Here are the key points from Chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement of a package of measures intended to ease the impact of the rising cost of living: The majority of the measures announced by the chancellor today will apply to people across the UK. But there are a few exceptions: An emotional Lisa Bradley welcomes the extra help, as do Raymond Graves, left, and Lee Ingham At the weekly job club in Handforth, Cheshire, the news of government help is met with much emotion. Lisa Bradley
breaks down in tears. âItâs such a massive relief,â she says. The mum of two grown-up children has been struggling for
months and losing sleep over money. She's been turning off appliances, including the fire alarm, to save pennies, because her meter swallows up what used to last her weeks. Lee feels the government's package could not have come at a better time. âThereâs no extra in the pot, youâre scratching the barrel,â he says. Raymond is not eligible for more than the Â£400 payment all
households will receive but he doesn't mind. âIâm pleased theyâre not just doing a
blanket Â£500 on everybody, theyâre actually targeting  those who need it and
it is related to energy bills as well, I think thatâs good.â âIâll still need to scrimp and save,â Lisa adds. âEven
though itâs a fantastic amount Iâm so aware how quickly it can slip through
your fingers again.â BBC Political Editor Chris Mason has been speaking to Chancellor Rishi Sunak about his plans to charge a windfall tax on oil and gas giants. Sunak says the new energy profits levy is a ""very specific"" tax which contains ""generous"" investment incentives for energy firms. Challenged as to why he's reluctant to use the phrase windfall tax, he says ""people can call it what they want"", adding other similar proposals for a one-off tax are ""blunt instruments"". Watch their exchange below. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak on why he doesn't use windfall tax phrase Millions of households will receive discounts on their energy bills The package of government support aimed at tackling spiralling living costs is going down well with consumer experts. The move is a ""life raft for the millions of people struggling to keep their heads above water"" saysCitizens Advice. And the announcements are ""more generous than expected""Martin Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website,says on Twitter,external. But, as we've been reporting, some campaigners want the government to take more action. Debt charityStepChangesays it's important that supporting a wide number of households does not dilute the assistance for those in greatest need. And the chancellor is ""kidding himself"" if he thinks the measures can prevent people suffering long-term financial setbacks, theChild Poverty Action Groupsays. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The energy price cap in England, Wales and Scotland is
actually a cap on the price of each unit of energy we use, and the standing
charge. Regulator Ofgem then calculates what that means for a
household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. Earlier this week, its boss, Jonathan Brearley, said the
regulatorâs current estimate for that typical household bill in October would
be Â£2,800 a year â a rise of Â£800 compared to now. If you use a comparatively high level of energy in your home
then you will pay more than that âtypicalâ bill; if you use less, then you will
pay less. After the chancellor was told of the size of the financial
hole these bills could create, he could finalise the measures that might help
people get out of it. Andrew PlantBBC Points West reporter, in Bristol After the chancellorâs
announcement of extra financial help I spoke to Colette Hedges, who is
partially sighted and has cerebral palsy. That means she receives a disability living allowance. She said she is struggling to pay her energy bills, which have reached Â£105 for electricity and Â£225 for gas, for a three-month period. Collette says: ""Iâm paying it in dribs and drabs, not all at once. Itâs a lot
of money."" Reacting to the extra Â£150 one-off payment for people living with a
disability, she adds: ""Thatâs great. Thatâs really good. I keep trying to
stay cheerful. That should really help."" The moveto impose a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas firmsis ""a backward step"" according to Offshore Energies UK, which represents the industry. Chief executive Deirdre Michie says the new taxes will ""drive away investors and so reduce UK energy production"". ""That
means less oil, less gas, and less renewables. It also makes it much harder for
the UK to reach net zero by 2050,"" she argues. Meanwhile, a spokesman for oil giant Shell, says the company has ""consistently emphasised the importance of a stable environment for long-term investment"". However, he notes that the proposal for tax relief on investment in the UK ""is a critical principle in the new levy"". Torsten Bell from the Resolution Foundation think tank has analysed who is going to benefit the most from the planned approach, as well as those who will see the least support sent their way. He says the biggest winners are ""poorer pensioner households with someone with a disability"", as they will receive multiple points of help from the package. However, he also notes that support for families with children will be more limited. Bell explains this is because, as they spend more on energy, but the flat rate of support being offered will do less to cut their bills as a proportion. He says there are still ""things to quibble with"" but overall describes the package as ""big and very welcome indeed"". At the moment, energy providers are not generally trying to tempt new customers with cheap offers, although a few firms, including British Gas and EDF, are offering new fixed price deals to some existing customers, which may be worth considering. People who are already on fixed deals are advised to stay put. Otherwise, households are being encouraged to save money by improving energy efficiency. The Energy Saving Trust saysseveral small changes,externalcould help many people off-set some of the recent rises in energy costs. You can read more about the support available to help with energy bills here. Digital companies will be taxed âmore
fairlyâ, the chancellor says, after being asked in the Commons why big firms like Amazon were not included in the
scope of his new windfall tax. The one-off levy targets the profits of companies â like fuel firms â that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for. SNP MP Patricia Gibson points out that the likes of Amazon made âbillionsâ during the pandemic. Rishi Sunak says the government worked to agree a
""new international taxation agreement"" for such firms â which will come into effect ""over the coming months and years"". Andrew PlantBBC Points West, in Bristol Iâve been speaking to people on East Street in the
Bedminster area of Bristol today to see what they make of the government's new plan. Alan Morgan is a pensioner who doesnât think
the money announced by the chancellor will be enough. ""I heard mention of Â£400, but they reckon the bill's going to go up by another Â£800. So Â£400 is not going to
cut it,"" he says. In order to pay his rising food and energy bills, he explains something
will have to give, adding: ""My car will probably have to go so that I can afford the
food and the energy."" Alan says heâs even cut back on meeting friends outside. He says he comes to this cafÃ© because itâs the ""only place I can afford to buy a
coffee"". One of the main announcements earlier was that all UK households will get a grant which will reduce energy bills by Â£400 from October. Previously, the chancellor had said Â£200 would be knocked off everyone's energy bills, but would have to be paid back in instalments over five years. Now, the discount has been doubled to Â£400 and he has cancelled the requirement to repay. In other words, from October, everyone's energy bill will be reduced by Â£400. In technical terms. it will apply directly for households in England, Scotland, and Wales. The equivalent funds should be given to Northern Ireland to distribute, although the way to do this has yet to be worked out, while the government is not functioning. You can read more about the other support that's been announced here. Reality Check The chancellor told MPs: In total the measures Iâve announced today provide support worth Â£15bn â combined with the plans weâve already announced that means we are supporting families with the cost of living with Â£37bn  There are some questions about the Â£22bn valuation of the
package announced previously. For example, the Â£22bn included raising the point at which
people have to start paying National Insurance which is a big tax cut, but not
the amount taken away through other tax measures. The Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that freezing
income tax thresholds costs households about Â£3bn while the increase in the
rate of National Insurance for employees and the self-employed costs them about
Â£7bn, so suggests that at least Â£10bn should have been taken off the figure. The
Â£22bn figure (and thus the Â£37bn figure) also includes the freeze on alcohol
duty, which the government says will save people Â£3bn over the next five years. A windfall tax was prompted by big profits for fuel companies The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has welcomed the government's efforts to tackle the cost-of-living issue - but it's expressed concern about the chancellor's new windfall tax. Rain Newton-Smith said Rishi Sunak's package of help for households was the right thing to do. But she added that the ""open-ended nature"" of the tax on fuel company profits could prove damaging to investment - which was necessary for energy security as well as reducing carbon emissions to tackle climate change. The move ""sends the wrong signal to the whole sector, against a backdrop of rising business taxation elsewhere,"" the CBI's chief economist said. The move follows huge profit increases for firms including Shell A
windfall tax is a one-off levy targeting firms that have benefited from
something they werenât responsible for. At
the moment, that means fuel companies. BP and Shell have both reported big
increases in profits as oil and gas prices surge around the world â partly driven
by Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Ministers had previously rejected the idea of such a tax, which Labour,
Liberal Democrats and the SNP were calling for. The chancellor described the new tax as a 25% Energy Profits
Levy. It could raise around Â£5bn. Crucially, firms will not be allowed to reduce their tax
liability by factoring in money spent on tasks like decommissioning North Sea
oil platforms â something thatâs helped them lower tax bills previously. Want to know more? Read our explainer here. The support announced by the chancellor includes a mix of universal payments and other help targeted at specific groups. Here's a quick summary of what has been announced -you can read about the measures in more detail here. A nurse from Somerset has described her struggle to make ends meet in the run up to payday. Lucy told Radio 5 Live she went to fill her car to get to work this morning, but had just Â£5 left to do so and won't get paid until tomorrow. She says: I was on the red light and that Â£5 did not even take me out of the red light.  I'm just hoping that I make it to work - I'm not sure how I'm going to get back  Meanwhile, Justine from Surrey says she in a similar position of living from pay cheque to pay cheque, describing the cost of filling a car currently as ""extortionate"". She says: We are turning off the hot water when we are not using it and everyone is using their towel a few extra times to reduce on the laundry.  I am also selling a few things out of my wardrobe as we are not going out so often. We are making lots and lots of little cutbacks in order to make the pennies last until the end of the month.

Some more now on Ukraine's request that the US start supplying it with powerful long-range weapon systems to enhance its military capabilities against Russia. On Friday a Pentagon spokesperson announced that ""decisions...haven't been made yet"" but the US is ""mindful"" of the request. The comment comes after CNN published a report that the US was preparing to send Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine. In the past Washington officials had denied the request fearing such long-range weapons could be used to attack targets inside Russia and end up widening and prolonging the conflict. A presenter on Russian state TV responded to the report by claiming the US would be crossing a red line and deliberately provoking Russia if it supplied Ukraine with the weapons. The evacuees left the city in an armoured vehicle Ukraine's police have taken to safety 31 residents - including 13 children - of Ukraine's eastern city of Lysychansk, in what the top regional official describes as one of the most ""difficult evacuations"" in recent days. Luhansk regional head Serhiy Haidai says the officers were initially sent to evacuate seven people, who had previously agreed to leave but - after ""a few hours of persuasion"" - ended up picking up 31 residents. Haidai also says that one vehicle that delivered humanitarian aid to Lysychansk was damaged because of the fighting in the area. Russian forces have been slowly advancing on the twin cities of Lysychansk and Severodonetsk. Local officials say two-thirds of Severodonetsk is now surrounded. Ukraine is hugely significant for the Russian Orthodox Church, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there The Ukrainian Orthodox Church has declared its ""full autonomy and independence"" from the under Moscow Patriarchate (UOC-MP), condemning the stance Russian religious leaders have taken on the war in Ukraine. ""We disagree with the position of Patriarch Kirill of Moscow,"" the UOC-MP said in a statement after a council meeting in Kyiv, referring to the head of the Russian Orthodox Church (ROC). Kirill has openly voiced support for Russian President Vladimir Putin's invasion of Ukraine launched on 24 February. It is the second schism in Ukraine in recent years, with part of the Ukrainian Orthodox Church breaking away from Moscow in 2019. The Orthodox Church of Ukraine (OCU) was then granted a degree of independence, or the tomos, by the Ecumenical Patriarchate of Constantinople. Talks on the unification of the Ukrainian Orthodoxy between the UOC-MP and the OCU have so far brought no breakthrough. Ukraine is hugely significant for the ROC, with many parishes and some of its most important monasteries located there.  Russian forces will not capture Luhansk in the coming days but Ukraine may have to evacuate some of its forces there for their own protection, the region's governor has saidon Telegram,external. ""It is possible that in order not to be surrounded we will have to retreat,"" Serhiy Haidai wrote. In an evening military report he also described how dangerous everyday life was in the Ukrainian-controlled areas of Luhansk. Remaining civilians ""are constantly in shelters, it is almost impossible to go outside due to the density of shelling,"" he said. Haidai added that Russian forces have been continuing to target the city of Severodonetsk, where fighting has broken out on the outskirts of the city. Earlier we reported that the US is preparing to offer Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS) to Ukraine, according to reports in US media. Last Saturday Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky repeated his request for Western and Nato countries to supply the weaponry. ""I can honestly say our expectations are very high and we have been waiting a long time ... and I hope for a positive response that will allow us to acquire MLRS weapons,"" he said during a press conference in Kyiv. Thanks to this system, ""Ukraine will be able to take steps to liberate its country,"" he added. The powerful M270 system can launch rockets further than any weapons Ukraine currently possesses. What weapons has the US given to Ukraine? Jonathan BealeBBC defence correspondent Fire crews deal with a fire after shelling at Bakhmut in the Donbas region There is no doubt Ukraine is suffering setbacks in eastern Ukraine. The assessments from President Zelensky sound increasingly bleak. He says Russia is reducing cities to ashes. Earlier this week he said between 50 and 100 Ukrainians were losing their lives every day in the Donbas. Ukraine is certainly outnumbered and outgunned â with relentless Russian artillery bombardments being used to brutal effect over a much smaller area than during the first phase of the war. One Ukrainian official estimated that in some areas of Donbas their forces are outnumbered seven to one. Today UK PM Boris Johnson acknowledged that Russia was making slow but palpable progress in the region. He called for more military support â including providing Ukraine with long range rocket launchers â which the US is now considering too. There has been a lag between some Western promises of weapons and the time it takes to deliver them and to train Ukrainian forces. They could make a difference. But Russia still has much larger stockpiles of artillery ammunition. A senior official of one Nato country said it was âcriminalâ that the West had more limited stocks. Ukraine and Belarus last met in a qualifying game for Euro 2016 - Ukraine won 3-1 in Lviv Teams from Ukraine and Belarus will be kept apart in international football tournaments and European club competitions until further notice, governing body Uefa says. Uefa suspended Russia - and Russian clubs - from its tournaments
following the invasion of Ukraine, but has allowed Belarus to continue competing
despite that country's support of the invasion. Belarus have already been ordered to play home matches behind closed doors on
neutral territory, and now Uefa says it will not permit any meetings between
teams from Belarus and Ukraine to ensure the safety and security of everyone
involved. The news comes the week beforeUkraine's footballers bid to qualify for the World Cup- they play Scotland next Wednesday in a match delayed by the war, with the winners then playing Wales four days later for a spot in the finals in Qatar. Action against sportspeople and teams from Russia and Belarus has been a bone of contention in recent months. The International Olympic Committee's executive board recommended in February that athletes and teams from the two nations should not
be allowed to take part in international competitions. But international tennis ruling bodies have saidno ranking points will be awarded at Wimbledon this yearafter championship organisers said they would exclude Russian and Belarussian players. The French Open, currently taking place, does feature stars from the two countries. More now on thisnews we brought you earlier. Shaun Pinner, 48, and another Brit, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, were captured in April while defending Ukraine's south-eastern port of Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands. In footage later shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, has lived in Ukraine since 2018. Also in April, Russia released a video of a man who it said he was called Andrew Hill and that he had surrendered to Russian troops. The man, who was seen wearing a military camouflage uniform, said he was from Plymouth, and had children and a partner. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Moscow to treat captured British fighters ""humanely and compassionately"". The Moroccan national was shown in Russian custody by state-run media in April, calling himself Sadun Brahim. He is believed to have studied in Kyiv before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war must be protected ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine: On the ground  Elsewhere  Two UK citizens and a Moroccan, who fought on the Ukrainian side in the country's eastern Donbas region, may face the death penalty, Russian-backed rebels are quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Viktor Gavrilov, an official at the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic's (DNR) prosecutor general's office,  says a criminal investigation ""has been completed"" and - taking into account that a war is going on - the accused may be given capital punishment. Gavrilov identified the two captured Brits as Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill, while the Moroccan national was named as Sadun Brahim. The DNR reportedly introduced the death penalty on the territory seized from Ukraine in 2014. In a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says the pair discussed American military support for Kyiv. Kuleba says ""heavy weapons"" are top of Ukraine's agenda and wrote that ""more are coming our way"" following the call. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said. The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause were sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine. He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with
Ukraine. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg holds up Sweden and Finland's membership applications Talks aimed at overcoming Turkey's objections to Sweden and Finland joining Nato have broken up with no sign of progress. A senior Turkish official said talks between the countries made little headway and told Reuters news agency ""it is not an easy process"". Negotiations will continue but no date has been set for them, the source added. All 30 Nato members, including Turkey, need to approve the applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western security alliance. But Turkey has challenged both after accusing the two countries of harbouring individuals linked to Kurdish terrorists, a claim denied by Sweden and Finland. Some analysts view Turkey's stance as an attempt to win concessions from other Nato members. A Ukrainian official has been giving more details about the fighting in the city of Severodonetsk. The head of the Severodonetsk district administration, Roman Vlasenko, told the BBC's World At One programme that Ukrainian forces needed more heavy weaponry to drive the Russians out of the city. He said Russian forces did not have a numerical advantage but had more heavy weapons. ""Arms are reaching the front in many areas of Luhansk and
Donetsk regions,"" Vlasenko said. ""But for the counter-offensive to be quick and effective we
need more of them."" He said Russian forces were in the suburbs and trying to take the city from three sides, but had been repulsed from central areas twice in the last three days. This video can not be played District head Roman Vlasenko says troops need more weapons or Russia will overpower them. Russia requires substantial financial resources in order to continue supporting both its economy and its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, the country's finance minister says. ""Money for a special operation"" means ""huge resources"" are needed, Anton Siluanov says at a university event. Moscow officials insist on referring to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" He adds the Russian government will be spending 8 trillion roubles (Â£95.8bn) in the form of an economic stimulus package this year. ""Huge funds. We need these resources to support the economy, support our citizens."" The Russian economy has fared poorly in the last few months afterbeing hammered by Western sanctions, with some forecasts projecting its GDP to shrink by between 8.5% and 15% this year. Up to 90% of the city has been damaged by shelling Russian forces have taken over two-thirds of the perimeter of the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the governor of Luhansk region says. But Serhiy Haidai says the city is not completely surrounded, denying reports by officials from the pro-Moscow self-declared Luhansk People's Republic that Ukrainian forces are cut off there. Severodonetsk is the most easterly major population centre in the Donbas still controlled by Ukraine. Earlier we reported that 60% of the city's housing stock is completely destroyed and up to 90% of buildings are damaged. At least 1,500 people have died there since the invasion began in February. Russia appears to have gained control of most of Lyman in Donetsk region - one of several key locations in eastern Ukraine under intense bombardment. Moscow says its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia now controls more than 90% of Luhansk and has made significant advances in Donetsk since its invasion on 24 February. See the latest maps and charts here Â© 2025 BBC.

Shaun Pinner, 48, and another Brit, 28-year-old Aiden Aslin, were captured in April while defending Ukraine's south-eastern port of Mariupol, which is now in Russian hands. In footage later shown on Russian state TV, both appeared to have facial bruising, prompting their families to call for the Geneva Convention to be respected. Mr Pinner, originally from Bedfordshire, has lived in Ukraine since 2018. Also in April, Russia released a video of a man who it said he was called Andrew Hill and that he had surrendered to Russian troops. The man, who was seen wearing a military camouflage uniform, said he was from Plymouth, and had children and a partner. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has urged Moscow to treat captured British fighters ""humanely and compassionately"". The Moroccan national was shown in Russian custody by state-run media in April, calling himself Sadun Brahim. He is believed to have studied in Kyiv before Russia invaded Ukraine on 24 February. The Geneva Convention states that prisoners of war must be protected ""against acts of violence or intimidation and against insults and public curiosity"". If you're just joining us, here are the latest developments from Ukraine: On the ground  Elsewhere  Two UK citizens and a Moroccan, who fought on the Ukrainian side in the country's eastern Donbas region, may face the death penalty, Russian-backed rebels are quoted as saying by Russia's Interfax news agency. Viktor Gavrilov, an official at the self-proclaimed Donetsk People's Republic's (DNR) prosecutor general's office,  says a criminal investigation ""has been completed"" and - taking into account that a war is going on - the accused may be given capital punishment. Gavrilov identified the two captured Brits as Shaun Pinner and Andrew Hill, while the Moroccan national was named as Sadun Brahim. The DNR reportedly introduced the death penalty on the territory seized from Ukraine in 2014. In a call with US Secretary of State Antony Blinken on Friday, Ukraine's foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba says the pair discussed American military support for Kyiv. Kuleba says ""heavy weapons"" are top of Ukraine's agenda and wrote that ""more are coming our way"" following the call. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Russia's President Vladimir Putin accused Ukraine of ""sabotaging"" peace talks with Russia, the Kremlin has said. The comments were apparently made during a 45-minute phone call between the Russian leader and the Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. According to Moscow's readout of the call, Putin denied that his country's blockade of Ukrainian ports is to blame for disruption to global food supplies, suggesting the real cause were sanctions imposed by the United States and the European Union. Austria's Chancellor said the point of the call, described as ""very intense, very serious"", was to establish if potential humanitarian solutions can be found in Ukraine. He also added Putin said he was ready to discuss a prisoner swap with
Ukraine. Nato chief Jens Stoltenberg holds up Sweden and Finland's membership applications Talks aimed at overcoming Turkey's objections to Sweden and Finland joining Nato have broken up with no sign of progress. A senior Turkish official said talks between the countries made little headway and told Reuters news agency ""it is not an easy process"". Negotiations will continue but no date has been set for them, the source added. All 30 Nato members, including Turkey, need to approve the applications from Sweden and Finland to join the Western security alliance. But Turkey has challenged both after accusing the two countries of harbouring individuals linked to Kurdish terrorists, a claim denied by Sweden and Finland. Some analysts view Turkey's stance as an attempt to win concessions from other Nato members. A Ukrainian official has been giving more details about the fighting in the city of Severodonetsk. The head of the Severodonetsk district administration, Roman Vlasenko, told the BBC's World At One programme that Ukrainian forces needed more heavy weaponry to drive the Russians out of the city. He said Russian forces did not have a numerical advantage but had more heavy weapons. ""Arms are reaching the front in many areas of Luhansk and
Donetsk regions,"" Vlasenko said. ""But for the counter-offensive to be quick and effective we
need more of them."" He said Russian forces were in the suburbs and trying to take the city from three sides, but had been repulsed from central areas twice in the last three days. This video can not be played District head Roman Vlasenko says troops need more weapons or Russia will overpower them. Russia requires substantial financial resources in order to continue supporting both its economy and its ""special operation"" in Ukraine, the country's finance minister says. ""Money for a special operation"" means ""huge resources"" are needed, Anton Siluanov says at a university event. Moscow officials insist on referring to the invasion of Ukraine as a ""special military operation."" He adds the Russian government will be spending 8 trillion roubles (Â£95.8bn) in the form of an economic stimulus package this year. ""Huge funds. We need these resources to support the economy, support our citizens."" The Russian economy has fared poorly in the last few months afterbeing hammered by Western sanctions, with some forecasts projecting its GDP to shrink by between 8.5% and 15% this year. Up to 90% of the city has been damaged by shelling Russian forces have taken over two-thirds of the perimeter of the front-line city of Severodonetsk, the governor of Luhansk region says. But Serhiy Haidai says the city is not completely surrounded, denying reports by officials from the pro-Moscow self-declared Luhansk People's Republic that Ukrainian forces are cut off there. Severodonetsk is the most easterly major population centre in the Donbas still controlled by Ukraine. Earlier we reported that 60% of the city's housing stock is completely destroyed and up to 90% of buildings are damaged. At least 1,500 people have died there since the invasion began in February. Russia appears to have gained control of most of Lyman in Donetsk region - one of several key locations in eastern Ukraine under intense bombardment. Moscow says its forces are fighting for the ""complete liberation"" of the Donbas, which broadly refers to Ukraine's eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk, where Russian-backed separatists held significant territory before the invasion. Russia now controls more than 90% of Luhansk and has made significant advances in Donetsk since its invasion on 24 February. See the latest maps and charts here Â© 2025 BBC.

Stormont recalled amid row over Brexit deal,"Michelle O'Neill, with Finance Minister Conor Murphy, says voters expect members in the chamber Northern Ireland's Assembly will meet on Monday after a successful petition to recall members back to Stormont. The Democratic Unionist Party has blocked the establishment of the assemblysince Sinn FÃ©in emerged as the largest party in this month's election. The DUP has refused to support the election of a new speaker or first and deputy first minister until there is ""action"" on the NI Protocol. It comes as a US delegation is in Belfast meeting the five main parties. The delegation's leader Congressman Richard Neal had been criticised for sayingthe protocol dispute was ""manufactured"", which the DUP said was ""one-sided"". However, the DUP leader Jeffrey Donaldson said the US politicians had shown ""a greater understanding of unionist concerns"" in a meeting with him on Thursday. A simple guide to the Brexit border problem Claims about Northern Ireland's Brexit fact-checked ""If their public response echoes what they said to us in the meeting, then some progress will have been made,"" he added. Mr Neal said the meeting went ""pretty well"" with the DUP leader. ""The conversations we had probably 25 years ago were considerably more strenuous than the one we had today,"" he said. He said the argument of the US delegation was ""negotiate a solution to a satisfactory outcome"". Unionist politicians have been protesting against the protocol, which was part ofthe UK government's Brexit deal with the EU. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson says US politicians showed an understanding of unionist concerns, including that the protocol undermined Northern Ireland's position in the UK Designed to ensure free trade could continue across Ireland's land border post-Brexit, it has also resulted in additional checks being placed on some goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Sir Jeffrey has previously described this as undermining Northern Ireland's position in the UK. For unionists this US fact finding mission will be remembered for two words, manufactured and planters. Both caused offence when used by Congressman Neal to describe the protocol row and unionists living in Northern Ireland. He may have rowed back from the remarks behind closed doors but there was no sense of a climbdown when Congressman Neal appeared in front of the cameras. ""No harm intended"" was as close as he came. But for the other Stormont parties, the DUP's outrage at Congressman Neal was manufactured to deflect from the party's Executive boycott. The US visitors may not have found too many new facts about the protocol but they did discover where all the pressure points are. The Stormont recall petition was proposed by Sinn FÃ©in on Wednesday in a bid to see a new speaker elected. That election, which required cross-community support, is the first act that must happen after an election before the assembly can carry out any other business. There are concerns that without a functioning government in Northern Ireland, the cost of living crisis cannot be addressed by politicians. On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak announceda Â£1,000 payment for Northern Ireland's most vulnerable households, including a one-off cost of living payment. The Northern Ireland Protocol ispart of the Brexit deal: it means lorries don't face checkpoints when they go from Northern Ireland (in the UK) to the Republic of Ireland (in the EU) Instead,when goods arrive in Northern Irelandfrom the rest of the UK (England, Scotland and Wales), they are checked against EU rules The UK and the EU chose this arrangement becausethe Irish border is a sensitive issuedue to Northern Ireland's troubled political history Read more:Guide to the Brexit border problem The petition needed 30 signatures to pass, and received the backing of Alliance and SDLP. Members of the Legislative Assembly (MLAs) have now been summoned to the Stormont chamber on Monday by current Speaker Alex Maskey to debate the ""urgent appointment"" of ministers. Sinn FÃ©in's would-be first minister, Michelle O'Neill, said voters expected politicians to be in the assembly chamber. Richard Neal, leading a delegation of US politicians, at Stormont with outgoing Speaker Alex Maskey Speaking after meeting the US delegation at Stormont, Ms O'Neill said: ""They expect us to be putting money into peoples pockets but the DUP are blocking all that. ""It's important we attempt to elect a speaker."" However Sir Jeffrey dismissed the recall as a Sinn FÃ©in ""stunt"". ""If they think that pulling a stunt like this next Monday is going to change things, then they really don't understand unionism and our determination to stand our ground until we get the decisive action that is required to move us all forward."" Ulster Unionist leader Doug Beattie confirmed his party would be at Stormont on Monday, ""because that's our job"". ""The people of Northern Ireland are suffering, we have the power to help them, and the way to do that is to get both the assembly and the executive up and running,"" he said. Mr Beattie said he felt US representatives would emerge from Thursday's meetings ""understanding the unionist position"". He added: ""We were all in agreement to a degree that this is not a crisis, this is a problem and a problem to be solved."" Alliance MP Stephen Farry said there were ""genuine"" problems with the protocol, but unionism was not ""helping itself"" by walking away from solutions offered. ""The solution here has to be about partnership between the UK and the European Union, and we deeply understand the frustrations that the EU has with the approach that the UK has taken, but we also feel that creativity is required to get this over the line. ""We need to see more progress."" On Wednesday night, the American delegation was hosted by Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis, who said the UK and the US were united in their shared commitment to the Good Friday Agreement. DUP Mayor of Derry Graham Warke asked if the US visitors ""could be careful with their words"" Earlier, the UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss, on a visit to County Antrim, said issues with the protocol were ""soluble"" but cannot be allowed to drift. Businesses in Northern Ireland think the protocol can work- and want it to, the UK's biggest business association has said. Tony Danker, the director general of the CBI, said: ""If you're a manufacturer you have access to dual markets. That is a very big deal in the context of the overall Brexit fall out.""

LiveLiveChancellor setting out measures to help with energy billsLess than a minute ago,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out measures to address the rising cost of living, as the government seeks to draw a line under Partygate One-off payments of different amounts will be given to the most vulnerable - the elderly, those with disabilities, and those with the lowest incomes All households will receive a Â£400 discount on energy bills Eight million of the lowest income families will also get a one-off payment of Â£650, Sunak says He confirms a temporary windfall tax on oil and gas giants to fund the payments - a move called for by the Lib Dems and Labour There will be a one-off disability cost of living payment of Â£150, and pensioners will get Â£300 The UK's energy regulator Ofgem says typical household energy bills are set to rise by Â£800 in October, to Â£2,800 a year Edited by Chris Giles We're about to wrap up our live coverage. Your writers today were Becky Morton, James FitzGerald, Adam Durbin and Marie Jackson. The page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owen and Claire Heald. This video can not be played Chancellor announces energy bill discounts of Â£400 this autumn It's been another busy day in Westminster and we're ending our live coverage shortly. Here are the key points from Chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement of a package of measures intended to ease the impact of the rising cost of living: The majority of the measures announced by the chancellor today will apply to people across the UK. But there are a few exceptions: An emotional Lisa Bradley welcomes the extra help, as do Raymond Graves, left, and Lee Ingham At the weekly job club in Handforth, Cheshire, the news of government help is met with much emotion. Lisa Bradley
breaks down in tears. âItâs such a massive relief,â she says. The mum of two grown-up children has been struggling for
months and losing sleep over money. She's been turning off appliances, including the fire alarm, to save pennies, because her meter swallows up what used to last her weeks. Lee feels the government's package could not have come at a better time. âThereâs no extra in the pot, youâre scratching the barrel,â he says. Raymond is not eligible for more than the Â£400 payment all
households will receive but he doesn't mind. âIâm pleased theyâre not just doing a
blanket Â£500 on everybody, theyâre actually targeting  those who need it and
it is related to energy bills as well, I think thatâs good.â âIâll still need to scrimp and save,â Lisa adds. âEven
though itâs a fantastic amount Iâm so aware how quickly it can slip through
your fingers again.â BBC Political Editor Chris Mason has been speaking to Chancellor Rishi Sunak about his plans to charge a windfall tax on oil and gas giants. Sunak says the new energy profits levy is a ""very specific"" tax which contains ""generous"" investment incentives for energy firms. Challenged as to why he's reluctant to use the phrase windfall tax, he says ""people can call it what they want"", adding other similar proposals for a one-off tax are ""blunt instruments"". Watch their exchange below. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak on why he doesn't use windfall tax phrase Millions of households will receive discounts on their energy bills The package of government support aimed at tackling spiralling living costs is going down well with consumer experts. The move is a ""life raft for the millions of people struggling to keep their heads above water"" saysCitizens Advice. And the announcements are ""more generous than expected""Martin Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website,says on Twitter,external. But, as we've been reporting, some campaigners want the government to take more action. Debt charityStepChangesays it's important that supporting a wide number of households does not dilute the assistance for those in greatest need. And the chancellor is ""kidding himself"" if he thinks the measures can prevent people suffering long-term financial setbacks, theChild Poverty Action Groupsays. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The energy price cap in England, Wales and Scotland is
actually a cap on the price of each unit of energy we use, and the standing
charge. Regulator Ofgem then calculates what that means for a
household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. Earlier this week, its boss, Jonathan Brearley, said the
regulatorâs current estimate for that typical household bill in October would
be Â£2,800 a year â a rise of Â£800 compared to now. If you use a comparatively high level of energy in your home
then you will pay more than that âtypicalâ bill; if you use less, then you will
pay less. After the chancellor was told of the size of the financial
hole these bills could create, he could finalise the measures that might help
people get out of it. Andrew PlantBBC Points West reporter, in Bristol After the chancellorâs
announcement of extra financial help I spoke to Colette Hedges, who is
partially sighted and has cerebral palsy. That means she receives a disability living allowance. She said she is struggling to pay her energy bills, which have reached Â£105 for electricity and Â£225 for gas, for a three-month period. Collette says: ""Iâm paying it in dribs and drabs, not all at once. Itâs a lot
of money."" Reacting to the extra Â£150 one-off payment for people living with a
disability, she adds: ""Thatâs great. Thatâs really good. I keep trying to
stay cheerful. That should really help."" The moveto impose a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas firmsis ""a backward step"" according to Offshore Energies UK, which represents the industry. Chief executive Deirdre Michie says the new taxes will ""drive away investors and so reduce UK energy production"". ""That
means less oil, less gas, and less renewables. It also makes it much harder for
the UK to reach net zero by 2050,"" she argues. Meanwhile, a spokesman for oil giant Shell, says the company has ""consistently emphasised the importance of a stable environment for long-term investment"". However, he notes that the proposal for tax relief on investment in the UK ""is a critical principle in the new levy"". Torsten Bell from the Resolution Foundation think tank has analysed who is going to benefit the most from the planned approach, as well as those who will see the least support sent their way. He says the biggest winners are ""poorer pensioner households with someone with a disability"", as they will receive multiple points of help from the package. However, he also notes that support for families with children will be more limited. Bell explains this is because, as they spend more on energy, but the flat rate of support being offered will do less to cut their bills as a proportion. He says there are still ""things to quibble with"" but overall describes the package as ""big and very welcome indeed"". At the moment, energy providers are not generally trying to tempt new customers with cheap offers, although a few firms, including British Gas and EDF, are offering new fixed price deals to some existing customers, which may be worth considering. People who are already on fixed deals are advised to stay put. Otherwise, households are being encouraged to save money by improving energy efficiency. The Energy Saving Trust saysseveral small changes,externalcould help many people off-set some of the recent rises in energy costs. You can read more about the support available to help with energy bills here. Digital companies will be taxed âmore
fairlyâ, the chancellor says, after being asked in the Commons why big firms like Amazon were not included in the
scope of his new windfall tax. The one-off levy targets the profits of companies â like fuel firms â that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for. SNP MP Patricia Gibson points out that the likes of Amazon made âbillionsâ during the pandemic. Rishi Sunak says the government worked to agree a
""new international taxation agreement"" for such firms â which will come into effect ""over the coming months and years"". Andrew PlantBBC Points West, in Bristol Iâve been speaking to people on East Street in the
Bedminster area of Bristol today to see what they make of the government's new plan. Alan Morgan is a pensioner who doesnât think
the money announced by the chancellor will be enough. ""I heard mention of Â£400, but they reckon the bill's going to go up by another Â£800. So Â£400 is not going to
cut it,"" he says. In order to pay his rising food and energy bills, he explains something
will have to give, adding: ""My car will probably have to go so that I can afford the
food and the energy."" Alan says heâs even cut back on meeting friends outside. He says he comes to this cafÃ© because itâs the ""only place I can afford to buy a
coffee"". One of the main announcements earlier was that all UK households will get a grant which will reduce energy bills by Â£400 from October. Previously, the chancellor had said Â£200 would be knocked off everyone's energy bills, but would have to be paid back in instalments over five years. Now, the discount has been doubled to Â£400 and he has cancelled the requirement to repay. In other words, from October, everyone's energy bill will be reduced by Â£400. In technical terms. it will apply directly for households in England, Scotland, and Wales. The equivalent funds should be given to Northern Ireland to distribute, although the way to do this has yet to be worked out, while the government is not functioning. You can read more about the other support that's been announced here. Reality Check The chancellor told MPs: In total the measures Iâve announced today provide support worth Â£15bn â combined with the plans weâve already announced that means we are supporting families with the cost of living with Â£37bn  There are some questions about the Â£22bn valuation of the
package announced previously. For example, the Â£22bn included raising the point at which
people have to start paying National Insurance which is a big tax cut, but not
the amount taken away through other tax measures. The Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that freezing
income tax thresholds costs households about Â£3bn while the increase in the
rate of National Insurance for employees and the self-employed costs them about
Â£7bn, so suggests that at least Â£10bn should have been taken off the figure. The
Â£22bn figure (and thus the Â£37bn figure) also includes the freeze on alcohol
duty, which the government says will save people Â£3bn over the next five years. A windfall tax was prompted by big profits for fuel companies The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has welcomed the government's efforts to tackle the cost-of-living issue - but it's expressed concern about the chancellor's new windfall tax. Rain Newton-Smith said Rishi Sunak's package of help for households was the right thing to do. But she added that the ""open-ended nature"" of the tax on fuel company profits could prove damaging to investment - which was necessary for energy security as well as reducing carbon emissions to tackle climate change. The move ""sends the wrong signal to the whole sector, against a backdrop of rising business taxation elsewhere,"" the CBI's chief economist said. The move follows huge profit increases for firms including Shell A
windfall tax is a one-off levy targeting firms that have benefited from
something they werenât responsible for. At
the moment, that means fuel companies. BP and Shell have both reported big
increases in profits as oil and gas prices surge around the world â partly driven
by Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Ministers had previously rejected the idea of such a tax, which Labour,
Liberal Democrats and the SNP were calling for. The chancellor described the new tax as a 25% Energy Profits
Levy. It could raise around Â£5bn. Crucially, firms will not be allowed to reduce their tax
liability by factoring in money spent on tasks like decommissioning North Sea
oil platforms â something thatâs helped them lower tax bills previously. Want to know more? Read our explainer here. The support announced by the chancellor includes a mix of universal payments and other help targeted at specific groups. Here's a quick summary of what has been announced -you can read about the measures in more detail here. A nurse from Somerset has described her struggle to make ends meet in the run up to payday. Lucy told Radio 5 Live she went to fill her car to get to work this morning, but had just Â£5 left to do so and won't get paid until tomorrow. She says: I was on the red light and that Â£5 did not even take me out of the red light.  I'm just hoping that I make it to work - I'm not sure how I'm going to get back  Meanwhile, Justine from Surrey says she in a similar position of living from pay cheque to pay cheque, describing the cost of filling a car currently as ""extortionate"". She says: We are turning off the hot water when we are not using it and everyone is using their towel a few extra times to reduce on the laundry.  I am also selling a few things out of my wardrobe as we are not going out so often. We are making lots and lots of little cutbacks in order to make the pennies last until the end of the month.

Households to get hundreds off energy billsThe support package is expected to be partly funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas firms.,"Households in England, Scotland and Wales are set to have hundreds of pounds knocked off energy bills as part of a package worth billions to help people cope with soaring prices. The government is to scrapa plan to give people Â£200 off bills from Octoberwhich would be repaid over five years. Instead, the BBC understands that sum will be increased and possibly doubled, and will not need to be paid back. Additional help for those on the lowest incomes is also expected. The support, to be announced by Chancellor Rishi Sunak later, is expected to be largely funded by a windfall tax on oil and gas firms that could raise Â£7bn. It comes a day afterSue Gray's critical report into lockdown parties in Downing Streetand follows intense pressure on the government to do more to help people with the cost of living crisis. Live: Millions await new help for cost-of-living squeeze How high could my energy bills go? 'She won't ask me for money for sanitary products' Earlier this week the UK's energy regulator Ofgem said the typical household energy bill was set to rise by Â£800 in October, bringing the typical household bill to Â£2,800 a year. Bills had already risen on average by Â£700 in April. Ofgem warned it meant 12 million households could be placed into fuel poverty. Most people living in homes in England in council tax bands A-D have already received a Â£150 rebate on their bills. Dame Clare Moriarty, chief executive of Citizens Advice, said the ""bulk"" of government support needed to go to those on the lowest incomes ""who are suffering the most severe consequences of this cost of living crisis"". She told the BBC the charity was now helping more than 750 people every day with food bank vouchers. ""We have got people in this country who cannot put food on the table, they cannot keep their lights on and the heating on,"" she said. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, said offering a universal payment would mean a lot of the money would go to households who ""don't desperately need it"". He also warned putting billions of pounds into the economy at a time when prices were rising quickly ""could stoke additional demand and make inflation much more permanent"". Opposition parties have repeatedly called for a windfall tax on energy companies that have made bumper profits, in large part because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. But until now the government had resisted calls to impose the one-off levy, with some senior members of the cabinet arguing it could deter energy firms from investing in the UK. However, it is understood the prime minister has now sided with Mr Sunak, who had been pushing for the tax. Government set to U-turn on windfall tax Which countries are doing the most to tackle bills? But proposals to tax income from other electricity producers, such as some older windfarms and nuclear plants which have also seen windfall gains, have been shelved. And companies that increase investment in the UK could earn a discount on the additional tax. The Treasury said the government understood ""that people are struggling with rising prices"" and that Mr Sunak had been ""clear that as the situation evolves, so will our response"". David Thompson is one of those struggling to pay the bills. The 46-year-old has five children and four grandchildren and gets Universal Credit - which he calls ""Universal Crisis"". David Thompson says food, energy and clothing are all costing more ""It is getting worse and worse, but you have just got to make do with what you have got. It is a struggle. You are worrying before you get paid, then when you get paid you worry how far it is going to go,"" he said, ""It is supposed to last a month, but you are skint after a week or two."" As typical household energy bills are rising, and areset to go up again in October, he said that any extra support given by the government was never going to match the rate of price rises at the moment. ""This is one of the worst times. I remember when the shipyards went down, and the miners' strikes. People are more well-off now than the 80s and the 90s, but things are a lot more expensive,"" he said. Read more about people struggling with bills Energy firms have made huge profits following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Shell reported a record Â£7bn profit in the first three months of this year while BP made Â£5bn, the highest for 10 years. But Offshore Energies UK, which represents the offshore oil and gas industry, said a windfall tax on energy firms would see higher prices and do long-term damage to the oil and gas industry. Deirdre Michie, chief executive of the body, said: ""This is an industry that thinks and plans long-term, so sudden new costs, like this proposed tax, will disrupt planning and investment and, above all, undermine investor confidence."" Higher energy bills are pushing prices to rise at the fastest rate for 40 years, with fuel and food costs also biting into household budgets. Ofgem chief executive Jonathan Brearley said conditions in the global gas market had worsened after Russia's invasion and warned that the price cap could rise beyond Â£2,800 if Moscow decided to disrupt supplies. Europe gets about 40% of its natural gas from Russia, so sudden supply cuts could have a huge economic impact. While the UK would not be directly impacted by supply disruption - as it imports less than 5% of its gas from Russia - it would be affected by prices rising on global markets as demand in Europe increased.

Millions await new help for cost-of-living squeeze,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has set out measures to address the rising cost of living, as the government seeks to draw a line under Partygate One-off payments of different amounts will be given to the most vulnerable - the elderly, those with disabilities, and those with the lowest incomes All households will receive a Â£400 discount on energy bills Eight million of the lowest income families will also get a one-off payment of Â£650, Sunak says He confirms a temporary windfall tax on oil and gas giants to fund the payments - a move called for by the Lib Dems and Labour There will be a one-off disability cost of living payment of Â£150, and pensioners will get Â£300 The UK's energy regulator Ofgem says typical household energy bills are set to rise by Â£800 in October, to Â£2,800 a year Edited by Chris Giles We're about to wrap up our live coverage. Your writers today were Becky Morton, James FitzGerald, Adam Durbin and Marie Jackson. The page was edited by Chris Giles, Emma Owen and Claire Heald. This video can not be played Chancellor announces energy bill discounts of Â£400 this autumn It's been another busy day in Westminster and we're ending our live coverage shortly. Here are the key points from Chancellor Rishi Sunak's announcement of a package of measures intended to ease the impact of the rising cost of living: The majority of the measures announced by the chancellor today will apply to people across the UK. But there are a few exceptions: An emotional Lisa Bradley welcomes the extra help, as do Raymond Graves, left, and Lee Ingham At the weekly job club in Handforth, Cheshire, the news of government help is met with much emotion. Lisa Bradley
breaks down in tears. âItâs such a massive relief,â she says. The mum of two grown-up children has been struggling for
months and losing sleep over money. She's been turning off appliances, including the fire alarm, to save pennies, because her meter swallows up what used to last her weeks. Lee feels the government's package could not have come at a better time. âThereâs no extra in the pot, youâre scratching the barrel,â he says. Raymond is not eligible for more than the Â£400 payment all
households will receive but he doesn't mind. âIâm pleased theyâre not just doing a
blanket Â£500 on everybody, theyâre actually targeting  those who need it and
it is related to energy bills as well, I think thatâs good.â âIâll still need to scrimp and save,â Lisa adds. âEven
though itâs a fantastic amount Iâm so aware how quickly it can slip through
your fingers again.â BBC Political Editor Chris Mason has been speaking to Chancellor Rishi Sunak about his plans to charge a windfall tax on oil and gas giants. Sunak says the new energy profits levy is a ""very specific"" tax which contains ""generous"" investment incentives for energy firms. Challenged as to why he's reluctant to use the phrase windfall tax, he says ""people can call it what they want"", adding other similar proposals for a one-off tax are ""blunt instruments"". Watch their exchange below. This video can not be played Rishi Sunak on why he doesn't use windfall tax phrase Millions of households will receive discounts on their energy bills The package of government support aimed at tackling spiralling living costs is going down well with consumer experts. The move is a ""life raft for the millions of people struggling to keep their heads above water"" saysCitizens Advice. And the announcements are ""more generous than expected""Martin Lewis, the founder of the MoneySavingExpert website,says on Twitter,external. But, as we've been reporting, some campaigners want the government to take more action. Debt charityStepChangesays it's important that supporting a wide number of households does not dilute the assistance for those in greatest need. And the chancellor is ""kidding himself"" if he thinks the measures can prevent people suffering long-term financial setbacks, theChild Poverty Action Groupsays. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance correspondent The energy price cap in England, Wales and Scotland is
actually a cap on the price of each unit of energy we use, and the standing
charge. Regulator Ofgem then calculates what that means for a
household using a typical amount of gas and electricity. Earlier this week, its boss, Jonathan Brearley, said the
regulatorâs current estimate for that typical household bill in October would
be Â£2,800 a year â a rise of Â£800 compared to now. If you use a comparatively high level of energy in your home
then you will pay more than that âtypicalâ bill; if you use less, then you will
pay less. After the chancellor was told of the size of the financial
hole these bills could create, he could finalise the measures that might help
people get out of it. Andrew PlantBBC Points West reporter, in Bristol After the chancellorâs
announcement of extra financial help I spoke to Colette Hedges, who is
partially sighted and has cerebral palsy. That means she receives a disability living allowance. She said she is struggling to pay her energy bills, which have reached Â£105 for electricity and Â£225 for gas, for a three-month period. Collette says: ""Iâm paying it in dribs and drabs, not all at once. Itâs a lot
of money."" Reacting to the extra Â£150 one-off payment for people living with a
disability, she adds: ""Thatâs great. Thatâs really good. I keep trying to
stay cheerful. That should really help."" The moveto impose a windfall tax on the profits of oil and gas firmsis ""a backward step"" according to Offshore Energies UK, which represents the industry. Chief executive Deirdre Michie says the new taxes will ""drive away investors and so reduce UK energy production"". ""That
means less oil, less gas, and less renewables. It also makes it much harder for
the UK to reach net zero by 2050,"" she argues. Meanwhile, a spokesman for oil giant Shell, says the company has ""consistently emphasised the importance of a stable environment for long-term investment"". However, he notes that the proposal for tax relief on investment in the UK ""is a critical principle in the new levy"". Torsten Bell from the Resolution Foundation think tank has analysed who is going to benefit the most from the planned approach, as well as those who will see the least support sent their way. He says the biggest winners are ""poorer pensioner households with someone with a disability"", as they will receive multiple points of help from the package. However, he also notes that support for families with children will be more limited. Bell explains this is because, as they spend more on energy, but the flat rate of support being offered will do less to cut their bills as a proportion. He says there are still ""things to quibble with"" but overall describes the package as ""big and very welcome indeed"". At the moment, energy providers are not generally trying to tempt new customers with cheap offers, although a few firms, including British Gas and EDF, are offering new fixed price deals to some existing customers, which may be worth considering. People who are already on fixed deals are advised to stay put. Otherwise, households are being encouraged to save money by improving energy efficiency. The Energy Saving Trust saysseveral small changes,externalcould help many people off-set some of the recent rises in energy costs. You can read more about the support available to help with energy bills here. Digital companies will be taxed âmore
fairlyâ, the chancellor says, after being asked in the Commons why big firms like Amazon were not included in the
scope of his new windfall tax. The one-off levy targets the profits of companies â like fuel firms â that have benefited from circumstances they were not responsible for. SNP MP Patricia Gibson points out that the likes of Amazon made âbillionsâ during the pandemic. Rishi Sunak says the government worked to agree a
""new international taxation agreement"" for such firms â which will come into effect ""over the coming months and years"". Andrew PlantBBC Points West, in Bristol Iâve been speaking to people on East Street in the
Bedminster area of Bristol today to see what they make of the government's new plan. Alan Morgan is a pensioner who doesnât think
the money announced by the chancellor will be enough. ""I heard mention of Â£400, but they reckon the bill's going to go up by another Â£800. So Â£400 is not going to
cut it,"" he says. In order to pay his rising food and energy bills, he explains something
will have to give, adding: ""My car will probably have to go so that I can afford the
food and the energy."" Alan says heâs even cut back on meeting friends outside. He says he comes to this cafÃ© because itâs the ""only place I can afford to buy a
coffee"". One of the main announcements earlier was that all UK households will get a grant which will reduce energy bills by Â£400 from October. Previously, the chancellor had said Â£200 would be knocked off everyone's energy bills, but would have to be paid back in instalments over five years. Now, the discount has been doubled to Â£400 and he has cancelled the requirement to repay. In other words, from October, everyone's energy bill will be reduced by Â£400. In technical terms. it will apply directly for households in England, Scotland, and Wales. The equivalent funds should be given to Northern Ireland to distribute, although the way to do this has yet to be worked out, while the government is not functioning. You can read more about the other support that's been announced here. Reality Check The chancellor told MPs: In total the measures Iâve announced today provide support worth Â£15bn â combined with the plans weâve already announced that means we are supporting families with the cost of living with Â£37bn  There are some questions about the Â£22bn valuation of the
package announced previously. For example, the Â£22bn included raising the point at which
people have to start paying National Insurance which is a big tax cut, but not
the amount taken away through other tax measures. The Institute for Fiscal Studies points out that freezing
income tax thresholds costs households about Â£3bn while the increase in the
rate of National Insurance for employees and the self-employed costs them about
Â£7bn, so suggests that at least Â£10bn should have been taken off the figure. The
Â£22bn figure (and thus the Â£37bn figure) also includes the freeze on alcohol
duty, which the government says will save people Â£3bn over the next five years. A windfall tax was prompted by big profits for fuel companies The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) has welcomed the government's efforts to tackle the cost-of-living issue - but it's expressed concern about the chancellor's new windfall tax. Rain Newton-Smith said Rishi Sunak's package of help for households was the right thing to do. But she added that the ""open-ended nature"" of the tax on fuel company profits could prove damaging to investment - which was necessary for energy security as well as reducing carbon emissions to tackle climate change. The move ""sends the wrong signal to the whole sector, against a backdrop of rising business taxation elsewhere,"" the CBI's chief economist said. The move follows huge profit increases for firms including Shell A
windfall tax is a one-off levy targeting firms that have benefited from
something they werenât responsible for. At
the moment, that means fuel companies. BP and Shell have both reported big
increases in profits as oil and gas prices surge around the world â partly driven
by Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. Ministers had previously rejected the idea of such a tax, which Labour,
Liberal Democrats and the SNP were calling for. The chancellor described the new tax as a 25% Energy Profits
Levy. It could raise around Â£5bn. Crucially, firms will not be allowed to reduce their tax
liability by factoring in money spent on tasks like decommissioning North Sea
oil platforms â something thatâs helped them lower tax bills previously. Want to know more? Read our explainer here. The support announced by the chancellor includes a mix of universal payments and other help targeted at specific groups. Here's a quick summary of what has been announced -you can read about the measures in more detail here. A nurse from Somerset has described her struggle to make ends meet in the run up to payday. Lucy told Radio 5 Live she went to fill her car to get to work this morning, but had just Â£5 left to do so and won't get paid until tomorrow. She says: I was on the red light and that Â£5 did not even take me out of the red light.  I'm just hoping that I make it to work - I'm not sure how I'm going to get back  Meanwhile, Justine from Surrey says she in a similar position of living from pay cheque to pay cheque, describing the cost of filling a car currently as ""extortionate"". She says: We are turning off the hot water when we are not using it and everyone is using their towel a few extra times to reduce on the laundry.  I am also selling a few things out of my wardrobe as we are not going out so often. We are making lots and lots of little cutbacks in order to make the pennies last until the end of the month.

'She won't ask me for money for period products'A mother explains how she can't make ends meet as data suggests more people are struggling.,"Further support with the cost of living is urgent as income is failing to cover basic living costs for many people, a charity has warned. Citizens Advice said 46% of its debt clients had a so-called negative budget, up from 36% three years ago. That means they do not have enough money to meet essential living costs. One mother-of-two said her teenage daughter did not want to ask her for money to buy sanitary products. Extra support is expected soon. Citizens Advice debt advisers have called for a return of the Â£20-a-week boost to Universal Credit, but Treasury chief secretary Simon Clarke has ruled that out, describing it as ""a temporary response to the pandemic"" which would not return. Other measures could be outlined within hours, which could include help for vulnerable households. Many people seeking help from Citizens Advice are already in a difficult financial state. Their budgets are in the red, with income failing to cover daily living costs, even before paying bills such as credit card repayments. Their situation has been made worse by prices rising at the fastest rate for 40 years, and particularly surging energy bills. Among them is a mother-of-two, who we are not naming owing to her vulnerability. She is unable to work and has borrowed from family and friends, but has found it tough to budget, and is seeking official relief from her debts - all of which she said was having an impact on her children. ""We are eating sandwiches and things like that because I don't want to use the oven,"" she said. ""We live off the basics with food shopping, but it is not all healthy. ""My daughter does not like to ask me for money. She worries that it is worrying me. ""With sanitary towels, she won't tell me that she needs them. When she needs them she gets them from school. But they are a necessity. It should not be down to the school; they are there only for an emergency."" Money advice supervisor Christopher Whitehead says food vouchers are often needed The people who work at North Tyneside Citizens Advice are used to such stories, where more women than men seek debt and benefits advice, and contact with people aged in their early 20s is rising. Most people in the area have a low income, but it is very mixed, with pockets of deprivation and also of wealth. Even so, in the first three months of this year, there was an 89% rise in clients who needed charitable support compared with a year earlier. In other words, the need for food and fuel vouchers or welfare support almost doubled in a year. Sometimes staff even have to source second hand ovens for families so they can cook the food they are given. 'I'm in work but I need to use a food bank' Cost of living: What are Rishi Sunak's options? Money advice supervisor Christopher Whitehead, 39, first started in debt advice in 2007 as the financial crisis of that time took hold. ""It was about credit card, store card, and catalogue debt back then. Now it is about people not being able to afford the essentials. There are debts on council tax, energy and rent which are day-to-day costs you should be able to meet,"" he said. When somebody has a negative budget, it means they have nothing left, or have to borrow, after paying their living costs. And those costs don't include unsecured debt repayments such as credit cards. On the quayside, just a few hundred yards from the Citizens Advice office, David Thompson is fishing, and is one of those struggling to pay the bills. The 46-year-old has five children and four grandchildren and gets Universal Credit - which he calls ""Universal Crisis"". David Thompson says food, energy and clothing are all costing more ""It is getting worse and worse, but you have just got to make do with what you have got. It is a struggle. You are worrying before you get paid, then when you get paid you worry how far it is going to go,"" he said, ""It is supposed to last a month, but you are skint after a week or two."" As typical household energy bills are rising, and areset to go up again in October, he said that any extra support given by the government was never going to match the rate of price rises at the moment. ""This is one of the worst times. I remember when the shipyards went down, and the miners' strikes. People are more well-off now than the 80s and the 90s, but things are a lot more expensive,"" he said. It is not only those receiving benefits who are struggling with rising prices and potential debts. The rate of people in debt who have a negative budget is rising fastest among those who are not on benefits, Citizens Advice said. Whatever people's circumstances, whether in-work or not, Citizens Advice is urging anyone who is worried they could be facing a spiral of debt to get in touch for help. ""You have to speak out. You can't just struggle,"" said the mother referred to earlier. ""If I hadn't, I would be in a big black hole now."" Advisers are able to do benefit checks and sometimes to find and apply for grants from benevolent funds run by former employers. However, the charity is warning that there are limits to the support it can offer, so further assistance from ministers is vital. Developments such as social tariffs from energy companies would also help, they said. So far, government support has been a mix of broad, general assistance to help everyone, such as council tax rebates, and more targeted policy - such as allowing those on universal credit to take home more of what they earn. The Treasury said it had already put together a Â£22bn package of support for people facing the rising cost of living, and the government is set to outline further help. The government is expected to scrap a plan to give people Â£200 off bills from October which would be repaid over five years.
