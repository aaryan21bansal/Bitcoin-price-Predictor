Cameron warned over 'stupid' Brexit vote,"This video can not be played David Cameron thought there was 'no risk' of a Brexit referendum, according to Donald Tusk European Council President Donald Tusk told David Cameron to ""get real"" over his ""stupid referendum"" before the 2016 Brexit vote, a BBC documentary reveals. Mr Tusk tells the three-part show that he warned the then prime minister there was no ""appetite for revolution in Europe"" and he ""could lose everything"". He claims that Mr Cameron, who did not take part in the programme, felt ""there was no risk of a referendum"" happening. But Craig Oliver, Mr Cameron's former communications director, denies this. ""David Cameron spent the whole of the 2015 election campaign making clear he would not lead any form of government that didn't have a referendum,""he said on Twitter.,external InBBC Two's ""Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil"",which starts next Monday, Mr Tusk said Mr Cameron thought a referendum would not happen because of the coalition government with the Lib Dems. ""[He told me] he felt really safe, because he thought at the same time that there's no risk of a referendum, because his coalition partner, the Liberals, would block this idea of a referendum,"" Mr Tusk said. ""But then, surprisingly, he won and there was no coalition partner. So paradoxically David Cameron became the real victim of his own victory."" Mr Tusk said he was ""really amazed and even shocked"" to learn from Mr Cameron that he decided to hold the referendum because of his own party. Mr Cameron decided to resign as prime minister when the Leave campaign won the referendum. The programme's producers said he did not take part in the programme because he has signed an exclusive deal for his memoirs. May axes Brexit fee for EU citizens Brexit: A really simple guide Mr Tusk warned Mr Cameron that other European prime ministers would not be inclined to help him in the referendum, and says: ""For the first time I saw something close to fear in his eyes. He finally realised what a challenge he was facing."" And after hearing Mr Cameron's decision to quit, Mr Tusk says he told him: ""Yes David, it would be very difficult even to imagine that a prime minister who was the leader of Remain's campaign would be just two days later a prime minister negotiating Brexit. ""It was like his day of reckoning was coming, reckoning for his biggest mistake in his life."" Donald Tusk said he warned David Cameron, the then prime minister, about holding a referendum The first episode of the three-part series features interviews with former chancellor George Osborne, ex-foreign secretary William Hague, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker and former French presidents Nicolas Sarkozy and Francois Hollande. Nick Clegg, the UK's then EU ambassador Sir Ivan Rogers and Mr Oliver are also included. In the programme, Mr Sarkozy reveals how he warned Mr Cameron about his attempt at strong-arm tactics with EU leaders over concessions on migrant rules and integration, telling him: ""If you try to break our arm, you'll get nothing."" And Mr Hollande says that during a visit to Chequers in 2015 he tried to talk the Tory leader out of holding the referendum. ""Nothing obliged him to hold the referendum when he did,"" he tells the documentary. ""This would not be the first time that a commitment made at an election had not been kept afterwards, but he wanted to show he could negotiate successfully with Europeans."" Theresa May, who is criticised in the programme by Mr Osborne - who she sacked as chancellor, also declined to take part in the programme Describing a meeting held by Mr Cameron to get ministers' views on whether to back a referendum, Mr Osborne said: ""Theresa May didn't say very much, which was par for the course in those meetings."" The first episode of Inside Europe: Ten Years of Turmoil, 'We Quit', is on BBC Two on Monday, 28 January at 21:00 GMTand available on iPlayer afterwards.

Key Antarctic food source moves south,"This video can not be played Simeon Hill: ""Our data goes all the way back to the 'Discovery era' of the 20s and 30s"" A keystone prey species in the Southern Ocean is retreating towards the Antarctic because of climate change. Krill are small, shrimp-like creatures that swarm in vast numbers and form a major part of the diets of whales, penguins, seabirds, seals and fish. Scientists say warming conditions in recent decades have led to the krill contracting poleward. If the shift is maintained, it will have negative ecosystem impacts, they warn. Already there is some evidence that macaroni penguins and fur seals may be finding it harder to get enough of the krill to support their populations. ""Our results suggest that over the past 40 years, the amount of krill has, on average, gone down, and also the location of the krill has contracted to much less of the habitat. That suggests all these other animals that eat krill will face much more intense competition with each other for this important food resource,"" Simeon Hill from the British Antarctic Survey told BBC News. The study is publishedin the journal Nature Climate Change,external. Space laser makes height maps of Earth South Pole 'has a saggy bottom' Biggest ever Antarctic field campaign Krill sit near the base of a food web that supports some of the biggest animals on the planet It focuses on the Scotia Sea and the Antarctic Peninsula - the places where the crustaceans are most abundant. Scientists have been gathering data in these areas since the 1920s. Initially, krill catches were recorded to understand the environmental consequences of commercial whaling, but the information has continued to be collected through to the present. Dr Hill and colleagues say the change in the distribution and density of the crustaceans is a clear signal that emerges in the data from the late 1980s onwards. It coincides with a phase change in a climate oscillation known as the Southern Annular Mode. The SAM essentially describes the dominant pattern of pressure zones in the southern hemisphere outside of the tropics. The mode's switch in state in the late 80s produced warmer, cloudier, windier weather, and much less sea-ice in those areas where the krill had tended to congregate. The larval stage of the crustaceans in particular has been strongly associated with the presence of a sea-ice habitat. The team's analysis indicates the centre of krill distribution has now moved to where more favourable conditions are found, tracking southward towards the Antarctic continent by about 440km, or four degrees of latitude. ""The average size of krill has lengthened over this period of time as well,"" said Dr Hill. ""And that's because the population has increasingly become dominated by older and larger animals. This is a result of a decline in the number of krill entering the population - what we call juvenile recruitment."" Margaret McBride, from the Norwegian Institute of Marine Research in Bergen, has writtena comment article on the research,externalin the same edition of Nature Climate Change. She said models had predicted that krill would shift southwards in the future, whereas the new research suggested this contraction was already under way. ""It offers a profoundly adverse, but highly plausible, endgame for Antarctic krill that has serious implications for both the Southern Ocean food web and sustainable management of fisheries targeting this species,"" she wrote. The krill do not only support marine mammals and seabirds; an international fishery also extracts something on the order of a quarter of a million tonnes of the crustaceans each year in the Antarctic region. The campaign group WWF-UK said the study showed ""the need to protect the waters off the Antarctic Peninsula with an effective network of marine protected areas - placing conservation above fishing interests.""

Wanted Schwimmer 'lookalike' arrested,"Police issued a new photo of Abdulah Husseini (left) A ""lookalike"" of Friends star David Schwimmer has been arrested a month after failing to appear in court. Abdulah Husseini, 36, was found in London after a police hunt when he failed to appear in court in Blackpool over allegations of theft and fraud. The first police bid to trace him went viral over his apparent resemblance to character Ross Geller. Mr Husseini was arrested in Wimbledon, south-west London, and was remanded in custody. He will appear at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court Wednesday. Mr Husseini, of Spencer Road, Slough, allegedly stole a coat, a phone and a wallet from Mr Basrai's on Talbot Road in the Lancashire seaside resort on 20 September. An appeal by Lancashire Police went viral, fuelled by David Schwimmer's own take (shown on the left) Lancashire Police released a CCTV image allegedly showing Mr Husseini carrying a case of beer at a shop in Blackpool and this led to social media users pointing out his likeness to the US sitcom character. Mr Husseini failed to appear at Blackpool Magistrates' Court on 18 December to face accusations of theft and four charges of fraud. A new warrant for his arrest was then issued by the magistrate, leading to his arrest in Wimbledon. Mr Husseini was also being sought by the Metropolitan Police after failing to appear at court on a charge of handling stolen goods.

Deadly blast hits cargo ships off Crimea,"This video can not be played Ships ablaze off Crimea after explosion At least 11 people have died in a fire involving two Tanzanian-flagged cargo vessels in the Black Sea near the Kerch Strait, authorities say. Russian rescuers are trying to reach sailors who jumped overboard. Fourteen people have so far been rescued. One ship is a gas tanker, and the fire reportedly followed an explosion, which set the other vessel on fire. They were named as the Kandy (Venice), with a crew of 17 from Turkey and India, and Maestro, with 14 sailors. The fire broke out when one vessel was transferring fuel to another, Russian maritime agency spokesman Alexei Kravchenko said, adding that this had then forced several crew members to jump overboard. Rescue workers reportedly witnessed a further three people struggling in the water, who most likely had drowned. AFP news agency said that ""no signal from either one of the two captains"" had been received. Authorities in the Crimean city of Kerch are now preparing to receive the victims. The crew members were sailing in ""neutral waters"" in the Black Sea when the incident occurred, authorities said. The names of the two vessels, the Venice and the Maestro, both appear on a US treasury list,externalas possible targets for sanctions over petroleum shipments to Syria. The US tightened sanctions against Syria back in 2011 in response to what it said was President Bashar al-Assad's ""continued atrocities"" committed against the Syrian people. The Kerch Strait is a focus of tension between Russia and Ukraine. In November, Russian border guards seized three Ukrainian naval vessels near the narrow channel, which links the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov. Russia-Ukraine tensions rise after Kerch Strait ship capture A court in Russia has extended by three months the detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors captured in the incident. They are accused of illegally crossing into Russian territory. Ukraine condemned the Russian move, denying that its ships had violated the navigation laws in the area.

California Democrat to run for president,"This video can not be played Students describe presidential hopeful Kamala Harris in three words Democratic Senator Kamala Harris says she will run for president in the 2020 election, the eighth name to join the battle for the party's nomination. The California senator, who was elected in 2016, previously served as the state's attorney general. ""I love my country,"" she told ABC's Good Morning America, adding she would ""fight for the best of who we are"". The 54-year-old, a vocal critic of President Donald Trump, is described as a rising star within the party. Elizabeth Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Tulsi Gabbard, John Delaney and Julian Castro are among those who have also announced their intentions to run. Allow Twitter content?

""The future of our country depends on you and millions of others lifting our voices to fight for our American values. That's why I'm running for president of the United States,"" the senator said in a video posted on Twitter. The 2020 Democratic presidential primary will be the first time more than one woman competes for the party's nomination. The race is already thought to be record-breaking, with four women candidates running national campaigns. The lessons Democrats can learn for 2020 Securing the nomination would make Ms Harris the first African American or Indian American woman to be a major party nominee for the presidency. At her first campaign event on Monday, at an African American university in Washington, she accused President Trump of holding Americans hostage by prolonging the partial government shutdown.

US shutdown: Workers crowdfund to survive Kamala Harris is the kind of Democrat who could stick around and prevail in what is sure to be a gruelling nomination battle. She is from California, which is rich in both primary delegates and fundraising dollars. As a woman, and from an ethnic minority, she is well positioned to capitalise on her party's growing diversity. She has one of the most liberal voting records in the US Senate at a time when Democrats are leaning to the left, but she also has a background as a hard-nosed prosecutor. That background may end up a vulnerability as well, given that some progressives have criticised her for failing to support California criminal justice reform efforts and pointed to her prosecutorial record as being insufficiently sensitive to the rights of the accused. She will have to walk a fine line to tout her accomplishments while justifying her decisions. Ms Harris has only been on the national stage two years, and not every political neophyte can hold up under fire the way Mr Obama did in 2008. She will be tested in the coming months, but she starts the contest near the head of the pack. She served two terms as district attorney of San Francisco (2004-2011), before being elected as attorney general of California (2011-2017), the first woman of colour to do so. In 2017, the former prosecutor was sworn in as California's junior US senator. Warren takes step toward presidential run US Democrats launch bids for presidency She is the daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India and has pushed back against critics of ""identity politics"". ""It is used to try and shut us up,"" Ms Harris told a conference last summer. Her tough questioning of Justice Brett Kavanaugh about his views on abortion and the ongoing investigation into alleged Russian interference in the 2016 election attracted attention from Democrats. But she has also faced criticism for saying she was not aware of allegations of sexual harassment against one of her aides, who resigned in 2016. Ms Harris plans to launch her campaign during a rally in Oakland, California, on Sunday.

Painful restraint of children challenged,"The centre is now run by HM Prison and Probation Service Painful restraint of children in young offenders institutions and secure training centres increases the risk of abuse, a serious case review has said. The restraint techniques are authorised in certain situations, but a BBC Panorama programme in 2016 showed mistreatment at a centre in Kent. G4S recruited staff with no experience of working with children, said the review. Sixteen people were later arrested. There were no convictions. G4S held the contract to run the Medway Secure Training Centre, Rochester, from 1998 to 2016, at which point the government took over. Theserious case review (SCR),externalsaid the use of restraint techniques, that ""include a final stage allowing infliction of pain on children"", featured strongly in the Panorama programme and ""appeared to enable an environment of increased risk of abuse to children"". ""Children reported that having pain inflicted on them was a highly unpleasant experience,"" the report said. The case review recommended a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) review of the authorisation of pain-inducing restraint on children detained in young offenders institutions and secure training centres considers alternative techniques used in secure children's homes. It points out that restraint involving pain is not used at those homes, even though they house ""equally challenging"" children. The report said Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons had madeprevious recommendations,externalto the MoJ that the use of pain-inflicting techniques on children in secure training centres (STCs) and young offenders institutions should be stopped. Justice minister Edward Argar told the House of Commons in September: ""The government has committed to review the use of pain-inducing techniques in systems of restraint used on those under the age of 18 years in custodial and escort situations. ""We are finalising the scope and timetable for the review, which we expect to be agreed shortly."" The 65-page report states that ""staff were recruited to the STC without previous experience of working with children, or with the necessary behaviours, values and attitudes"". G4S's report to the review said some staff had never worked with young people before, but all those subject to the allegations had undertaken relevant training. There was also an operational whistle-blowing policy in place and a culture ""of openness and honesty"", it said. The most worrying aspect of this detailed review is that the many organisations involved at Medway simply hadn't identified or addressed the problems which Panorama highlighted. Reports of crimes committed against children were ""stymied"", there were ""serious deficiencies"" in the way the local authority handled allegations; safeguarding officials failed to analyse complaints properly. In short, the voices of young people detained at Medway went unheard. Ultimately, of course, responsibility for the failings rested with G4S, which managed the centre: the company paid the price through the loss of its contract. But everyone in this sector - including children's charities, police officers and watchdogs - should read this report because there are lessons for all of them. The review said improvements had been made at the Medway training centre, but it made 38 recommendations. These including listening more to children and whistleblowers, improving training, and improving how the Ministry of Justice monitors its contracts. Medway Secure Training Centre offers secure provision for children aged between 12 and 18 Medway Council also came in for criticism, with the department responsible for managing allegations of abuse against people who work with children described as having acted in an ""erratic and ineffective"" manner. However, the SCR report said there appeared to be ""a good understanding of the duties by all"" at Medway Children's Social Care, and the direct work by the Medway Youth Offending Team with the children was ""of a high standard"". G4S staff cleared of youth jail misconduct Young offenders 'watch porn on TV' Medway unit to get bedroom phone The SCR report concluded: ""Had a number of arrangements been more effective there were opportunities to prevent the abuse of children. ""Local and national agencies and the multi-agency processes to monitor the STC were not effective in identifying and responding and monitoring allegations of abuse meant children were not kept safe."" John Drew, independent chairman of the Medway Safeguarding Children Board, which published the serious case review's findings, said it was ""clear there were many lessons to be learnt by a number of agencies"". Jerry Petherick, managing director of G4S Custodial and Detention Services, described the behaviour of some staff at the centre in 2016 as  ""completely unacceptable, and in stark contrast to our training and values"". ""I am confident that we are an organisation that learns and improves,""  he said. A spokesman for the MoJ said: ""We have made significant changes at Medway and across the wider estate since these allegations of abuse were brought to light. ""Medway's last inspection report showed some improvement to safety and we will continue working tirelessly to raise its standards."" Ian Sutherland, director of children and adult services at Medway Council, said: ""We fully accept the recommendations in the serious case review and will be addressing these as a matter of priority. ""Substantial changes have already been made to the local authority designated officer service and these changes, which were made in 2017, addressed many of the points raised following external inspection and reviews."" The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to prosecute nine people in connection with behaviour towards children in the centre. Offences included misconduct in public office and common assault. All nine pleaded not guilty. Following trials, juries found seven of the defendants not guilty. Verdicts were not reached on the remaining two cases and the CPS said a retrial would ""not be appropriate"".

AFP news agency said that ""no signal from either one of the two captains"" had been received. Authorities in the Crimean city of Kerch are now preparing to receive the victims. The crew members were sailing in ""neutral waters"" in the Black Sea when the incident occurred, authorities said. The names of the two vessels, the Venice and the Maestro, both appear on a US treasury list,externalas possible targets for sanctions over petroleum shipments to Syria. The US tightened sanctions against Syria back in 2011 in response to what it said was President Bashar al-Assad's ""continued atrocities"" committed against the Syrian people. The Kerch Strait is a focus of tension between Russia and Ukraine. In November, Russian border guards seized three Ukrainian naval vessels near the narrow channel, which links the Black Sea with the Sea of Azov. Russia-Ukraine tensions rise after Kerch Strait ship capture A court in Russia has extended by three months the detention of 24 Ukrainian sailors captured in the incident. They are accused of illegally crossing into Russian territory. Ukraine condemned the Russian move, denying that its ships had violated the navigation laws in the area.

Google hit with ÃÂ£44m GDPR fine,"Google has been fined 50 million euros (Â£44m) by the French data regulator CNIL, for a breach of the EU's data protection rules.

Simon Mayo joins new classical station,"Former BBC Radio 2 DJ Simon Mayo is to lead the line-up on a new classical music radio station. Mayo, who left his Radio 2 drivetime show just before Christmas, will host a mid-morning show on Scala Radio when it launches on 4 March. The station will hope to win listeners from BBC Radio 3 and Classic FM. Mayo said the digital station would be different to its rivals because ""we're going all out to entertain, laugh with the listeners and have a good time"". The station's owners Bauer Media said Mayo's new show would include celebrity interviews, listener interaction and a classical version of the long-running Confessions feature from his Radio 1 and Radio 2 days. ""There are hundreds of radio stations playing rock and pop, and only two classical music stations up until now,"" Mayo said. ""We're different because we're going all out to entertain, laugh with the listeners, and have a good time. Some of it will be familiar, some new and exciting but all timeless, beautiful and all absolutely relevant to today"". Angellica Bell will host a weekend show Mayo presented Radio 2's drivetime slot for eight years, co-presenting with Jo Whiley for the final seven months. But their show was scrappedafter a backlash from listeners, with Whiley moving back to evenings and Sara Cox taking over drivetime.

May condemns Derry bomb attack,"This video can not be played The moment the bomb exploded on Saturday Three security alerts in Londonderry - triggered when two vehicles were hijacked by masked men and a delivery van was abandoned - have ended. Police said residents have been allowed to return to their homes following the alerts, which were confirmed as hoaxes. An alert in north Belfast on Monday night has also been confirmed as a hoax. The disruption in Derry came 48 hours after a bomb exploded in the city. The area around the courthouse in Bishop Street, where the bomb exploded in a car on Saturday, has reopened. Grandfather's shock over Derry bomb The PSNI have said Saturday's bomb attack may have been carried out by dissident republican group the New IRA. Four out of five men held over the bombing have been released. A 50-year-old man arrested on Monday remains in police custody. Members of the DUP are to meet Northern Ireland's chief constable on Tuesday morning to discuss recent incidents in the city and the ongoing dissident republican threat. A number of residents were moved from their homes as police deal with an abandoned vehicle on the Northland Road Police said that while the alerts were hoaxes ""we cannot underestimate the impact these incidents have had on our community"". ""The occupants of the hijacked vehicles did not believe when they set out for work this morning that they would be threatened by masked men,"" said Supt Gordon McCalmont. ""The residents in Circular Road, Southway and Northland Road did not wake up today expecting to be asked to leave their homes for their own safety. ""Too many people were affected because of the deliberate and anti-community actions of a few."" Timeline of Irish dissident activity Four arrests over 'reckless' attack Bomb explodes in car at courthouse Bomb was 'pointless act of terror' On Monday, the Army was called to two security alerts in the city involving reported hijackings. Army bomb disposal officers carried out a controlled explosion in Creggan's Circular Road after a vehicle was hijacked by three masked men at 11:30 GMT on Monday. The second alert on Southway, also in Creggan, followed reports of a vehicle being hijacked by four masked men at 13:45 GMT. In a third incident, police responded to a report of an abandoned lorry on the Northland Road close to the Glenbank Road junction and St Mary's College. In north Belfast, a controlled explosion was carried out on a suspicious object in the area of Springfield Road and Lanark Way. Residents returned to their home shortly after midnight. This video can not be played 'This House stands with Northern Ireland' St Mary's College in Derry will be open to staff and pupils on Tuesday morning. The school principal Marie Lindsay told BBC Radio Foyle that additional support will be provided for students who may have been affected by the security alert. A number of residents were moved from their homes. A nearby community centre was opened to people who were affected. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Housing Executive said one of their vans was hijacked and that a contractor they work with has withdrawn services in the Bishop Street, Brandywell, Creggan, Rosemount and Rossville areas until further notice. SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said the area was largely populated by older people. ""When you see frail pensioners in their late 80s and 90s being forced to leave their homes in their dressing gowns, it really is despicable. ""There is a huge sense of anxiety right across the city, and a huge sense of anger right across the city and understandably so,"" he said. What is the New IRA? The New IRA wasformed in 2012after a number of dissident republican organisations said they were unifying under one leadership It is believed to be the largestdissident republican organisation The group is believed to have been responsible for a number of attacks since its formation, including the murders of prison officersDavid BlackandAdrian Ismay. In a post on the PSNI Foyle Facebook page, police also confirmed that ""there has been an attempted hijacking of a local bus service"" in the Galliagh area of the city. Saturday'sbomb exploded outside the city's courthouse on Bishop Streetshortly after a pizza delivery vehicle was hijacked at gun point. A CCTV clip posted on Twitter by police showed a group of seven young people walking past the vehicle shortly before the blast. This video can not be played A timeline of events leading up to the explosion in Derry Addressing MPs in the Commons on Monday afternoon, Prime Minister Theresa May said: ""This house stands together with the people of Northern Ireland in ensuring that we never go back to the violence and terror of the past."" Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told MPs those behind the attack ""will never succeed"". ""Londonderry is a city that has thrived since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement 20 years ago - everyone can see that - and one that will continue to grow and develop despite the actions of those who seek to sow discord and division,"" she said. The alert at Southway is the second in the Creggan area of the city DUP leader Arlene Foster tweeted that the PSNI ""needs our full support to remove those responsible from our streets"". Sinn FÃ©in councillor Kevin Campbell said there can be ""no justification for this type of reckless activity"". ""Those responsible for this disruption have shown complete disregard for the people of Creggan, particularly elderly people who live in this area,"" he said. Houses were evacuated in the Creggan area At the courthouse in Derry, scheduled jury trials have been put off until Wednesday. Cases listed to be heard in the magistrates' courts were being held in Strabane, with some other hearings switching to Coleraine,external. A forensic officer examines the remains of the vehicle following Saturday night's explosion PSNI Supt Gordon McCalmont told BBC Radio Foyle the police were trying to get the city back to normal and show the attack had ""little or no long-term impact"". He said the PSNI was ""lucky we are not talking about loss of life"". Supt McCalmont also said the pizza delivery driver whose vehicle was hijacked and used in Saturday's bombing ""had to go through the drama of having a firearm put to his head"". ""He was threatened and intimidated. It would be fair to say he was asked not to raise the alarm."" He added: ""These groupings obviously want us to respond. We will be very balanced. This threat has always been in this city. ""My sense is that this is not because of Brexit.""

Law to target non-physical domestic abuse,"Claire Throssell - with her sons Jack and Paul - was cross-examined by her abuser in court Non-physical and economic abuse are to be included in the first legal definition of domestic abuse as part of a landmark overhaul of the law. Under thedraft laws,external, a wide range of measures will also include domestic abusers being banned from cross-examining victims in family courts. The home secretary said the changes would ""bolster protection for victims"". Campaigners say the measures are a ""once in a generation"" opportunity to combat the impact of abuse. Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, the director of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse, said adding economic abuse to the legal definition was ""highly significant"" and would give victims ""more confidence"" when they came forward. The draft bill going before MPs will also: Create new powers to force perpetrators into behaviour-changing rehabilitation programmes Make victims automatically eligible for special protections when they are giving evidence in criminal trials Set up a national ""domestic abuse commissioner"" tasked with improving the response and support for victims across public services The definition of domestic abuse will specifically recognise that it goes beyond crimes of violence and includes victims who are psychologically coerced and manipulated, as well as those who have no control of their finances. The legislation will also clarify the workings of ""Clare's Law"" - a measure introduced four years ago to permit police to tell a member of the public if there are concerns over about previous violence committed by their partner. Domestic abuse: Majority of controlling cases dropped Coercive control: How father's abuse turned into murder 'My mum killed my dad with a hammer but I want her freed' One woman, who has suffered abuse from different partners, told the BBC described how one of them controlled her spending. She said: ""When I got a job he said to me, 'Well you've been bankrupt' - I'd gone through bankruptcy with my first marriage, I'd had a business that had gone through - all related to that abuse I was enduring, so he said, 'Well you can't possibly look after your finances on your own, I'll take control of that for you, so pay your salary into my account.' ""Which of course I did, and then he said, 'I'll pay you a weekly allowance.' I then had to account for every single penny I was spending and if I didn't use it, I had to give it back."" Anothervictim of domestic abuse, Claire Throssell,from Sheffield, was cross-examined by her husband - after they had separated - during two separate court hearings over access to their two children. Her husband went on to kill her two sons in a house fire. Talking about coming face-to-face with her ex-partner in court, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""All the evidence was there but he was still trying to control, so you feel like you're still that piece of dirt underneath his shoe. ""How dare I take him to court, how dare I keep the children away from him? ""It was a good job I had a solicitor there because when you've been told for long enough that you can't do something, whenever you see the person that's installed that in you - and it is installed for years and years and years - you instantly curl up again inside and you instantly feel again worthless."" Justice Secretary David Gauke said the cross-examination by abusers of their victims in family courts could cause ""immense distress"" and amount to ""a continuation of abuse"". This video can not be played Claire Throssell's sons, Jack and Paul, were killed by her ex-husband Victoria Atkins, Minister for Crime, Safeguarding and Vulnerability, said: ""I have heard absolutely heartbreaking accounts of victims whose lives have been ripped apart because of the physical, emotional or economic abuse they have suffered by someone close to them. ""The draft domestic abuse bill recognises the complex nature of these horrific crimes and puts the needs of victims and their families at the forefront."" But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said survivors of domestic violence had waited too long for the plans. ""If the Tories are serious about combating domestic violence, then there should be long-term funding commitments to ensure sufficient resources are available for abuse survivors,"" she said. Theresa May promised to overhaul domestic abuse laws almost two years ago - and the bill was a key pledge in the 2017 Queen's Speech. The public consultation closed eight months ago - and only now are we seeing the final package. So, given government is so pre-occupied with Brexit, it's not clear when there will be Parliamentary time to turn the measures into law. Campaigners say the plans must be a national priority - not least because of the government's staggering estimate of the costs supports what they have said for years. The Â£66bn figure is an estimate of the full impact of perpetrators on society - not just the cost of clearing up a specific crime. One housing association in Sunderland, for example,spent Â£8m on repairs,externalsuspected to be linked to domestic violence. There are many other hidden impacts, including the damaged life chances for children scarred by what they experience. Sandra Horley, chief executive of the charity Refuge, welcomed the draft bill - saying it was a ""once in a generation"" opportunity. And Suzanne Jacob, head of SafeLives, said: ""For too long, we've expected victims and children to uproot their lives while the perpetrators remain invisible and unchallenged by the system. ""The new change in approach reflects what hundreds of survivors told SafeLives they wanted - we're pleased the government is listening.""

Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. MPs voted on a series of amendments designed to change the direction of Brexit. House of CommonsParliament And with that, the day in the Commons comes to an end. There was a distinct Brexit flavour to the start of the day, with questions to Brexit ministers and an urgent question about government attempts to roll over EU trade deals. The Brexit discussion also continued during the business statement, with a number of MPs asking procedural questions about next Tuesday'sbig Brexit votes in Parliament. After this, Prisons Minister Rory Stewart pledged to act on a report about the supervision of sex offenders in prison or on probation. The afternoon saw MPs call for greater education about the Holocaust, during a debate to mark this Sunday's Holocaust Memorial Day. A debate on treatment for people with ME saw a number of MPs call for more research into the condition and greater understanding of challenges faced by sufferers. House of LordsParliament The debate on climate change finishes - and the House of Lords finishes for the day. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Energy Minister Lord Henley says the entire country has played a part in reducing carbon emissions, and there seems to be a conscious effort among the younger generation to make a change. We are already seeing the impact of climate change both in the UK and globally, he says, noting that ""we cannot say how devastating a rise in temperatures by 3 degrees could be"". He says the government is investing Â£2.6bn before 2021 to reduce flood and coastal erosion risks, and  is taking the challenge of climate change ""extremely seriously"". The government is serious about decarbonising the economy and ""not being complacent"", he adds, disagreeing with the view that the government has ""chopped and changed"" its climate change strategy. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Summing up for Labour, Lord Grantchester says the time to identify new ways to tackle climate change is running out. He adds that more can be done with housing and energy efficiency, and since 2015 the government has ""undermined"" the establishment of new renewable energies. He questions whether the government is looking far enough into the future, suggesting that the focus remains on short-term fixes which will not be enough. ""The government needs to invest in a green economy, new skills and new industries"", he adds. Adjournment Debate House of CommonsParliament Sports Minister Mims Davies says fans have a right to raise concerns about the management of their clubs, with all football clubs required to have an ""open dialogue"" with fans. The government has taken further steps by asking the FA to carry out an intense review of football club ownership, she says. Current owner and directors tests have been strengthened, whilst new owners have to provide sources and sufficiency of funding in place, she adds. ""I am unafraid to go further and to give more focus to this...we will continue to look for a fair deal for fans"", she says. On Newcastle United, she says ""to the best of our knowledge, Newcastle's owner is complying...and the club is meeting all requirements of meeting with supporters"". That does not mean Mike Ashley could not go further however, pointing out that it will be far easier for him to sell the club if he looks after it. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Summing up for the Liberal Democrats, Lord Redesdale says flooding poses a severe threat as the UK's drainage system is still designed for the 1950s. He says it is important everyone makes small changes to their lives to help the planet, which on a large scale will make a big difference. Lord Redesdale says the UK is on the right track to tackling climate change, but ""there is always more that can be done"". Adjournment Debate House of CommonsParliament MPs now turn to the adjournment debate, which tonight is led by Labour MP Chi Onwurah and focuses on the regulation of Newcastle United FC. She says that since today's debate was announced, she has been able to hold a ""robust"" meeting with the club's owner - and Sports Direct owner - Mike Ashley about his running of the club. She calls on Newcastle fans to refrain from ""personal attacks"" against him, adding that they are ""wrong and hurt our cause"". The club's financial accounts are not accessible, she says, but there is considerable concern among fans that money is not being used appropriately. ""Why is it that football is left to regulate itself, when social media companies and other businesses must meet social requirements?"", she asks. She calls for an inquiry into the financial reporting requirements of Premier League clubs, using Newcastle United ""as a test case"". Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat MP Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer says one of the worst threats of climate change will be the effect of extreme weather on the agricultural system. She notes that it is 46 degrees in parts of Australia today, and the Central Land Council has said they could carry out an emergency cull of 120 horses, goats and donkeys that are dying in the heatwave. The UK needs to change the way it produces food and the population need to change its diet, she says, although noting that there is ""no need"" for everyone to give up meat altogether. Conservative peer the Earl of Caithness says the West is ""terribly good at thinking we're good at tackling climate change"", but there is more to be done. He adds that members of all parties should work together in the interest of the planet, and listen to expert advice. Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up for the government, Health Minister Steve Brine says they ""do not for one minute underestimate ME"". ""But the truth is we do not understand the underlying causes of it...there is currently no cure for it"", he says. The medical profession ""have had a bad rap today"", he says, ""and some of it's deserved"". Whilst trainee doctors would benefit from greater training, qualified doctors have a responsibility to keep up to date. NICE is updating its guidance for ME, he adds. The government seeks to ""stimulate the research community"" to come forward with the best applications, but often ME research proposals are lacking in sufficient quality. Concluding the debate, SNP Carol Monaghan says there is excellent research already going on, but it is funded by charities, adding: ""government needs to take this seriously"". Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow health minister Sharon Hodgson says patients are often ""passed from pillar to post"" when seeking treatment, with huge delays in diagnosis that do not meet NICE guidelines. The government should do more, she says, ""and considering they don't currently do much, that isn't too much to ask"". Research funding from the government is ""long overdue"", she says, as research is currently completely done by charities, with some researchers even relying on crowdfunding. ""We must ensure that the stigma of ME is tackled"", she says. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Bethell says the key is to latch on to a large change in public opinion as now more than ever, people want to help protect the planet. He says UK emissions have been cut by 42%, faster than any other G7 nation, which is ""a hell of an achievement"" and ""should not be underestimated"". Lord Bethell says everyone must work harder to ""shore up the political consensus"", and this can be done by talking about an optimistic future. ""We have to try and create a sense of opportunity,"" he adds, ""we cannot inspire only through fear"". Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament DUP MP Jim Shannon says ME affects 25,000 children in the UK and is said to be the leading cause of long-term school absence due to illness. He says people suffering from the condition are repeatedly turned down for personal independence payments (PIPs), a kind of disability benefit. The system needs to move away from the ""if it can't be tested, it can't be helped"" approach. SNP MP Philippa Whitford says many sufferers resent ME being referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome, she says, because it ""sounds so trivial"". A better description would be ""chronic exhaustion syndrome"", she says. She says it is hard for doctors to help because it is so hard to prove a patient is suffering from ME and not something else, whilst there is no known effective treatment or cure. It is ""quite sinister"", she adds, that some previous research into ME was funded by the Department of Work & Pensions, which she says has penalised suffers. Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament Plaid Cymru Ben Lake says ME affects more people than Parkinson's disease and MS combined, yet it receives just 0.02% of research funding. ""We simply cannot wait any longer"", he says. Labour MP Nick Thomas-Symonds says there needs to be far greater awareness and research on ME. He echoes Ben Lake in pointing out how little research funding it receives compared to other illnesses. The World Health Organisation classifies ME as a neurological condition, he points out, suggesting that for warrants greater attention, rather than it being treated as a psychological condition as it currently is. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Sheehan says it is time to stop the ""blanket subsidy"" to fossil fuel power. A fundamental change is needed in the industries we want to support, she says, calling for green energy to be at the forefront of new industrial projects. The malign effects of climate change are felt across the globe, she adds, noting that it is not about placing blame on a particular country on industry, but ensuring everyone takes more responsibility. ""Fossil fuels have had their day, it's time to stop using them and clean up after them,"" she says. Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament There are a relatively large number of MPs still looking to speak in today's backbench business debate on ME treatment, which can only continue until 5pm. As a result, Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing has had to impose a time limit on speeches of three minutes. Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Nicky Morgan says more research into ME could improve treatment, but even ""having a GP who not only believes you but wants to help...would make a huge difference."" Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck says women are often treated as lazy or hysterical when suffering from ME, and risk being stripped of benefits when they are unable to work. Those doctors who want to help risk being ""hauled up"" by the General Medical Council, she says, but often patients are just dismissed. ""There must be nothing worse for someone knowing how ill they are than being told it's all in their head and being sneered at by the very professionals and organisations that should be supporting them"", she adds. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Over in the Lords, Liberal Democrat peer Lord Teverson has opened a debate on the threats presented by climate change. He says the increase in temperatures is already 1 degree above pre-industrial levels, bringing the risks of extreme weather, flooding and sea level rises. ""Progress has been made"", he says, ""but this is something that still needs to be tackled as the clock is ticking"". In the last two years global emissions went up by 1.6%, Lord Teverson says, acknowledging that most of this growth comes from China and India. He suggests that investment in renewable energy is falling because a previous budget from former Chancellor George Osborne reduced incentives to build zero-emission homes. Â© 2025 BBC.

Kuenssberg: Sticking with plan?,"On the face of it, there is nothing remotely surprising about Theresa May telling her Cabinet colleagues last night that she wants to have another go at trying to sort out the backstop. The political implication of that is that she still thinks it is better at this stage for her to pursue a strategy that might just about conceivably see, in the end after a lot more wrangling, a version of her deal squeak through the House of Commons with support from her own MPs and having kissed and made up with the DUP. Right now that seems a long way off of course, and it might prove impossible. But the view at the top of government is that, on balance, this is the better choice. There are plenty of MPs and some in government on the other side of this argument who think it is not much short of insane to keep going with a strategy that has been so roundly kicked out by the Commons. You hear a lot of quoting of Einstein, who claimed the definition of insanity was doing the same thing over and over and expecting different results. (Although as so often there is a row over whether he actually said that at all) And while it's scoffed at, some people in government believe in the end the EU might budge and that Ireland might be persuaded to look at a separate agreement to sort out the backstop. (Don't all scream at once, I know how far off that looks at the moment). May seeks way to break Brexit deadlock Brexit: A really simple guide Brexit: What could happen next? Remember, Theresa May just isn't the kind of politician who was ever going to tear up her Plan A overnight, however irritating it might be to some of her own ministers like the one who told me last week she would haveto budge at ""five past seven"". This doesn't of course mean in theory that the cross-party process is over. There are more talks between various MPs and senior ministers today. But one senior MP involved in the process believes the problem is that by suggesting compromise in the Commons in the wake of defeat last week, then telling ministers Plan B is basically Plan A last night, the PM has ""burned up the goodwill"". If she wasn't going to budge, what was the point of implying that she might? In theory the point was, of course, that it's highly likely she will in the end need to compromise, and that every vote will count. But one source joked that she won't do it until ""she's in a half-Nelson"" - the reality is by then, those MPs who were willing to help last week may have concluded, as some already have, that if she won't budge, Parliament will simply grab hold of the process when it comes to the vote next week.

Fox: MPs trying to steal Brexit,"This video can not be played Liam Fox: ""We can compromise... with the European Union over the backstop"" Brexiteer cabinet minister Liam Fox has accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to ""steal Brexit"", amid backbench moves to take control of the process. He told the BBC: ""You've got a Leave population and a Remain Parliament. Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process."" There are various backbench moves to prevent the UK leaving the European Union without a deal on 29 March. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said the PM should rule out a no-deal Brexit. He said he believed it was ""inevitable"" that Article 50 would be delayed and that events in Parliament last week - whenMPs heavily rejected the withdrawal dealTheresa May has negotiated with the EU - mean that another referendum was now more likely. He told the BBC the prime minister must also change her ""red lines"" adding: ""If she won't, it's difficult to see where we go from here."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We're facing a possible no deal and therefore a public vote"" On Monday, Theresa May will make a statement to MPs setting out how she intends to proceed with Brexit, amid apparent deadlock in Parliament over a way forward. She will also table a motion to be debated and voted on, on 29 January. It is expected that various MPs will try to amend that motion over the course of the next week to put forward proposals to test the will of the Commons. International Trade Secretary Mr Fox told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process because Parliament has said to the people of this country: 'We make a contract with you, you will make the decision and we will honour it.' Brexit: A really simple guide Liam Fox yet to seal no-deal trade agreements Theresa May should become mediator, says Sir John Major ""What we are now getting are some of those who were always absolutely opposed to the result of the referendum, trying to hijack Brexit and, in fact, steal the result from the people."" He warned that, if the referendum result was not honoured: ""The consequences politically would be astronomical"" Mr Fox also said that he believed the way to break the deadlock was to win over more Conservative MPs to the PM's deal by finding a ""different mechanism"" to the controversial ""backstop"" proposal, to prevent a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Two cross-party groups involving Labour's Yvette Cooper, and Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve are planning on tabling bills that could take a no-deal Brexit off the table Various MPs are likely to try to amend the PM's ""neutral"" motion - simply saying that the Commons has considered the PM's statement - which Theresa May will put forward on Monday. One group, including Labour's Yvette Cooper, the Conservative former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, and Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, among others, want the UK to extend its negotiations with the EU beyond 29 March - if MPs do not approve a withdrawal agreement by 26 February. Please upgrade your browser MPs voted in favour ofinvoking Article 50of the Lisbon Treaty - which allows the UK and EU two years to negotiate the terms of Brexit - in 2017 and the 29 March date is in UK legislation - the EU Withdrawal Act. Ms Morgan told Sky News the law would have to be changed if the UK was to be prevented from leaving the EU without a deal in place - and that is where the ""very short"" bill she is backing came in. Meanwhile Conservative Remainer Dominic Grieve wants backbench MPs to be able to choose to debate and vote on Brexit issues, one day a week - breaking with the usual practice where the government controls the parliamentary timetable. Mr Grieve said those debates could then give an indication to the government about what the Commons wanted. ""My intention is not to stop Brexit,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House. ""My intention has always been to try to ensure that the government is forced to listen to what the majority view of the House of Commons is on this."" But Conservative Brexiteer Peter Bone said Mr Grieve had ""lost the plot"" and his plan would not get through Parliament. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent The government is continuing to look at ideas to end the deadlock in Parliament over Brexit. The key one Liam Fox was alluding to this morning is finding an alternative to the ""backstop"". But some MPs are now so angry with the government, they want to take control. Dominic Grieve's plan would allow Parliament to put its own ideas forward and be voted on. The working plan is 300 MPs would have to back a proposal for it to be discussed. A majority would have to then back it for it to be approved. The battle for control of Plan B is well under way. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the formal route for any country leaving the EU and it allows for a two-year process of negotiation. At the end of that period ""the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question"" unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. Brexit: What happens now? No-deal Brexit: Can Parliament stop it? It was backed by MPsand invoked on 29 March 2017, meaning the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March this year. But the withdrawal agreement reached by the EU and UK wasrejected by MPs by 432 votes to 202 on Tuesday. If MPs do not approve a deal, the UK is due to leave the EU without one, which would mean trade reverting to World Trade Organization rules. To extend Article 50, the UK would first have to make a request to the EU - which could be granted if all EU countries agree at a vote of the EU Council. Then it would have to table a statutory instrument to change the definition of ""exit day"" in the UK's EU Withdrawal Act. MPs would get a chance to vote on this change. According to anEuropean Court of Justice ruling in December, the UK could choose to cancel Brexit altogether without seeking the permission of the rest of the EU - something the government says it has no intention of doing.

'Landmark' overhaul for domestic abuse laws,"Claire Throssell - with her sons Jack and Paul - was cross-examined by her abuser in court Non-physical and economic abuse are to be included in the first legal definition of domestic abuse as part of a landmark overhaul of the law. Under thedraft laws,external, a wide range of measures will also include domestic abusers being banned from cross-examining victims in family courts. The home secretary said the changes would ""bolster protection for victims"". Campaigners say the measures are a ""once in a generation"" opportunity to combat the impact of abuse. Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, the director of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse, said adding economic abuse to the legal definition was ""highly significant"" and would give victims ""more confidence"" when they came forward. The draft bill going before MPs will also: Create new powers to force perpetrators into behaviour-changing rehabilitation programmes Make victims automatically eligible for special protections when they are giving evidence in criminal trials Set up a national ""domestic abuse commissioner"" tasked with improving the response and support for victims across public services The definition of domestic abuse will specifically recognise that it goes beyond crimes of violence and includes victims who are psychologically coerced and manipulated, as well as those who have no control of their finances. The legislation will also clarify the workings of ""Clare's Law"" - a measure introduced four years ago to permit police to tell a member of the public if there are concerns over about previous violence committed by their partner. Domestic abuse: Majority of controlling cases dropped Coercive control: How father's abuse turned into murder 'My mum killed my dad with a hammer but I want her freed' One woman, who has suffered abuse from different partners, told the BBC described how one of them controlled her spending. She said: ""When I got a job he said to me, 'Well you've been bankrupt' - I'd gone through bankruptcy with my first marriage, I'd had a business that had gone through - all related to that abuse I was enduring, so he said, 'Well you can't possibly look after your finances on your own, I'll take control of that for you, so pay your salary into my account.' ""Which of course I did, and then he said, 'I'll pay you a weekly allowance.' I then had to account for every single penny I was spending and if I didn't use it, I had to give it back."" Anothervictim of domestic abuse, Claire Throssell,from Sheffield, was cross-examined by her husband - after they had separated - during two separate court hearings over access to their two children. Her husband went on to kill her two sons in a house fire. Talking about coming face-to-face with her ex-partner in court, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""All the evidence was there but he was still trying to control, so you feel like you're still that piece of dirt underneath his shoe. ""How dare I take him to court, how dare I keep the children away from him? ""It was a good job I had a solicitor there because when you've been told for long enough that you can't do something, whenever you see the person that's installed that in you - and it is installed for years and years and years - you instantly curl up again inside and you instantly feel again worthless."" Justice Secretary David Gauke said the cross-examination by abusers of their victims in family courts could cause ""immense distress"" and amount to ""a continuation of abuse"". This video can not be played Claire Throssell's sons, Jack and Paul, were killed by her ex-husband Victoria Atkins, Minister for Crime, Safeguarding and Vulnerability, said: ""I have heard absolutely heartbreaking accounts of victims whose lives have been ripped apart because of the physical, emotional or economic abuse they have suffered by someone close to them. ""The draft domestic abuse bill recognises the complex nature of these horrific crimes and puts the needs of victims and their families at the forefront."" But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said survivors of domestic violence had waited too long for the plans. ""If the Tories are serious about combating domestic violence, then there should be long-term funding commitments to ensure sufficient resources are available for abuse survivors,"" she said. Theresa May promised to overhaul domestic abuse laws almost two years ago - and the bill was a key pledge in the 2017 Queen's Speech. The public consultation closed eight months ago - and only now are we seeing the final package. So, given government is so pre-occupied with Brexit, it's not clear when there will be Parliamentary time to turn the measures into law. Campaigners say the plans must be a national priority - not least because of the government's staggering estimate of the costs supports what they have said for years. The Â£66bn figure is an estimate of the full impact of perpetrators on society - not just the cost of clearing up a specific crime. One housing association in Sunderland, for example,spent Â£8m on repairs,externalsuspected to be linked to domestic violence. There are many other hidden impacts, including the damaged life chances for children scarred by what they experience. Sandra Horley, chief executive of the charity Refuge, welcomed the draft bill - saying it was a ""once in a generation"" opportunity. And Suzanne Jacob, head of SafeLives, said: ""For too long, we've expected victims and children to uproot their lives while the perpetrators remain invisible and unchallenged by the system. ""The new change in approach reflects what hundreds of survivors told SafeLives they wanted - we're pleased the government is listening.""

TV host jailed for interviewing gay man,"TV host Mohamed al-Gheity has himself expressed views against homosexuality in the past An Egyptian TV presenter has been sentenced to one year of hard labour for interviewing a gay man last year. A court in Giza also fined Mohamed al-Ghiety 3,000 Egyptian pounds ($167; Â£130) for ""promoting homosexuality"" on his privately owned LTC TV channel. The gay man, whose identity was hidden, had talked about life as a sex worker. Homosexuality is not explicitly criminalised in Egypt, however, the authorities have been increasingly cracking down on the LGBT community. They routinely arrest people suspected of engaging in consensual homosexual conduct on charges of ""debauchery"", immorality or blasphemy. Egypt 'escalates LGBT crackdown' Egypt takes harsh line towards artists and authors The most recent case came about after lawyer Samir Sabry, who is well known in Egypt for taking celebrities to court, filed a lawsuit against Ghiety for his interview which took place in August 2018. The TV host, who has voiced homophobic views on a number of occasions, spoke to a gay man who expressed regret over his sexuality and described life as a prostitute. The man's face had been blurred to conceal his identity. Egypt's top media body, the Supreme Council for Media Regulation, immediately took the channel off air for two weeks, citing ""professional violations"". The prosecuting lawyer, Mr Sabry, accused the TV host of revealing there to be financial gains of ""practising homosexuality"", state-owned al-Ahram newspaper reports. In addition to the jail term and fine, the misdemeanours court also ordered Ghiety to be put under surveillance for one year after serving his sentence, Mr Sabry said. The verdict could be appealed against and suspended if Ghiety paid bail of 1,000 Egyptian pounds, pending the appeal's outcome, he added. Egyptians have seen a crackdown on homosexuals intensify since the rainbow flag incident two years ago Egypt's media council banned homosexuals from appearing on any media outlet after a rainbow flag was raised at a concert in Cairo in 2017, in a rare public show of support for the LGBT community in the conservative, mainly Muslim country. A crackdown was also launched on suspected homosexualswith dozens of people arrested, in a move decried by human rights groups. The authorities rely on a 1961 prostitution law that criminalises ""habitual debauchery"" to charge people who they suspect of engaging in consensual homosexual conduct. Mr Sabry was alsothe lawyer who filed a case against Egyptian actress Rania Youssefon charges of ""inciting debauchery"" over a see-through outfit she wore at an awards ceremony last year. He later dropped the case after Ms Youssef apologised. He has filed hundreds of similar cases in recent years.

German firm to control UK tanks business,"Work to upgrade and maintain the Challenger 2 tank is a potential future contract British defence giant BAE Systems has sold a majority stake in its Land UK tank and combat vehicle division to German rival Rheinmetall for Â£28.6m. The new joint venture gives Rheinmetall a 55% stake, with BAE owning the rest, and will be based at the UK firm's factory in Telford, Shropshire. Called Rheinmetall BAE Systems Land, the venture will produce the British Army's new infantry vehicles. BAE's Land UK is competing to upgrade and maintain the Challenger 2 tank. About 400 people work at the main Telford factory, and at sites in Washington, Filton and Bovington. The new venture will not include Land UK's munitions and technology interests. BAE said the combination of Rheinmetall's military vehicles technology and products, together with BAE's capabilities, would create a European market leader in the military vehicle sector with the potential to create new jobs in the UK. Jennifer Osbaldestin, managing director of the Land UK business, said: ""Joining forces with Rheinmetall in the UK provides renewed purpose for our vehicles business and allows us to deliver products, services and technology that help land forces excel in their vital roles."" The UK operation, which also maintains the Warrior armoured vehicle, generates revenues of about Â£60m a year. Ben Hudson, global head of Rheinmetall's vehicle systems division, said: ""The combined capabilities of our two great companies will offer our customers a comprehensive portfolio of military vehicles and associated technologies both now and into the future. ""We are proud to invest in the UK and expect to substantially grow the current business and the Telford manufacturing facility over the coming years."" Rheinmetall already leads a consortium, called Artec, that will build the new Boxer armoured vehicle for the British Army. The UK government has said that 60% of the value of the programme must be delivered in the UK, and BAE said the new joint venture gives it a central role in the contract.

Second security alert after weekend bomb,"This video can not be played The moment the bomb exploded on Saturday Three security alerts in Londonderry - triggered when two vehicles were hijacked by masked men and a delivery van was abandoned - have ended. Police said residents have been allowed to return to their homes following the alerts, which were confirmed as hoaxes. An alert in north Belfast on Monday night has also been confirmed as a hoax. The disruption in Derry came 48 hours after a bomb exploded in the city. The area around the courthouse in Bishop Street, where the bomb exploded in a car on Saturday, has reopened. Grandfather's shock over Derry bomb The PSNI have said Saturday's bomb attack may have been carried out by dissident republican group the New IRA. Four out of five men held over the bombing have been released. A 50-year-old man arrested on Monday remains in police custody. Members of the DUP are to meet Northern Ireland's chief constable on Tuesday morning to discuss recent incidents in the city and the ongoing dissident republican threat. A number of residents were moved from their homes as police deal with an abandoned vehicle on the Northland Road Police said that while the alerts were hoaxes ""we cannot underestimate the impact these incidents have had on our community"". ""The occupants of the hijacked vehicles did not believe when they set out for work this morning that they would be threatened by masked men,"" said Supt Gordon McCalmont. ""The residents in Circular Road, Southway and Northland Road did not wake up today expecting to be asked to leave their homes for their own safety. ""Too many people were affected because of the deliberate and anti-community actions of a few."" Timeline of Irish dissident activity Four arrests over 'reckless' attack Bomb explodes in car at courthouse Bomb was 'pointless act of terror' On Monday, the Army was called to two security alerts in the city involving reported hijackings. Army bomb disposal officers carried out a controlled explosion in Creggan's Circular Road after a vehicle was hijacked by three masked men at 11:30 GMT on Monday. The second alert on Southway, also in Creggan, followed reports of a vehicle being hijacked by four masked men at 13:45 GMT. In a third incident, police responded to a report of an abandoned lorry on the Northland Road close to the Glenbank Road junction and St Mary's College. In north Belfast, a controlled explosion was carried out on a suspicious object in the area of Springfield Road and Lanark Way. Residents returned to their home shortly after midnight.

A number of residents were moved from their homes. A nearby community centre was opened to people who were affected. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Housing Executive said one of their vans was hijacked and that a contractor they work with has withdrawn services in the Bishop Street, Brandywell, Creggan, Rosemount and Rossville areas until further notice. SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said the area was largely populated by older people. ""When you see frail pensioners in their late 80s and 90s being forced to leave their homes in their dressing gowns, it really is despicable.

Breaking|Breaking newsGoogle hit with Â£44m GDPR fineGoogle has been fined 50 million euros (Â£44m) by the French data regulator CNIL.Technology,"Google has been fined 50 million euros (Â£44m) by the French data regulator CNIL, for a breach of the EU's data protection rules. CNIL said it had levied the record fine for ""lack of transparency, inadequate information and lack of valid consent regarding ads personalisation"". The regulator said it judged that people were ""not sufficiently informed"" about how Google collected data to personalise advertising. In a statement, Google said it was ""studying the decision"" to determine its next steps. Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix and Spotify face GDPR complaint Complaints against Google were filed in May 2018 by two privacy rights groups: noyb and La Quadrature du Net (LQDN). The first complaint under the EU's new General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) was filed on 25 May 2018, the day the legislation took effect. The groups claimed Google did not have a valid legal basis to process user data for ad personalisation, as mandated by the GDPR. This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? Although Google's European headquarters is in Ireland, it was decided among the authorities that the case would be handled by the French data regulator, since the Irish watchdog did not have ""decision-making power"" over its Android operating system and its services. The regulator said Google had not obtained clear consent to process data because ""essential information"" was ""disseminated across several documents"". ""The relevant information is accessible after several steps only, implying sometimes up to five or six actions,"" the regulator said. ""Users are not able to fully understand the extent of the processing operations carried out by Google."" Additionally, the regulator said Google had failed to obtain a valid legal basis to process user data. ""The information on processing operations for the ads personalisation is diluted in several documents and does not enable the user to be aware of their extent,"" it said. It said the option to personalise ads was ""pre-ticked"" when creating an account, which did not respect the GDPR rules. ""The user gives his or her consent in full, for all the processing operations purposes carried out by Google based on this consent (ads personalisation, speech recognition, etc). ""However, the GDPR provides that the consent is 'specific' only if it is given distinctly for each purpose."" The regulator said it was Google's ""utmost responsibility to comply with the obligations on the matter"". In a statement, Google said: ""People expect high standards of transparency and control from us. We're deeply committed to meeting those expectations and the consent requirements of the GDPR.""

"'Ancient' stone circle found to be replicaThe findings sparked excitement among archaeologists, who believed the stones to be thousands of years old.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","The recumbent stone circle was found to be about 20 years old An Aberdeenshire stone circle initially thought to be thousands of years old has been identified as a modern replica. An investigation into the site at the parish of Leochel-Cushnie found the stones to be about 20 years old. It was originally thought to be the site of a recumbent stone circle - until the man who built it came forward. The findings sparked excitement among experts and were widely reported. They were initially celebrated as an authentic recumbent stone circle by Adam Welfare of Historic Environment Scotland and Aberdeenshire Council's Archaeology Service. Further archaeological analysis of the stones was being conducted when a former owner of the farm contacted Mr Welfare to say he had built the stone circle in the 1990s. Neil Ackerman, historic environment record assistant at Aberdeenshire Council, said the development was ""disappointing"", but hoped the site would still be appreciated. He said: ""I hope the stones continue to be used and enjoyed - while not ancient it is still in a fantastic location and makes for a great feature in the landscape. ""These types of monument are notoriously difficult to date."" Recumbent stone circles were constructed about 3,500 to 4,500 years ago and are unique to the north east of Scotland. Their defining feature is a large horizontal stone flanked by two upright stones, usually situated between the south-east to south-west of the circle.

"Painful restraint of children challengedA report on abuse at Medway Secure Training Centre, Kent, calls for a new look at control methods.Kent","The centre is now run by HM Prison and Probation Service Painful restraint of children in young offenders institutions and secure training centres increases the risk of abuse, a serious case review has said. The restraint techniques are authorised in certain situations, but a BBC Panorama programme in 2016 showed mistreatment at a centre in Kent. G4S recruited staff with no experience of working with children, said the review. Sixteen people were later arrested. There were no convictions. G4S held the contract to run the Medway Secure Training Centre, Rochester, from 1998 to 2016, at which point the government took over. Theserious case review (SCR),externalsaid the use of restraint techniques, that ""include a final stage allowing infliction of pain on children"", featured strongly in the Panorama programme and ""appeared to enable an environment of increased risk of abuse to children"". ""Children reported that having pain inflicted on them was a highly unpleasant experience,"" the report said. The case review recommended a Ministry of Justice (MoJ) review of the authorisation of pain-inducing restraint on children detained in young offenders institutions and secure training centres considers alternative techniques used in secure children's homes. It points out that restraint involving pain is not used at those homes, even though they house ""equally challenging"" children. The report said Her Majesty's Inspector of Prisons had madeprevious recommendations,externalto the MoJ that the use of pain-inflicting techniques on children in secure training centres (STCs) and young offenders institutions should be stopped. Justice minister Edward Argar told the House of Commons in September: ""The government has committed to review the use of pain-inducing techniques in systems of restraint used on those under the age of 18 years in custodial and escort situations. ""We are finalising the scope and timetable for the review, which we expect to be agreed shortly."" The 65-page report states that ""staff were recruited to the STC without previous experience of working with children, or with the necessary behaviours, values and attitudes"". G4S's report to the review said some staff had never worked with young people before, but all those subject to the allegations had undertaken relevant training. There was also an operational whistle-blowing policy in place and a culture ""of openness and honesty"", it said. The most worrying aspect of this detailed review is that the many organisations involved at Medway simply hadn't identified or addressed the problems which Panorama highlighted. Reports of crimes committed against children were ""stymied"", there were ""serious deficiencies"" in the way the local authority handled allegations; safeguarding officials failed to analyse complaints properly. In short, the voices of young people detained at Medway went unheard. Ultimately, of course, responsibility for the failings rested with G4S, which managed the centre: the company paid the price through the loss of its contract. But everyone in this sector - including children's charities, police officers and watchdogs - should read this report because there are lessons for all of them. The review said improvements had been made at the Medway training centre, but it made 38 recommendations. These including listening more to children and whistleblowers, improving training, and improving how the Ministry of Justice monitors its contracts. Medway Secure Training Centre offers secure provision for children aged between 12 and 18 Medway Council also came in for criticism, with the department responsible for managing allegations of abuse against people who work with children described as having acted in an ""erratic and ineffective"" manner. However, the SCR report said there appeared to be ""a good understanding of the duties by all"" at Medway Children's Social Care, and the direct work by the Medway Youth Offending Team with the children was ""of a high standard"". G4S staff cleared of youth jail misconduct Young offenders 'watch porn on TV' Medway unit to get bedroom phone The SCR report concluded: ""Had a number of arrangements been more effective there were opportunities to prevent the abuse of children. ""Local and national agencies and the multi-agency processes to monitor the STC were not effective in identifying and responding and monitoring allegations of abuse meant children were not kept safe."" John Drew, independent chairman of the Medway Safeguarding Children Board, which published the serious case review's findings, said it was ""clear there were many lessons to be learnt by a number of agencies"". Jerry Petherick, managing director of G4S Custodial and Detention Services, described the behaviour of some staff at the centre in 2016 as  ""completely unacceptable, and in stark contrast to our training and values"". ""I am confident that we are an organisation that learns and improves,""  he said. A spokesman for the MoJ said: ""We have made significant changes at Medway and across the wider estate since these allegations of abuse were brought to light. ""Medway's last inspection report showed some improvement to safety and we will continue working tirelessly to raise its standards."" Ian Sutherland, director of children and adult services at Medway Council, said: ""We fully accept the recommendations in the serious case review and will be addressing these as a matter of priority. ""Substantial changes have already been made to the local authority designated officer service and these changes, which were made in 2017, addressed many of the points raised following external inspection and reviews."" The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) decided to prosecute nine people in connection with behaviour towards children in the centre. Offences included misconduct in public office and common assault. All nine pleaded not guilty. Following trials, juries found seven of the defendants not guilty. Verdicts were not reached on the remaining two cases and the CPS said a retrial would ""not be appropriate"".

WhatsApp restricts message-sharing,"WhatsApp is limiting all its members to forwarding any single message up to five times in an effort to tackle the spread of false information on the platform. The Facebook-owned business had alreadyintroduced the policy in Indiasix months ago. The move followed a number of mob lynchings that were blamed on fake reports spread via the service. Until now, users elsewhere could forward messages up to 20 times. The update to the app's rules was announced at an event in Jakarta, Indonesia. The country is holding its general election in April. The firm told the BBC it had made its decision after ""carefully"" evaluating the results of its half-year-long test in the country. ""The forward limit significantly reduced forwarded messages around the world,"" a spokeswoman added. ""[This] will help keep WhatsApp focused on private messaging with close contacts. We'll continue to listen to user feedback about their experience, and over time, look for new ways of addressing viral content."" Up to 256 users can be enrolled,externalin a WhatsApp group. So, theoretically, a single user can now only forward a message up to 1,280 other individuals rather than the 5,120 people figure that had been possible previously. WhatsApp abused in Brazil's elections On the frontline of India's WhatsApp fake news war WhatsApp sets new rules after mob killings There is nothing, however, to stop those on the receiving end each forwarding the message up to five times themselves. The restriction comes at a time WhatsApp and Facebook's other services are under scrutiny for their role in the spread of propaganda and other untruths online. Last week, Facebook announced it had removed 500 pages and accounts allegedly involved in peddling fake news in Central Europe, Ukraine and other Eastern European nations. It also recently announced that it had employed a UK-fact-checking service toflag content on its main platform. However, the use of end-to-end encryption by WhatsApp means its messages can only be read by their senders and recipients, limiting the firm's ability to spot false reports. But at the end of last year,the Indian press reported that the government,externalwas considering a change to the law that would force Facebook to police WhatsApp for ""unlawful"" content. This would challenge its use of the encryption technology.

May seeks way to break Brexit deadlock,"UK Prime Minister Theresa May is making a statement to MPs on the way forward on Brexit after her planned deal was rejected by MPs last week. She hopes to win over Tory Brexiteer MPs and Northern Ireland's DUP, by resolving their concerns over the ""backstop"" plan for the Irish border. Last week, Mrs Maysaid she would focus on cross-party talksto get a Brexit deal accepted by Parliament. Downing Street insisted that cross-party talks were continuing. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk. But a way of avoiding those checks has yet to win over MPs. The DUP, which keeps Mrs May's minority government in power through a deal to support it in key votes, rejected her Brexit deal last Tuesday, but 24 hours later helped her see off a bid to oust her in a no confidence motion, saying it didn't want a change of government, just a change of policy. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit Live: May statement to MPs Kuenssberg: Should May stick with her plan? Brexit: A really simple guide Mrs May held a conference call with her cabinet on Sunday. It is understood she wants to show the EU that MPs could back a deal without a backstop, in the hope of encouraging Brussels to soften its position. Meanwhile BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg has suggested Mrs May may announce that fees will be waived for EU nationals who want to live in the UK after Brexit: Allow Twitter content?

Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor, said anyone waiting for a Plan B would be ""stuck at the bus stop for an awfully long time"". He said that reports over the weekend of the possibility of a bi-lateral agreement with the Irish Republic or a rewriting of theGood Friday Agreementhad been ""kiboshed"" by both governments. ""It is back to the backstop and trying to find some sort of breakthrough,"" he added. Mrs May's government agreed a withdrawal deal with the EU in November - covering topics such as the ""divorce bill"" and the Irish border -but it was rejected by MPs by a majority of 230 votes. If Parliament doesn't approve a withdrawal agreement, the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March without a deal or transition period. The prime minister addresses the Commons on Monday afternoon, setting out how she intends to proceed with the Brexit withdrawal agreement. She will also table a ""neutral"" motion, simply saying that the Commons has considered her statement, which will be debated and voted upon on 29 January. This motion is expected to attract amendments from groups of backbenchers seeking more of a say in the process. Fox: Remainer MPs trying to steal Brexit PM should be Brexit mediator, says Major MPs are expected to table bills which could take a no-deal Brexit off the table, and potentially suspend Article 50 - which allows the UK to leave the EU. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Under Mrs May's deal, if there is not a trade deal or other agreement between the UK and the EU when the transition period ends, the backstop kicks in. It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single custom territory - effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - unless both the EU and UK agree it is no longer necessary. But this has been a huge issue for many Conservative MPs and theDUP, who have supported Theresa May's government since the 2017 election. Removing or amending the backstop could provide Mrs May with enough backing from Brexiteer Tory MPs and the DUP to get an agreement passed. Labour's Yvette Cooper is trying to prevent a 'no-deal' Brexit Theresa May's government is engaged in a battle with MPs over who controls the Brexit process, after her deal with the EU was defeated by a record-breaking 230 votes last Tuesday. MPs are trying to use various Parliamentary tactics to tell Mrs May what to do - or force through alternatives to her Brexit deal. They can do this by tabling amendments - suggested changes - to a government motion, which is due to be voted on next Tuesday. Or by proposing new laws of their own. One group of MPs,headed by Labour's Yvette Cooper,with backing from Remainer Conservative MPs, is planning to table a bill that would delay the UK's planned departure date from the EU if the government is not able to get its deal through by 26 February. Private Members' Bills - laws proposed by MPs who are not in the government - can be passed but there's normally only very limited time to debate them. The government usually controls the agenda - what gets debated in Parliament. Some MPs now want to suspend the normal rules to allow time to debate and vote on a bill that would rule out a no-deal Brexit. That might not be enough though. If the bill will involve spending money it also needs a ""money resolution"". That has to be proposed by the government. So MPs face another obstacle if they want to take control of the Brexit process. European Commission Margaritis Schinas said: ""Don't look for answers to Brussels â¦ this is the moment for London to speak, not for us."" But Poland's Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz has told the BBC that he has suggested time-limiting the Irish border backstop as a means of ""unblocking"" the negotiations. He said he had discussed his proposals with Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney and the UK's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, but did not know whether it was ""feasible"". German's foreign minister Heiko Mass said he had confidence in Mrs May but did not know if it was too late to get a deal. Miroslav Lajcak, Slovakia's foreign minister, said reopening the Withdrawal Agreement was not feasible and there was no point in delaying the UK's planned departure date. This video can not be played Labour's Barry Gardiner says the party would vote for another referendum Mrs May invited Jeremy Corbyn to cross-party talks on Brexit after she survived a vote of no confidence in her government last week. But the leader of the opposition said he would only enter cross-party talks if the prime minister took the possibility of a no-deal Brexit off the table. Mrs May said that was an ""impossible condition"". Labour's position since Mrs May's withdrawal agreement was rejected by the Commons is to seek a general election - if that fails they would consider backing a second referendum. Mr Corbyn has previously said Labour wants a customs union with the EU, tariff-free access to the single market and an EU-level of employment rights to be included in any Brexit agreement. Shadow International Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner told BBC Leeds his party would back a motion in favour of another referendum. But the Labour leadership's position is not thought to have changed, and it will be tabling an amendment next week on Labour's customs union plan. A spokesperson for Mr Gardiner said: ""'Barry is committed to Labour's policy of pushing for a general election as the best outcome. ""If the Conservatives block an election we will keep all options on the table, including campaigning for a public vote. Whipping arrangements will be decided in the normal way in due course.""

May to scrap Brexit fee for EU citizens,"This video can not be played Theresa May says fees axed for EU citizens wanting to stay in UK Theresa May has scrapped the Â£65 fee millions of EU citizens were going to have to pay to secure the right to continue living in the UK after Brexit. She also vowed to seek changes to the Irish backstop from the EU. But she again rejected calls to rule out a ""no-deal"" Brexit - and warned another EU referendum could threaten the UK's ""social cohesion"". Conservative rebels and Labour accused her of being in denial about the scale of opposition to her Brexit deal. Mrs May had been forced to make the statement setting out her plan for how to proceed after MPs rejected her Brexit deal with the EU by 230 votes last week - her ""plan B"". MPs are due to vote on a modified version of the deal next Tuesday, although she gave few details about how it would be changed. Between now and then, MPs will table a series of amendments - proposed changes to the PM's deal - in an attempt to force through alternatives to her Brexit deal. The Commons Speaker John Bercow will choose which amendments are put to a vote. Brexit Live: May makes Brexit statement to MPs Nick Watt: May boxed into her comfort zone Kuenssberg: Should May stick with her plan? Cameron warned over 'stupid' Brexit vote Mrs May promised to seek the views of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party - who keep her minority government in power - and others on the proposed Irish backstop. She said she would then ""take the conclusions of these discussions back to the EU"". She said she was exploring potential ""movement"" on the backstop that could secure the backing of a majority of MPs, with the aim of addressing concerns that it could become permanent and threaten the integrity of the United Kingdom. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk. This video can not be played Brexit: Theresa May on âsix key issuesâ in EU talks The prime minister attacked the Labour leader for refusing to take part in talks with her on the way forward. She promised to take a more ""flexible, open and inclusive"" approach to involving MPs and the Scottish and Welsh governments, in negotiating a future relationship with the EU - once her Brexit deal has been approved. But Labour's Yvette Cooper asked why MPs could not be given a greater say now. ""Why not put to Parliament some votes on her red lines, including a customs union, otherwise how can any of us believe a word she says?"" Conservative rebel Sarah Wollaston, who backs another referendum, tweeted that it was ""like last week's vote never happened"". Allow Twitter content?

She told MPs: ""Our duty is to implement the decision of the first one. ""I fear a second referendum would set a difficult precedent that could have significant implications for how we handle referendums in this country. This video can not be played MPs who back a second referendum say they had a ""constructive"" meeting with the PM's deputy ""Not least, strengthening the hand of those campaigning to break up our United Kingdom. ""It would require an extension of Article 50. We would very likely have to return a new set of MEPs to the European Parliament in May. ""And I also believe that there has not yet been enough recognition of the way that a second referendum could damage social cohesion by undermining faith in our democracy."" Earlier, MPs who back a second referendum said they had a ""constructive"" meeting with the prime minister's de facto second-in-command David Lidington. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says PM's talk offer was a ""PR sham"" The Labour leader accused Mrs May of being in ""deep denial"" about the scale of opposition to her ""undeliverable"" deal, which was rejected by 230 votes in a Commons vote last week. He said Labour would back an amendment next week that would rule out the ""disaster"" of a no-deal Brexit - and he challenged her to confirm that she would do that if MPs voted for it. He rejected her ""phoney"" offer of cross-party talks to find a way forward. Mr Corbyn wants to force a general election and, having won it, negotiate a deal with Brussels that would see the UK in a permanent customs union with the EU, with strong ties to the single market and guaranteed protections for workers' rights and environmental standards. If he can't secure a general election he has not ruled out getting behind calls for another referendum. The official Labour amendment, put down on Monday evening, says MPs should be able to vote on the option of a closer relationship with Europe - with a permanent customs union - and also keep the option of a second referendum on the table. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said it was about ""wrestling control of this process away from the prime minister into the hands of Parliament"". Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit Select Committee, has tabled another amendment, calling for the Commons to hold a series of indicative votes on a way forward. Allow Twitter content?

Private Members' Bills - laws proposed by MPs who are not in the government - can be passed but there's normally only very limited time to debate them. The government usually controls the agenda - what gets debated in Parliament. Some MPs now want to suspend the normal rules to allow time to debate and vote on a bill that would rule out a no-deal Brexit. That might not be enough though. If the bill will involve spending money it also needs a ""money resolution"". That has to be proposed by the government. So MPs face another obstacle if they want to take control of the Brexit process. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Under Mrs May's deal, if there is not a trade deal or other agreement between the UK and the EU when the transition period ends, the backstop kicks in. It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single custom territory - effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - unless both the EU and UK agree it is no longer necessary. But this has been a huge issue for many Conservative MPs and theDUP, who have supported Mrs May's government since the 2017 election. Removing or amending the backstop could provide Mrs May with enough backing from Brexiteer Tory MPs and the DUP to get her deal passed by Parliament. Mrs May's plan would mean millions of EU citizens living in the UK would have to apply for ""settled status"" to remain after Brexit. Applicants must have lived in the UK for five years and had been expected to pay a fee of Â£65 each. ""Settled status"" would give EU citizens the same access to healthcare and education after Britain leaves the EU as they have now. Mrs May told MPs she had listened to the concerns of EU citizens - through campaign group the 3million - about the fees, which would be waived when the scheme was launched on 30 March. The government launched a pilot scheme this week for people to apply for leave to remain through a smartphone app. Mrs May said anyone applying during the pilot phase will have their fee reimbursed, with further details to be announced shortly. In her statement, Mrs May said: Parliament will have ""a proper say"" in the next stage of negotiations on the future relationship between the UK and the EU the government plans to hold confidential committee sessions to ensure Parliament has the most up-to-date information there will be ""regular updates"" in the House of Commons, in particular before the six monthly review points with the EU she would engage ""more deeply"" with businesses, civil society and trade unions she will ensure that Parliament is provided with a guarantee that protections for workers' rights and the environment will not be ""eroded"" Please upgrade your browser Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

"Amazon, Apple, Google face data complaints","Entertainment streaming giants including Amazon, Apple, Google, Netflix and Spotify have been accused of breaking the EU's data regulations. General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules say EU customers have the right to access a copy of the personal data companies hold about them. However, privacy group noyb said it found that most of the big streaming companies did not fully comply. It has filed formal complaints,,externalwhich if upheld could result in large fines. GDPR took effect in May 2018 and gives EU customers the right to demand a copy of their personal data from companies. That data must be easy to understand and should also be presented in a machine-readable format, so that a customer could transfer all their data to a competitor, for example. This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? When GDPR took effect, many of the biggest names in tech including Amazon, Apple, Google and Spotify made changes, to let customers download a copy of their data. But the privacy campaign group noyb, whose slogan is ""My Privacy is none of your Business"", said it found many of the biggest services did not do enough to comply with the law. Individuals working with noyb requested a copy of their data from several movie and music streaming services. They found Amazon, Apple, Spotify and Google's YouTube all let people download a copy of their personal information quickly. But noyb said that only some of the data was ""intelligible"", with some parts supplied in a format that could not be understood by people. The GDPR requires the data to be both machine-readable and easily understood by customers. All four streaming giants also failed to supply additional information to which people are entitled, such as a list of other companies with whom their data was shared. Netflix supplied the requested data in a format that was easy to understand, but did not supply all the additional information and took about 30 days to reply. Soundcloud and UK-based streaming service Dazn did not reply to the information requests at all. Privacy activist Max Schrems, diector of noyb, said:  ""In most cases, users only got the raw data, but, for example, no information about who this data was shared with. ""This leads to structural violations of users' rights, as these systems are built to withhold the relevant information."" Noyb said it had filed 10 complaints with Austria's data protection regulator. The maximum penalty for a breach of the GDPR is 20 million euros (Â£17.7m) or 4% of a company's global turnover. In theory, Apple could be fined Â£7bn if the regulatory authority rules that it has broken the law. The BBC has contacted the named companies for comment. Spotify said in a statement: ""Spotify takes data privacy and our obligations to users extremely seriously. We are committed to complying with all relevant national and international laws and regulations, including GDPR, with which we believe we are fully compliant."" GDPR: Europe's new data law explained.

Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. MPs voted on a series of amendments designed to change the direction of Brexit. House of CommonsParliament And with that, the day in the Commons comes to an end. There was a distinct Brexit flavour to the start of the day, with questions to Brexit ministers and an urgent question about government attempts to roll over EU trade deals. The Brexit discussion also continued during the business statement, with a number of MPs asking procedural questions about next Tuesday'sbig Brexit votes in Parliament. After this, Prisons Minister Rory Stewart pledged to act on a report about the supervision of sex offenders in prison or on probation. The afternoon saw MPs call for greater education about the Holocaust, during a debate to mark this Sunday's Holocaust Memorial Day. A debate on treatment for people with ME saw a number of MPs call for more research into the condition and greater understanding of challenges faced by sufferers. House of LordsParliament The debate on climate change finishes - and the House of Lords finishes for the day. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Energy Minister Lord Henley says the entire country has played a part in reducing carbon emissions, and there seems to be a conscious effort among the younger generation to make a change. We are already seeing the impact of climate change both in the UK and globally, he says, noting that ""we cannot say how devastating a rise in temperatures by 3 degrees could be"". He says the government is investing Â£2.6bn before 2021 to reduce flood and coastal erosion risks, and  is taking the challenge of climate change ""extremely seriously"". The government is serious about decarbonising the economy and ""not being complacent"", he adds, disagreeing with the view that the government has ""chopped and changed"" its climate change strategy. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Summing up for Labour, Lord Grantchester says the time to identify new ways to tackle climate change is running out. He adds that more can be done with housing and energy efficiency, and since 2015 the government has ""undermined"" the establishment of new renewable energies. He questions whether the government is looking far enough into the future, suggesting that the focus remains on short-term fixes which will not be enough. ""The government needs to invest in a green economy, new skills and new industries"", he adds. Adjournment Debate House of CommonsParliament Sports Minister Mims Davies says fans have a right to raise concerns about the management of their clubs, with all football clubs required to have an ""open dialogue"" with fans. The government has taken further steps by asking the FA to carry out an intense review of football club ownership, she says. Current owner and directors tests have been strengthened, whilst new owners have to provide sources and sufficiency of funding in place, she adds. ""I am unafraid to go further and to give more focus to this...we will continue to look for a fair deal for fans"", she says. On Newcastle United, she says ""to the best of our knowledge, Newcastle's owner is complying...and the club is meeting all requirements of meeting with supporters"". That does not mean Mike Ashley could not go further however, pointing out that it will be far easier for him to sell the club if he looks after it. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Summing up for the Liberal Democrats, Lord Redesdale says flooding poses a severe threat as the UK's drainage system is still designed for the 1950s. He says it is important everyone makes small changes to their lives to help the planet, which on a large scale will make a big difference. Lord Redesdale says the UK is on the right track to tackling climate change, but ""there is always more that can be done"". Adjournment Debate House of CommonsParliament MPs now turn to the adjournment debate, which tonight is led by Labour MP Chi Onwurah and focuses on the regulation of Newcastle United FC. She says that since today's debate was announced, she has been able to hold a ""robust"" meeting with the club's owner - and Sports Direct owner - Mike Ashley about his running of the club. She calls on Newcastle fans to refrain from ""personal attacks"" against him, adding that they are ""wrong and hurt our cause"". The club's financial accounts are not accessible, she says, but there is considerable concern among fans that money is not being used appropriately. ""Why is it that football is left to regulate itself, when social media companies and other businesses must meet social requirements?"", she asks. She calls for an inquiry into the financial reporting requirements of Premier League clubs, using Newcastle United ""as a test case"". Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat MP Baroness Miller of Chilthorne Domer says one of the worst threats of climate change will be the effect of extreme weather on the agricultural system. She notes that it is 46 degrees in parts of Australia today, and the Central Land Council has said they could carry out an emergency cull of 120 horses, goats and donkeys that are dying in the heatwave. The UK needs to change the way it produces food and the population need to change its diet, she says, although noting that there is ""no need"" for everyone to give up meat altogether. Conservative peer the Earl of Caithness says the West is ""terribly good at thinking we're good at tackling climate change"", but there is more to be done. He adds that members of all parties should work together in the interest of the planet, and listen to expert advice. Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament Winding up for the government, Health Minister Steve Brine says they ""do not for one minute underestimate ME"". ""But the truth is we do not understand the underlying causes of it...there is currently no cure for it"", he says. The medical profession ""have had a bad rap today"", he says, ""and some of it's deserved"". Whilst trainee doctors would benefit from greater training, qualified doctors have a responsibility to keep up to date. NICE is updating its guidance for ME, he adds. The government seeks to ""stimulate the research community"" to come forward with the best applications, but often ME research proposals are lacking in sufficient quality. Concluding the debate, SNP Carol Monaghan says there is excellent research already going on, but it is funded by charities, adding: ""government needs to take this seriously"". Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament Shadow health minister Sharon Hodgson says patients are often ""passed from pillar to post"" when seeking treatment, with huge delays in diagnosis that do not meet NICE guidelines. The government should do more, she says, ""and considering they don't currently do much, that isn't too much to ask"". Research funding from the government is ""long overdue"", she says, as research is currently completely done by charities, with some researchers even relying on crowdfunding. ""We must ensure that the stigma of ME is tackled"", she says. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Bethell says the key is to latch on to a large change in public opinion as now more than ever, people want to help protect the planet. He says UK emissions have been cut by 42%, faster than any other G7 nation, which is ""a hell of an achievement"" and ""should not be underestimated"". Lord Bethell says everyone must work harder to ""shore up the political consensus"", and this can be done by talking about an optimistic future. ""We have to try and create a sense of opportunity,"" he adds, ""we cannot inspire only through fear"". Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament DUP MP Jim Shannon says ME affects 25,000 children in the UK and is said to be the leading cause of long-term school absence due to illness. He says people suffering from the condition are repeatedly turned down for personal independence payments (PIPs), a kind of disability benefit. The system needs to move away from the ""if it can't be tested, it can't be helped"" approach. SNP MP Philippa Whitford says many sufferers resent ME being referred to as chronic fatigue syndrome, she says, because it ""sounds so trivial"". A better description would be ""chronic exhaustion syndrome"", she says. She says it is hard for doctors to help because it is so hard to prove a patient is suffering from ME and not something else, whilst there is no known effective treatment or cure. It is ""quite sinister"", she adds, that some previous research into ME was funded by the Department of Work & Pensions, which she says has penalised suffers. Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament Plaid Cymru Ben Lake says ME affects more people than Parkinson's disease and MS combined, yet it receives just 0.02% of research funding. ""We simply cannot wait any longer"", he says. Labour MP Nick Thomas-Symonds says there needs to be far greater awareness and research on ME. He echoes Ben Lake in pointing out how little research funding it receives compared to other illnesses. The World Health Organisation classifies ME as a neurological condition, he points out, suggesting that for warrants greater attention, rather than it being treated as a psychological condition as it currently is. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat peer Baroness Sheehan says it is time to stop the ""blanket subsidy"" to fossil fuel power. A fundamental change is needed in the industries we want to support, she says, calling for green energy to be at the forefront of new industrial projects. The malign effects of climate change are felt across the globe, she adds, noting that it is not about placing blame on a particular country on industry, but ensuring everyone takes more responsibility. ""Fossil fuels have had their day, it's time to stop using them and clean up after them,"" she says. Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament There are a relatively large number of MPs still looking to speak in today's backbench business debate on ME treatment, which can only continue until 5pm. As a result, Deputy Speaker Dame Eleanor Laing has had to impose a time limit on speeches of three minutes. Appropriate ME Treatment Debate House of CommonsParliament Conservative MP Nicky Morgan says more research into ME could improve treatment, but even ""having a GP who not only believes you but wants to help...would make a huge difference."" Labour's Emma Lewell-Buck says women are often treated as lazy or hysterical when suffering from ME, and risk being stripped of benefits when they are unable to work. Those doctors who want to help risk being ""hauled up"" by the General Medical Council, she says, but often patients are just dismissed. ""There must be nothing worse for someone knowing how ill they are than being told it's all in their head and being sneered at by the very professionals and organisations that should be supporting them"", she adds. Debate on threats presented by climate change House of LordsParliament Over in the Lords, Liberal Democrat peer Lord Teverson has opened a debate on the threats presented by climate change. He says the increase in temperatures is already 1 degree above pre-industrial levels, bringing the risks of extreme weather, flooding and sea level rises. ""Progress has been made"", he says, ""but this is something that still needs to be tackled as the clock is ticking"". In the last two years global emissions went up by 1.6%, Lord Teverson says, acknowledging that most of this growth comes from China and India. He suggests that investment in renewable energy is falling because a previous budget from former Chancellor George Osborne reduced incentives to build zero-emission homes. Â© 2025 BBC.

'The bed that saved me from the Taliban',"Just over a year ago, Greek pilot Vasileios Vasileiou checked into a luxury hilltop hotel in Kabul. The Intercontinental was popular with foreign visitors - which is why, on 20 January, Taliban gunmen stormed it, killing at least 40 people. Vasileios explains how he survived. I had decided to go for dinner early - at six o'clock - with my friend, another pilot called Michael Poulikakos. It was the first time in the three or four months that I had been coming to the Intercontinental that I'd done this - usually I had dinner at around 8.30pm. Vasileios Vasileiou and Michael Poulikakos worked for Afghan airline Kam Air We finished dinner about 7.30pm and then I went up to my room - room 522 - on the top floor, to make some calls. At 8.47pm I was on the phone to Athens when I heard a big explosion down in the lobby. I went out on to the balcony. I could see a man on the ground covered in blood and I could hear gunfire coming from inside and outside the hotel. I realised how lucky it was that I wasn't in the restaurant at that moment and said to myself, ""OK Vasileios, you have to do something in order to survive."" I left the balcony door open and locked the door to my room. There were two beds in my suite so I took one of the mattresses and put it against the door to protect myself from grenades, and then I gathered some bed sheets, towels and clothes and made a rope that I could use to get to the fourth floor if I needed to. Because I'm a pilot and a trainer I've studied crisis management and decision-making for years, so even if I'm only going to a restaurant or to the theatre I think about sitting by the door, or close to the emergency exit - it's automatic, almost second nature. I started thinking about what I was going to do next. I had no idea how many attackers there were or where they were in the building, and jumping from the fifth floor wasn't wise, so I said to myself, ""Vasileios, stay inside and try to do as much as possible to protect yourself."" For some reason I can't really explain, I was unexpectedly calm. I made the bed with the mattress on it look a little bit untidy, and the other one - the one I had removed the mattress from - look tidy. I turned off the light and decided to hide behind the heavy curtains and furniture in the dark. About an hour-and-a-half passed, and although I didn't know it at the time the attackers had by now killed almost everyone in the lobby, the restaurant, and on the first and second floors of the hotel. They had rushed through the third and fourth floors to the fifth floor and I could hear them running around on the rooftop above my head, where they were managing to keep away helicopters belonging to the international forces. I heard gunfire in the corridor nearby and suddenly all the electricity in the hotel went off. The end of the corridor, near the lifts, where the gunmen entered the fifth floor The first room on the fifth floor that the attackers went into was room 521, the room next to mine, which became their operational centre for the duration of the overnight siege. I heard guns being fired into the door to my room and I thought to myself, ""This is not a good position to be in."" I got on to the floor and went underneath the bed that still had a mattress on it to try to protect myself. I was holding this single bed up with my fists and the tip of my toes, supporting the weight of the bed. I could see a little, because the bed was elevated about 10cm into the air. They shot through the lock, hit the door with a heavy hammer and then four men came into my room. One immediately ran to the balcony because he saw that the door was open. I heard gunfire from a pistol, one shot, and I thought that in the next few seconds I was probably going to die. I thought about my family, the faces of my children, and the good and bad moments in my life. The door was left open and the gunmen were coming in and out all the time. Then they started opening other doors on the fifth floor. Just across the corridor from me was an air steward and some other pilots that I'd worked with. Sometimes I would hear their cries before they were executed. Sometimes nothing. I think they opened every single door on the fifth floor and killed everyone that they found. I'd hear the cries, hear the bullet - just one bullet - and then they'd crash through the next door. Each time they would laugh afterwards, like they were just playing around, or like it was a big party or something. Around three o'clock in the morning, they started a big fire on the fifth floor and then left because the smoke was so heavy. For 20-25 minutes there was no gunfire, so I decided to come out from underneath the bed. When I came out, I realised that while I had been hiding underneath one of the two beds they had shot at the other bed and then lifted up its wooden base to look for anyone who might be hiding there. I thought, ""This is the second time today that I have escaped with my life."" This video can not be played Vasileios's room, number 522: He describes how he hid from his attackers when they burst in Before long, smoke began coming into my room. I had to do something, so I went out on to the balcony. I could see the fire on my left hand side, it was heavy and I realised that if it reached my room I wasn't going to survive. I saw some TV cables hanging from the roof, going straight down to the ground. I stretched to grab them to see if they could support my weight and I could use them to slip down, but just at that moment I heard bullets passing right next to me. One bullet passed about 20cm from my left shoulder and another about half a metre away. They left two holes in the window glass right behind me. Vasileios Vasileiou spoke toOutlookon the BBC World Service You canlisten again here It was probably a sniper belonging to the international forces who'd seen me through night vision cameras coming out of room 522 and assumed that I was one of the bad guys. Snipers never miss at that distance, but in the split second that they'd fired I'd moved my body to grab the cables, and the bullets had just missed me. I decided to go inside. I went to the bathroom - very, very slowly, so as not to make a noise. I had some nail scissors among my things and I took them, went back underneath the bed and, using the small scissors, opened a hole in the plastic material which covered the underside of the bed's wooden base. There was just enough room for me to crawl inside. I took two bottles of water and some milk from the little fridge in my room and a T-shirt. I cut the T-shirt into small pieces and put some inside my nose to filter the smoke. I put another piece of the T-shirt around my mouth and put lots of milk and water on it, like a double filter, something I'd learned from training with the fire department at Athens International Airport. Room 520 is to the right, followed by 521, then Vasileios's room, 522 Almost as soon as I was inside the bed they were back. One of the guys came and sat on the bed that I was inside. I could see his feet and he kept spitting on the floor. He was giving orders to the other guys, telling them what to do, and I still remember his voice. Then he went to the bathroom, and after that he went on to the balcony and fired a few AK-47 magazines. I couldn't risk making any noise at all because when the gunfire stopped there was complete silence. At that moment something in my brain told me that I wasn't going to die that day. I had survived when I hadn't gone for dinner at my usual time. I had survived when those guys first came into my room and had shot at the other bed, not the one that I was underneath. I had survived when the sniper's bullets had missed me. And right now I was well hidden. I thought that the international forces would take over somehow, so I decided that if I just stayed where I was and did nothing, I'd be OK. But early in the morning the international forces began to fire from a tank into the rooms. They concentrated on room 521, the one next door to me, but also fired at some of the other rooms, because the gunmen were moving around and firing at them from other places too. Each time the heavy guns on the tank fired the whole hotel shook. Later I saw the damage that they had done - all of the furniture had been turned to dust and holes had been opened in the ceilings. Again I felt lucky to still be alive. Room 520 - two doors down from Vasileios - after the attack They started a second fire about six o'clock in the morning, right outside my room. I had heard the guys collecting some of the clothes from my closet, then they took the carpets and poured a lot of diesel on them. They burned their room - room 521 - too. The fire was very close to me and I knew that in the heavy smoke and heat I would only be able to survive for 15-20 minutes, maybe half an hour maximum. I was breathing from the floor to get the last oxygen from the heavy cold air coming into my room from the open balcony door. The smoke didn't smell like the usual smell that you get from fires of wood or carpets. It was not a good smell. It was the smell of human bodies burning. Since I couldn't hear anyone around, I decided that I'd come out. But as I emerged, I suddenly heard the sound of breaking windows. It was coming from room 521 but then the same thing began happening in my room and I had to try to protect myself very quickly. The international forces outside were firing pressurised jets of water into the rooms to extinguish the flames and these were shattering the windows. The fire was quickly put out but I was now soaked to the skin in cold water in a room without windows or doors, on a cold Kabul night, when the outside temperature was about -3C. I would soon be suffering from hypothermia. Vasileios considered escaping via this emergency staircase in the early stages of the attack - but luckily decided against it At 9.25am I heard gunfire coming from down the corridor near the elevators - it sounded different, so I guessed that it must be the international forces. A gunman in room 521 was answering that gunfire with a Kalashnikov. Between 9.30am and 11.15am the international forces were throwing numerous grenades, I would hear them rolling across the floor. Sometimes they landed in room 521 and sometimes they exploded outside the open door of my room. I still have a flight case that was dented by one of those grenades, which I've kept as a kind of souvenir. By about 11.30am there seemed to be only one gunman left near me - the man in room 521. I heard his gunfire switch from a Kalashnikov to a pistol. He was out of ammunition. Then he tried to set a new fire using a blowtorch, but soon was out of gas. Room 521's balcony, following the attack I was so excited and full of adrenaline that I put my hand over my mouth in case I started laughing. He disappeared after a few minutes. I was so tired. I'd had to fly late the night before all of this began, then hadn't slept the day or night previously, so I'd been awake for more than 35 or 40 hours. Not much later I began to hear other noises and people walking towards my room but I couldn't see if it was the bad guys or the good guys. Around 11.40am somebody called out, ""Police! Police!"" in an Afghan accent, but I decided not to come out in case it was the bad guys. Then after 10 or 20 seconds I heard some people with English accents also shouting, ""Police!"" and I was so happy that I began yelling and crawling out of the bed. It was difficult to get out and I could barely breathe - my chest was hurting so much from being inside the bed, in one position, for so long. I was black with smoke so they couldn't see my face and the four commandos were shouting, ""Stay down! Stay down!"" while pointing their guns at me. One of them whispered: ""This must be a ghost!"" I was freezing cold but managed to say, ""I'm the captain from Kam Air. Please, don't shoot!"" They couldn't believe what they were seeing. They asked me how many hours I'd been there. I told them I'd been there all the time. They looked at the bed and asked me how I had managed to survive. One of them said to me, ""OK, I'm gonna take you down, but listen, I have to have a photo with you before we go,"" and I said I'd like to have a photo to remember that moment too. Vasileios was given a battery-powered blanket to raise his body temperature I was the last to come out of the hotel. They took all of the survivors to the British base in Kabul. As soon as I saw my colleague Michael there I was so happy, I couldn't believe it. I didn't know whether to laugh or to cry. But there were mixed feelings. We had lost so many friends - so many people that we used to work with - pilots, operational personnel, engineers. The Ministry for Foreign Affairs had told my family that they had evacuated all the survivors from the hotel, but that they hadn't found me, so my family thought I hadn't made it. You can't imagine their happiness when three or four hours later I called them and told them that I was OK. Parts of the hotel were able to re-open two months after the attack I have always been a positive person, but nowadays I am even more so. I enjoy every single moment of life and feel grateful for what I have. Life is a gift and we should enjoy it for as long as it lasts. You know, sitting on the beach in Greece with friends I've heard people complaining that because we had a financial crisis they miss some of the comforts they used to have. I am like, ""Come on! Enjoy your life and health. You are eating sardines and drinking Ouzo by the beach. We are free, we have good friends around and we laugh - this is what people are supposed to do."" Don't concentrate only on work, stressful and bad things in your life. Concentrate instead on creating good moments and being around good people, because life is so beautiful. I really realise that after Kabul - life is extremely beautiful. And, believe me, I enjoy every moment. At least 40 people died as a result of the Intercontinental Hotel attack.

British soldier sues Army over Q fever,"Wayne Bass served in Helmand in 2011 A former soldier is suing the Ministry of Defence after contracting Q fever in Afghanistan. Wayne Bass claims his life has been ruined by the Army's failure to provide antibiotics which would have protected him from the disease. His case is the first to test the MoD's duty to protect against Q fever, an infectious disease linked to exposure to animal excrement. The MoD says it is not appropriate to comment on ongoing legal cases. In 2011, Mr Bass, then a private serving with 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment, was deployed to Helmand Province, to an area known for its heavy Taliban presence and fire. Pte Bass's platoon was responsible for reconnaissance and protecting other forces. It is there that he believes he contracted Q fever, an infection caused by bacteria most commonly found in cattle, sheep, and goats. Humans typically get Q fever when they breathe in dust from faeces of infected animals. ""To avoid enemy fire I was constantly having to dive into ditches on the ground where farm animals had been, there were animals all over the place,"" he says. Wayne Bass's platoon was responsible for protecting other forces Initially, as is typical with the disease, he experienced flu-like symptoms and an army doctor diagnosed Q fever. Intravenous antibiotics failed to cure him and following periods in hospital and at the MoD's Headley Court rehabilitation centre in Surrey, he was diagnosed with Q fever chronic fatigue syndrome. Normally, the fever is successfully treated with antibiotics and it is rare for it to develop into chronic fatigue syndrome. ""On some days I'm OK, I can walk a few hundred metres but often I get breathless, have aches and pains all over my body for which I have to take very powerful painkillers. ""The nerve pain in my lower back and legs means that my back can lock up and I'm immobile. ""On a less bad day it can take 45 minutes to walk 600m,"" he says. His condition means he is unable to work, but the effects are not only physical: ""It has brought about a spike in my post-traumatic stress disorder, I have night terrors, I feel very low and isolated, very depressed. I am on anti-depressants. I can't see a future,"" he says. Justin Glenister, a partner at Hilary Meredith, the law firm acting for Mr Bass, believes the case breaks new legal ground. ""This is the first case in which the question will be asked whether the MoD had a duty to protect soldiers against this known risk of Q fever, which we say was a preventable risk, and what steps it ought to have taken to protect them. There are other similar cases being prepared."" The MoD's defence, seen by the BBC, says 200 personnel per year tested positive for Q fever in 2008-2011 and of those only a third were symptomatic. The MoD says the risk of contracting Q fever is very low and it follows the recommendations of theJoint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation,externalwhich does not recommend vaccination for Q Fever. Wayne Bass, as a young soldier and more recently Q-Vax, a vaccine against Q fever, is not licensed in the UK. Mr Bass's case is that the Army failed to provide the antibiotic doxycycline to guard against the risk of Q fever. But the MoD says it would not have been reasonable to use doxycycline due to its side-effects and because it would have compromised the effect of anti-malarial drugs given to troops. It denies that any action could have been taken to avoid him contracting Q fever. Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at Reading University, says: ""Doxycycline is an anti-malarial. If given it could have protected against both malaria and Q fever. I am puzzled that the army did not give it as a prophylactic."" Mr Bass, from Redditch, Worcestershire, says bringing the case is not about money. ""I'd take a cure over Â£50m in a second, I want other soldiers and officers to be made aware of the risks of Q fever and the devastating consequences it can have."" The five-day trial, starting on Monday at Central London County Court, will examine the extent of any duty owed by the army to Mr Bass in relation to Q fever, and whether that duty was breached. Its findings will be based in part on expert medical evidence, with judgement reserved to a later date.

EU sanctions Russian suspects over SalisburyThe suspects in the Novichok poisoning and their superiors are hit with EU sanctions.Europe,"""Alexander Petrov"" (left) and ""Ruslan Boshirov"" were unmasked as agents for Russian intelligence The European Union has put sanctions on senior officials from the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU, over the Salisbury poisonings. Four people have been sanctioned - including the head of the GRU, deputy head, and two agents who are believed to have carried out the attack. The Novichok nerve agent they used severely poisoned three people and killed a fourth, Dawn Sturgess. The sanctions put a ban on travel to the EU and freezes any assets there. They also prevent any person or company in the EU from providing any financial support to those affected. This is the first time the EU has used its new powers to sanction those connected to chemical weapons manufacture and use, which it created in October last year. All four GRU staff remain in Russia, which will not extradite them to face charges. In a statement, the EU said: Anatoliy Vladimirovich ChepigaandAlexander Mishkin""possessed, transported and then, during the weekend of 4 March 2018, in Salisbury, used a toxic nerve agent"" for which the UK has charged them with attempted murder Igor Olegovich Kostyukov,head of the GRU, andVladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev, the deputy head, are both accused, ""given his senior leadership role"" to be ""responsible for the possession, transport and use"" of the nerve agent The intended target of the attack, Sergei Skripal, survived despite being severely poisoned, as did his daughter Yulia. Their whereabouts are kept secret. But months after the initial poisoning, a resident of nearby Amesbury, Dawn Sturgess, died of Novichok poisoning. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, had found a bottle in a perfume box and had given it to her. It contained the nerve agent, apparently discarded after the attack on the Skripals. Mr Rowley was also poisoned, but survived. The sanctioning of the two agents comes after months of insistence from Moscow that there is no evidence to show their guilt. This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police believe carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 In the aftermath of the poisoning, UK police released the names and photographs of Mr Chepiga and Mr Mishkin, who had used the pseudonyms Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov, having traced their steps meticulously through CCTV footage. Despite the presence of the two Russian intelligence agents in Salisbury at the time and the use of a nerve agent believed to have been made in Russia, Moscow insisted the men were innocent. Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far The Salisbury poisoning: What happened next? In an interview on state-run television channel RT, the pair said they were merely tourists, denied having travelled under fake names, and said they had made the journey to see the city's cathedral. The appearance was widely ridiculed and the story labelled implausible. Their identities, at least, are now widely agreed upon:the EU listed the two agent's real names, along with dates and places of birth, in its sanctions list,external. After the EU announced its sanctions, Russia's foreign ministry threatened retaliation ""against this unfriendly action"". It said the sanctions were adopted under the ""pretext"" that the pair were involved in the Salisbury attack, but maintained that the accusations against them ""do not stand up to scrutiny"". ""The information campaign unleashed by the British authorities on this case pursues, first of all, domestic political goals,"" it said, highlighting the current ""crisis"" over Brexit. It also accused the EU of circumventing the United Nations Security Council and taking unilateral action. Alongside the Russian GRU agents, five people from a Syrian institute widely held responsible for damaging chemical weapons, the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, were also hit with the same sanctions.

Derry security alert after weekend bombPolice evacuate houses over hijacked vehicle two days after explosion in the city centre.Northern Ireland,"This video can not be played The moment the bomb exploded on Saturday Three security alerts in Londonderry - triggered when two vehicles were hijacked by masked men and a delivery van was abandoned - have ended. Police said residents have been allowed to return to their homes following the alerts, which were confirmed as hoaxes. An alert in north Belfast on Monday night has also been confirmed as a hoax. The disruption in Derry came 48 hours after a bomb exploded in the city. The area around the courthouse in Bishop Street, where the bomb exploded in a car on Saturday, has reopened. Grandfather's shock over Derry bomb The PSNI have said Saturday's bomb attack may have been carried out by dissident republican group the New IRA. Four out of five men held over the bombing have been released. A 50-year-old man arrested on Monday remains in police custody. Members of the DUP are to meet Northern Ireland's chief constable on Tuesday morning to discuss recent incidents in the city and the ongoing dissident republican threat. A number of residents were moved from their homes as police deal with an abandoned vehicle on the Northland Road Police said that while the alerts were hoaxes ""we cannot underestimate the impact these incidents have had on our community"". ""The occupants of the hijacked vehicles did not believe when they set out for work this morning that they would be threatened by masked men,"" said Supt Gordon McCalmont. ""The residents in Circular Road, Southway and Northland Road did not wake up today expecting to be asked to leave their homes for their own safety. ""Too many people were affected because of the deliberate and anti-community actions of a few."" Timeline of Irish dissident activity Four arrests over 'reckless' attack Bomb explodes in car at courthouse Bomb was 'pointless act of terror' On Monday, the Army was called to two security alerts in the city involving reported hijackings. Army bomb disposal officers carried out a controlled explosion in Creggan's Circular Road after a vehicle was hijacked by three masked men at 11:30 GMT on Monday. The second alert on Southway, also in Creggan, followed reports of a vehicle being hijacked by four masked men at 13:45 GMT. In a third incident, police responded to a report of an abandoned lorry on the Northland Road close to the Glenbank Road junction and St Mary's College. In north Belfast, a controlled explosion was carried out on a suspicious object in the area of Springfield Road and Lanark Way. Residents returned to their home shortly after midnight. This video can not be played 'This House stands with Northern Ireland' St Mary's College in Derry will be open to staff and pupils on Tuesday morning. The school principal Marie Lindsay told BBC Radio Foyle that additional support will be provided for students who may have been affected by the security alert. A number of residents were moved from their homes. A nearby community centre was opened to people who were affected. A spokesperson for Northern Ireland's Housing Executive said one of their vans was hijacked and that a contractor they work with has withdrawn services in the Bishop Street, Brandywell, Creggan, Rosemount and Rossville areas until further notice. SDLP MLA Mark H Durkan said the area was largely populated by older people. ""When you see frail pensioners in their late 80s and 90s being forced to leave their homes in their dressing gowns, it really is despicable. ""There is a huge sense of anxiety right across the city, and a huge sense of anger right across the city and understandably so,"" he said. What is the New IRA? The New IRA wasformed in 2012after a number of dissident republican organisations said they were unifying under one leadership It is believed to be the largestdissident republican organisation The group is believed to have been responsible for a number of attacks since its formation, including the murders of prison officersDavid BlackandAdrian Ismay. In a post on the PSNI Foyle Facebook page, police also confirmed that ""there has been an attempted hijacking of a local bus service"" in the Galliagh area of the city. Saturday'sbomb exploded outside the city's courthouse on Bishop Streetshortly after a pizza delivery vehicle was hijacked at gun point. A CCTV clip posted on Twitter by police showed a group of seven young people walking past the vehicle shortly before the blast.

Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley told MPs those behind the attack ""will never succeed"". ""Londonderry is a city that has thrived since the signing of the Good Friday Agreement 20 years ago - everyone can see that - and one that will continue to grow and develop despite the actions of those who seek to sow discord and division,"" she said. The alert at Southway is the second in the Creggan area of the city DUP leader Arlene Foster tweeted that the PSNI ""needs our full support to remove those responsible from our streets"". Sinn FÃ©in councillor Kevin Campbell said there can be ""no justification for this type of reckless activity"". ""Those responsible for this disruption have shown complete disregard for the people of Creggan, particularly elderly people who live in this area,"" he said.

Cases listed to be heard in the magistrates' courts were being held in Strabane, with some other hearings switching to Coleraine,external. A forensic officer examines the remains of the vehicle following Saturday night's explosion PSNI Supt Gordon McCalmont told BBC Radio Foyle the police were trying to get the city back to normal and show the attack had ""little or no long-term impact"". He said the PSNI was ""lucky we are not talking about loss of life"". Supt McCalmont also said the pizza delivery driver whose vehicle was hijacked and used in Saturday's bombing ""had to go through the drama of having a firearm put to his head"". ""He was threatened and intimidated. It would be fair to say he was asked not to raise the alarm."" He added: ""These groupings obviously want us to respond. We will be very balanced.

Abbott: BBC still needs to apologise,"Diane Abbott is a regular contributor to Question Time Diane Abbott has rejected the BBC's response to claims she was poorly treated on Question Time. The Labour Party lodged a formal complaint with the BBC after she reported she had ""never had such a horrible experience"" on the show. The shadow home secretary accused presenter Fiona Bruce of ""decidedly unfair"" handling and claimed she was wrongly corrected over polling figures. The BBC said it ""firmly"" rejects claims any of the panel was treated unfairly. Ms Abbott said that during Thursday's programme, she was interrupted more than double the number of times Tory MP Rory Stewart was, and was not allowed to respond to a ""blatantly abusive remark"" from the audience. She claimed she had also been told that the TV studio audience had been ""wound up"" against her ahead of broadcast. Ms Abbott said Ms Bruce did ""not appear well briefed"" after getting polling figures wrong for Labour standings compared to those of the Conservatives. A Labour source told the BBC: ""The way she was treated on Question Time was unacceptable and fed the hostility towards her. ""We expect the programme to correct inaccuracies, provide a full explanation of what happened during the show's production and to apologise to Diane."" A BBC spokesperson said: ""We have received Labour's comments and will respond in due in course."" Diane Abbott said it 'would be wrong to blame Fiona Bruce for all this' In a statement on Friday the BBC said: ""We are sorry to hear Diane Abbott's concerns over Thursday's edition of Question Time and we have contacted her team to reassure them that reports circulating on social media are inaccurate and misleading. ""Diane is a regular and important contributor to the programme. ""As we said earlier, we firmly reject claims that any of the panel was treated unfairly either before or during the recording."" The BBC also said it reviewed the polling figures used in the programme, and that while a YouGov poll on the day of the programme put the Conservatives ahead, Ms Abbott was ""right to say other polls suggested Labour was either ahead or tied"". The BBC added: ""We should have made that clear."" Ms Abbott said on Twitter on Monday: ""This is not an apology and does not address all of the issues that have been raised."" ""Fiona Bruce was clearly repeating Tory propaganda that Labour were behind in the polls. If she had said behind in one poll, that would have been (a) different matter,"" she added. Thursday's Question Time was Fiona Bruce's second time presenting the show since the departure of veteran broadcaster David Dimbleby. Viewers had reacted warmly toMs Bruce's first edition of QT the previous week. Ms Abbott said it ""would be wrong to blame Fiona Bruce for all this. Question Time has had a new editor for some time, and seems more interested in entertainment than politics. ""In the current abusive political climate, TV production teams need to reflect before they wind up live audiences against particular politicians. ""It may result in 'good television', but it can easily turn ugly."" Ms Abbott said she is not asking for ""special treatment, only fair treatment"".

EU sanctions Russian suspects over Salisbury,"""Alexander Petrov"" (left) and ""Ruslan Boshirov"" were unmasked as agents for Russian intelligence The European Union has put sanctions on senior officials from the Russian military intelligence agency, the GRU, over the Salisbury poisonings. Four people have been sanctioned - including the head of the GRU, deputy head, and two agents who are believed to have carried out the attack. The Novichok nerve agent they used severely poisoned three people and killed a fourth, Dawn Sturgess. The sanctions put a ban on travel to the EU and freezes any assets there. They also prevent any person or company in the EU from providing any financial support to those affected. This is the first time the EU has used its new powers to sanction those connected to chemical weapons manufacture and use, which it created in October last year. All four GRU staff remain in Russia, which will not extradite them to face charges. In a statement, the EU said: Anatoliy Vladimirovich ChepigaandAlexander Mishkin""possessed, transported and then, during the weekend of 4 March 2018, in Salisbury, used a toxic nerve agent"" for which the UK has charged them with attempted murder Igor Olegovich Kostyukov,head of the GRU, andVladimir Stepanovich Alexseyev, the deputy head, are both accused, ""given his senior leadership role"" to be ""responsible for the possession, transport and use"" of the nerve agent The intended target of the attack, Sergei Skripal, survived despite being severely poisoned, as did his daughter Yulia. Their whereabouts are kept secret. But months after the initial poisoning, a resident of nearby Amesbury, Dawn Sturgess, died of Novichok poisoning. Her partner, Charlie Rowley, had found a bottle in a perfume box and had given it to her. It contained the nerve agent, apparently discarded after the attack on the Skripals. Mr Rowley was also poisoned, but survived. The sanctioning of the two agents comes after months of insistence from Moscow that there is no evidence to show their guilt. This video can not be played On the trail of Russians Alexander Petrov and Ruslan Boshirov, who UK police believe carried out a nerve agent attack in Salisbury in March 2018 In the aftermath of the poisoning, UK police released the names and photographs of Mr Chepiga and Mr Mishkin, who had used the pseudonyms Ruslan Boshirov and Alexander Petrov, having traced their steps meticulously through CCTV footage. Despite the presence of the two Russian intelligence agents in Salisbury at the time and the use of a nerve agent believed to have been made in Russia, Moscow insisted the men were innocent. Skripal suspects: 'We were just tourists' Amesbury poisoning: What we know so far The Salisbury poisoning: What happened next? In an interview on state-run television channel RT, the pair said they were merely tourists, denied having travelled under fake names, and said they had made the journey to see the city's cathedral. The appearance was widely ridiculed and the story labelled implausible. Their identities, at least, are now widely agreed upon:the EU listed the two agent's real names, along with dates and places of birth, in its sanctions list,external. After the EU announced its sanctions, Russia's foreign ministry threatened retaliation ""against this unfriendly action"". It said the sanctions were adopted under the ""pretext"" that the pair were involved in the Salisbury attack, but maintained that the accusations against them ""do not stand up to scrutiny"". ""The information campaign unleashed by the British authorities on this case pursues, first of all, domestic political goals,"" it said, highlighting the current ""crisis"" over Brexit. It also accused the EU of circumventing the United Nations Security Council and taking unilateral action. Alongside the Russian GRU agents, five people from a Syrian institute widely held responsible for damaging chemical weapons, the Scientific Studies and Research Centre, were also hit with the same sanctions.

'Ancient' stone circle found to be replica,"The recumbent stone circle was found to be about 20 years old An Aberdeenshire stone circle initially thought to be thousands of years old has been identified as a modern replica. An investigation into the site at the parish of Leochel-Cushnie found the stones to be about 20 years old. It was originally thought to be the site of a recumbent stone circle - until the man who built it came forward. The findings sparked excitement among experts and were widely reported. They were initially celebrated as an authentic recumbent stone circle by Adam Welfare of Historic Environment Scotland and Aberdeenshire Council's Archaeology Service. Further archaeological analysis of the stones was being conducted when a former owner of the farm contacted Mr Welfare to say he had built the stone circle in the 1990s. Neil Ackerman, historic environment record assistant at Aberdeenshire Council, said the development was ""disappointing"", but hoped the site would still be appreciated. He said: ""I hope the stones continue to be used and enjoyed - while not ancient it is still in a fantastic location and makes for a great feature in the landscape. ""These types of monument are notoriously difficult to date."" Recumbent stone circles were constructed about 3,500 to 4,500 years ago and are unique to the north east of Scotland. Their defining feature is a large horizontal stone flanked by two upright stones, usually situated between the south-east to south-west of the circle.

Breakfast hit by shrinkflation,"Bread and breakfast cereals are the most likely to be affected by shrinkflation, whereby a product shrinks in size but its price doesn't. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalstudied the price of 17,000 items between September 2015 and June 2017. It found 206 products in all categories had shrunk in size, while 79 increased. The Brexit vote sparked a fall in the pound and a rise in the price of imports. But the ONS said this did not lead to a pick-up in shrinkflation. ""There was no trend in the frequency of size changes over this period, which included the EU referendum,"" the UK statistics body said. Biscuits and chocolates take the shrinkflation test Among bread and cereals the ONS found 36 cases of shrinkflation. The next two categories with the largest number of shrinkflation cases were meat and confectionery. But most categories also saw some products increase in size. There were 18 increases in size among the bread and cereal category, and 13 meat products where this happened. These popular snacks have been subjected to shrinkflation But the category most likely to rise in size for the same price was tobacco, where there were also no examples of packets shrinking. Shrinkflation is not a widespread problem, although products are much more likely to contract than expand. The ONS estimates that in 2016, just 1-2.1% of food products in its sample shrunk in size, while 0.3-0.7% got bigger. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, said: ""Over the last few years, consumers may have noticed that some companies have reduced the size of their products while the price remained the same, which is often attributed to operational and material cost rises."" Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said there had been few cost increases recently: ""In the past, companies blamed the rising price of raw materials. In the last couple of years these prices dropped back, but the shrinkage continued. ""The ONS investigated whether this was due to the fall in the pound, but said it hadn't spotted trends that can be attributed to a Brexit effect. It may simply be that manufacturers have found a way to boost profits under the radar.""

Chris Evans launches new breakfast show,"Chris Evans said it was ""so great to be back on Virgin"" as he launched his new breakfast radio show. It's his first sincehe exited BBC Radio 2 on Christmas Eveafter nine years of fronting the breakfast show there. ""I say, this is very exciting,"" Evans said as he opened his new show. ""It's so great to be back on Virgin and I have to say it's a real treat, we are blessed, we couldn't be more grateful,"" he added. Singer Richard Ashcroft was in the studio with Evans to play the first song live - Lucky Man by his former band The Verve. ""There's been a lot of talk about the first song I'm going to play,"" Evans said before he introduced the singer. ""But I press buttons, I don't play songs, musicians play songs. Why don't we get a musician to play a song live, how about Richard Ashcroft?"" Other guests appearing on Evans's first Virgin show included actors Fay Ripley and Paul Whitehouse. Evans was pictured outside the Virgin Radio studios in south London before his first show In what could be a sign of things to come, comedians Romesh Ranganathan and Rob Beckett were also on topromote their Sky One show,external. Sky are sponsoring Evans's show, which means it will not feature adverts - a first for a commercial radio breakfast show. Evans explained he has signed a three-year contract at Virgin, but added he's likely to extend that to five years. Features on the new programme include Gobsmackers, Golden Oldie and Big Screen Belter - where listeners request their favourite song from a movie soundtrack. Evans informed listeners of two changes since he was last heard on air - that his family has a new dog and that he no longer owns a smartphone. James Corden was among those towelcome Evans to the airwaves,externalon Twitter, writing: ""It's making me feel incredibly homesick and yet warm and fuzzy at the same time."" Listeners also were generally positive about the show, although some struggled to track down the digital-only Virgin on their radios. Allow Twitter content?

The DJ told listeners Zoe Ball, who has taken over the breakfast show on BBC Radio 2, sent him a message over the weekend to wish him good luck. Dismissing rumours of any rivalry between the two, Evans said: ""If anybody's any good at anything, there's room for everyone. And it helps with the quality of the business."" Songs by Blondie, Queen, Coldplay, Stereophonics, KT Tunstall, Oasis, Kings of Leon and Blossoms were on the playlist for Evans's first show on Virgin, which broadly specialises in rock and indie music. The Daily Telegraph,externalgave the show three stars out of five, with Charlotte Runcie writing: ""Fans of his previous breakfast show on BBC Radio 2 will be delighted to hear that it's more of the same. In fact, it's eerily similar. ""Comparisons between Virgin and Radio 2 are inevitable... Zoe Ball and Evans have an on-air rivalry going back decades. On the strength of the early showings from both of them, Ball's is the more enjoyable listening experience. It's more laidback and inclusive, whereas Evans's show sometimes feels like high-rolling posturing."" Evans urged listeners to retune their radios to receive Virgin in a promotional advert Clive Davis ofThe Times,external, gave Evans four stars: ""If you are allergic to Evans' brand of chatter, you won't be converted, but there must be an awful lot of Radio 2 listeners who find Ball's style so uneven that they will be working out how to retune their radios. Flash Chris is still full of himself, but there were glimpses of a humble, new-age Chris, a parent who gives thought to how radio can be a form of positive energy."" Jan Moir from the Daily Mail,external, had mixed feelings: ""Chris Evans is a truly gifted broadcaster and there is a quickening in the airwaves when he is around. He has superb interviewing skills, whether he is chatting to an excited child or a global international megastar - like Fay Ripley! ""Yet he can be annoying. Yes, it is delightful that he is the proud father of four, but I do wish he wouldn't drone on about his own children or namecheck them in every show."" Mark Lawson, writing in the Guardian,external, gave the new show three stars. ""If Virgin can become enough of a radio player to create an Evans-Ball breakfast battle with Radio 2, then rarely have listeners been offered such a contrast - Zoe the fun neighbour, Chris the would-be radio leader of the world. But he issued a note of caution. ""One of the better BBC executives would surely have warned, with Ball now the perceived rival, against putting together an opening line-up that sounded so male - especially when Evans, Alexander, Beckett, Ranganathan, and another guest, comedian Paul Whitehouse, were mannishly cackling together for a lengthy spell. ""The guests announced for the rest of the week were also mainly men, which feels like Evans taking his eye off Ball, and the extent to which she has feminised Radio 2 breakfast."" The 52-year-old's new show, which will run weekdays from 06:30-10:00, is unusual for a commercial radio station in that it will not feature adverts. Instead, the show is sponsored by Sky, with Evans promoting their programmes during his slot. Many of Evans's former team members have followed him to Virgin for the new show - including sports reporter Vassos Alexander and travel presenter Rachel Horne. But his former newsreader Moira Stuart is not joining them, as she's insteadmoving to Classic FM. The Virgin Radio Evans is joining is not the same one he left in 2001. That station was rebranded to Absolute Radio in 2008. Instead, he is joining a new iteration of Virgin Radio, which was launched in March 2016. Edith Bowman was the first host of breakfast, where she remained for 18 months. Chris Evans: A life in broadcasting Evans bids emotional farewell to Radio 2 Chris Evans's tearful goodbye speech in full Sam Pinkham and Amy Voce then took over the slot. Both are now moving to different shows on the station with Evans's arrival. Virgin's other current presenters include Matt Richardson and former Big Brother winner Kate Lawler. The launch of Virgin Radio was so recent that, as part of the marketing campaign for the breakfast show,Evans has encouraged listeners to retune their radios,external, as many may not currently receive the station. Virgin currently attracts around 414,000 listeners a week - but that figure is likely to jump given Evans's profile. His first show on Virgin comes a week afterZoe Ball made her debutas Evans's successor on BBC Radio 2, becoming the first woman to host the coveted breakfast slot. Zoe Ball has taken over the Radio 2 breakfast show, which Evans hosted for nine years The two are going head-to-head in the battle for listeners for the first time since 1997, when Ball hosted the BBC Radio 1 Breakfast Show as Evans made his debut on the previous iteration of Virgin. Last year, Evans was the second highest-paid star at the BBC, earning Â£1.6 million per year. There have been reports that he will earn more than that from Virgin but he has denied that his move was about the money. When he announced his departure and explained his decision in September 2018, he said: ""Some of us are mountain climbers [but] if you get to the top of your favourite mountain and you stay there, you become an observer. I want to keep climbing."" He has also suggested he willtake part in the next series of Strictly Come Dancing, which will see him interviewed regularly by his new rival Ball, who hosts the spin-off show It Takes Two.

US teen denies mocking Native American,"Nick Sandmann (left) and Nathan Phillips (right) both said they were trying to defuse tensions A teenager involved in a controversial encounter between a Native American man and a crowd of students has spoken out. A video appeared to show some of the boys laughing and jeering as Omaha elder Nathan Phillips sang and drummed in Washington. The footage, which went viral, led to widespread criticism of the boys. However, additional video footage has provided further details of the incident, while student Nick Sandmann has denied mocking Mr Phillips. Native Americans removed from college tour How far do free speech protections go in the US? Anger at Trump's Native American tweet ""I did not make any hand gestures or aggressive moves,"" he said. ""I believed that by remaining motionless and calm, I was helping to diffuse [sic] the situation."" At least three groups appear to have been involved in Friday's incident. Students from Kentucky's Covington Catholic High School, who had finished taking part in March for Life, an anti-abortion rally, had gathered at the Lincoln Memorial. The group of teenagers was predominantly white, and many wore Make America Great Again caps. Mr Phillips and many other Native American activists were also at the memorial, having taken part in the Indigenous Peoples March. Meanwhile, a group of black men, who called themselves Hebrew Israelites, were at the scene. Video footage shows them shouting insults at many people, including Native Americans, as well as the schoolboys. As the group shouted at the students, some of the teenagers began chanting, and one of them took his top off. Mr Phillips then approached the students, singing and beating a drum, in what he said was a prayer to defuse tensions. He was surrounded by the students, some of whom began chanting and singing as well. A short video emerged showing Mr Sandmann smiling and standing directly in front of Mr Phillips as he beat the drum. Other students laughed, shouted and clapped along. Allow Instagram content?

The video went viral as many accused the boys of mocking and being disrespectful towards the Elder. The Covington Catholic High School apologised,externalto Mr Phillips and said they would investigate and ""take appropriate action, up to and including expulsion"". 'The bed that saved me from the Taliban' Why are single women still mistaken for prostitutes? Can anyone 'own' the Moon? Meanwhile, the Sisters of Mercy,a Catholic group, also criticised the boys' behaviour,external, saying the videos showed ""a bigoted disrespect of indigenous peoples"". However, supporters of the students said they were being unfairly targeted, while others began searching social media forfurther video, which showed the Hebrew Israelites group shouting at the students,,externaland Mr Phillips approaching them. In a statement released by a PR company, Mr Sandmann said ""outright lies"" were being spread about him and his family and that he had received death threats as a result of the incident. He said the group of African American protesters had called the students ""racists"" and ""incest kids"". ""Because we were being loudly attacked and taunted in public, a student in our group asked one of our teacher chaperones for permission to begin our school spirit chants to counter the hateful things that were being shouted at our group."" Then, he said, the Native American protesters approached the students, including Mr Phillips, who was playing his drum. ""I did not see anyone try to block his path,"" he said. ""He locked eyes with me and approached me, coming within inches of my face. He played his drum the entire time he was in my face."" ""To be honest, I was startled and confused as to why he had approached me,"" he said. ""I never felt like I was blocking the Native American protester. He did not make any attempt to go around me... I was not intentionally making faces at the protester. I did smile at one point because I wanted him to know that I was not going to become angry, intimidated or be provoked into a larger confrontation."" ""I respect this person's right to protest and engage in free speech activities... I believe he should re-think his tactics of invading the personal space of others, but that is his choice to make."" Mr Sandmann said the students had only used school chants, and he had not heard anyone make hateful or racist remarks. However,Mr Phillips, who appeared upset in a video after that encounter,external, said he had heard the students saying ""build that wall"". Nathan Phillips, centre, at a 2017 protest against an oil pipeline That phrase was not audible in video footage of the incident. Two other participants in the Indigenous Peoples March, anda photojournalist covering the march,external, told US media they had heard people chanting ""build that wall"" and ""Trump 2020"".

Archbishop Welby says he prays 'in tongues',"Archbishop Welby: ""It's not something to make a great song and dance about"" The Archbishop of Canterbury says he prays in tongues early every morning. Tongues, understood by believers to be a divine language, involves sounds with no easily understood meaning. The Most Rev Justin Welby, who is the leader of the Anglican Church, also says he expects to hear messages and prophecies from God through others. The Archbishop said it wasn't something to make a ""song and dance about"", saying using tongues was seldom an ""ecstatic"" experience for him. Tongues are less associated with Anglicanism than with a form of Christianity known as ""charismatic"" . Many charismatic worshippers expect the work of the Holy Spirit to be seen in miracles and supernatural occurrences in their lives. Speaking to Christian radio station Premier,external, Archbishop Welby said every Christian was a charismatic in one sense, as they were ""filled with the spirit"", according to the New Testament. He said: ""In my own prayer life, and as part of my daily discipline I pray in tongues every day - not as an occasional thing but as part of daily prayer."" He added: ""It's not something to make a great song and dance about. ""Given it's usually extremely early in the morning it's not usually an immensely ecstatic moment because I'm sort of 'Urrgh' - struggling."" In the interview, the archbishop also said he had been encouraged by messages people believed to have been given to them by God - often known as 'words of knowledge'. He said: ""I expect to hear from God through other people with words of knowledge or prophecies. ""An awful lot of those come in - some of them, shall we say, we read them and think I'm not entirely sure about that, and others I think 'Oh yes, I can sense there being something of the spirit of God in that.'"" Archbishop: I don't pray for my daughter's disability Archbishop calls for 'spirit of openness' Archbishop 'ashamed' of Church over abuse Before becoming a priest in the Church of England, the archbishop was a member of Holy Trinity Brompton, in west London, where speaking in tongues and ""words of knowledge"" are not uncommon practices. Tongues have no readily comprehended meaning and are sometimes believed to be a divine language unknown to the person using them. Many believers consider tongues to come from the Holy Spirit and think they can be used in prayer when a worshipper feels unsure what to pray. According to the Bible: ""The Holy Spirit helps us in our weakness. For example, we don't know what God wants us to pray for. But the Holy Spirit prays for us with groanings that cannot be expressed in words."" (Romans 8:26). Praying in tongues is often associated with so-called ""charismatic Christianity"" - in which believers consider miracles and signs  to be part of their every day lives. ""Words of knowledge"" and ""prophecies"" are messages which believers consider to be revelations given to them by God about people or future events. Some Christians believe the Holy Spirit can transmit this knowledge to a person through their daily life. They say this knowledge can be anything from the mundane, such as where to find your house keys, to the more significant, such as how to solve a major crisis. Archbishop Welby said many letters claiming to be messages from God were sent to his official residence, Lambeth Palace.

Ja Rule: I was scammed by Fyre Festival too,"Ja Rule's lawyers argued that McFarland (right) used his name and connections to promote the event Ja Rule claims he was scammed and lost money through his involvement with 2017's Fyre Festival. The rapper has spoken out after two documentaries shed light on what happened at the flop Bahamas event. Ticket holders were promised a weekend partying with influencers on a private island but instead got rain-soaked mattresses in disaster tents and their luggage dumped in an unlit car-park. Ja denied he was involved in defrauding party-goers and locals on the island. Tickets for the festival were available for up to $75,000 (Â£58,000). Billy McFarland, founder of Fyre, is serving a six-year jail term but Ja Rule was not arrested or charged in connection with the fraud. He shared his views on the festival, the documentaries and questions on why his involvement wasn't being investigated by US authorities on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

Two documentaries, on Netflix and US streaming site Hulu, were released last week but Ja Rule wasn't interviewed for either. In the Netflix documentary, he is heard saying ""It's not like anybody died"" in a conference call with Fyre employees after the event collapsed. Ja Rule is also seen at part of the early stages of promoting the festival, which included filming a promotional trailer featuring influencers and models such as Kendall Jenner, Bella Hadid and Hailey Baldwin.

He also defended his original ""vision"" for Fyre Festival and said it wouldn't make sense for him to ""scam or fraud anyone."" Billy McFarland didn't appear in the Netflix documentary because the producers of the doc refused to pay him for his appearance. ""We just didn't feel comfortable with him benefitting after so many people had been hurt based on what he had done,"" director Chris Smith recently told BBC Radio 1 Newsbeat. Ja Rule also expressed anger over this payment, saying that any money paid to Fyre Festival employees for appearing in either the Netflix or Hulu documentaries should have gone to the people of Great Exuma in the Bahamas who lost money.

Israel targets Iranian positions in SyriaIsrael's military says it hit sites operated by elite Iranian units as well as Syrian air defences.Middle East,"This video can not be played An onlooker captures explosions in the night sky over Damascus. Israel says it has hit Iranian targets around the Syrian capital, Damascus. The Israel Defense Forces say the overnight operation targeted the elite Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, as well as Syrian air defences. The Syrian military says it shot down most of the Israeli missiles. But a monitoring group reported that at least 11 pro-government fighters were killed. The IDF says it acted after the Quds Force fired a rocket from Syria towards the occupied Golan Heights on Sunday. Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, has sent thousands of military personnel to support Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil war. Israel and Iran on collision course The IDF rarely admits carrying out attacks inside Syria.But it announced the start of Monday's strikes on the Quds Force in a tweet,external. A statement issued later said Israeli fighter jets had hit munition storage sites, a site located in Damascus International Airport, an Iranian intelligence site and an Iranian military training camp. The jets also struck several Syrian military air defence batteries after dozens of surface-to-air missiles were launched ""despite clear warnings"", it added. Allow Twitter content?

""We're operating both against Iran and against the Syrian forces that are abetting the Iranian aggression,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. ""We'll strike at anyone who tried to harm us. Whoever threatens to eliminate us, bears full responsibility."" Israel v Iran in 300 words Syria war: Who's fighting whom? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that weapons depots and positions belonging to Iranian forces and the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah, were hit. It said at least 11 fighters, including two Syrians, were killed. Syria's state-run Sana news agency quoted a military source as saying it ""confronted an Israeli attack"",externaland ""prevented it from achieving its objectives"". The IDF said it targeted Syrian air defence batteries after they ignored warnings not to fire ""Our air defences dealt with the situation and intercepted the hostile missiles, downing most of them before reaching their targets as they continue their heroic response to the aggression,"" the source added, without mentioning any casualties. The Russian military, which like Iran also backs the Syrian government, said more than 30 missiles and guided bombs were shot down. However, it added that the ""infrastructure"" of Damascus International Airport was partially damaged and that four Syrian soldiers were killed and six were wounded. There was no immediate comment from Iran. But the head of its air force, Brig Gen Aziz Nasirzadeh, said the country was ""fully ready and impatient to confront the Zionist regime and eliminate it from the Earth"", according to the Young Journalists' Club website. The operation came a day after the IDF said the Quds Force had launched an Iranian-made surface-to-surface rocket from Syrian territory towards the northern Golan Heights, which was intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system. The IDF said a rocket fired by the Quds Force endangered skiers at a resort on Mount Hermon IDF spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said the rocket endangered thousands of Israeli civilians at a ski resort on Mount Hermon in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The rocket launch followed a reported Israeli air raid on Damascus airport on Sunday afternoon, which a Syrian military source said air defences also ""thwarted"". By Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic correspondent, BBC News The strategic context on Israel's northern border is changing. All the major actors are trying to influence the new rules of the game. President Assad has survived; in large part due to Iranian support. President Trump is pulling out US ground forces from Syria. And Russia, which also backs Mr Assad, is eager to put its diplomatic stamp on future developments. It is this new context that - in part - explains Israel's greater willingness to speak publicly about its air campaign. The strategic dialogue between Israel and Russia continues at a high level. Only last week senior Russian officers were in Israel for talks. But Russia has not persuaded the Syrians to remove or contain Iran's growing presence. Israel's war of attrition is set to continue. But the firing of a missile from Syria, which prompted an additional wave of Israeli strikes, shows just how dangerous things are becoming. Until recently the IDF rarely commented on reports of strikes. But it has become increasingly open about its attempts to dislodge Iranian forces. Earlier this month,IDF's now former military chief-of staff Lt Gen Gadi Eisenkot told the New York Times the IDF had struck ""thousands"" of targets,externalsince Syria's civil war began in 2011. Until two-and-a-half years ago, the IDF mainly struck Iranian weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah, he said. Iran then changed its strategy significantly, seeking to build a 100,000-strong force of Shia militia fighters from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq and constructing intelligence bases at Syrian air force facilities, he added. Gen Eisenkot said that in January 2017 he had obtained the government's consent to change the IDF's tactics and strikes in Syria began to take place almost daily.

"Breakfast hit by shrinkflationBread and cereal products are most likely to have shrunk in size, but remained at the same price.Business","Bread and breakfast cereals are the most likely to be affected by shrinkflation, whereby a product shrinks in size but its price doesn't. The Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalstudied the price of 17,000 items between September 2015 and June 2017. It found 206 products in all categories had shrunk in size, while 79 increased. The Brexit vote sparked a fall in the pound and a rise in the price of imports. But the ONS said this did not lead to a pick-up in shrinkflation. ""There was no trend in the frequency of size changes over this period, which included the EU referendum,"" the UK statistics body said. Biscuits and chocolates take the shrinkflation test Among bread and cereals the ONS found 36 cases of shrinkflation. The next two categories with the largest number of shrinkflation cases were meat and confectionery. But most categories also saw some products increase in size. There were 18 increases in size among the bread and cereal category, and 13 meat products where this happened. These popular snacks have been subjected to shrinkflation But the category most likely to rise in size for the same price was tobacco, where there were also no examples of packets shrinking. Shrinkflation is not a widespread problem, although products are much more likely to contract than expand. The ONS estimates that in 2016, just 1-2.1% of food products in its sample shrunk in size, while 0.3-0.7% got bigger. Mike Hardie, head of inflation at the Office for National Statistics, said: ""Over the last few years, consumers may have noticed that some companies have reduced the size of their products while the price remained the same, which is often attributed to operational and material cost rises."" Sarah Coles, personal finance analyst at stockbrokers Hargreaves Lansdown, said there had been few cost increases recently: ""In the past, companies blamed the rising price of raw materials. In the last couple of years these prices dropped back, but the shrinkage continued. ""The ONS investigated whether this was due to the fall in the pound, but said it hadn't spotted trends that can be attributed to a Brexit effect. It may simply be that manufacturers have found a way to boost profits under the radar.""

Dingoes attack boy on Australian island,"Dingo attacks are rare but can be deadly A young boy has been attacked by a group of dingoes on Australia's popular tourist spot of Fraser Island. One of the wild dogs bit the six-year old at a beach after he'd been swimming with his parents. He was airlifted to a nearby hospital and is in a stable condition. Australia's dingoes are protected in some national parks but there have been rare instances where they have attacked people. ""The family had finished swimming when the young boy said he wanted to race up a sand dune,"" Dan Leggat of the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland Lifeflight rescue told local media. ""Unfortunately, when he got to the top, there was a pack of four dingoes. One of the dingoes attacked the boy and bit him on the leg."" How dangerous are dingoes? Fraser Island is home to the purest dingo population in Australia Fraser Island, a World Heritage site, is the world's largest sand island and situated off the southern coast of Queensland. It is home to what is regarded the purest dingo population in Australia and there are thought to be around 200 of the animals on the island. The Fraser Island dingoes are more curious and less wary than mainland dingoes, and authorities warn visitors not to feed them and to walk in groups. In 2001, a nine-year-old boy was killed and his seven-year-old brother injured after being attacked by several dingoes on the island. Dingoes were also at the centre of one of Australia's most controversial trials, when Lindy Chamberlain was convicted of murdering her nine-week-old daughter Azaria in 1980. She spent three years in jail before a court quashed her conviction and ruled that her baby had been taken by a dingo from a campsite near Uluru, then known as Ayers Rock. Dingoes were first introduced into Australia some 3,000 to 4,000 years ago and are thought to be descended from a domestic dog brought in from Indonesia.

China's annual growth slowest in decades,"China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990, stoking fears about the impact on the global economy. China expanded at 6.6% in 2018, official figures out Monday showed. In the three months to December, the economy grew 6.4% from a year earlier, down from 6.5% in the previous quarter. The data was in line with forecasts but underlines recent concern about weakening growth in the world's second-biggest economy. China's rate of expansion has raised worries about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy. The trade war with the US has added to the gloomy outlook. The official figures out Monday showed the weakest quarterly growth rate since the global financial crisis. What does China's slowdown mean for the UK? China mulls longer weekend to boost shopping Why are the Chinese buying fewer cars? While China watchers advise caution with Beijing's official GDP numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory. By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent China's economic slowdown is not news in itself. Beijing has broadcast this for several years, that it's going to focus on the quality not quantity of growth. But still, we should be worried. Slower growth in China means slower growth for the rest of the world. It accounts for one-third of global growth. Jobs, exports, commodity producing nations - we all depend on China to buy stuff from us. Slower growth in China also means it is harder for China to address its mountain of debt, even with the Communist Party's undoubted ability to be able to support the economy. Why China's slowdown should worry us all Growth has been easing for years, but concern over the pace of the slowdown in China has risen in recent months as companies sound the alarm over the crucial market. Earlier this monthApple warned weakness in China would hit its sales. Carmakers and other firms have spoken out on the impact of the trade war with the US. China's government has been pushing to shift away from export-led growth to depend more on domestic consumption. Policymakers in China have stepped up efforts in recent months to support the economy. Those measures to boost demand include speeding-up construction projects, cutting some taxes, and reducing the level of reserves banks need to hold. Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said the Chinese economy remained weak at the end of 2018 ""but held up better than many feared"". ""Still, with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify... China's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year.""

"'Landmark' overhaul for domestic abuse lawsA new definition of abuse will include economic harm, manipulation and controlling behaviour.UK","Claire Throssell - with her sons Jack and Paul - was cross-examined by her abuser in court Non-physical and economic abuse are to be included in the first legal definition of domestic abuse as part of a landmark overhaul of the law. Under thedraft laws,external, a wide range of measures will also include domestic abusers being banned from cross-examining victims in family courts. The home secretary said the changes would ""bolster protection for victims"". Campaigners say the measures are a ""once in a generation"" opportunity to combat the impact of abuse. Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, the director of the charity Surviving Economic Abuse, said adding economic abuse to the legal definition was ""highly significant"" and would give victims ""more confidence"" when they came forward. The draft bill going before MPs will also: Create new powers to force perpetrators into behaviour-changing rehabilitation programmes Make victims automatically eligible for special protections when they are giving evidence in criminal trials Set up a national ""domestic abuse commissioner"" tasked with improving the response and support for victims across public services The definition of domestic abuse will specifically recognise that it goes beyond crimes of violence and includes victims who are psychologically coerced and manipulated, as well as those who have no control of their finances. The legislation will also clarify the workings of ""Clare's Law"" - a measure introduced four years ago to permit police to tell a member of the public if there are concerns over about previous violence committed by their partner. Domestic abuse: Majority of controlling cases dropped Coercive control: How father's abuse turned into murder 'My mum killed my dad with a hammer but I want her freed' One woman, who has suffered abuse from different partners, told the BBC described how one of them controlled her spending. She said: ""When I got a job he said to me, 'Well you've been bankrupt' - I'd gone through bankruptcy with my first marriage, I'd had a business that had gone through - all related to that abuse I was enduring, so he said, 'Well you can't possibly look after your finances on your own, I'll take control of that for you, so pay your salary into my account.' ""Which of course I did, and then he said, 'I'll pay you a weekly allowance.' I then had to account for every single penny I was spending and if I didn't use it, I had to give it back."" Anothervictim of domestic abuse, Claire Throssell,from Sheffield, was cross-examined by her husband - after they had separated - during two separate court hearings over access to their two children. Her husband went on to kill her two sons in a house fire. Talking about coming face-to-face with her ex-partner in court, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""All the evidence was there but he was still trying to control, so you feel like you're still that piece of dirt underneath his shoe. ""How dare I take him to court, how dare I keep the children away from him? ""It was a good job I had a solicitor there because when you've been told for long enough that you can't do something, whenever you see the person that's installed that in you - and it is installed for years and years and years - you instantly curl up again inside and you instantly feel again worthless."" Justice Secretary David Gauke said the cross-examination by abusers of their victims in family courts could cause ""immense distress"" and amount to ""a continuation of abuse"". This video can not be played Claire Throssell's sons, Jack and Paul, were killed by her ex-husband Victoria Atkins, Minister for Crime, Safeguarding and Vulnerability, said: ""I have heard absolutely heartbreaking accounts of victims whose lives have been ripped apart because of the physical, emotional or economic abuse they have suffered by someone close to them. ""The draft domestic abuse bill recognises the complex nature of these horrific crimes and puts the needs of victims and their families at the forefront."" But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said survivors of domestic violence had waited too long for the plans. ""If the Tories are serious about combating domestic violence, then there should be long-term funding commitments to ensure sufficient resources are available for abuse survivors,"" she said. Theresa May promised to overhaul domestic abuse laws almost two years ago - and the bill was a key pledge in the 2017 Queen's Speech. The public consultation closed eight months ago - and only now are we seeing the final package. So, given government is so pre-occupied with Brexit, it's not clear when there will be Parliamentary time to turn the measures into law. Campaigners say the plans must be a national priority - not least because of the government's staggering estimate of the costs supports what they have said for years. The Â£66bn figure is an estimate of the full impact of perpetrators on society - not just the cost of clearing up a specific crime. One housing association in Sunderland, for example,spent Â£8m on repairs,externalsuspected to be linked to domestic violence. There are many other hidden impacts, including the damaged life chances for children scarred by what they experience. Sandra Horley, chief executive of the charity Refuge, welcomed the draft bill - saying it was a ""once in a generation"" opportunity. And Suzanne Jacob, head of SafeLives, said: ""For too long, we've expected victims and children to uproot their lives while the perpetrators remain invisible and unchallenged by the system. ""The new change in approach reflects what hundreds of survivors told SafeLives they wanted - we're pleased the government is listening.""

CIA spy who inspired Affleck movie Argo dies,"Tony Mendez was a specialist in disguises and forgeries at the CIA Ex-CIA agent Tony Mendez, who inspired the Oscar-winning film Argo, has died at the age of 78. He had been suffering from Parkinson's Disease. At the CIA, Mendez specialised in disguises, forgery and rescues. He is best known for smuggling six American diplomats out of Iran during the 1979-81 hostage crisis by posing as a film producer. Ben Affleck, who directed Argo and starred as Mendez, called him ""a true American hero"". ""He was a man of extraordinary grace, decency, humility and kindness,"" Affleck said in a tweet.

Tony Mendez, the real CIA spy in Argo Argo: The true story behind Ben Affleck's Globe-winning film Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell also tweeted that Mendez ""was one of the best officers to ever serve at CIA"". ""His work was unique, and it help [sic] to protect our nation in significant ways."" Mendez's literary agent, Christy Fetcher, said: ""He was surrounded with love from his family and will be sorely missed."" Born in 1940, Mendez worked as a draughtsman after graduating from university and joined the CIA after answering a blind advert for a graphic artist. Over a 25-year career he worked with Hollywood make-up artists and magicians to perfect disguises and fake identities. He served in multiple foreign posts, mostly in Asia. In 1980 he orchestrated what would later be called the ""Canadian Caper"", a daring rescue of six American diplomats from Iran. The diplomats were forced to shelter in Canada's embassy in Tehran after protesters overran the American embassy. Mendez met the six and helped them to pose as a Canadian film crew scouting locations for a non-existent sci-fi movie, Argo. With Canada's help, the group was able to evade Iranian security services and board a flight to Zurich from Tehran. After retiring from the CIA, Mendez ran an art studio and wrote three memoirs about his experiences. ""I've always considered myself to be an artist first,"" he told the Washington Post, ""and for 25 years I was a pretty good spy.""

Businesses break card surcharge rules,"This video can not be played Card surcharges: Customers charged hundreds illegally Customers are paying hundreds of pounds as retailers are illegally charging for card payments, a BBC investigation has found. Credit and debit card surcharges were banned in January 2018, but retailers, letting agents and even a university have been found breaking the rules. The legislation means customers cannot be charged more for paying by card. Matt Dickinson, from the Federation of Small Businesses, said for many it could simply be an ""honest mistake"". In some cases, the surcharge may be as little as 50p but when companies charge a percentage for using a card machine, the price can soar. The BBC discovered a total of nine businesses across England, from a Chinese takeaway in Exeter to a beer delivery service in Blackpool, charging customers extra to pay using a credit card. The University of Hull offered a discount for students who did not pay their fees using a credit card The University of Hull was found to be offering a 2% discount for students choosing to pay their fees by means other than a credit card, which Sylvia Rook from the Chartered Trading Standards Institute said was ""no different"" to a card surcharge. This meant students who paid this year's annual tuition fees using credit or debit cards were charged over Â£170 more than everyone else. The university said it was a ""genuine mistake"" and it had refunded affected students after the BBC informed it the charges were illegal. Rebecca Mansoor from Whitby, North Yorkshire, said she was told by Nissan Finance she would have to pay a Â£375 surcharge for paying off her car using her credit card in December 2018. ""I knew something was wrong in the back of my mind, but it's a big company so you would think they know the law,"" she said. Mrs Mansoor decided to pay using bank transfer to avoid the charge, something she describes as ""frustrating"" as she wanted the protection of using her credit card and the option to pay off the credit loan more slowly. Rebecca Mansoor was told she would be charged an extra Â£375 if she paid off her car using a credit card Ms Rook said some companies suggest that using credit cards ""may attract"" a surcharge - which technically would be payable if business rather than personal credit card was used - to deter customers paying by card. Mrs Mansoor said she was clearly told she would incur the surcharge over the phone, something reiterated on the Nissan finance website which says payment by credit card ""will attract an additional charge of 2.5% of the amount paid"". Nissan said its website had now been updated and added there was no surcharge. Nissan Finance says on its website that paying by credit card will incur an additional charge of 2.5% In Birmingham a car dealer insisted on a 3% card surcharge that, in a transaction discussed with an Inside Out reporter posing as a customer planning to buy a car for Â£4,795, meant an extra cost of Â£143.85. The car was not purchased. During secret filming, the second hand trader at Rose Motors said the charge was due to ""the machine we use"". Ms Rook said anyone who had incurred a card surcharge was entitled to return to the retailer and get their money back. When asked for a response, the company's director said it did not know the rules had changed and would stop adding the surcharge. Ms Rook said it is ""very hard to determine the scale"" of the problem, which she said is ""usually down to ignorance"", as Trading Standards are not often notified of the charges. ""People need to complain, go and get their money back and notify Trading Standards,"" she said. Card surcharges were banned in January 2018 Card surcharges were banned following a directive from the European Union, which banned such fees on Visa and Mastercard payments. But the UK government went further and also banned American Express and PayPal charges. Trading standards officers are supposed to police the system. But due to financial cuts and pressure on servicesthe organisation said enforcement of rules on surcharges was ""unlikely to be a priority""when the laws came in last year. In 2010, consumers spent Â£473m on such charges, according to estimates by the Treasury. Despite the surcharge ban being in place for a year, Mr Dickinson said it was understandable some small businesses ""aren't fully across the details"". ""There's a lot of different rules in there that haven't been particularly well explained,"" he said. The sentiment was echoed by David Cox, from the Association of Retail Letting Agents, after estate agents across the country were also found charging more for card payments. ""Every few months there are new laws coming out,"" he said. ""Agents are missing some."" Agents in Newcastle-upon-Tyne, London and Southend-on-Sea told an undercover reporter during secret filming that they added a surcharge on rental payments of between 2-3% for customers paying by credit card.  All of the agents the BBC visited have now updated their policies. Ms Rook said there had been ""a lot of confusion"" but ""there are no exemptions"" to the surcharge ban for personal credit and debit cards. Surcharges are still allowed on the use of corporate credit cards.

MI5 and law firm among 'best LGBT employers',"MI5, a law firm, a fire brigade and the Welsh government are among the best LGBT employers in the UK, according to Stonewall. Solicitors Pinsent Masons is number one in a list of the top 100 companies for 2019, says the LGBT charity. Several universities, the British Army, Lloyds Bank and homeless charity St Mungo's also feature. Stonewall says LGBT-inclusive employers play a ""crucial role in changing society"". Its executive director Darren Towers says Pinsent Mansons is ""leading the way, championing lesbian, gay, bi and trans equality in the workplace"". ""They know that helping staff feel that they can bring their full selves to work doesn't just make a huge difference to individual team members - it makes real business sense too."" Lawyer Finlay Fraser works for Pinsent Masons Stonewall says the law firm topped the list because of its inclusive policies, attitudes towards transgender staff and visitors, and involvement in campaigns - including marriage equality in Northern Ireland. ""When you are able to bring your whole self to work, you are more productive, you're happier and you stay longer,"" says 27-year-old lawyer Finlay Fraser, who's LGBT and works at Pinsent Masons. ""A goal for me is to be as authentic as I can be and I definitely feel like I am where I work."" Finlay believes the reason the company is number one is because of its diverse workforce and the support and understanding it has for its staff. ""A person who is LGBT and BAME is going to have a different experience than someone who is white and LGBT,"" he says. ""This company does a lot of work recognising that those two groups will have different experiences. ""It creates an environment where employees from diverse backgrounds want to work."" Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service came fourth last year but have now jumped to third As well as Pinsent Masons, the other companies which make the top five are Cheshire Fire and Rescue Service, MI5, the National Assembly for Wales and law firm Bryan Cave Leighton Paisner. Cheshire's fire brigade - which is third - was recognised for its support networks and the work it does with LGBT people in the community. ""There are a lot of factors, particularly among older LGBT people that in theory put them at more risk of fire,"" says Mark Shone, who works in community safety. ""They're more likely to live alone, perhaps have mental health issues, more likely to be affected by substance misuse and they're all factors that make you at risk of fire. ""We've done a lot of work to trying to map where those people are and engage them in community safety."" Does the pride flag need black and brown stripes?

Women's frozen eggs 'should be stored longer',"Women who freeze their eggs should be allowed to keep them for longer than 10 years, fertility experts are telling the government. Legislation says frozen eggs must be destroyed after this time, unless a medical condition has left the woman prematurely infertile. Experts told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that the limit was arbitrary and had not kept up with technology. The government has said an extension ""would be a significant policy change"". Campaigners say the method of freezing has changed since the law was created, and the current method, vitrification, means eggs can be frozen without deterioration for an indeterminate period of time. They say the limit means a growing number of women face losing their chance of having a baby, or rushing to find a sperm donor so they can re-freeze an embryo. Sarah Norcross, director of the Progress Educational Trust, which helps people with infertility issues, is one of the three experts due to meet junior health minister Jackie Doyle-Price on Monday. ""There's absolutely no biological reason for this law,"" she said. ""It's discriminatory against women and removing an option for them to take charge of their reproductive system. ""If you want to freeze your eggs in your late 20s, you might not then have decided you want to use them by your late 30s."" Sabrina Maydew had her eggs frozen in her late 20s after a cancer scare and a family history of cancer. ""I didn't realise how fast the 10-year limit would come up, I always thought I'd get the chance to use them. ""In December last year I would have reached it. ""I reluctantly chose to use donor sperm - I was literally crying on the computer trying to choose. ""Right before the deadline I had scan results which showed thinning of the uterus lining and shrinking of the ovaries. ""So, in November I had a stay of execution - I was potentially prematurely infertile - it allows me to freeze my eggs for 55 years. ""I'm probably the only person who found out she was prematurely infertile and jumped for joy. ""I think now that I've actually chosen a sperm donor I may well go on with that, but the process was terrible and unnecessary."" Ms Norcross will be joined at the meeting by Baroness Deech, the former chairwoman of the Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, who raised this debate in the House of Lords last year, and Prof Emily Jackson, who specialises in medical law. In the debate last year, Conservative Lord O'Shaunghnessy said any extension to time limits for egg storage ""would be a significant social policy change, with far-reaching impacts on decisions that women make in starting families. It would require a broader public debate before any change could be contemplated"". The Department of Health and Social Care said concerns would be taken into account by Ms Doyle-Price during Monday's meeting, and any decisions made would be set out accordingly.

Soldier sues army over Q fever,"Wayne Bass served in Helmand in 2011 A former soldier is suing the Ministry of Defence after contracting Q fever in Afghanistan. Wayne Bass claims his life has been ruined by the Army's failure to provide antibiotics which would have protected him from the disease. His case is the first to test the MoD's duty to protect against Q fever, an infectious disease linked to exposure to animal excrement. The MoD says it is not appropriate to comment on ongoing legal cases. In 2011, Mr Bass, then a private serving with 2nd Battalion The Mercian Regiment, was deployed to Helmand Province, to an area known for its heavy Taliban presence and fire. Pte Bass's platoon was responsible for reconnaissance and protecting other forces. It is there that he believes he contracted Q fever, an infection caused by bacteria most commonly found in cattle, sheep, and goats. Humans typically get Q fever when they breathe in dust from faeces of infected animals. ""To avoid enemy fire I was constantly having to dive into ditches on the ground where farm animals had been, there were animals all over the place,"" he says. Wayne Bass's platoon was responsible for protecting other forces Initially, as is typical with the disease, he experienced flu-like symptoms and an army doctor diagnosed Q fever. Intravenous antibiotics failed to cure him and following periods in hospital and at the MoD's Headley Court rehabilitation centre in Surrey, he was diagnosed with Q fever chronic fatigue syndrome. Normally, the fever is successfully treated with antibiotics and it is rare for it to develop into chronic fatigue syndrome. ""On some days I'm OK, I can walk a few hundred metres but often I get breathless, have aches and pains all over my body for which I have to take very powerful painkillers. ""The nerve pain in my lower back and legs means that my back can lock up and I'm immobile. ""On a less bad day it can take 45 minutes to walk 600m,"" he says. His condition means he is unable to work, but the effects are not only physical: ""It has brought about a spike in my post-traumatic stress disorder, I have night terrors, I feel very low and isolated, very depressed. I am on anti-depressants. I can't see a future,"" he says. Justin Glenister, a partner at Hilary Meredith, the law firm acting for Mr Bass, believes the case breaks new legal ground. ""This is the first case in which the question will be asked whether the MoD had a duty to protect soldiers against this known risk of Q fever, which we say was a preventable risk, and what steps it ought to have taken to protect them. There are other similar cases being prepared."" The MoD's defence, seen by the BBC, says 200 personnel per year tested positive for Q fever in 2008-2011 and of those only a third were symptomatic. The MoD says the risk of contracting Q fever is very low and it follows the recommendations of theJoint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation,externalwhich does not recommend vaccination for Q Fever. Wayne Bass, as a young soldier and more recently Q-Vax, a vaccine against Q fever, is not licensed in the UK. Mr Bass's case is that the Army failed to provide the antibiotic doxycycline to guard against the risk of Q fever. But the MoD says it would not have been reasonable to use doxycycline due to its side-effects and because it would have compromised the effect of anti-malarial drugs given to troops. It denies that any action could have been taken to avoid him contracting Q fever. Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at Reading University, says: ""Doxycycline is an anti-malarial. If given it could have protected against both malaria and Q fever. I am puzzled that the army did not give it as a prophylactic."" Mr Bass, from Redditch, Worcestershire, says bringing the case is not about money. ""I'd take a cure over Â£50m in a second, I want other soldiers and officers to be made aware of the risks of Q fever and the devastating consequences it can have."" The five-day trial, starting on Monday at Central London County Court, will examine the extent of any duty owed by the army to Mr Bass in relation to Q fever, and whether that duty was breached. Its findings will be based in part on expert medical evidence, with judgement reserved to a later date.

UN peacekeepers killed in Mali attack,"Ten UN peacekeepers from Chad have been killed in an attack by suspected Islamist militants in northern Mali, the UN says. Another 25 Chadian troops were injured when the gunmen stormed the UN camp in Aguelhok early on Sunday. The attack was repelled, the UN says. The UN mission in Mali was set up in 2013 to fight Islamist militias operating in the country. Militants have regularly attacked UN and Malian troops since then. Al-Qaeda's North-African branch, Al-Qaeda in the Islamic Maghreb, said it carried out the latest attack, local media report.

Tony Mendez, the real CIA spy in Argo Argo: The true story behind Ben Affleck's Globe-winning film Former CIA deputy director Michael Morell also tweeted that Mendez ""was one of the best officers to ever serve at CIA"". ""His work was unique, and it help [sic] to protect our nation in significant ways."" Mendez's literary agent, Christy Fetcher, said: ""He was surrounded with love from his family and will be sorely missed."" Born in 1940, Mendez worked as a draughtsman after graduating from university and joined the CIA after answering a blind advert for a graphic artist. Over a 25-year career he worked with Hollywood make-up artists and magicians to perfect disguises and fake identities. He served in multiple foreign posts, mostly in Asia. In 1980 he orchestrated what would later be called the ""Canadian Caper"", a daring rescue of six American diplomats from Iran. The diplomats were forced to shelter in Canada's embassy in Tehran after protesters overran the American embassy. Mendez met the six and helped them to pose as a Canadian film crew scouting locations for a non-existent sci-fi movie, Argo. With Canada's help, the group was able to evade Iranian security services and board a flight to Zurich from Tehran. After retiring from the CIA, Mendez ran an art studio and wrote three memoirs about his experiences. ""I've always considered myself to be an artist first,"" he told the Washington Post, ""and for 25 years I was a pretty good spy.""

A forensic officer at the scene of the explosion on Sunday morning Three minutes later, a warning was called into the Samaritans in the West Midlands. It was passed to West Midlands police, who contacted the Police Service of Northern Ireland. ""In the intervening minutes we had already found the car and were starting to evacuate the area,"" said ACC Hamilton.

China economic figures confirm slowdown,"China's economy grew at its slowest rate since 1990, stoking fears about the impact on the global economy. China expanded at 6.6% in 2018, official figures out Monday showed. In the three months to December, the economy grew 6.4% from a year earlier, down from 6.5% in the previous quarter. The data was in line with forecasts but underlines recent concern about weakening growth in the world's second-biggest economy. China's rate of expansion has raised worries about the potential knock-on effect on the global economy. The trade war with the US has added to the gloomy outlook. The official figures out Monday showed the weakest quarterly growth rate since the global financial crisis. What does China's slowdown mean for the UK? China mulls longer weekend to boost shopping Why are the Chinese buying fewer cars? While China watchers advise caution with Beijing's official GDP numbers, the data is seen as a useful indicator of the country's growth trajectory. By Karishma Vaswani, BBC Asia business correspondent China's economic slowdown is not news in itself. Beijing has broadcast this for several years, that it's going to focus on the quality not quantity of growth. But still, we should be worried. Slower growth in China means slower growth for the rest of the world. It accounts for one-third of global growth. Jobs, exports, commodity producing nations - we all depend on China to buy stuff from us. Slower growth in China also means it is harder for China to address its mountain of debt, even with the Communist Party's undoubted ability to be able to support the economy. Why China's slowdown should worry us all Growth has been easing for years, but concern over the pace of the slowdown in China has risen in recent months as companies sound the alarm over the crucial market. Earlier this monthApple warned weakness in China would hit its sales. Carmakers and other firms have spoken out on the impact of the trade war with the US. China's government has been pushing to shift away from export-led growth to depend more on domestic consumption. Policymakers in China have stepped up efforts in recent months to support the economy. Those measures to boost demand include speeding-up construction projects, cutting some taxes, and reducing the level of reserves banks need to hold. Capital Economics China economist Julian Evans-Pritchard said the Chinese economy remained weak at the end of 2018 ""but held up better than many feared"". ""Still, with the headwinds from cooling global growth and the lagged impact of slower credit growth set to intensify... China's economy is likely to weaken further before growth stabilises in the second half of the year.""

Fox: Remainer MPs trying to steal Brexit,"This video can not be played Liam Fox: ""We can compromise... with the European Union over the backstop"" Brexiteer cabinet minister Liam Fox has accused pro-Remain MPs of trying to ""steal Brexit"", amid backbench moves to take control of the process. He told the BBC: ""You've got a Leave population and a Remain Parliament. Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process."" There are various backbench moves to prevent the UK leaving the European Union without a deal on 29 March. Labour's Sir Keir Starmer said the PM should rule out a no-deal Brexit. He said he believed it was ""inevitable"" that Article 50 would be delayed and that events in Parliament last week - whenMPs heavily rejected the withdrawal dealTheresa May has negotiated with the EU - mean that another referendum was now more likely. He told the BBC the prime minister must also change her ""red lines"" adding: ""If she won't, it's difficult to see where we go from here."" This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer: ""We're facing a possible no deal and therefore a public vote"" On Monday, Theresa May will make a statement to MPs setting out how she intends to proceed with Brexit, amid apparent deadlock in Parliament over a way forward. She will also table a motion to be debated and voted on, on 29 January. It is expected that various MPs will try to amend that motion over the course of the next week to put forward proposals to test the will of the Commons. International Trade Secretary Mr Fox told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""Parliament has not got the right to hijack the Brexit process because Parliament has said to the people of this country: 'We make a contract with you, you will make the decision and we will honour it.' Brexit: A really simple guide Liam Fox yet to seal no-deal trade agreements Theresa May should become mediator, says Sir John Major ""What we are now getting are some of those who were always absolutely opposed to the result of the referendum, trying to hijack Brexit and, in fact, steal the result from the people."" He warned that, if the referendum result was not honoured: ""The consequences politically would be astronomical"" Mr Fox also said that he believed the way to break the deadlock was to win over more Conservative MPs to the PM's deal by finding a ""different mechanism"" to the controversial ""backstop"" proposal, to prevent a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Two cross-party groups involving Labour's Yvette Cooper, and Tory Remainer Dominic Grieve are planning on tabling bills that could take a no-deal Brexit off the table Various MPs are likely to try to amend the PM's ""neutral"" motion - simply saying that the Commons has considered the PM's statement - which Theresa May will put forward on Monday. One group, including Labour's Yvette Cooper, the Conservative former Education Secretary Nicky Morgan, and Liberal Democrat MP Norman Lamb, among others, want the UK to extend its negotiations with the EU beyond 29 March - if MPs do not approve a withdrawal agreement by 26 February. Please upgrade your browser MPs voted in favour ofinvoking Article 50of the Lisbon Treaty - which allows the UK and EU two years to negotiate the terms of Brexit - in 2017 and the 29 March date is in UK legislation - the EU Withdrawal Act. Ms Morgan told Sky News the law would have to be changed if the UK was to be prevented from leaving the EU without a deal in place - and that is where the ""very short"" bill she is backing came in. Meanwhile Conservative Remainer Dominic Grieve wants backbench MPs to be able to choose to debate and vote on Brexit issues, one day a week - breaking with the usual practice where the government controls the parliamentary timetable. Mr Grieve said those debates could then give an indication to the government about what the Commons wanted. ""My intention is not to stop Brexit,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House. ""My intention has always been to try to ensure that the government is forced to listen to what the majority view of the House of Commons is on this."" But Conservative Brexiteer Peter Bone said Mr Grieve had ""lost the plot"" and his plan would not get through Parliament. By Nick Eardley, BBC political correspondent The government is continuing to look at ideas to end the deadlock in Parliament over Brexit. The key one Liam Fox was alluding to this morning is finding an alternative to the ""backstop"". But some MPs are now so angry with the government, they want to take control. Dominic Grieve's plan would allow Parliament to put its own ideas forward and be voted on. The working plan is 300 MPs would have to back a proposal for it to be discussed. A majority would have to then back it for it to be approved. The battle for control of Plan B is well under way. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the formal route for any country leaving the EU and it allows for a two-year process of negotiation. At the end of that period ""the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question"" unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. Brexit: What happens now? No-deal Brexit: Can Parliament stop it? It was backed by MPsand invoked on 29 March 2017, meaning the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March this year. But the withdrawal agreement reached by the EU and UK wasrejected by MPs by 432 votes to 202 on Tuesday. If MPs do not approve a deal, the UK is due to leave the EU without one, which would mean trade reverting to World Trade Organization rules. To extend Article 50, the UK would first have to make a request to the EU - which could be granted if all EU countries agree at a vote of the EU Council. Then it would have to table a statutory instrument to change the definition of ""exit day"" in the UK's EU Withdrawal Act. MPs would get a chance to vote on this change. According to anEuropean Court of Justice ruling in December, the UK could choose to cancel Brexit altogether without seeking the permission of the rest of the EU - something the government says it has no intention of doing.

May to focus on backstop in Brexit 'plan B',"UK Prime Minister Theresa May is making a statement to MPs on the way forward on Brexit after her planned deal was rejected by MPs last week. She hopes to win over Tory Brexiteer MPs and Northern Ireland's DUP, by resolving their concerns over the ""backstop"" plan for the Irish border. Last week, Mrs Maysaid she would focus on cross-party talksto get a Brexit deal accepted by Parliament. Downing Street insisted that cross-party talks were continuing. The backstop is the ""insurance policy"" in the withdrawal deal, intended to ensure that whatever else happens, there will be no return to a visible border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic after the UK leaves the EU. Both the UK and the EU believe that bringing back border checks could put the peace process at risk. But a way of avoiding those checks has yet to win over MPs. The DUP, which keeps Mrs May's minority government in power through a deal to support it in key votes, rejected her Brexit deal last Tuesday, but 24 hours later helped her see off a bid to oust her in a no confidence motion, saying it didn't want a change of government, just a change of policy. Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Brexit Live: May statement to MPs Kuenssberg: Should May stick with her plan? Brexit: A really simple guide Mrs May held a conference call with her cabinet on Sunday. It is understood she wants to show the EU that MPs could back a deal without a backstop, in the hope of encouraging Brussels to soften its position. Meanwhile BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg has suggested Mrs May may announce that fees will be waived for EU nationals who want to live in the UK after Brexit: Allow Twitter content?

Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor, said anyone waiting for a Plan B would be ""stuck at the bus stop for an awfully long time"". He said that reports over the weekend of the possibility of a bi-lateral agreement with the Irish Republic or a rewriting of theGood Friday Agreementhad been ""kiboshed"" by both governments. ""It is back to the backstop and trying to find some sort of breakthrough,"" he added. Mrs May's government agreed a withdrawal deal with the EU in November - covering topics such as the ""divorce bill"" and the Irish border -but it was rejected by MPs by a majority of 230 votes. If Parliament doesn't approve a withdrawal agreement, the UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March without a deal or transition period. The prime minister addresses the Commons on Monday afternoon, setting out how she intends to proceed with the Brexit withdrawal agreement. She will also table a ""neutral"" motion, simply saying that the Commons has considered her statement, which will be debated and voted upon on 29 January. This motion is expected to attract amendments from groups of backbenchers seeking more of a say in the process. Fox: Remainer MPs trying to steal Brexit PM should be Brexit mediator, says Major MPs are expected to table bills which could take a no-deal Brexit off the table, and potentially suspend Article 50 - which allows the UK to leave the EU. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics Under Mrs May's deal, if there is not a trade deal or other agreement between the UK and the EU when the transition period ends, the backstop kicks in. It would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also involve a temporary single custom territory - effectively keeping the whole of the UK in the EU customs union - unless both the EU and UK agree it is no longer necessary. But this has been a huge issue for many Conservative MPs and theDUP, who have supported Theresa May's government since the 2017 election. Removing or amending the backstop could provide Mrs May with enough backing from Brexiteer Tory MPs and the DUP to get an agreement passed. Labour's Yvette Cooper is trying to prevent a 'no-deal' Brexit Theresa May's government is engaged in a battle with MPs over who controls the Brexit process, after her deal with the EU was defeated by a record-breaking 230 votes last Tuesday. MPs are trying to use various Parliamentary tactics to tell Mrs May what to do - or force through alternatives to her Brexit deal. They can do this by tabling amendments - suggested changes - to a government motion, which is due to be voted on next Tuesday. Or by proposing new laws of their own. One group of MPs,headed by Labour's Yvette Cooper,with backing from Remainer Conservative MPs, is planning to table a bill that would delay the UK's planned departure date from the EU if the government is not able to get its deal through by 26 February. Private Members' Bills - laws proposed by MPs who are not in the government - can be passed but there's normally only very limited time to debate them. The government usually controls the agenda - what gets debated in Parliament. Some MPs now want to suspend the normal rules to allow time to debate and vote on a bill that would rule out a no-deal Brexit. That might not be enough though. If the bill will involve spending money it also needs a ""money resolution"". That has to be proposed by the government. So MPs face another obstacle if they want to take control of the Brexit process. European Commission Margaritis Schinas said: ""Don't look for answers to Brussels â¦ this is the moment for London to speak, not for us."" But Poland's Foreign Minister Jacek Czaputowicz has told the BBC that he has suggested time-limiting the Irish border backstop as a means of ""unblocking"" the negotiations. He said he had discussed his proposals with Ireland's foreign minister Simon Coveney and the UK's Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt, but did not know whether it was ""feasible"". German's foreign minister Heiko Mass said he had confidence in Mrs May but did not know if it was too late to get a deal. Miroslav Lajcak, Slovakia's foreign minister, said reopening the Withdrawal Agreement was not feasible and there was no point in delaying the UK's planned departure date. This video can not be played Labour's Barry Gardiner says the party would vote for another referendum Mrs May invited Jeremy Corbyn to cross-party talks on Brexit after she survived a vote of no confidence in her government last week. But the leader of the opposition said he would only enter cross-party talks if the prime minister took the possibility of a no-deal Brexit off the table. Mrs May said that was an ""impossible condition"". Labour's position since Mrs May's withdrawal agreement was rejected by the Commons is to seek a general election - if that fails they would consider backing a second referendum. Mr Corbyn has previously said Labour wants a customs union with the EU, tariff-free access to the single market and an EU-level of employment rights to be included in any Brexit agreement. Shadow International Trade Secretary Barry Gardiner told BBC Leeds his party would back a motion in favour of another referendum. But the Labour leadership's position is not thought to have changed, and it will be tabling an amendment next week on Labour's customs union plan. A spokesperson for Mr Gardiner said: ""'Barry is committed to Labour's policy of pushing for a general election as the best outcome. ""If the Conservatives block an election we will keep all options on the table, including campaigning for a public vote. Whipping arrangements will be decided in the normal way in due course.""

Could MPs stop no deal?,"There's a big problem facing members of Parliament who want to avoid a no-deal Brexit. They can't just show there is a majority in the House of Commons against no deal - they need to prove there is a majority in favour of an alternative outcome. That's because leaving the EU - with or without a deal - is currently the default. If the prime minister fails to get a deal through the House of Commons, the UK will leave with no deal at all unless something changes, because leaving the EU is written into UK law. The EU Withdrawal Act sets 29 March as the date of departure. The wording of the act does allow a minister to change the definition of ""exit day"" relatively quickly using a statutory instrument - a piece of secondary legislation - rather than an entirely new act of Parliament that would need to be debated. A minister would have to propose the change and MPs would have to approve it. But there is a second and more significant reason why no deal would become the default position: that's what EU law says. Article 50 of the Lisbon Treaty is the formal route for any country leaving the EU and it allows for a two-year process of negotiation. At the end of that period ""the treaties shall cease to apply to the state in question"" unless Article 50 is extended or revoked. The most obvious way therefore to stop a no-deal Brexit, or any form of Brexit, is to revoke Article 50. Minister talks down Brexit delay claim Bid to limit tax powers if no-deal Brexit Is the EU about to rescue Theresa May? TheEuropean Court of Justice has ruledthe UK can do that on its own, without asking the other 27 countries, and stay a member of the EU on its current terms - including opting-out of key policies, and keeping the budget rebate. But it seems highly unlikely that the House of Commons would vote to revoke Article 50 unless there had been another referendum, or maybe an election, in which the public backed the UK remaining in the EU. The government rejects the idea of holding another referendum anyway - and the time to do so before the end of March has run out. So, the other way to avoid a no-deal Brexit in the short term is to play for time and extend the Article 50 period. The government would need to propose that and MPs would have to approve it. But, crucially, unlike in the case of revoking Article 50, to extend it the UK would also need the agreement of all 27 other EU countries. It would probably need to persuade them that something important had changed in UK politics to warrant an extension - perhaps a looming election, or another referendum, rather than more of the same argument. One of the constraints for the rest of the EU is that European elections will take place at the end of May and the new European Parliament (without UK MEPs if Brexit has taken place) is due to meet for the first time in July. The only other circumstance in which a brief extension to Article 50 would probably be approved by the EU is if there had been a vote in favour of Theresa May's deal but a little more time was needed to dot the ""i""s and cross the ""t""s. But if Article 50 was extended without a deal passing the House of Commons, no deal would still remain the default outcome at the end of the extended negotiating period. In a word, amendments. An amendment to the Finance Bill, limiting the Treasury's ability to make no-deal preparations unless authorised by Parliament, was backed by MPs by 303 to 296 votes. This amendment will make it ""harder for the government to drift into no deal without Parliament being able to direct it"", according to Labour MP Yvette Cooper. A cross-party coalition of MPs against no deal is now flexing its muscles, and what we're likely to see over the next couple of months is what some are calling ""guerrilla warfare by amendment"" in the House of Commons. Yvette Cooper says her amendment has support from Remain and Leave MPs The trade bill is likely to be another target - it would be needed in the event of no deal, to try to keep the UK trading on the same terms as it has now with the rest of the world. The idea behind all this parliamentary manoeuvring is to demonstrate that there is a clear majority in the House of Commons against no deal. But none of it, taken in isolation, will prevent the Article 50 clock ticking away until it stops at the end of March. That's why a growing number of MPs support the idea of holding a series of ""indicative votes"" on different potential outcomes, to try to find an alternative to no deal that would enjoy broad  (or even sufficient) support. Senior MPs argue that the government would be unable to ignore the political pressure if the will of the House of Commons was clearly expressed on numerous occasions. But political pressure is not the same as legal reality. Three ministers have said publicly they would resign if the government pursued a no-deal strategy, while others are thought to hold the same position in private. A handful of backbench MPs have said they would quit the party. The Work and Pensions Secretary, Amber Rudd, is understood to have told cabinet that history would take a dim view of the government if it accepted no deal and it would leave the UK a less safe country. But if the prime minister did decide to press on regardless, it may well be that the only way MPs could stop a no-deal Brexit at the last moment would be to vote down the government itself. UPDATE -This article was updated on Wednesday 9 Jan to include the new amendment asking government to return to Parliament with new plans within three days of a vote against the Prime Minister's withdrawal deal.

Student helps Tube station baby birthThe churchgoing patriot who spied for ChinaNursing mother smashes 268-mile race recordBlue Whale: The truth behind an online 'suicide challenge',"The London Ambulance Service was called to Warren Street Station A medical student who helped deliver a baby at a central London Tube station said it was a panicked situation. Hamzah Selim, 21, was on his way home from an anatomy lecture when he heard a woman screaming at Warren Street Station on Tuesday afternoon. The first-year medic rushed to help the woman, who was standing in a ""pool of blood"" alongside her sister, and used his jumper to protect the newborn. The mother and her baby were then taken to hospital by paramedics. Mr Selim initially thought a fight had broken out between two women when he heard screaming and swearing at the station. He helped her to sit down as he feared she might faint because of the extensive blood loss. He said he ""felt something warm, instinctively looked down and saw a little baby's head with its arms side by side"". ""All the blood left me in that moment,"" he added. The woman was with her sister, he said, who had been ""incredible"" and had begun delivering the baby prior to his arrival. Hamzah Selim is currently building an app to screen for dementia as part of his degree Mr Selim has not studied midwifery but had just spent the past few weeks at a neo-natal unit as part of his degree at University College London. ""I knew a little bit of what to do. I had to lower the woman. I took my jumper off and wrapped the baby in it. ""I held the baby in horror. It wasn't responding so I immediately went to the worst possible thought."" He said he called for ""someone more qualified"" to help but that ""there was no-one there"". Allow Twitter content?

He tried to find the baby's pulse but could not feel anything. ""I was in utter panic,"" he recalled. It then came back to him to test the baby's reflexes and, after rubbing its cheek, ""it just coughed in my face, and it was the best moment of my life,"" he said. He handed the baby wrapped in his jumper to the mother before the paramedics arrived. ""The mum was incredible, she was so strong, and so much more brave than me,"" he said. Mr Selim also said Transport for London staff had provided them with ""some privacy"" by holding up a blanket protecting the mother from onlookers who walked past and started filming. The London Ambulance Service said it treated the woman and baby at the scene and took them both to hospital ""as a priority"".

The churchgoing patriot who spied for ChinaNursing mother smashes 268-mile race recordBlue Whale: The truth behind an online 'suicide challenge',"US officials say China is trying to influence US policymakers, steal secrets and spy on the US government. But how? The story of Kevin Mallory, a man who seemed to lead a typical suburban life in Virginia, provides the answer. FBI agents pointed their weapons at Jeremiah Mallory, a teenager standing in the doorway of his house one morning in June 2017, and told him to get on his knees. ""They've got guns in his face,"" says Patsy Clark, a family friend. They were looking for evidence against his father, Kevin Mallory, a former Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) officer who had been spying for the Chinese government. One of Mallory's neighbours, a dog walker, was heading down the block: ""All of a sudden I hear this yelling."" The roar of helicopters woke another neighbour, Delrose Winter, who says she saw police cars and black vans at the house. Cameron Norris, a student who lived nearby, saw dogs searching the yard and FBI agents carrying boxes: ""They were taking equipment out - a computer."" FBI agents searched Mallory's house, a place with a red banner covered in Chinese calligraphy that hung alongside the front door, his yard and, according to neighbours, a bridle path where he used to go on runs. His street in Raspberry Falls, a Leesburg subdivision, looked like a war zone, with helicopters circling in the air and armed men charging through the grass. At home, Mallory secretly communicated with Chinese agents One year later Mallory, 61, was found guilty of espionage. In a real-life episode of The Americans, a TV spy drama that takes place in northern Virginia, Mallory had lived a double life: he helped people on his street with yard work, went to church and assisted immigrants with income-tax forms. Yet at home he communicated with Chinese agents through social media and sold them US secrets. Today he faces life in prison - and he is now awaiting sentencing. His punishment may serve as a warning to others who may be contemplating espionage, say US justice department officials. It also highlights the tense nature of the US-China relationship. The US has entered a new ""cold war"", said the CIA's Mike Collins, deputy assistant director at the agency's East Asia mission centre,at the Aspen Security Forum,externallast year. Chinese officials are investing billions of US dollars in global influence operations and espionage, according toresearch,externalby a former CIA analyst, Peter Mattis. The Chinese officials are attempting to gain inside information about the White House and the government, according to US officials, and shape the way that Beijing policies and its commercial and military activities are perceived on the world stage. Loudoun County's Kristen Umstattd says she's concerned about Chinese broadcasting in Virginia Chinese officials are attempting to sway the views of politicians and ordinary Americans, according to US officials, so they will support policies that are favourable to Beijing on issues ranging from the South China Sea to currency manipulation. Last month US Assistant Attorney General John Demerstestified,externalbefore Congress about China's ""covert efforts to influence the American public"". US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who previously served as CIA director,told the BBC's Gordon Coreralast year that the Chinese government is trying to ""infiltrate the United States with spies"". This video can not be played Then-CIA Director: China intent on stealing US secrets A Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman, Hua Chunying, said the accusations are false. ""We never do such things as interference or infiltration,"" she said. ""That is definitely not Chinese style."" In Beijing, state officials view the US with suspicion, and espionage is punished severely. Between 2011-12, 10 individuals who were working undercover in China for the CIA were killed, according to theNew York Times,external. ""One was shot in front of his colleagues in the courtyard of a government building - a message to others,"" the New York Times reporters claimed, citing US officials. Where Mallory went jogging Meanwhile President Xi has made it clear that influence operations in other countries are a priority for his government. He has done this by expanding the efforts of the United Front Work Department,according to Xinhua,external, the state-run news agency. The United Front was created in the 1930s in order to marshal forces behind the Communist Party by providing a ""united front"" for the party among those who are living abroad. This means that today when Chinese students in the US publicly contradict party positions, Beijing officials may inform their family in China that they have spoken out in a ""subversive"" manner,according to a report,external, Chinese Influence and American Interests. Chinese American students say they're singled out for scrutiny by the Beijing officials and also by US officials who suspect them of being spies. As many as one in five Asian Americans who were accused of espionage since 2009 were never convicted, according to legal scholar Andrew Kim, theauthor of a May 2017 report,externalabout espionage. He showed that the rate is twice as high as that among individuals with non-Asian backgrounds. Leesburg, a town in Loudoun County, provides a textbook example of the Communist Party's mode of operations. Located 40 miles from Washington, Leesburg has old-fashioned streetlamps, brick sidewalks and picket fences, evoking authentic Americana, and seems far from global conflict. Yet Chinese agents lured Mallory, working out of his Leesburg home, into their spy ring. Separately Chinese officials obtained access to the airwaves of a local radio station. The Chinese officials bought access to a Leesburg station, WCRW 1190 AM, through a subsidiary company. The 50,000-watt station used to be housed in a low-slung building with plate-glass windows, but the place was sold to a family several years ago. WCRW towers in Ashburn, shown above, broadcast programmes to Washington Under a new style of management, WCRW transmitters were moved to Ashburn, a town closer to Washington. The radio towers are posted on property owned by a company, Loudoun Water, near an installation of China's Zigong Lantern Festival, a travelling exhibit that was open in December. ""They wanted a stronger signal,"" says Kristen Umstattd, a local official, referring to the station owners. A former CIA analyst who has studied in Taiwan, she says that last year the station owners received permission to expand their programming hours. A station engineer says they now broadcast 24 hours a day. ""I hope somebody above my pay grade is paying attention,"" Umstattd says. WCRW, once located in this building, is now known as China Radio Washington The radio signal is powerful. On a recent Sunday, listeners in Washington learned about Chinese satellites hurling through space and other achievements of the Beijing government. In contrast the news bulletins, which are produced by China Radio International, tended to strike an ominous tone when reporting on the US economy. In addition, Chinese officials broadcast news bulletins in Philadelphia, Atlanta and other cities, according to Reuters. The programming of WCRW and the other stations, according to the report, Chinese Influence and American Interests, are part of what is known as the Grand External Propaganda Campaign. Chinese broadcasters say on the station that they're offering listeners in the area ""perspective"" and ""commentary"" on news and current events so that people in the US can ""learn what China is thinking and saying"". For the Chinese agents, Mallory was a catch. He has dark brown hair, a broad smile and an easy-going manner, and he does not drink alcohol or coffee. He had worked as a covert CIA officer and held security clearances that gave him access to the nation's most valuable secrets. By the time he was approached by the Chinese in early 2017, though, he was working as an independent consultant and was struggling to make ends meet. Randall Phillips, an investigator with the Mintz Group, previously served as the CIA's chief representative in China. Speaking on the phone from Shanghai, he says the Chinese agents tried to make Mallory feel special. ""They played with the guy's vanity,"" says Phillips. It's a time-honoured technique often joked about. ""I keep waiting for the honey trap,"" one CIA official said recently in a Washington bar. The Chinese agents approached Mallory not in a bar but on LinkedIn, saying in a casual way: ""Hey, will you join my network?'"" According to court records. Mallory replied: ""I'm open to whatever. I've got to - you know - pay the bills."" Mallory lived next to a golf course They told him they were looking for someone with his professional background, the same ploy they had used on European members of parliament, according to theGerman domestic intelligence service,external. A German official says that the Chinese agents have become more perfidious on LinkedIn over the past year. Paul Rockwell, LinkedIn's head of trust and safety department, says they're concerned about therecruitment efforts of Chinese agents,external: ""We are committed to stopping this behaviour."" Beijing officials dispute the Germans' account, calling it ""groundless"". Mallory, one of nine children, graduated from university in Utah with a political science degree and spent time in the military before working as a CIA operative. He lived in Iraq, China and Taiwan and married Mariah Nan Hua in Taipei. In 2006, they bought their house in Raspberry Falls for $1.16m, with their three children, an adopted Alaskan malamute-style puppy Misty and another husky, Sierra. Mallory and his wife spoke Chinese at home, a place decorated with brightly coloured throw pillows, a framed picture of a Mormon tabernacle and a rice cooker resting on a kitchen counter. His own life reflected the way Americans and native Chinese speakers have come together in northern Virginia over the years. About 14% of the population in Loudon County is Asian American, ,according tocensus data,external. On Sundays Mallory and his wife would head to church, where he was known as Zhiping Mao. Many of their friends at church are native Chinese speakers - they sing lyrics in Chinese (you can follow the English-language version in a hymnbook) in a back room. Leesburg has several Chinese businesses Others at the church have a similar background to Mallory. Fluent in Chinese, these middle-aged men work for the CIA or other intelligence agencies. As one of Mallory's friends commented, ""You can't swing a dead cat without hitting someone with a security clearance."" Mallory used to remind people in Raspberry Falls how lucky they are. ""He'd say: 'You're living the American dream,"" recalls a family friend. ""He'd tell people they should appreciate what they have."" Another friend, Delrose Winter, recalls a day when Mallory and his family came over for a Fourth of July barbecue. They wore red, white and blue on that Independence Day and seemed ""very patriotic"", she says. But after the 2008 real estate crash, his fortunes changed. His house plummeted in value, and later he lost his job. A scientist who lives nearby, says: ""They were under severe financial stress."" Another neighbour says: ""They were under water"", adding: ""That contributed to his desperation."" Mallory struggled to support his family in Raspberry Falls By the time the Chinese agents got in touch with Mallory, he had $30,000 in credit card debt, according to court records, and was behind in his mortgage payments. His new acquaintance on LinkedIn introduced him to someone who worked for the Shanghai Academy of Social Sciences, a think-tank that provides offices for scholars and cover for intelligence agents. He offered Mallory a position as a consultant. Mallory flew to Shanghai and met his new bosses in a hotel room. These men did not say they worked for the intelligence agency, but they did not deny it either. During that meeting, the hair on Mallory's neck stood up, he later said. He had agreed to take their money, though. ""They get you to cross a line,"" says Phillips, the former CIA officer. ""Once you do, it's harder to get out."" Mallory returned to Leesburg with a Samsung Galaxy phone the Chinese had given him - complete with a chat application by which they communicated with him. That phone later proved to be his downfall. When he got home, he told his wife he had concerns about his new job. Despite his reservations, though, he provided the Chinese with information he had obtained while working in the US intelligence services. According to US officials, some of the material that he gave to the Chinese was classified. Mallory said that the agents told him: ""We just want to understand what Trump administration policy is going to be."" He told the Chinese he had applied for a job in the White House, and they encouraged his efforts. The agents also prodded him for information about missile defence systems and other sensitive issues. Mallory placed classified material on a Toshiba SD card, shown above But then things got really complicated for Mallory. He texted a CIA resource officer and a covert operative, both of whom attended his church, and said he was hoping to speak to someone in the CIA's East Asia division. He said later he was looking to tell the CIA what he was learning about the Chinese agents - effectively becoming a double agent. These text messages began to take on a frantic tone. Psychiatrist David Charney who has interviewed several convicted spies, says they realise at a certain point they ""can never go home"", which can lead to deep apprehension and terror. Mallory placed classified material that he had obtained during the time that he worked for US intelligence agencies on a Toshiba SD card, wrapping it in tinfoil and stashing in his bedroom closet. He told the Chinese agents he was worried that US authorities would discover his subterfuge: ""If they were looking for me in terms of state secrets and found the SD card we would not be talking today."" Mallory's lawyers said that he did nothing wrong. They said he was simply collecting information about Chinese espionage so he could inform the CIA about Beijing's methods. He hoped to impress the CIA with his knowledge of Chinese tradecraft so the CIA would hire him back. But prosecutors presented text messages in court as evidence that he was selling US secrets: ""Your object is to gain information,"" he texted the Chinese agents. ""My object is to be paid."" Mallory arranged to meet with a CIA official in an Ashburn hotel in May 2017. Mallory's lawyers said that he was planning to show off his knowledge of the Chinese espionage techniques. The prosecutors said Mallory wanted to speak with the CIA officials not to impress them with his knowledge but because he wanted to cover his tracks. Mallory was clearly surprised when an FBI special agent also showed up for the meeting, as prosecutors later showed in court. The presence of the FBI agent showed that federal investigators were interested in Mallory. Still he carried on as if everything was fine. He described the way the Chinese had provided him with a secure phone. At this point, he assumed that his text messages would remain encrypted. Mallory texted the Chinese agents on a Samsung Galaxy that they gave him But as he spoke, the phone crashed. The messages suddenly appeared on the phone's screen while he was in the room with the FBI, revealing how he had betrayed his country. For a long moment he said nothing. James Hamrock, an engineer who examined the phone for the FBI, says that Mallory was overly trusting of the phone and of the people who gave it to him. Unbeknownst to Mallory, the software had a glitch. Two of the counts, both relating to where he had committed the crimes, have been dropped. The government is trying to get the charges reinstated. These two charges do not affect his sentence, however: life in prison. Mallory wrecked his own life and cast suspicion on others. Many of the native Chinese speakers who live in Loudoun County are angry. ""We're American first,"" says Taiwan-born Eiling Chao, who runs her own company, Choice Insurance Network, with her daughter, Stephanie Chao, and other family members. ""If there's any spying action happening, I certainly hope the person gets punished to the fullest."" Eiling Chao, shown with Stephanie, says the US should fight hard against espionage US officials have studied the crime of espionage, creating an acronym that establishes motives: MICE (money, ideology, compromise and ego). It's true that Mallory wanted to make money from the Chinese, but in the end it was not much: he earned $25,000 USD from his spy work. Mallory's house is now on the market: a short sale, it's listed at $740,000 and has lost more than a third of its value. The Chinese banner has been taken down. Misty and Sierra still lie on a patch of woodchips in the yard on sunny afternoons. They barely look up when a mailman comes. Mallory is being held in the Alexandria Detention Center in Virginia, and he is waiting for his sentencing. He was in the courtroom on an autumn morning, and he wore Velcro sneakers, white socks and a prison jumpsuit, and his face was ashen. During a phone call to his daughter from jail, he tried to explain why he had been arrested. ""Your mom knows I've been all up front with all this kind of stuff with the CIA,"" he said and, referring to the FBI agents, said: ""Somehow these other guys twisted things around a little bit."" He said: ""Things get complicated sometimes."" The jury wrote a note to the judge, stating their verdict His friend Kevin McLane worked with him in Iraq and says that he is innocent. ""He thought he was doing something good for the United States,"" says McLane. ""Was he naÃ¯ve? Probably. A little bit stupid? Probably. Was he trying to hurt the United States? Absolutely not."" Mallory's wife, ""an absolute rock"", as a friend describes her, is now driving a school bus. Jeremiah leads the church group in prayer and has the grace that comes from years of studying ballet. He is getting ready to go on a two-year missionary in Australia, following his brother, Michael, 22, who is there now. Jeremiah wrote to the court in October and asked if he could hug his father before he leaves: ""It would be an unforgettable blessing to have a last moment with my Dad."" Many of the Americans who have committed treason were once model citizens who went into a downward spiral and thought espionage would help them turn things around. Behind bars they still see themselves as patriotic, says David Charney, the psychiatrist. That seems to be true with Mallory: he calls his friend Patsy Clark from jail, and she says he remains loyal to the US. ""They were never hating the US,"" Charney said in a Washingtonlecture,external: ""Their only beef was with themselves."" He added: ""Weirdly enough, they're still good Americans.""

Nursing mother smashes 268-mile race recordBlue Whale: The truth behind an online 'suicide challenge',"Jasmin Paris pumping breast milk at checkpoint one A mother who expressed milk for her baby during a 268-mile race along the Pennine Way has broken the course record by more than 12 hours. Jasmin Paris, 35, completed the Montane Spine Race - from Derbyshire to the Scottish borders - in 83 hours, 12 minutes and 23 seconds. The vet, who lives in Midlothian said the race was ""brutal"". Mrs Paris' sponsor, inov-8, said her achievement was ""one of the greatest stories"" in the sport. Jasmin Paris was met by her daughter, Rowan, at the end of the race Competitors spend two-thirds of the race in the dark and carry all their own kit and supplies. They also have no personal support team or runner with them on the course. Mrs Paris told the BBC Scotland news website how despite having frozen breast milk at home before the race for her 14-month-old daughter, she expressed milk during the race to stop mastitis. She said: ""I had thought I would have stopped breast feeding by this point and tried when Rowan was one, but over Christmas she got two viruses and I had to go back to feeding her multiple times throughout the night to soothe her. ""Although my milk production diminished throughout the race, I did express at four out of the five checkpoints. ""The first night was the hardest for me mentally because I was away from my daughter, but as the race went on it got easier as I got used to being away from her. ""She was very bemused to see me on the finish line and has been very clingy today as if she is thinking I might go away again. This video can not be played She broke the Spine Race course record by more than 12 hours Mrs Paris reached the finish line in Kirk Yetholm on Wednesday evening having started in Edale in the Derbyshire Peak District on Sunday. She said that compared with other competitors, she had got off lightly with just a few blisters although her toenails were very sore and black and she feared she would lose at least her big toenails. She said: ""I was worried at the start of the race when I heard other runners saying they had taped their feet up as I hadn't, but somehow I've not really had any problems with my feet apart from losing the skin between my toes. ""I think it comes from all the running I do, it's toughened up my feet. I was running 100 miles a week in the run up to the race. ""I never thought I would do this race as I've heard it's absolute torture but its good to set yourself a challenge because it's exciting so I entered. ""I started thinking I could possibly win and it was exciting when it turned into a race and Eugeni was chasing me for 40 miles. ""A man was also popping up along the course telling me our split times, which made it really exciting and when Eugeni was entering one of the checkpoints and I was leaving I think it broke his morale."" Competitors have one week to complete the gruelling race, which travels over hilly terrain and covers 43,000ft of climbing - more than Everest at 29,000ft. The Spine Race 2013 winner, Eugeni Rosello Sole, was forced to push his emergency button 6km before the end, which eliminated him from the race after becoming unwell from sleep deprivation. During the entirety of the race, Mrs Paris only slept for three hours. She said that by the last day, she was hallucinating on the Cheviots. ""I saw a pig in the heather, trees stretching and doing a morning workout in the woods, workmen doing stretches, a house appeared and I was very cold. ""There is not much of a comfort zone between a bad situation and an ok situation and I was aware I was pushing my limits but I know that's what happens. ""It was the hardest race I've done due to the amount of time and weather wise, but I'm really happy because I gave it my best shot. I raced hard and gave it the best I could. ""It's been a life affirming experience and it will take me a couple of weeks to recover from the effort and cost it took."" Mrs Paris did the race during a week-long break from writing her PhD thesis, which she must hand in by the end of March. Lee Procter, inov-8 ambassador team manager, said: ""All of us here at inov-8 are so proud of Jasmin. ""She is not a professional, full-time athlete, but instead a down-to-earth, modest mum-of-one with an incredible talent and phenomenal strength, both physically and mentally. ""What she has achieved in this race in beating everyone of both sexes and setting a new overall course record is one of the greatest stories in the history of ultra-running as a sport."" Scott Gilmour, The Montane Spine Race director, also said it was an ""incredible feat"". He said: ""Never underestimate a competitor whether it's a man or a woman. It's the person's dedication and attitude that drives results. ""Paris is a machine so this result is not a surprise to us, but what is brilliant is she carried all that expectation and pressure on her shoulders. ""She never got upset and was swan-like all the way to the end."" He added: ""The four-day record of 95 hours was really tough and we didn't think it was possible to beat it due to sleep depravation, its incredible. ""She absolutely dictated the pace of the race, it's an incredible feat. ""She's such a figure head and such a champion and she will inspire others.""

Israeli 'hitting Iranian targets in Syria',"This video can not be played An onlooker captures explosions in the night sky over Damascus. Israel says it has hit Iranian targets around the Syrian capital, Damascus. The Israel Defense Forces say the overnight operation targeted the elite Quds Force of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards, as well as Syrian air defences. The Syrian military says it shot down most of the Israeli missiles. But a monitoring group reported that at least 11 pro-government fighters were killed. The IDF says it acted after the Quds Force fired a rocket from Syria towards the occupied Golan Heights on Sunday. Iran, Israel's arch-enemy, has sent thousands of military personnel to support Syria's President Bashar al-Assad in the country's civil war. Israel and Iran on collision course The IDF rarely admits carrying out attacks inside Syria.But it announced the start of Monday's strikes on the Quds Force in a tweet,external. A statement issued later said Israeli fighter jets had hit munition storage sites, a site located in Damascus International Airport, an Iranian intelligence site and an Iranian military training camp.

""We're operating both against Iran and against the Syrian forces that are abetting the Iranian aggression,"" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said. ""We'll strike at anyone who tried to harm us. Whoever threatens to eliminate us, bears full responsibility."" Israel v Iran in 300 words Syria war: Who's fighting whom? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, reported that weapons depots and positions belonging to Iranian forces and the Iran-backed Lebanese militant group, Hezbollah, were hit. It said at least 11 fighters, including two Syrians, were killed. Syria's state-run Sana news agency quoted a military source as saying it ""confronted an Israeli attack"",externaland ""prevented it from achieving its objectives"". The IDF said it targeted Syrian air defence batteries after they ignored warnings not to fire ""Our air defences dealt with the situation and intercepted the hostile missiles, downing most of them before reaching their targets as they continue their heroic response to the aggression,"" the source added, without mentioning any casualties. The Russian military, which like Iran also backs the Syrian government, said more than 30 missiles and guided bombs were shot down. However, it added that the ""infrastructure"" of Damascus International Airport was partially damaged and that four Syrian soldiers were killed and six were wounded. There was no immediate comment from Iran. But the head of its air force, Brig Gen Aziz Nasirzadeh, said the country was ""fully ready and impatient to confront the Zionist regime and eliminate it from the Earth"", according to the Young Journalists' Club website. The operation came a day after the IDF said the Quds Force had launched an Iranian-made surface-to-surface rocket from Syrian territory towards the northern Golan Heights, which was intercepted by the Iron Dome air defence system. The IDF said a rocket fired by the Quds Force endangered skiers at a resort on Mount Hermon IDF spokesman Lt Col Jonathan Conricus said the rocket endangered thousands of Israeli civilians at a ski resort on Mount Hermon in the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights. The rocket launch followed a reported Israeli air raid on Damascus airport on Sunday afternoon, which a Syrian military source said air defences also ""thwarted"". By Jonathan Marcus, diplomatic correspondent, BBC News The strategic context on Israel's northern border is changing. All the major actors are trying to influence the new rules of the game. President Assad has survived; in large part due to Iranian support. President Trump is pulling out US ground forces from Syria. And Russia, which also backs Mr Assad, is eager to put its diplomatic stamp on future developments. It is this new context that - in part - explains Israel's greater willingness to speak publicly about its air campaign. The strategic dialogue between Israel and Russia continues at a high level. Only last week senior Russian officers were in Israel for talks. But Russia has not persuaded the Syrians to remove or contain Iran's growing presence. Israel's war of attrition is set to continue. But the firing of a missile from Syria, which prompted an additional wave of Israeli strikes, shows just how dangerous things are becoming. Until recently the IDF rarely commented on reports of strikes. But it has become increasingly open about its attempts to dislodge Iranian forces. Earlier this month,IDF's now former military chief-of staff Lt Gen Gadi Eisenkot told the New York Times the IDF had struck ""thousands"" of targets,externalsince Syria's civil war began in 2011. Until two-and-a-half years ago, the IDF mainly struck Iranian weapons shipments destined for Hezbollah, he said. Iran then changed its strategy significantly, seeking to build a 100,000-strong force of Shia militia fighters from Pakistan, Afghanistan and Iraq and constructing intelligence bases at Syrian air force facilities, he added. Gen Eisenkot said that in January 2017 he had obtained the government's consent to change the IDF's tactics and strikes in Syria began to take place almost daily.
