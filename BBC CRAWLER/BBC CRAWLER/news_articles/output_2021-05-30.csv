PM marries Carrie Symonds at Westminster Cathedral,"Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds in the garden of 10 Downing Street after their wedding Prime Minister Boris Johnson has married his fiancee Carrie Symonds in a secretly-planned wedding at Westminster Cathedral. The marriage took place in a ""small ceremony"" on Saturday afternoon, a Downing Street spokesman said. The spokesman added that the couple would celebrate again with family and friends next summer, with their honeymoon also delayed until then. The prime minister has already returned to work. He is the first PM to get married while in office in nearly 200 years. The Mail on Sunday reported,externalthat 30 guests were invited to the ceremony at short notice - the maximum number of attendees allowed under Covid restrictions in England. A small number of church officials were involved in preparations for the Catholic ceremony, which was officiated by Father Daniel Humphreys, it said. Although Mr Johnson, 56, has been married twice before, the Roman Catholic Church can allow divorcees to remarry if the previous marriages were outside the Roman Catholic Church. Boris Johnson likes to avoid talking about his private life - he's declined to answer questions on the topic for the past few years. It can't have been easy to keep yesterday's wedding - between a former journalist and someone who works in public relations - under wraps. But it seems to have taken almost everyone in Westminster by surprise. Such was the desire to keep it quiet, Downing Street only officially confirmed it had happened on Sunday morning - the day after the wedding. Christopher Lamb, Rome correspondent for Catholic magazine The Tablet, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There will be a feeling that, why are some people who are divorced allowed to be married in the church and others not? ""And I think that's where the Church, I think, can look at its current rules and see how it can become more welcoming. It has been welcoming to Boris Johnson, why not to others?"" Who is Carrie Symonds? Father Mark Drew, assistant priest at St Joseph's Church in Penketh, Warrington, said he has previously had to tell Catholic couples going through a divorce they are not able to remarry in the Church. ""It looks to them - rightly or wrongly - as if the Church is applying double standards and I do fear that this decision does make the Church look bad."" Just one official photograph has been released - the day after the wedding - showing the couple in the garden at 10 Downing Street in the hours following the ceremony. However, Conservative MP James Cleverly shared a different photograph of the newlyweds enjoying their garden reception in the Saturday sunshine, with decorations and a table of refreshments visible in the background. At this stage in the day's proceedings, Mrs Johnson is seen barefoot and her husband has dispensed with his jacket and tie. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Downing Street did not reveal any details of who was invited and whether any of Mr Johnson's Cabinet colleagues were among the guests. Several politicians have congratulated the couple, including Home Secretary Priti Patel, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi and Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey. Ms Patel wrote on Twitter: ""Many Congratulations to Mr & Mrs Johnson @BorisJohnson and @CarrieSymonds. Wishing you both much love and happiness."" Musicians were pictured leaving No 10 on Saturday night. People carrying musical instruments were seen leaving Downing Street on Saturday evening Members of the public were asked to leave Westminster Cathedral just after 13:30 BST,the Sun reported.,external The new Mrs Johnson - who has confirmed she will take her husband's surname -  wore a white dress to exchange vows with the prime minister. Her wedding dress was designed by Athens-based Christos Costarellos, who studied at the London College of Fashion anddescribes his work,externalas being ""inspired by the spirit of ancient Greek philosophy"". The last prime minister to get married while in office was Robert Banks Jenkinson in 1822. Mrs Johnson used to work in the Conservative Party press office, which she joined in 2010, and two years later she worked on Mr Johnson's successful campaign to be re-elected as mayor in London. She became the party's head of communications before leaving in 2018 to work in public relations for marine conservation organisation Oceana. Mrs Johnson then became head of communications for conservation group the Aspinall Foundation in January. The couple were first romantically linked by the media in early 2019.  In February 2020, theyrevealed that they were engagedand that she was pregnant. Their son, Wilfred,was born last April. Mr Johnson and his previous wife, Marina Wheeler,announced in 2018that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage. He was previously married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen.

EU treating NI as a political plaything says Poots,"This video can not be played DUP leader Edwin Poots accuses European commissioners of not caring about the peace process The DUP leader Edwin Poots has accused the European Union of treating Northern Ireland as a political ""plaything"". Mr Poots claimed the EU was damaging the Northern Ireland peace process. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic firmly rejected that suggestion. Speaking on the Marr programme on BBC One, Mr Poots said the current EU commissioners did not seem to care about the peace process. He said he shared the fear of his predecessor Arlene Foster that anger over the Northern Ireland Protocol could lead to violence on the streets this summer. He said: ""I don't want to use a threat of violence in terms of this. ""Our arguments are very clear, they are very coherent. ""This is the European Union seeking to punish the UK and, as a consequence, Northern Ireland is being used as a plaything. ""I can assure you, Northern Ireland should be nobody's plaything."" EU-UK 'compromise needed for NI Protocol to work' Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? He urged the UK government to consider invoking Article 16 of the protocol, which allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". On the same programme, the European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic, firmly rejected any suggestion that the EU no longer cared about the peace process. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic suggested a temporary Swiss-style veterinary deal for Northern Ireland He expressed ""total commitment to the Good Friday/Belfast Agreement"". He said the protocol brought economic opportunity for Northern Ireland and added that he was working ""flat out"" to ensure that the protocol worked ""smoothly"". Mr Sefcovic suggested a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement as a solution for Northern Ireland, where the UK continues to follow all EU agrifood rules. He said such a deal could be done in weeks and would remove 80% of GB-NI checks. Although Lord Frost has already ruled out such a deal. Mr Poots also rejected this proposal saying: ""That struck me as a temporary solution. I want permanent solutions to take the barriers away and provide security in terms of the single market."" He suggested providing checks between GB and the EU in Northern Ireland ""that doesn't have to be at the border, it can be at another location in NI including the ports"". Mr Sefcovic said he wants to meet the Northern Ireland Executive parties soon. ""I would like to hear from Mr Poots himself but also from other leaders of the political parties who form the Northern Ireland Executive, and discuss with them what we can do better,"" he said. Michelle O'Neill said Brexit is ""not an excuse for violence"" Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the DUP ""need to be honest with people"" over Brexit. ""Any difficulties being faced by businesses or traders are a direct result of the Brexit the DUP campaigned for, and now must take responsibility for,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said ""no credible alternative"" to the Northern Ireland Protocol exists, adding that it must be implemented to protect the Good Friday Agreement and prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. She said Brexit ""is not an excuse for violence"" and called on unionist leaders to state that ""there can be no place for threats of violence in our society."" Allow Twitter content?

Brexit lorry park 'has destroyed the night sky',"Residents say the Sevington inland border facility is like ""living next to Gatwick Airport"" Floodlights at a Brexit lorry park in Kent have ""destroyed"" the night sky, residents say. The site near Ashford, Kent, was built to cope with extra customs checks after Britain left the European Union. Linda Arthur, who lives in nearby Mersham, said it was like ""living next to Gatwick Airport"". The Department for Transport said it had commissioned a ""detailed lighting survey"" and was working to develop a plan to reduce the disturbance. The 66-acre Sevington inland border facility, close to the M20, operates through the night, providing customs checks for hauliers entering or leaving the UK by ferry at Dover or Hoylhead, or by Eurotunnel from Folkestone. Linda Arthur says they have ""lost our dark night sky"" Mrs Arthur said she lived in a ""beautiful area"", which had been a ""quiet country village until this happened to us"". ""We have lost our dark night sky,"" she added. Geoffrey Fletcher said the lights had a ""terrific impact"" on the area. ""When the sun goes down and the lights switch on, one really can't imagine unless you see it, the glow in the night sky."" ""I live about a mile away and the whole of the western night sky for us is destroyed,"" he said. The Department for Transport said it had already ""acted to minimise disturbance by turning off the lights in one of the most public sections"", and would share an action plan with residents once the lighting survey is complete.

Travis Perkins warns builders of price rises,"The UK's biggest builders' merchant has warned customers of ""considerable"" cost increases to raw materials amid an industry-wide shortage. As first reportedby the Times,external, Travis Perkins says the price of bagged cement will rise by 15%, chipboard by 10% and paint by 5% from Tuesday. It comes as industry groups warn electrical components, timber and steel are also in short supply. They blame surging demand as lockdown eases, as well as supply chain issues. Travis Perkins has been informing customers in its stores, websites and by email of the price rises. It said it had seen demand across the board - from consumers doing more DIY projects, to demand from big infrastructure projects such as HS2. It said the increases could affect its other brands which include Keyline and BSS. A spokesman said: ""In instances where we have seen some challenges posed by global demand for raw materials or inflationary pressures, we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to minimise price increases where possible, whilst also ensuring healthy stock availability for all of our customers."" DIY and building projects hit by materials shortage The Office for National Statistics has projected a rise of 7-8% in material prices this year, with increases for certain materials, such as timber, expected to more than double. The supply problems stem from a number of factors. Construction industry projects have surged since lockdown began easing which has led to skyrocketing demand for already scarce materials. There are also issues hitting specific products, such as the warmer winter affecting timber production in Scandinavia while the cold winter weather in Texas affected the production of chemicals, plastics and polymer. There has also been a sharp rise in shipping costs amid the pandemic. Travis Perkins is the UK's biggest builder's merchant The Federation of Master Builders said that some building firms may have to delay projects and others could be forced to close as a result. ""Small, local builders are being hit hardest by material shortages and price rises,"" chief executive Brian Berry told the BBC last week. ""My members are experiencing price rises of 10-15% across the board, rising to 50% on timber and 30% on cement."" Trade group the Construction Leadership Council said it saw material shortages lasting for the foreseeable future. Roland Glancy, managing director of design service Peek Home, advised people to delay home improvement projects until autumn. ""The last thing you want is to knock through a wall and then struggle to get hold of a bag of plaster to complete your vision, leaving you living in a building site, just when we should be enjoying our new freedoms,"" he said.

"New national ship to showcase best of British - PMThe government plans to build a successor to Britannia in the UK, at a reported cost of about Â£200m.UK","A mocked up image of what the new flagship might look like has been released A new national flagship is to be commissioned by the government in a bid to boost British trade and industry globally, the prime minister has said. The vessel will be the successor to the Royal Yacht Britannia, which was retired in 1997. The government plans to build the ship in the UK, at a reported cost of Â£200m. Labour said the government must demonstrate clearly how the ship is expected to boost trade, jobs and growth. The name of the new flagship has yet to be announced, but the Daily Telegraph has suggested the ship will be named after the Duke of Edinburgh, who helped design Britannia. The new vessel would be used to promote British interests around the world - including hosting trade fairs and diplomatic meetings - as the UK seeks to build links and boost exports following Brexit. The tendering process for its design and construction will begin soon - with an emphasis on utilising British design expertise and the latest green technology. Downing Street said costs for the ""construction and operation"" of the ship would be confirmed after the tendering process concluded. Construction is set to start as early as next year, with the ship expected to enter service within the next four years. The vessel, which is set to be in service for about 30 years, will be part of the Royal Navy and crewed by it. After it was decommissioned in 1997, the Royal Yacht Britannia became a tourist attraction in Edinburgh The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh travelled aboard the the Royal Yacht Britannia many times, including during the monarch's Silver Jubilee tour in 1977 Prince Philip,who died on 9 April, aged 99, served in theRoyal Navy during World War Twoand was made Lord High Admiral by the Queen in 2011. How the navy shaped the Duke of Edinburgh's life Boris Johnson said the flagship would be ""the first vessel of its kind in the world"" and would reflect ""the UK's burgeoning status as a great, independent maritime trading nation"". ""Every aspect of the ship, from its build to the businesses it showcases on board, will represent and promote the best of British - a clear and powerful symbol of our commitment to be an active player on the world stage,"" he said. Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, Bridget Phillipson, said if the ship is going to be part of a genuine plan for Britain's future, the government ""must set out clearly how it will boost trade, jobs and growth in every corner of our country"". She said if the flagship is built, it should be made in the UK to support jobs in shipyards and there must be ""a real focus on value for money at every stage"". ""Right now our country faces huge challenges, and there's no sign the government has a plan for the recovery. We want to see public money used for targeted investment in a green economic recovery, resources for our NHS, and supporting families to succeed,"" she said. This video can not be played The launch of the Royal Yacht Britannia 65 years ago The Queen launched the Royal Yacht Britannia at the John Brown shipyard in Clydebank on 16 April 1953 in front of thousands of people. It travelled more than one million miles in its 44 years of service and, after it was decommissioned, became a tourist attraction in Ocean Terminal in Leith, Edinburgh. In November last year,it was announced the yacht would temporarily shutafter recording losses of Â£2.4m as coronavirus restrictions meant it cost more to open with limited visitor numbers than to be closed with staff furloughed. The floating visitor attraction, which had 390,000 visitors in 2019, has since reopened. How the navy shaped the duke's life MP: Time to commission new royal yacht Britannia.

Election hopes and fears play out,"Voters in Mitzpe Ramon are hoping this election will break a succession of deadlocks The town of Mitzpe Ramon is recovering from its isolation in the desert. Often the inhabitants had only themselves and their crater for company. The population of 5,211 lives on a cliff edge above a naturally formed chasm in the Negev desert - a site of stunning beauty that entices tourists. But the visitors vanished amid the Covid closures. The lockdown laid waste to work for the tour guides. In Israel, joblessness has soared. The country suffered badly as the virus surged last year and there were claims of government blunders. Then came a dramatically swift vaccine rollout. A battered economy is starting to reopen. Many of these things were weighing on Israel's already crisis-hit coalition, when gridlock triggered yet another election. There are not many tourists to be seen these days in Mitzpe Ramon But in Mitzpe - the town whose name means ""lookout"" - no-one seems to be watching much. The streets don't echo with the sound of political rallying. Election posters are as unlikely to be seen as foreign tourists. Instead there's a desert wind and weariness. The same bitter divisions over Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's leadership - splits formed years ago - look set to play the major role in Tuesday's poll, the fourth since 2019. ""It's no, no, no to Bibi and his friends,"" says Boaz Katz, who runs Desert Prime tours. He has seen business drop by two-thirds since the start of the pandemic. Netanyahu trial: What are the allegations? Netanyahu: Commando turned PM He steers his 4x4 over rocks into the crater's core, hinting at worries shared by many Israelis. ""I think about the future a lot and it spooks me to see Benjamin Netanyahu and his natural companions - I want to live in a free, democratic country,"" says Mr Katz, who used to vote for Mr Netanyahu's Likud party. Benjamin Netanyahu is seeking a clear mandate, but polls suggest results could be tight The prime minister has been met with protests over his desire to rewire parts of the justice system while on trial for corruption. Others oppose his long-standing pact with ultra-religious parties. The tour guide scratches a heart shape in the sand and explains the landscape. The crater was not formed by an asteroid smashing into Earth. Instead, it was scoured out over millennia through water erosion, as torrents eviscerated soft rock. Likewise, those who rival for Israel's leadership feel they are fighting an unstoppable force. The last election with no winner led to an ""emergency coalition"" to fight the pandemic. Mr Netanyahu's rival Benny Gantz - a former general and political novice - agreed to a rotating premiership. But Mr Gantz never got to take his turn. The remnants of his Blue and White party are facing near wipe-out, according to opinion polls. The drive back into town passes the only shopping centre. There's a queue at the shawarma restaurant. Others sit inside a franchise coffee shop, masks on. Business is also back by the crater. Rachel Amsalem lives on the edge. Her home close to the clifftop is covered in Israeli flags. Rachel Amsalem credits Israel's achievements to Mr Netanyahu A Likud cap rests on a rail in the porch, ready for outings when she faces off against the ""black flag"" protesters who oppose Mr Netanyahu. ""He doesn't sleep. He is the guardian of Israel,"" says Mrs Amsalem, borrowing a biblical phrase. She knew him decades ago, working as a maid in the Netanyahu family home in Jerusalem. Her parents fled Algeria in the 1940s. Decades later, she came to Mitzpe Ramon, a development town providing low-cost homes for Jewish immigrants, many from Arab countries. The community now forms a base of working-class support for Mr Netanyahu. Mrs Amsalem credits him with the speedy vaccine deal helping bring the pandemic under control. Last year, her daughter-in-law, also called Rachel, died with Covid-19. ""Nobody else has the courage to pick up the phone and call [vaccine-maker] Pfizer,"" she says. ""He works day and night, whether it's [the diplomatic deals] with Arab countries, [countering] Iran, on corona, on the economyâ¦ there's one person we should say thanks to."" But Mr Netanyahu's opponents have instead been scrambling to find another viable challenger to him. The ""anti-Bibi"" bloc now includes a former ally-turned-rival, Gideon Saar, who left Likud. Many more opposition votes are being soaked up by the centrist party led by a former TV host, Yair Lapid. The outcome could rest on how smaller parties do. In an unlikely move, Mr Netanyahu has tried to get support from Palestinian citizens of Israel, who make up a fifth of the population. A drive further north in the Negev - al-Naqab in Arabic - reveals deep scepticism over the motives of a politician who once warned his base to get to the polling stations as ""the Arabs are voting in droves"". ""We all know he is lying to people,"" says Huda Abu Obaid, a community organiser in the Bedouin town of Lakiya. Huda Abu Obaid: Benjamin Netanyahu ""has been the worst one for us"" She believes Mr Netanyahu wants to further divide support for a group of Arab parties, which could strengthen his hand in coalition building. ""We know very well that he was the worst one for us, for the Arab community, and I think that he will not change himself,"" she says. The sun is setting back by the crater where the Mitzpe Ramon desert circus school - closed for much of the last year - is warming up. A juggler appears at the cliff edge. The principal, Adam De Langa, urges unity, calling a fourth election ""crazy"". It might be another cry in the wilderness.  The sides remain entrenched in Israel's unwon battle for a stable government. Israel heads to election as unity government falls Netanyahu: What are the corruption charges?

afternoon:  Foreign holidays are back, but organising a trip isn't straightforward. Popular destinations including Portugal, Spain, Greece and Turkey all have different rules at the moment. England's traffic light list classes destinations as green, amber or red. Similar rules apply in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The government says you should not holiday in amber and red countries. Quarantine rules apply and there are extra tests. Read morehere.

Colleen Tinnelly, from the Ulster Society for Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, says they have rehomed more than 850 animals since 2017 and ""even in lockdown when many of our services were closed because of restrictions, we still had similar numbers"". ""Now that we're coming out of lockdown and there is going to be a change in people's lifestyles, we expect an increasing number of animals to be surrendered in the coming months,"" she says. Find out more in the video above. Vaccinations will open for 16 to 29-year-olds at midnight on Friday, 5 June, the Czech Republic's Prime Minister Andrej Babis has announced. He says there are 1,485,433 people in this age category and he hopes young people will sign up. About 7.3 million people are currently eligible for vaccination - that is everyone aged 30 and over - in the country of 10.7 million people. So far, more than 3.7 million of them have received a first dose, and more than 1.4 million are fully vaccinated. Candles have been lit in memory of victims of the pandemic at Prague Castle The plays were given a new lease of life in 2012 in a massive production involving 1,700 people Performances of the Mystery Plays will go ahead in York in July, having previously been put on hold because of the coronavirus pandemic. They were first performed in the city in the 14th Century and traditionally involve just one professional actor, among a cast of amateurs. The outdoor plays will be staged on two wagons in Dean's Park on 3 and 4 July. Organisers York Festival Trust said audience capacity would be limited to 50 in order to keep people safe. Read more Concerns over the Indian variant mean vaccination is being speeded up in many areas, and second doses are being offered earlier to some groups of people. So who is eligible for the vaccine now?  Read more in our explainer here A total of 602,374 vaccines were administered on Saturday, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi says. He calls it ""another big day""on Twitter,external, saying more than 65.5 million vaccine doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 25.3 million adults protected with two doses. We're waiting for the daily coronavirus statistics from the UK government - it says today's dashboard is delayed because of ""technical difficulties"" in the reporting of vaccine data from Public Health Wales. ""We will update the dashboard as soon as we are able to,"" the website says. The number of single people in Bristol requiring temporary housing more than tripled during the pandemic, the city's head of housing options says. Paul Sylvester describes the 330% increase during the past year as ""absolutely massive"". Families with children in temporary accommodation went up by 11%, but the number of rough sleepers fell. Sylvester says homelessness surged after each lockdown, with the biggest rise after the third, as coronavirus took its toll on families and relationships. The number of people made homeless because they were told to leave by family or friends doubled during the past 12 months, he says. Read more A French ban on non-essential travel from the UK due to the spread of the so-called Indian coronavirus variant begins tomorrow. France is already on England's ""amber"" list, meaning the UK government advises against travel there and passengers must quarantine upon return. But now France says travel should only be allowed, for example, for bereavement or childcare, and that includes seven days of self-isolation. Read more about the rules for foreign travel from England here. This video can not be played Scotland's Deputy First Minister John Swinney says he is ""optimistic"" lockdown restrictions will be eased in Glasgow next week. He tells BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show the decision relies on people sustaining ""the very good engagement"" seen over the weekend with the vaccination programme. ""It's really encouraging,"" he adds. As we heard earlier, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has said it would be ""irresponsible"" of the government not to consider mandatory vaccinations for NHS staff. But the president of the Royal College of Emergency Medicine has rejected this, saying it would be a ""great shame"" if ministers went down that route. ""Everyone has a professional obligation to keep the patient safe,"" Doctor Katherine Henderson tells the BBC. ""But we ought to be able to explain and encourage and make people understand why vaccination is the right thing to do and make sure that people are working in an environment that is safe for them."" Two-thirds of big retailers expect to face legal action from their landlords when a suspension of aggressive debt collection ends in June, a survey says. Many shops have been shut for long periods due to coronavirus restrictions in the UK, accruing Â£2.9bn in rental arrears, according to the British Retail Consortium. The BRC says a rush to collect could lead to a ""tsunami of closures"" and is urging the government to act. The government introduced a code of practice last year to address the outstanding debt issues. It also put curbs on aggressive debt collection practices until 30 June. But of the 24 major retailers surveyed - who account for more than 5,000 UK stores - two-thirds described the code as ""ineffective"" because it is voluntary. Read morehere. More than two million Scots are now fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Figures released today show 2,022,728 people have received both doses of a vaccine after 24,319 were jabbed in the latest 24-hour period. In total, 3,234,311 people have been given at least one dose of a vaccine in Scotland, an increase of 18,541 on Saturday's figure. Read morehere. Aleksandra Zadroga swapped hospitality for the recruitment industry after returning from furlough While customers have enthusiastically returned to reopened bars and restaurants, the same is not necessarily true for staff. More than one in 10 UK hospitality workers has left the industry in the past year, and vacancies have soared while applications slumped. Several former hospitality workers are blaming the financial impact of lockdown and furlough. Aleksandra Zadroga, who used to work in a restaurant, says being on furlough has given many a ""push"" to quit. Industry body UK Hospitality says venues are struggling to fill thousands of jobs. Read more:Why are hospitality workers leaving the industry? The rapid spread of Covid-19 within Thailand's overcrowded prisons is continuing to drive a surge in confirmed cases in the country. The authorities have today recorded more than 4,500 new cases of the virus, with almost half of them inside prisons. At least 22,000 prisoners have tested positive for coronavirus since the government first began releasing figures a month ago. Thailand's justice minister says each prisoner is allocated less room than the inside of a coffin, and he says he is exploring ways to release convicts if they have underlying medical conditions.  A tai chi teacher has been helping people recovering from coronavirus with techniques to make their breathing easier. Paul White, from Derbyshire, found he was contacted by patients during the pandemic and began assisting them free of charge. Hear more from Paul below.

But last night's gripping Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea reminded fans of the thrill of live sport - with 6,000 followers of each team in attendance in Porto, Portugal. Aleksander Ceferin, the Uefa president, says the event ""was a great success"". He adds: ""The organisation and co-operation of the Portuguese FA and the local and national authorities was exemplary but the whole occasion was made so much more special because at last we had fans back, cheering their teams on and giving us the reminder of what a beautiful occasion it is. âThis game, watched by millions all around the world, has given everyone hope and a glimpse of light at the end of this very dark tunnel that has dictated our lives for so long. Normality is slowly returning and we can all celebrate that. âChelsea were worthy winners.â BBC Radio 4 Prof Dale Fisher, a member of the first World Health Organization (WHO) team to visit China last year, has said the theory the coronavirus leaked from a Wuhan lab is ""not off the table"" but lacks credibility so far. He tells BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend he does not give claims the virus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology ""any credibility until it's validated"". Fisher says the WHO has asked countries for any evidence they have and he says it is disappointing to read reports the US and now others may have intelligence to suggest a lab leak occurred. It follows a Wall Street Journal report saying several Insititute of Virology workers were hospitalised with virus symptoms in November 2019. ""The only evidence in my mind for there being a lab leak is that there was a lab... but really the lab-leak theory is not off the table and there is more work to be done,"" Fisher says. Scotland's deputy first minister says he expects Covid restrictions in Glasgow to be eased before the Euro 2020 tournament comes to the city. John Swinney tells BBC Scotland's Sunday Show the intention is to lift Glasgow out of level three as soon as possible, likely by the end of this week. Glasgow is currently the only area of Scotland that is subject to tougher level three restrictions. This means people are not allowed to meet in each other's homes, and pubs and restaurants are not able to sell alcohol indoors. Non-essential travel in and out of the city is also prohibited. Glasgow is due to host a football fan zone for 6,000 supporters from 11 June. Swinney says the extra measure appeared to be having an impact on stemming Covid rates rates in the city, which have been among the highest in Scotland. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

"Travis Perkins warns builders of price risesIndustry-wide shortages mean the builders' merchant will charge more for cement, chipboard and paint.Business","The UK's biggest builders' merchant has warned customers of ""considerable"" cost increases to raw materials amid an industry-wide shortage. As first reportedby the Times,external, Travis Perkins says the price of bagged cement will rise by 15%, chipboard by 10% and paint by 5% from Tuesday. It comes as industry groups warn electrical components, timber and steel are also in short supply. They blame surging demand as lockdown eases, as well as supply chain issues. Travis Perkins has been informing customers in its stores, websites and by email of the price rises. It said it had seen demand across the board - from consumers doing more DIY projects, to demand from big infrastructure projects such as HS2. It said the increases could affect its other brands which include Keyline and BSS. A spokesman said: ""In instances where we have seen some challenges posed by global demand for raw materials or inflationary pressures, we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to minimise price increases where possible, whilst also ensuring healthy stock availability for all of our customers."" DIY and building projects hit by materials shortage The Office for National Statistics has projected a rise of 7-8% in material prices this year, with increases for certain materials, such as timber, expected to more than double. The supply problems stem from a number of factors. Construction industry projects have surged since lockdown began easing which has led to skyrocketing demand for already scarce materials. There are also issues hitting specific products, such as the warmer winter affecting timber production in Scandinavia while the cold winter weather in Texas affected the production of chemicals, plastics and polymer. There has also been a sharp rise in shipping costs amid the pandemic. Travis Perkins is the UK's biggest builder's merchant The Federation of Master Builders said that some building firms may have to delay projects and others could be forced to close as a result. ""Small, local builders are being hit hardest by material shortages and price rises,"" chief executive Brian Berry told the BBC last week. ""My members are experiencing price rises of 10-15% across the board, rising to 50% on timber and 30% on cement."" Trade group the Construction Leadership Council said it saw material shortages lasting for the foreseeable future. Roland Glancy, managing director of design service Peek Home, advised people to delay home improvement projects until autumn. ""The last thing you want is to knock through a wall and then struggle to get hold of a bag of plaster to complete your vision, leaving you living in a building site, just when we should be enjoying our new freedoms,"" he said.

Israeli opposition nears deal to oust Netanyahu,"Benjamin Netanyahu has dominated Israeli politics for a generation Israeli opposition parties have moved closer towards forming a government that would bring to an end Benjamin Netanyahu's time as the country's longest serving prime minister. Centrist party leader Yair Lapid is reportedly close to reaching a coalition agreement with the ultra-nationalist leader Naftali Bennett. Leaders from Mr Bennett's party spoke in favour of the deal on Sunday. Mr Lapid, 57, has until Wednesday to form a new coalition government. Israeli media reports suggest both sides have inched closer towards a deal that would see Mr Bennett, 49, serve as prime minister for two years before being replaced by Mr Lapid for the second half of the term. Mr Bennett is due to deliver a statement on Sunday evening in which he is expected to formally declare his support for the agreement. Israel election hopes and fears play out in crater town Israel's Benjamin Netanyahu: Commando turned PM His Yamina party hold a crucial six seats in the 120-member parliament that would give an opposition coalition of right-wing, centrist and left-wing parties a clear majority. Mr Bennett met with Yamina leaders on Sunday and received their support for the coalition deal, a statement said. But no one should count out Mr Netanyahu whose political survival instincts remain second to none, says BBC Middle East analyst Sebastian Usher. Centrist party leader Yair Lapid (L) is reportedly close to reaching a deal with the ultra-nationalist leader Naftali Bennett The opponents of Mr Netanyahu, who is on trial for fraud, have little in common politically but are united in their desire to see his run in power come to an end. The 71-year-old, who has been in power for 12 years and has dominated Israeli politics for a generation, fell short of a decisive majority at a general election in March. It was the fourth inconclusive vote in two years. That result opened the door for Mr Lapid, a former finance minister who was given until 2 June to form a new coalition government after Mr Netanyahu failed to do so. His Yesh Atid party came second to Mr Netanyahu's right-wing Likud at the last election. A conflict on pause as both sides claim victory How much money does Israel get from the US? In pictures: The destruction in Gaza and Israel Mr Lapid was initially given a 28-day mandate to form a government, but this was interrupted by the recent 11-day conflict in Gaza. One of his potential coalition partners, the Arab Islamist Raam party, broke off talks because of the violence. There were also clashes in Israeli cities between mixed Arab and Jewish populations. This video can not be played Two children from Gaza City and Israel describe their experience of the Israel-Gaza conflict On Saturday night, Mr Netanyahu's Likud party made an offer to Mr Bennett and the leader of another potential coalition party to share the premiership in a three-way split. However, his offer was rejected. If Mr Lapid is unable to agree a coalition, Israelis could be going back to the polls again later for the fifth election in just two years. Under Israel's electoral system of proportional representation, it is difficult for a single party to gain enough seats to form a government outright. Smaller parties are usually needed to make up the numbers needed for a coalition.

Live music performances to return in Wales,"Gigs can return to Wales immediately but will have to follow strict rules Live music can return immediately in Wales, it has been announced. The Welsh government confirmed performances could begin again but the change did not apply to nightclubs. Venues will need risk assessments in line with hospitality andperforming guidance,external. They will need to limit groups to a maximum of six people from six households, use one-way systems and follow ventilation guidelines. The change brings music performances in line with restaurants and theatres, which were able to open earlier in May. What are the lockdown rules in Wales? What's the roadmap for lifting lockdown around the UK? The announcement applies to music venues, bars, pubs, cafes, restaurants and licensed premises. Further activities, such as events and festivals, will be considered in the next review. Tickets for the Green Man festival sold out in 18 minutes when they went on sale earlier this month, despite organisers making it clear it may not go ahead. ""The demand is definitely there,"" director Fiona Stewart told BBC Radio Wales. She added: ""I have 5,000 people who rely on the festival [for work] who want it to go ahead. ""It will be an amazing moment if Green Man goes ahead in Wales - a fist in the air triumph for when we have had to give things up [over the past 14 months]."" Green Man is due to take place in the Brecon Beacons in August However, Ms Stewart said her ""nervousness"" was that Covid insurance was not available for big events and social distancing rules would not work at a festival. UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nichols said venues that could have a seated audience would be able to socially distance people. ""However, for many small venues it will simply be impossible for them to manage this with social distancing in place,"" she added. ""And for our nightclubs, it's just impossible to operate. We do need to see the rest of the roadmap for our Welsh businesses too. ""Until we get that final bit of the jigsaw - the social distancing lifted - to be able to allow these businesses to return to profitability, then we're not at the end of the road yet for the sector."" Katie Hall is looking forward to performing for the first time since early 2020 Katie Hall, the lead singer of Chroma, said she was ""elated"" and it was a ""step in the right direction"" with the band unable to play any gigs since before the pandemic. The south Wales act has festival bookings for October, and she added: ""Everyone needs to be paid, and something like 36% of people in the sector have lost their jobs. ""It's had a massive hit on the music industry as a whole."" Trial events have taken place in Liverpool But Daniel Minty, who produces a Cardiff gig guide said he believed conversations were ""much needed"" over live events. ""The Welsh government has not discussed it over the last 16 months,"" he said. ""The train is leaving the station and that's the most important thing."" Mr Minty said he believed there would be a need for trial events while venues would need to decide if they can break even with gigs, adding: ""It's a difficult process, but a process that is now able to start."" In England, socially distanced gigs have been taking place since 17 May. All areas of mainland Scotland are at level two apart from Glasgow, which is at level three. At level two outdoor and indoor events such as concerts can go ahead with limited capacity. Northern Ireland has no date yet set for when live music can resume there. Cardiff Castle is due to stage a Foals concert this summer A Welsh government spokesman said the suspension of gigs and other live performances had been one of ""the biggest shocks to our sense of well-being and the arts economy"". He added: ""We will continue to support our music and arts sectors in Wales through our cultural recovery, freelancer and economic resilience funds."" Welsh music tourism attracts 440,000 people annually, according to industry group UK Music. It said the industry generates about Â£143m for the Welsh economy and supports more than 1,800 jobs. Welsh rockers Feeder, whose UK top 20 hits include Buck Rogers and Just A Day, are due to play an outdoor homecoming concert at Tredegar Park in Newport on 9 July. One of the first big gigs in Wales this summer is Feeder's open air concert in Newport While renowned live band Foals, winners of the best album award at the 2020 Brits, are scheduled to play one of the open-air concerts at Cardiff Castle this summer. Some of Wales' most popular gig venues - like Venue Cymru in Llandudno and Newport Centre - are still Covid vaccination centres. ""It's been a long road, but I think we're finally getting to the end of it,"" said Sam Dabb, the Wales coordinator for the Music Venue Trust. Tell us when we can reopen, nightclubs say Many music venues 'could never reopen' ""I'm really, really happy. ""The gigs are subject to risk assessments and the guidance, and we have to wait for the guidance to come out from Welsh government and then the Music Venue Trust are going to help their members build the risk assessments, to make sure we do everything safely and properly. Sam Dabb of the Music Venue Trust says the best route back is ""safely and slowly"" ""I think the best route back is to do it safely and slowly,"" added Ms Dabb, manager of Newport gig venue Le Pub. ""Whatever the scientific advisers are saying we should do, we're going to make sure our members are doing,"" she said.

Mr Lapid's 28-day mandate to form a government was interrupted by the recent 11-day conflict in Gaza. One of his potential coalition partners, the Arab Islamist Raam party, broke off talks because of the violence. There were also clashes in Israeli cities with mixed Arab and Jewish populations. On Saturday night, Mr Netanyahu's Likud party made an offer to Mr Bennett and the leader of another potential coalition party to share the premiership in a three-way split. However, his offer was rejected. If Mr Lapid is unable to agree a coalition, Israelis could be going back to the polls again later this year. Under Israel's electoral system of proportional representation, it is difficult for a single party to gain enough seats to form a government outright. Smaller parties are usually needed to make up the numbers needed for a coalition.

Call for hubs to tackle backlog,"The Royal College of Surgeons says there should be around 40 centres based in existing NHS buildings to carry out non-urgent surgery. Surgeons are calling for specialist hubs in England to help tackle what they call a ""colossal backlog"" of non-urgent operations because of Covid-19. The Royal College of Surgeons (RCS) wants a network of hospital sites focused on routine surgery, such as hip and knee replacements. The government says it is working ""to accelerate the recovery of services"". In March, around five million patients were waiting for surgery - the highest number since modern records began. More than 436,000 were waiting more than a year, NHS England figures show - compared with just 1,600 before the Covid crisis. A similar proportion of the population is on waiting lists in Scotland and a higher percentage in Wales and Northern Ireland. The NHS Covid legacy - long waits and lives at risk 'I went to Sri Lanka for my operation' Life on a hospital list 'makes you feel forgotten' Prof Neil Mortensen, president of the RCS, said the pandemic has had a devastating impact on surgical services  - and that it must not be allowed to happen again. ""Surgery must be available on the NHS all year round, not stop and start,"" he said, adding that a ""New Deal for Surgery"" was required to help weather future pandemics. ""If a dangerous new variant of COVID-19 takes hold, or another bad flu arrives in the autumn, we cannot allow surgery to grind to a halt again or waiting lists will become insurmountable."" Prof Mortensen said patients and staff had already adapted to changes required because of the pandemic, such as flexible working and outpatient consultations by phone or video link. He added that politicians needed to be open to change and accept that services available at their nearest hospital might not be the same as before. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The RCS says there should be around 40 centres based in existing NHS buildings to carry out non-urgent surgery. The idea is to reduce the risk of infections spreading from other parts of hospitals. It is hoped that by bringing specialist teams together under one roof, there would be greater efficiency and better use of operating theatres. Patients might need to travel further from their local hospitals, but the RCS says its own polling suggests most would support the idea if it reduced waiting times. It wants to see an extra Â£1bn a year of government funding and a longer-term commitment to train more staff. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We have backed the NHS at every point in the pandemic, safeguarding urgent treatment such as cancer and emergency care, while protecting the NHS to ensure it was not overwhelmed."" He said the government was providing ""an extra Â£7bn for health and care services"" this year, and Â£1bn to tackle backlogs. ""We face an unprecedented challenge and will continue to work closely with the NHS to accelerate the recovery of services so everyone gets the care they need, including Â£160m to support hospitals to find innovative ways to carry out even more operations and cut waiting lists,"" he added. It comes amid growing concern about the Covid-19 variant first identified in India. Public Health England data shows cases of the variant have risen by 3,535 to 6,959 since last week. Health Secretary Matt Hancock saidup to three quarters of new UK Covid cases could be of the Indian variant, and that it was ""critical"" to monitor the link between cases and hospitalisations. The prime minister said it was important to understandthe extent to which the vaccine programme ""interrupts the link"" between infection, hospitalisation, serious illness and death.

GPs report surge in appointments,"Rising numbers of patients needing care and a shortage of GPs is threatening to overwhelm the system, doctors and patient groups are warning. It comes after the pandemic has caused severe disruption to GP practices for more than a year. Analysis of NHS England data by the Health Foundation found more than 28 million appointments were booked in March, among the highest recorded. Doctors' leaders say what they are being asked to achieve is ""undoable"". The analysis of NHS Digital data in England carried out by the Health Foundation for the BBC also found that that between 2019-20 and 2020-21: The total number of appointments dropped by 10% - meaning 31 million fewer consultations with GPs and practice nurses Major shift from face-to-face to remote consultation, with the proportion seen in practices dropping from 79% to 54% The number of patients referred by GPs for urgent cancer check-ups dropped by 15%, putting lives at risk The escalating situation has prompted patient groups to call for an urgent review of access to services, amid reports that patients are struggling to get through. This video can not be played Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster, opened his doors to the BBC to show the pressures facing practices Doncaster-based GP Dr Dean Eggitt has never seen anything like this: ""We have almost a tsunami of patients coming to us - it feels like the river has flooded the banks. ""It just keeps coming and coming and coming in this one massive, endless wave of patients who all are ill and need help and input. ""They're sick, they're complex and we've got very few places to send them. I wouldn't want to be my patient right now."" Dr Eggitt's experience is not unique. There were 28.4 million appointments in March, once you include those made with practice nurses as well as GPs - that is one of the highest on record. But he says he worries most about the ""hidden wave of patients who don't get through"". One of those is Sharron, who ended up in hospital after she struggled on at home for weeks getting more and more sick. She was eventually diagnosed with colitis and had lost so much blood, she needed four emergency blood transfusions. She says a combination of busy phone lines and not wanting to bother the practice meant she deteriorated at home. ""When I finally got through I knew I was really poorly, I had never felt so ill in my life."" She was immediately invited in for a consultation and sent to hospital. There could be millions of people in a similar position. There were 279 million appointments made with GP practices in England from April 2020 to March 2021, compared with 310 million the year before. The biggest drops were seen in the Midlands, North East, Yorkshire and East of England, according to the Health Foundation analysis. The data is not collected elsewhere in the UK, but the reports surfacing suggest the problems are similar. That has, the Health Foundation warns, created a huge amount of unmet need. This much can be seen from the drop in urgent referrals where GPs suspect someone has cancer. The numbers sent to hospital for check-ups have dropped by 15% since the pandemic started - that's potentially 367,000 people with symptoms who have not been sent for further investigations. Sara Bainbridge, from Macmillan Cancer Support, says the disruption to services has had a ""devastating impact"", saying it is leading to fewer diagnoses, and reducing survival chances. And it's not just cancer patients. Dr Becks Fisher, a GP in Oxford and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation, says there are people with other serious conditions, such as heart failure and non-Covid respiratory problems, who have stayed away too. ""Their health will have deteriorated as they have not been getting the help they need. The people we are seeing now are coming in with really complex problems. And it is those in deprived areas who have been affected the most."" She says this is being compounded by a significant rise in people seeking help with mental health problems, as well as those ""ricocheting"" back from hospital because their health has worsened while waiting for treatment. Latest figures show there are more than 400,000 people who have been waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements - up from 1,600 when the pandemic began. ""I think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at the moment - this is going to get a lot worse in the coming months"" added Dr Fisher. One of the key barriers, some say, is the lack of face-to-face care that is available. Social distancing restrictions and infection control procedures mean GPs have had to rely heavily on remote consultations. The number of face-to-face consultations has dropped significantly - down from 79% of total appointments in 2019-20 to 54% in 2020-21. And even now with restrictions easing, the numbers being brought in are still well short of what they were. One of those who has fallen foul of this is Helen Cowley, 55, from Swindon. She had a telephone consultation for ear pain and was advised to seek private treatment for the build-up of ear wax. When she got to the clinic, they diagnosed an ear infection and she had to phone her practice back. ""It was nearly two months before I got the proper treatment - and to be fair I thought it was ear wax too. It was obviously not the most serious problem in the world, but not being able to be seen face-to-face is not ideal. You can see how things can be missed and for some patients that may have huge consequences."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England is particularly concerned about the lack of face-to-face appointments, and is calling for an urgent review into the situation. National Director Imelda Redmond said while remote consultations suit some patients, there are many who have struggled with the arrangements that have been put in place. ""Those affected are often the most vulnerable in our society - older people, disabled people, those affected by homelessness and on low incomes."" The issue has already prompted action at the highest level. NHS England wrote to GPs in mid-May saying patients must be offered face-to-face appointments if that is their preference, unless there was good reason not to, such as the patient displaying Covid symptoms. Extra funding has been provided too. But the move has been met with some opposition from GP leaders who have raised concerns about the lack of space in GP practice buildings, with the British Medical Association's GPs committee even passing a motion of no confidence in NHS England. BMA GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey says doctors were left ""angry, frustrated and disappointed"" by the letter, especially given the ""incredible contribution"" GPs have made to the vaccination programme - around three-quarters of jabs have been given in GP-led settings. In many ways, this is a problem that has been building for a while. There has been a big push in recent years by the government to increase the number of GPs to keep up with rising demand, but once you exclude locums and trainees the number of permanent GPs has actually fallen by nearly 2,000 in the past few years to just under 27,000 full-time GPs. Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it means what is being asked of the profession now is simply ""undoable"". ""General practice was already facing intense workforce and workload pressures - the pandemic has only exacerbated these. We urgently need more GPs and other members of the practice team.""

"Travis Perkins warns builders of price risesIndustry-wide shortages mean the builders' merchant will charge more for cement, chipboard and paint.","The UK's biggest builders' merchant has warned customers of ""considerable"" cost increases to raw materials amid an industry-wide shortage. As first reportedby the Times,external, Travis Perkins says the price of bagged cement will rise by 15%, chipboard by 10% and paint by 5% from Tuesday. It comes as industry groups warn electrical components, timber and steel are also in short supply. They blame surging demand as lockdown eases, as well as supply chain issues. Travis Perkins has been informing customers in its stores, websites and by email of the price rises. It said it had seen demand across the board - from consumers doing more DIY projects, to demand from big infrastructure projects such as HS2. It said the increases could affect its other brands which include Keyline and BSS. A spokesman said: ""In instances where we have seen some challenges posed by global demand for raw materials or inflationary pressures, we continue to work closely with our suppliers and partners to minimise price increases where possible, whilst also ensuring healthy stock availability for all of our customers."" DIY and building projects hit by materials shortage The Office for National Statistics has projected a rise of 7-8% in material prices this year, with increases for certain materials, such as timber, expected to more than double. The supply problems stem from a number of factors. Construction industry projects have surged since lockdown began easing which has led to skyrocketing demand for already scarce materials. There are also issues hitting specific products, such as the warmer winter affecting timber production in Scandinavia while the cold winter weather in Texas affected the production of chemicals, plastics and polymer. There has also been a sharp rise in shipping costs amid the pandemic. Travis Perkins is the UK's biggest builder's merchant The Federation of Master Builders said that some building firms may have to delay projects and others could be forced to close as a result. ""Small, local builders are being hit hardest by material shortages and price rises,"" chief executive Brian Berry told the BBC last week. ""My members are experiencing price rises of 10-15% across the board, rising to 50% on timber and 30% on cement."" Trade group the Construction Leadership Council said it saw material shortages lasting for the foreseeable future. Roland Glancy, managing director of design service Peek Home, advised people to delay home improvement projects until autumn. ""The last thing you want is to knock through a wall and then struggle to get hold of a bag of plaster to complete your vision, leaving you living in a building site, just when we should be enjoying our new freedoms,"" he said.

Senior MP demands answers for leaseholders,"Leaseholder Jie Shen says he's unable to sell his flat in Leicester despite new guidance that should make it possible MP Clive Betts has written to the government to ask whynew guidance,externaldesigned to help about 500,000 leaseholders sell or remortgage their flats is not being followed. It was issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)in March. It is supposed to help surveyors decide which tower blocks need extra fire safety checks. But although mortgage providers were consulted on the guidance, Money Box has found some lenders are ignoring it. The extra checks are called an Exterior Wall System form, or EWS1, and were introduced in the wake of theGrenfell Tower firein which 72 people died. That form is supposed to provide assurance for buyers, sellers and, crucially, mortgage providers about whether or not a flat is safe to buy, sell, or lend against, depending on whether it has flammable cladding, vertically stacked balconies or other issues. But Money Box listener Jie Shen, who is trying to provide for his retirement, is selling a flat which has neither of those problems. He says three separate mortgage providers have turned down his prospective buyer because Jie's building doesn't have an EWS1 form - even though the RICS guidance says it doesn't need one. ""I feel like I'm trapped into this situation. I can't move on with my life, I'm just locked into this and I don't know how to resolve this,"" he says. ""I think the mortgage lenders should follow the advice from RICS and shouldn't insist on an EWS1 form [for a building] that does not contain flammable cladding. ""I just don't understand why the mortgage provider insists on this - it's just bureaucracy."" Another complication for Jie, and many others like him, is that getting an EWS1 form is not in his power, even if he wanted to get one. He is a leaseholder and the decision to pay for the survey needed to get the form lies entirely with the freeholder who owns his building. In Jie's case, the management company of his building, representing the freeholder, has quoted the RICS guidance to show the building should not require an EWS1 form, leaving Jie utterly stuck. But Jie's buyer has been turned down by three mortgage providers exactly because he doesn't have an EWS1 form. And so it goes round and round, with Jie left in limbo. It's hearing about cases like Jie's that has made Mr Betts act. Writing to the Secretary of State for Housing, Robert Jenrick, Mr Betts, while recognising that the EWS1 is ""a process led by industry"", has asked two key questions on behalf of the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee, which he chairs: The ways in which the government is supporting the implementation of the new guidance from RICS The actions that the government plans to take in the event that mortgage lenders continue to insist that EWS1 forms are obtained for buildings that do not meet RICS criteria. He has requested answers by the end of May. Mr Betts has also asked people who find themselves in the same position as Jie - when the RICS guidance shows their tower block doesn't need an EWS1, but when lenders are insisting on one - to email the committee at ""hclgcom@parliament.uk"". Speaking to Money Box after hearing about Jie's case, Mr Betts said: ""The system was set up with the lending industry and the surveying industry to work together to give reassurance to lenders. That's its whole purpose. ""So if it isn't giving reassurance to lenders to lend on buildings which the system says don't need a certificate... then the system is a complete failure and it needs taking up with both RICS and the lenders, so it doesn't leave people stranded in homes that they can't sell and can't remortgage."" UK Finance, which represents nearly 300 banks, building societies and mortgage providers, says it's supportive of the guidance but it's down to individual lenders whether or not they implement it, based on their own risk appetite. It also told Money Box that while lenders instruct valuers to complete property valuations, it's the valuers who determine whether or not EWS1 forms are required. The Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government told Money Box it wanted to encourage ""a sensible, proportionate approach to risk and for lenders to accept alternative forms of assurance"", adding that it was investing Â£5bn to help protect leaseholders from the cost of replacing unsafe cladding on their homes.

Thousands protest against Bolsonaro Covid handling,"Protesters in Brasilia carried a huge puppet of Jair Bolsonaro Protests have taken place across Brazil over the management of the Covid-19 crisis by the government of President Jair Bolsonaro. In the capital, Brasilia, thousands gathered in front of Congress calling for the president's impeachment, and demanding more vaccines. Demonstrations took place in other major cities, including Rio de Janeiro. Mr Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted over his response to the pandemic. Brazil has registered nearly 460,000 deaths - the second-highest toll in the world after the US. It also has the third-highest number of coronavirus cases at more than 16 million. Saturday's protests piled further pressure on Mr Bolsonaro as Brazil's Senate holds an inquiry into his government's handling of the pandemic and the slow roll-out of the vaccine programme. Opposition parties, trade unions and social movements accuse Mr Bolsonaro of stalling the programme and disregarding the consequences. Opponents of Jair Bolsonaro blame him for the slow response to the Covid crisis There was a large anti-government rally in Rio de Janeiro The high number of cases has brought the country's health system to the verge of collapse. The far-right leader has consistently opposed lockdown measures, arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the coronavirus itself. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Political crisis and Covid surge rock Brazil What is the Brazil variant and do vaccines work against it? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? In Brasilia, protesters marched alongside a giant plastic doll of the president. Placards demanded his impeachment and called for more vaccines and emergency financial aid. There were also calls to better protect indigenous people and to stop deforestation of the Amazon. Protesters in Brasilia had a wide-range of grievances against the government In Recife, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters who tried to march down a closed road, local media reported. In some cities, demonstrators laid thousands of symbolic crosses in tribute to those who died in the pandemic. On Thursday,  the head of Brazil's prestigious Butantan Institute told a Senate committee that President Bolsonaro's actions delayed the start of the vaccination programme, the Spanish news agency Efe reports. Dr Dimas Covas said that in August last year, Butantan offered to supply the government with 100 million doses of the CoronaVac vaccine, which the institute manufactures under licence from China's Sinovac. He said the proposal included a pledge to deliver the first five million doses by the beginning of December. In Brasilia, protesters marched to Congress where the Senate is investigating the government's response to the pandemic But a day after Butantan's offer, Mr Bolsonaro vowed that his government would ""never"" buy a Chinese vaccine, Dr Covas said. ""We could have been the first country in the world to vaccinate,"" he told the committee. Had the offer been accepted, Butantan would have been able to deliver 100 million doses by 30 March this year, Dr Covas added. Instead, Brazil has so far received a total of 46 million doses, due in part to shortages of raw materials amid the global scramble to obtain vaccines. Only 10% of the adult population has received the two required doses. Earlier in the inquiry, Pfizer's top executive for Latin America, Carlos Murillo, told the Senate committee that Mr Bolsonaro's government never responded to an offer that would have seen 1.5 million doses of the US pharmaceutical giant's vaccine reach Brazil last December.

EU treating NI as a political play-thing says Poots,"This video can not be played DUP leader Edwin Poots accuses European commissioners of not caring about the peace process The DUP leader Edwin Poots has accused the European Union of treating Northern Ireland as a political ""plaything"". Mr Poots claimed the EU was damaging the Northern Ireland peace process. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic firmly rejected that suggestion. Speaking on the Marr programme on BBC One, Mr Poots said the current EU commissioners did not seem to care about the peace process. He said he shared the fear of his predecessor Arlene Foster that anger over the Northern Ireland Protocol could lead to violence on the streets this summer. He said: ""I don't want to use a threat of violence in terms of this. ""Our arguments are very clear, they are very coherent. ""This is the European Union seeking to punish the UK and, as a consequence, Northern Ireland is being used as a plaything. ""I can assure you, Northern Ireland should be nobody's plaything."" EU-UK 'compromise needed for NI Protocol to work' Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? He urged the UK government to consider invoking Article 16 of the protocol, which allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". On the same programme, the European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic, firmly rejected any suggestion that the EU no longer cared about the peace process.

EU treating NI as 'a political play-thing' says Poots,"This video can not be played DUP leader Edwin Poots accuses European commissioners of not caring about the peace process The DUP leader Edwin Poots has accused the European Union of treating Northern Ireland as a political ""plaything"". Mr Poots claimed the EU was damaging the Northern Ireland peace process. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic firmly rejected that suggestion. Speaking on the Marr programme on BBC One, Mr Poots said the current EU commissioners did not seem to care about the peace process. He said he shared the fear of his predecessor Arlene Foster that anger over the Northern Ireland Protocol could lead to violence on the streets this summer. He said: ""I don't want to use a threat of violence in terms of this. ""Our arguments are very clear, they are very coherent. ""This is the European Union seeking to punish the UK and, as a consequence, Northern Ireland is being used as a plaything. ""I can assure you, Northern Ireland should be nobody's plaything."" EU-UK 'compromise needed for NI Protocol to work' Why are there Brexit checks in Northern Ireland? He urged the UK government to consider invoking Article 16 of the protocol, which allows either side to suspend any part of the agreement that causes ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"".

Thousands protest Bolsonaro Covid handling in Brazil,"Protesters in Brasilia carried a huge puppet of Jair Bolsonaro Protests have taken place across Brazil over the management of the Covid-19 crisis by the government of President Jair Bolsonaro. In the capital, Brasilia, thousands gathered in front of Congress calling for the president's impeachment, and demanding more vaccines. Demonstrations took place in other major cities, including Rio de Janeiro. Mr Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted over his response to the pandemic. Brazil has registered nearly 460,000 deaths - the second-highest toll in the world after the US. It also has the third-highest number of coronavirus cases at more than 16 million. Saturday's protests piled further pressure on Mr Bolsonaro as Brazil's Senate holds an inquiry into his government's handling of the pandemic and the slow roll-out of the vaccine programme. Opposition parties, trade unions and social movements accuse Mr Bolsonaro of stalling the programme and disregarding the consequences. Opponents of Jair Bolsonaro blame him for the slow response to the Covid crisis There was a large anti-government rally in Rio de Janeiro The high number of cases has brought the country's health system to the verge of collapse. The far-right leader has consistently opposed lockdown measures, arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the coronavirus itself. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Political crisis and Covid surge rock Brazil What is the Brazil variant and do vaccines work against it? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? In Brasilia, protesters marched alongside a giant plastic doll of the president. Placards demanded his impeachment and called for more vaccines and emergency financial aid. There were also calls to better protect indigenous people and to stop deforestation of the Amazon. Protesters in Brasilia had a wide-range of grievances against the government In Recife, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters who tried to march down a closed road, local media reported. In some cities, demonstrators laid thousands of symbolic crosses in tribute to those who died in the pandemic. On Thursday,  the head of Brazil's prestigious Butantan Institute told a Senate committee that President Bolsonaro's actions delayed the start of the vaccination programme, the Spanish news agency Efe reports. Dr Dimas Covas said that in August last year, Butantan offered to supply the government with 100 million doses of the CoronaVac vaccine, which the institute manufactures under licence from China's Sinovac. He said the proposal included a pledge to deliver the first five million doses by the beginning of December. In Brasilia, protesters marched to Congress where the Senate is investigating the government's response to the pandemic But a day after Butantan's offer, Mr Bolsonaro vowed that his government would ""never"" buy a Chinese vaccine, Dr Covas said. ""We could have been the first country in the world to vaccinate,"" he told the committee. Had the offer been accepted, Butantan would have been able to deliver 100 million doses by 30 March this year, Dr Covas added. Instead, Brazil has so far received a total of 46 million doses, due in part to shortages of raw materials amid the global scramble to obtain vaccines. Only 10% of the adult population has received the two required doses. Earlier in the inquiry, Pfizer's top executive for Latin America, Carlos Murillo, told the Senate committee that Mr Bolsonaro's government never responded to an offer that would have seen 1.5 million doses of the US pharmaceutical giant's vaccine reach Brazil last December.

"PM marries Carrie Symonds at Westminster CathedralDowning Street says the wedding took place on Saturday afternoon ""in a small ceremony"".UK","Boris Johnson and Carrie Symonds in the garden of 10 Downing Street after their wedding Prime Minister Boris Johnson has married his fiancee Carrie Symonds in a secretly-planned wedding at Westminster Cathedral. The marriage took place in a ""small ceremony"" on Saturday afternoon, a Downing Street spokesman said. The spokesman added that the couple would celebrate again with family and friends next summer, with their honeymoon also delayed until then. The prime minister has already returned to work. He is the first PM to get married while in office in nearly 200 years. The Mail on Sunday reported,externalthat 30 guests were invited to the ceremony at short notice - the maximum number of attendees allowed under Covid restrictions in England. A small number of church officials were involved in preparations for the Catholic ceremony, which was officiated by Father Daniel Humphreys, it said. Although Mr Johnson, 56, has been married twice before, the Roman Catholic Church can allow divorcees to remarry if the previous marriages were outside the Roman Catholic Church. Boris Johnson likes to avoid talking about his private life - he's declined to answer questions on the topic for the past few years. It can't have been easy to keep yesterday's wedding - between a former journalist and someone who works in public relations - under wraps. But it seems to have taken almost everyone in Westminster by surprise. Such was the desire to keep it quiet, Downing Street only officially confirmed it had happened on Sunday morning - the day after the wedding. Christopher Lamb, Rome correspondent for Catholic magazine The Tablet, told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""There will be a feeling that, why are some people who are divorced allowed to be married in the church and others not? ""And I think that's where the Church, I think, can look at its current rules and see how it can become more welcoming. It has been welcoming to Boris Johnson, why not to others?"" Who is Carrie Symonds? Father Mark Drew, assistant priest at St Joseph's Church in Penketh, Warrington, said he has previously had to tell Catholic couples going through a divorce they are not able to remarry in the Church. ""It looks to them - rightly or wrongly - as if the Church is applying double standards and I do fear that this decision does make the Church look bad."" Just one official photograph has been released - the day after the wedding - showing the couple in the garden at 10 Downing Street in the hours following the ceremony. However, Conservative MP James Cleverly shared a different photograph of the newlyweds enjoying their garden reception in the Saturday sunshine, with decorations and a table of refreshments visible in the background. At this stage in the day's proceedings, Mrs Johnson is seen barefoot and her husband has dispensed with his jacket and tie. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Downing Street did not reveal any details of who was invited and whether any of Mr Johnson's Cabinet colleagues were among the guests. Several politicians have congratulated the couple, including Home Secretary Priti Patel, Health Secretary Matt Hancock, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi and Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey. Ms Patel wrote on Twitter: ""Many Congratulations to Mr & Mrs Johnson @BorisJohnson and @CarrieSymonds. Wishing you both much love and happiness."" Musicians were pictured leaving No 10 on Saturday night. People carrying musical instruments were seen leaving Downing Street on Saturday evening Members of the public were asked to leave Westminster Cathedral just after 13:30 BST,the Sun reported.,external The new Mrs Johnson - who has confirmed she will take her husband's surname -  wore a white dress to exchange vows with the prime minister. Her wedding dress was designed by Athens-based Christos Costarellos, who studied at the London College of Fashion anddescribes his work,externalas being ""inspired by the spirit of ancient Greek philosophy"". The last prime minister to get married while in office was Robert Banks Jenkinson in 1822. Mrs Johnson used to work in the Conservative Party press office, which she joined in 2010, and two years later she worked on Mr Johnson's successful campaign to be re-elected as mayor in London. She became the party's head of communications before leaving in 2018 to work in public relations for marine conservation organisation Oceana. Mrs Johnson then became head of communications for conservation group the Aspinall Foundation in January. The couple were first romantically linked by the media in early 2019.  In February 2020, theyrevealed that they were engagedand that she was pregnant. Their son, Wilfred,was born last April. Mr Johnson and his previous wife, Marina Wheeler,announced in 2018that they were divorcing after 25 years of marriage. He was previously married to Allegra Mostyn-Owen.

About 7.3 million people are currently eligible for vaccination - that is everyone aged 30 and over - in the country of 10.7 million people. So far, more than 3.7 million of them have received a first dose, and more than 1.4 million are fully vaccinated.

He calls it ""another big day""on Twitter,external, saying more than 65.5 million vaccine doses have now been delivered in the UK, with 25.3 million adults protected with two doses.

The number of single people in Bristol requiring temporary housing more than tripled during the pandemic, the city's head of housing options says. Paul Sylvester describes the 330% increase during the past year as ""absolutely massive"". Families with children in temporary accommodation went up by 11%, but the number of rough sleepers fell. Sylvester says homelessness surged after each lockdown, with the biggest rise after the third, as coronavirus took its toll on families and relationships. The number of people made homeless because they were told to leave by family or friends doubled during the past 12 months, he says.

He tells BBC Scotland's The Sunday Show the decision relies on people sustaining ""the very good engagement"" seen over the weekend with the vaccination programme.

As we heard earlier, vaccines minister Nadhim Zahawi has said it would be ""irresponsible"" of the government not to consider mandatory vaccinations for NHS staff.

Two-thirds of big retailers expect to face legal action from their landlords when a suspension of aggressive debt collection ends in June, a survey says. Many shops have been shut for long periods due to coronavirus restrictions in the UK, accruing Â£2.9bn in rental arrears, according to the British Retail Consortium. The BRC says a rush to collect could lead to a ""tsunami of closures"" and is urging the government to act. The government introduced a code of practice last year to address the outstanding debt issues. It also put curbs on aggressive debt collection practices until 30 June. But of the 24 major retailers surveyed - who account for more than 5,000 UK stores - two-thirds described the code as ""ineffective"" because it is voluntary. Read morehere. More than two million Scots are now fully vaccinated against coronavirus. Figures released today show 2,022,728 people have received both doses of a vaccine after 24,319 were jabbed in the latest 24-hour period.

Aleksandra Zadroga swapped hospitality for the recruitment industry after returning from furlough While customers have enthusiastically returned to reopened bars and restaurants, the same is not necessarily true for staff. More than one in 10 UK hospitality workers has left the industry in the past year, and vacancies have soared while applications slumped. Several former hospitality workers are blaming the financial impact of lockdown and furlough. Aleksandra Zadroga, who used to work in a restaurant, says being on furlough has given many a ""push"" to quit. Industry body UK Hospitality says venues are struggling to fill thousands of jobs.

The authorities have today recorded more than 4,500 new cases of the virus, with almost half of them inside prisons. At least 22,000 prisoners have tested positive for coronavirus since the government first began releasing figures a month ago. Thailand's justice minister says each prisoner is allocated less room than the inside of a coffin, and he says he is exploring ways to release convicts if they have underlying medical conditions.

Fisher says the WHO has asked countries for any evidence they have and he says it is disappointing to read reports the US and now others may have intelligence to suggest a lab leak occurred.

Scotland's deputy first minister says he expects Covid restrictions in Glasgow to be eased before the Euro 2020 tournament comes to the city. John Swinney tells BBC Scotland's Sunday Show the intention is to lift Glasgow out of level three as soon as possible, likely by the end of this week. Glasgow is currently the only area of Scotland that is subject to tougher level three restrictions. This means people are not allowed to meet in each other's homes, and pubs and restaurants are not able to sell alcohol indoors. Non-essential travel in and out of the city is also prohibited. Glasgow is due to host a football fan zone for 6,000 supporters from 11 June. Swinney says the extra measure appeared to be having an impact on stemming Covid rates rates in the city, which have been among the highest in Scotland. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

""But we ought to be able to explain and encourage and make people understand why vaccination is the right thing to do and make sure that people are working in an environment that is safe for them."" Two-thirds of big retailers expect to face legal action from their landlords when a suspension of aggressive debt collection ends in June, a survey says. Many shops have been shut for long periods due to coronavirus restrictions in the UK, accruing Â£2.9bn in rental arrears, according to the British Retail Consortium. The BRC says a rush to collect could lead to a ""tsunami of closures"" and is urging the government to act. The government introduced a code of practice last year to address the outstanding debt issues. It also put curbs on aggressive debt collection practices until 30 June. But of the 24 major retailers surveyed - who account for more than 5,000 UK stores - two-thirds described the code as ""ineffective"" because it is voluntary. Read morehere.

Aleksandra Zadroga swapped hospitality for the recruitment industry after returning from furlough While customers have enthusiastically returned to reopened bars and restaurants, the same is not necessarily true for staff. More than one in 10 UK hospitality workers has left the industry in the past year, and vacancies have soared while applications slumped. Several former hospitality workers are blaming the financial impact of lockdown and furlough. Aleksandra Zadroga, who used to work in a restaurant, says being on furlough has given many a ""push"" to quit. Industry body UK Hospitality says venues are struggling to fill thousands of jobs.

The authorities have today recorded more than 4,500 new cases of the virus, with almost half of them inside prisons. At least 22,000 prisoners have tested positive for coronavirus since the government first began releasing figures a month ago. Thailand's justice minister says each prisoner is allocated less room than the inside of a coffin, and he says he is exploring ways to release convicts if they have underlying medical conditions.

This video can not be played Teaching post-Covid patients to breathe Most of this year's Premier and Champions League games have been played in empty stadiums due to coronavirus restrictions. But last night's gripping Champions League final between Manchester City and Chelsea reminded fans of the thrill of live sport - with 6,000 followers of each team in attendance in Porto, Portugal. Aleksander Ceferin, the Uefa president, says the event ""was a great success"". He adds: ""The organisation and co-operation of the Portuguese FA and the local and national authorities was exemplary but the whole occasion was made so much more special because at last we had fans back, cheering their teams on and giving us the reminder of what a beautiful occasion it is. âThis game, watched by millions all around the world, has given everyone hope and a glimpse of light at the end of this very dark tunnel that has dictated our lives for so long. Normality is slowly returning and we can all celebrate that. âChelsea were worthy winners.â BBC Radio 4 Prof Dale Fisher, a member of the first World Health Organization (WHO) team to visit China last year, has said the theory the coronavirus leaked from a Wuhan lab is ""not off the table"" but lacks credibility so far. He tells BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend he does not give claims the virus escaped from the Wuhan Institute of Virology ""any credibility until it's validated"". Fisher says the WHO has asked countries for any evidence they have and he says it is disappointing to read reports the US and now others may have intelligence to suggest a lab leak occurred. It follows a Wall Street Journal report saying several Insititute of Virology workers were hospitalised with virus symptoms in November 2019. ""The only evidence in my mind for there being a lab leak is that there was a lab... but really the lab-leak theory is not off the table and there is more work to be done,"" Fisher says. Scotland's deputy first minister says he expects Covid restrictions in Glasgow to be eased before the Euro 2020 tournament comes to the city. John Swinney tells BBC Scotland's Sunday Show the intention is to lift Glasgow out of level three as soon as possible, likely by the end of this week. Glasgow is currently the only area of Scotland that is subject to tougher level three restrictions. This means people are not allowed to meet in each other's homes, and pubs and restaurants are not able to sell alcohol indoors. Non-essential travel in and out of the city is also prohibited. Glasgow is due to host a football fan zone for 6,000 supporters from 11 June. Swinney says the extra measure appeared to be having an impact on stemming Covid rates rates in the city, which have been among the highest in Scotland. Read more Â© 2025 BBC.

4.7 million waiting for operations,"Around 4.7 million people were waiting for routine operations and procedures in England in February - the most since 2007, NHS England figures show. Nearly 388,000 people were waiting more than a year for non-urgent surgery compared with just 1,600 before the pandemic began. During January and February, the pressure on hospitals caused by Covid-19 was particularly acute. NHS England said two million operations took place despite the winter peak. However, surgeons said hospitals were still under huge pressure due to the second wave of Covid, which had led to ""a year of uncertainty, pain and isolation"" for patients waiting for planned treatment. Speaking on a visit to Dartmouth, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the government would ""make sure that we give the NHS all the funding that it needs... to beat the backlog"". He said the situation had been ""made worse by Covid"", and added: ""We do need people to take up their appointments and to get the treatment that they need."" NHS England recently announced that a Â£1bn fund would be used to help trusts restore operations and other services to get as many people treated as possible. NHS waits at record high as second wave hits care Hospital waiting list 'may double to 10m by April' Year-long routine surgery waits 'worst since 2008' Professor Stephen Powis, national medical director for the NHS in England, said treating 400,000 patients with Covid-19 over the course of the last year had ""inevitably had an impact on the NHS"". Around 40% of all patients who have received hospital treatment for Covid since the pandemic began were admitted in the first two months of the year. But he said ""the hard work and dedication of staff"" helped to deliver almost two million operations and procedures ""in the face of the winter wave"". Tim Mitchell, vice-president of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said: ""Although the most urgent operations, for cancer and life-threatening conditions went ahead, hundreds of thousands of patients waiting for routine surgery such as hip and knee operations, cochlear implants and vascular operations had their treatment cancelled or postponed. ""People have been patient as they've seen the battering the pandemic has given the NHS, but how much longer can they be expected to wait?"" Surgeons are calling for massive investment in the health service so that vital operations can continue no matter what comes its way in the future.  4.7 millionPeople waiting for routine operations and procedures in February - highest since records began in 2007 387,885People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in February 304,000People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment the previous month 1,613People waiting more than 52 weeks to start hospital treatment in February last year 400,000Patients with Covid-19 needing hospital treatment over the last year Zen Khan had an operation on his pancreas postponed three times Zen Kahn, from London, spent much of the past year in pain waiting for a vital, but not urgent, operation to remove a mass on his pancreas. The 23-year-old, who has severe learning difficulties and mental health issues, was originally told he would have surgery in September 2020 - but in the end he waited until March 2021. ""He was losing weight, turning yellow, and getting weaker and weaker,"" his older brother Waqas says of that time. Zen continued to be in pain and was on strong painkillers for a long time. ""It definitely affected my mum a lot - she was completely devastated,"" his brother says. ""Just to see him deteriorate daily, it was hard on us as a family."" Dr Katie Urch, divisional director of surgery at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust, where Zen was treated, said surgery that was ""absolutely time-critical"" was prioritised. ""As our services begin to resume, our clinical teams are constantly reviewing our waiting lists to ensure we're managing care as safely and effectively as possible,"" she said. Zen finally had surgery at the end of March The full scale of the backlog of non-Covid work which has built up because hospitals had to focus on coronavirus patients has been laid bare again. Things are likely to get worse before they get better as the NHS tries to deal with new patients being referred for treatment as well as those already on waiting lists. There is no obvious quick fix. The workforce is already over-stretched and training more staff takes years. The government has allocated some extra cash to the NHS in England to try to help deal with the backlog. But there have been calls for significant extra investment to fund overtime payments and make maximum seven-days-a-week use of operating theatres. There have been warnings that the NHS in all parts of the UK will take years to recover from the consequences of Covid care and longer-term plans to expand the workforce and build new hospital facilities will be needed soon. Cancer figures for England show that the number of people starting treatment for the disease in February 2021 was 6% lower compared with the same time last year. Although there has been a slight improvement in the numbers referred to a cancer specialist by their GP since January, the total number over the past year is more than 370,000 down on normal, Macmillan Cancer Support said. Sara Bainbridge, head of policy at the charity said: ""Tens of thousands of people are still missing a diagnosis due to disruption caused by the pandemic, which could affect their prognosis. ""It's vital that cancer services continue to be prioritised and that those with cancer are not forgotten."" Cancer Research UK said without the funding and resources the NHS needs, ""the UK faces the prospect of cancer survival going backwards for the first time in decades"".

Brazil protesters blame Bolsonaro for Covid crisis,"Protesters in Brasilia carried a huge puppet of Jair Bolsonaro Protests have taken place across Brazil over the management of the Covid-19 crisis by the government of President Jair Bolsonaro. In the capital, Brasilia, thousands gathered in front of Congress calling for the president's impeachment, and demanding more vaccines. Demonstrations took place in other major cities, including Rio de Janeiro. Mr Bolsonaro's popularity has plummeted over his response to the pandemic. Brazil has registered nearly 460,000 deaths - the second-highest toll in the world after the US. It also has the third-highest number of coronavirus cases at more than 16 million. Saturday's protests piled further pressure on Mr Bolsonaro as Brazil's Senate holds an inquiry into his government's handling of the pandemic and the slow roll-out of the vaccine programme. Opposition parties, trade unions and social movements accuse Mr Bolsonaro of stalling the programme and disregarding the consequences. Opponents of Jair Bolsonaro blame him for the slow response to the Covid crisis There was a large anti-government rally in Rio de Janeiro The high number of cases has brought the country's health system to the verge of collapse. The far-right leader has consistently opposed lockdown measures, arguing that the damage to the economy would be worse than the effects of the coronavirus itself. He has also told Brazilians to ""stop whining"" about the situation. Political crisis and Covid surge rock Brazil What is the Brazil variant and do vaccines work against it? Covid vaccines: How fast is worldwide progress? In Brasilia, protesters marched alongside a giant plastic doll of the president. Placards demanded his impeachment and called for more vaccines and emergency financial aid. There were also calls to better protect indigenous people and to stop deforestation of the Amazon. Protesters in Brasilia had a wide-range of grievances against the government In Recife, police fired rubber bullets and tear gas at protesters who tried to march down a closed road, local media reported. In some cities, demonstrators laid thousands of symbolic crosses in tribute to those who died in the pandemic. On Thursday,  the head of Brazil's prestigious Butantan Institute told a Senate committee that President Bolsonaro's actions delayed the start of the vaccination programme, the Spanish news agency Efe reports. Dr Dimas Covas said that in August last year, Butantan offered to supply the government with 100 million doses of the CoronaVac vaccine, which the institute manufactures under licence from China's Sinovac. He said the proposal included a pledge to deliver the first five million doses by the beginning of December. In Brasilia, protesters marched to Congress where the Senate is investigating the government's response to the pandemic But a day after Butantan's offer, Mr Bolsonaro vowed that his government would ""never"" buy a Chinese vaccine, Dr Covas said. ""We could have been the first country in the world to vaccinate,"" he told the committee. Had the offer been accepted, Butantan would have been able to deliver 100 million doses by 30 March this year, Dr Covas added. Instead, Brazil has so far received a total of 46 million doses, due in part to shortages of raw materials amid the global scramble to obtain vaccines. Only 10% of the adult population has received the two required doses. Earlier in the inquiry, Pfizer's top executive for Latin America, Carlos Murillo, told the Senate committee that Mr Bolsonaro's government never responded to an offer that would have seen 1.5 million doses of the US pharmaceutical giant's vaccine reach Brazil last December.

Senior MP demands answers for leaseholdersClive Betts asks why guidance for leaseholders selling or remortgaging flats is not being followed.Business,"Leaseholder Jie Shen says he's unable to sell his flat in Leicester despite new guidance that should make it possible MP Clive Betts has written to the government to ask whynew guidance,externaldesigned to help about 500,000 leaseholders sell or remortgage their flats is not being followed. It was issued by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (RICS)in March. It is supposed to help surveyors decide which tower blocks need extra fire safety checks. But although mortgage providers were consulted on the guidance, Money Box has found some lenders are ignoring it. The extra checks are called an Exterior Wall System form, or EWS1, and were introduced in the wake of theGrenfell Tower firein which 72 people died. That form is supposed to provide assurance for buyers, sellers and, crucially, mortgage providers about whether or not a flat is safe to buy, sell, or lend against, depending on whether it has flammable cladding, vertically stacked balconies or other issues. But Money Box listener Jie Shen, who is trying to provide for his retirement, is selling a flat which has neither of those problems. He says three separate mortgage providers have turned down his prospective buyer because Jie's building doesn't have an EWS1 form - even though the RICS guidance says it doesn't need one. ""I feel like I'm trapped into this situation. I can't move on with my life, I'm just locked into this and I don't know how to resolve this,"" he says. ""I think the mortgage lenders should follow the advice from RICS and shouldn't insist on an EWS1 form [for a building] that does not contain flammable cladding. ""I just don't understand why the mortgage provider insists on this - it's just bureaucracy."" Another complication for Jie, and many others like him, is that getting an EWS1 form is not in his power, even if he wanted to get one. He is a leaseholder and the decision to pay for the survey needed to get the form lies entirely with the freeholder who owns his building. In Jie's case, the management company of his building, representing the freeholder, has quoted the RICS guidance to show the building should not require an EWS1 form, leaving Jie utterly stuck. But Jie's buyer has been turned down by three mortgage providers exactly because he doesn't have an EWS1 form. And so it goes round and round, with Jie left in limbo. It's hearing about cases like Jie's that has made Mr Betts act. Writing to the Secretary of State for Housing, Robert Jenrick, Mr Betts, while recognising that the EWS1 is ""a process led by industry"", has asked two key questions on behalf of the Housing, Communities and Local Government committee, which he chairs: The ways in which the government is supporting the implementation of the new guidance from RICS The actions that the government plans to take in the event that mortgage lenders continue to insist that EWS1 forms are obtained for buildings that do not meet RICS criteria. He has requested answers by the end of May. Mr Betts has also asked people who find themselves in the same position as Jie - when the RICS guidance shows their tower block doesn't need an EWS1, but when lenders are insisting on one - to email the committee at ""hclgcom@parliament.uk"". Speaking to Money Box after hearing about Jie's case, Mr Betts said: ""The system was set up with the lending industry and the surveying industry to work together to give reassurance to lenders. That's its whole purpose. ""So if it isn't giving reassurance to lenders to lend on buildings which the system says don't need a certificate... then the system is a complete failure and it needs taking up with both RICS and the lenders, so it doesn't leave people stranded in homes that they can't sell and can't remortgage."" UK Finance, which represents nearly 300 banks, building societies and mortgage providers, says it's supportive of the guidance but it's down to individual lenders whether or not they implement it, based on their own risk appetite. It also told Money Box that while lenders instruct valuers to complete property valuations, it's the valuers who determine whether or not EWS1 forms are required. The Department for Housing, Communities and Local Government told Money Box it wanted to encourage ""a sensible, proportionate approach to risk and for lenders to accept alternative forms of assurance"", adding that it was investing Â£5bn to help protect leaseholders from the cost of replacing unsafe cladding on their homes.

How rising patient numbers threaten to overwhelm GPs,"Rising numbers of patients needing care and a shortage of GPs is threatening to overwhelm the system, doctors and patient groups are warning. It comes after the pandemic has caused severe disruption to GP practices for more than a year. Analysis of NHS England data by the Health Foundation found more than 28 million appointments were booked in March, among the highest recorded. Doctors' leaders say what they are being asked to achieve is ""undoable"". The analysis of NHS Digital data in England carried out by the Health Foundation for the BBC also found that that between 2019-20 and 2020-21: The total number of appointments dropped by 10% - meaning 31 million fewer consultations with GPs and practice nurses Major shift from face-to-face to remote consultation, with the proportion seen in practices dropping from 79% to 54% The number of patients referred by GPs for urgent cancer check-ups dropped by 15%, putting lives at risk The escalating situation has prompted patient groups to call for an urgent review of access to services, amid reports that patients are struggling to get through. This video can not be played Dr Dean Eggitt, a GP in Doncaster, opened his doors to the BBC to show the pressures facing practices Doncaster-based GP Dr Dean Eggitt has never seen anything like this: ""We have almost a tsunami of patients coming to us - it feels like the river has flooded the banks. ""It just keeps coming and coming and coming in this one massive, endless wave of patients who all are ill and need help and input. ""They're sick, they're complex and we've got very few places to send them. I wouldn't want to be my patient right now."" Dr Eggitt's experience is not unique. There were 28.4 million appointments in March, once you include those made with practice nurses as well as GPs - that is one of the highest on record. But he says he worries most about the ""hidden wave of patients who don't get through"". One of those is Sharron, who ended up in hospital after she struggled on at home for weeks getting more and more sick. She was eventually diagnosed with colitis and had lost so much blood, she needed four emergency blood transfusions. She says a combination of busy phone lines and not wanting to bother the practice meant she deteriorated at home. ""When I finally got through I knew I was really poorly, I had never felt so ill in my life."" She was immediately invited in for a consultation and sent to hospital. There could be millions of people in a similar position. There were 279 million appointments made with GP practices in England from April 2020 to March 2021, compared with 310 million the year before. The biggest drops were seen in the Midlands, North East, Yorkshire and East of England, according to the Health Foundation analysis. The data is not collected elsewhere in the UK, but the reports surfacing suggest the problems are similar. That has, the Health Foundation warns, created a huge amount of unmet need. This much can be seen from the drop in urgent referrals where GPs suspect someone has cancer. The numbers sent to hospital for check-ups have dropped by 15% since the pandemic started - that's potentially 367,000 people with symptoms who have not been sent for further investigations. Sara Bainbridge, from Macmillan Cancer Support, says the disruption to services has had a ""devastating impact"", saying it is leading to fewer diagnoses, and reducing survival chances. And it's not just cancer patients. Dr Becks Fisher, a GP in Oxford and senior policy fellow at the Health Foundation, says there are people with other serious conditions, such as heart failure and non-Covid respiratory problems, who have stayed away too. ""Their health will have deteriorated as they have not been getting the help they need. The people we are seeing now are coming in with really complex problems. And it is those in deprived areas who have been affected the most."" She says this is being compounded by a significant rise in people seeking help with mental health problems, as well as those ""ricocheting"" back from hospital because their health has worsened while waiting for treatment. Latest figures show there are more than 400,000 people who have been waiting over a year for routine treatment, such as knee and hip replacements - up from 1,600 when the pandemic began. ""I think we are only seeing the tip of the iceberg at the moment - this is going to get a lot worse in the coming months"" added Dr Fisher. One of the key barriers, some say, is the lack of face-to-face care that is available. Social distancing restrictions and infection control procedures mean GPs have had to rely heavily on remote consultations. The number of face-to-face consultations has dropped significantly - down from 79% of total appointments in 2019-20 to 54% in 2020-21. And even now with restrictions easing, the numbers being brought in are still well short of what they were. One of those who has fallen foul of this is Helen Cowley, 55, from Swindon. She had a telephone consultation for ear pain and was advised to seek private treatment for the build-up of ear wax. When she got to the clinic, they diagnosed an ear infection and she had to phone her practice back. ""It was nearly two months before I got the proper treatment - and to be fair I thought it was ear wax too. It was obviously not the most serious problem in the world, but not being able to be seen face-to-face is not ideal. You can see how things can be missed and for some patients that may have huge consequences."" Patient watchdog Healthwatch England is particularly concerned about the lack of face-to-face appointments, and is calling for an urgent review into the situation. National Director Imelda Redmond said while remote consultations suit some patients, there are many who have struggled with the arrangements that have been put in place. ""Those affected are often the most vulnerable in our society - older people, disabled people, those affected by homelessness and on low incomes."" The issue has already prompted action at the highest level. NHS England wrote to GPs in mid-May saying patients must be offered face-to-face appointments if that is their preference, unless there was good reason not to, such as the patient displaying Covid symptoms. Extra funding has been provided too. But the move has been met with some opposition from GP leaders who have raised concerns about the lack of space in GP practice buildings, with the British Medical Association's GPs committee even passing a motion of no confidence in NHS England. BMA GP leader Dr Richard Vautrey says doctors were left ""angry, frustrated and disappointed"" by the letter, especially given the ""incredible contribution"" GPs have made to the vaccination programme - around three-quarters of jabs have been given in GP-led settings. In many ways, this is a problem that has been building for a while. There has been a big push in recent years by the government to increase the number of GPs to keep up with rising demand, but once you exclude locums and trainees the number of permanent GPs has actually fallen by nearly 2,000 in the past few years to just under 27,000 full-time GPs. Prof Martin Marshall, chairman of the Royal College of GPs, says it means what is being asked of the profession now is simply ""undoable"". ""General practice was already facing intense workforce and workload pressures - the pandemic has only exacerbated these. We urgently need more GPs and other members of the practice team.""
