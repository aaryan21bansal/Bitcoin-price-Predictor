"UK ivory ban to be 'toughest' in the worldAll sales of ivory products to be banned, regardless of their age, the environment secretary says.6m6 minutes agoUK","Prince William condemned illegal wildlife trading during a trip to China in 2015 A British ban on ivory sales is to be one of the toughest in the world, the environment secretary has said. Michael Gove said the sale of ivory of any age, with limited exceptions, will be banned in an effort to reduce elephant poaching. The move, which is still to be signed into law, comes after a consultation in which more than 60,000 people supported the introduction of a complete ban. Campaigners say about 20,000 elephants are killed each year for their tusks. Previous bans only applied to ivory produced after 1947. The new law is even tougher than the changes proposed in the October 2017 consultation. Prince William plea on ivory trade Animals poached in 'horrifying numbers' Can China's ban save elephants? Mr Gove added that the new law would ""reaffirm the UK's global leadership on this critical issue, demonstrating our belief that the abhorrent ivory trade should become a thing of the past"". He said: ""Ivory should never be seen as a commodity for financial gain or a status symbol."" Those breaking the ban by selling ivory will face a maximum penalty of five years in jail or an unlimited fine, said the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra). It added that the measure was tougher than rules in China and the US. The US currently bans ivory apart from items older than 100 years, as well as items with up to 50% ivory. The Chinese ban exempts ""relics"", with no specific date before which these must have been made. There will still be some exemptions to the ban, designed to provide ""balance to ensure people are not unfairly impacted"" and for ""items which do not contribute to the poaching of elephants"", the department said. These will include: Items comprising less than 10% ivory (by volume) and made before 1947. Musical instruments made before 1975 and comprising less than 20% ivory. Rare or important items, at least 100 years old, will be assessed by specialist institutions before exemption permits are issued. There will be specific exemptions for portrait miniatures painted on thin ivory bases and for commercial activity between accredited museums WWF chief executive Tanya Steele said the UK stance made it a ""global leader in tackling this bloody trade"" and called for ""global action"" to stop elephant poaching. This video can not be played Alastair Leithead on ivory trade Charlie Mayhew, chief executive of the Tusk Trust which funds conservation and environmental education across Africa, welcomed the announcement. ""The ban will ensure there is no value for modern day ivory and the tusks of recently poached elephants cannot enter the UK market,"" he said. Alexander Rhodes, founder of Stop Ivory, also praised the strength of the ban and its tighter regulations. He did however urge the EU to ""move fast"" as a bloc to address the issue. ""Since the UK government held the Illegal Wildlife Conference in 2014, the US and China have both enacted bans on their domestic ivory trade, so the UK doing this now is extraordinarily important,"" he said. ""The EU on the other hand has been very resistant - I am hopeful that the UK's strong position will lead to change.""

Soldier dies in 'tragic diving incident'L/Cpl George Partridge had joined the Army aged 19 and his wife is pregnant with their first child.11h11 hours agoEngland,"L/Cpl George Partridge was described as an ""exemplary soldier"" by his commanding officer A soldier has died in a ""tragic"" diving accident during the final week of his Army Diver Course. L/Cpl George Partridge died on 26 March at the National Dive Centre in Gloucestershire, the Ministry of Defence (MoD) said. The 27-year-old, whose wife is expecting their first child, was based with 26 Engineer Regiment in Wiltshire. An MoD spokesman said ""our thoughts are with his family and friends at this extremely difficult time"". Paying tribute, his commanding officer Lt Col Simon Doyle,externaldescribed him as ""quietly determined, hard-working and immensely popular"". ""Lance Corporal George Partridge was an exemplary soldier,"" he continued. ""Humble but hugely capable, he was always ready to lend a helping hand."" The National Diving and Activity Centre is a large flooded quarry at Tidenham, Gloucestershire L/Cpl Partridge joined the Army in June 2010 at the age of 19. His first years were spent at 21 Engineer Regiment in Ripon, north Yorkshire, where he qualified as a Class 1 Royal Engineer Driver and was deployed to Afghanistan. He also served in Canada after being promoted to 26 Engineer Regiment. The statement said L/Cpl Partridge had a long-held ambition to be an Army diver and had recently been selected for promotion to corporal. Armed Forces Minister Mark Lancaster said: ""It's clear from the testaments of his colleagues that he had a bright future in the Army and was held in the highest regard."" Cpl Anthony Matthews said his colleague was a ""role model"" who was ""looked up to"" and his peers ""would come to him for advice"". ""He was a family-orientated man who was looking forward to starting his family with wife Zoe. He was both a physically and mentally fit person who relished any challenge thrown in his direction,"" he added. L/Cpl George Partridge was stationed at the Wiltshire-based 26 Engineer Regiment The MoD said it was investigating how the ""tragic diving incident"" happened. The National Diving and Activity Centre is a large flooded quarry at Tidenham in Gloucestershire, near Chepstow in Monmouthshire. It was formerly Dayhouse Quarry, a source of limestone, which was flooded in 1996. The diving centre, which opened in 2003, is described as an inland scuba diving site and is popular with technical and free divers due to the depths of up to 80m (260ft).

'One-stop shops' for cancer diagnosisThe aim is to stop patients from being referred for several tests for different forms of the illness.9m9 minutes agoHealth,"The aim is for patients to get all the checks they need under one roof ""One-stop shops"" aimed at speeding up cancer diagnosis are being introduced across England. The aim is to catch the disease earlier and prevent patients from being referred for several tests for different forms of the illness. Patients often face delays when they have non-specific symptoms. NHS England says this is a ""step change"" in the way people with suspected cancer are diagnosed and treated. The rapid diagnosis and then treatment of cancer can be vital in saving lives. While cancer survival rates have improved dramatically over recent decades, patients who are not displaying very obvious signs of the illness sometimes struggle to access quickly the help they need. Those with more vague symptoms, such as unexplained weight loss, reduced appetite or abdominal pain can be referred several times for different tests for different cancers, all wasting valuable opportunities to start treatment. Other symptoms can include fatigue, unexplained sweats or generally feeling unwell. NHS England is now adopting an approach first developed in Denmark - introducing 10 specialist rapid diagnostic and assessment centres where patients will receive all the necessary investigations under one roof. Cally Palmer, national director for cancer at NHS England, says the new centres could play a key role in improving diagnosis and treatment. ""Early diagnosis is crucial to saving lives and providing peace of mind for patients, which is why we are driving forward plans to revolutionise our approach to cancer in this country,"" she said. ""These new one-stop shops represent a real step change in the way people with unclear symptoms are identified, diagnosed and treated."" NHS England has developed the centres in collaboration with the cancer charities Macmillan and Cancer Research UK. Sara Hiom,  director of early diagnosis at CRUK, said: ""We're confident that these 10 pilot centres will give us a much better understanding of what's needed to speed up the diagnosis and treatment of people with less obvious symptoms, improve their experience of care and, ultimately, survival rates. ""This is a first for this country and Cancer Research UK is delighted to be partnering with NHS England in this innovative initiative. ""The knowledge gained will support others looking to roll out similar approaches in future."" The new centres will be spread across England, with the first 10 being located at: Royal Free Hospital, London North Middlesex Hospital, London, University College Hospitals London Southend University Hospital Queens Hospital, Romford St James University Hospital, Leeds Airedale General Hospital, West Yorkshire University Hospital, South Manchester Royal Oldham Hospital, Greater Manchester Churchill Hospital, Oxford The aim is that every patient is either diagnosed or given the all-clear within 28 days. If the project is a success, more of the centres will be established across England.

UK-led space junk mission sent into orbit,"Artwork: The RemoveDebris mission will trial the net method of capture A UK-led experiment to tackle space junk has been sent into orbit. It takes the form of a small satellite that will practise techniques for tracking debris and capturing it. TheRemoveDebris,externalsystem is heading to the International Space Station where astronauts are expected to set the experiment running in late May. Space junk is an ever-growing problem with more than 7,500 tonnes of redundant hardware now thought to be circling the Earth. Ranging from old rocket bodies and defunct spacecraft through to screws and even flecks of paint - this material poses a collision hazard to operational missions. RemoveDebris will showcase technologies that could be used to clean up some of this techno-garbage. The 100kg demonstrator left Earth on Monday onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.  It should arrive at the ISS on Wednesday. China space lab comes down over South Pacific Big harpoon is 'solution to space junk' Old satellites will need 'rapid disposal' This video can not be played The junk hardware in orbit represents a collision hazard The satellite was assembled at Surrey Satellite Technology Limited The satellite will be stored at the station for a number of weeks, before being released by the orbiting platform's robotic arm to begin a series of manoeuvres. RemoveDebris carries its own ""junk"" - two small cubesats that it will eject and then track. For one of these, the ""mother"" satellite will demonstrate the laser ranging (Lidar) and camera technology needed to monitor and characterise debris in orbit; for the the other cubesat, it will actually try to snare the object with a net. There will also be a demonstration of a  small harpoon. The RemoveDebris satellite will extend a boom with a target on the end. The sharp projectile will be fired at this to learn more about how such devices move and impact a surface in micro-gravity. At the end of its mission, RemoveDebris will deploy a large membrane. This ""sail"" will increase the drag from air molecules high in the atmosphere and act to pull the satellite down to Earth much faster than would otherwise be the case. The miniature harpoon to be tested on the mission The project, which draws on expertise from across Europe, is led from the University of Surrey's Space Centre. Its principal investigator is Prof Guglielmo Aglietti. He said the jury was still out on the best way to capture and remove space junk. ""As you know, there are other people who are going with the idea of a robotic arm. All these different technologies have their advantages and disadvantages,"" he told BBC News. ""For example, the ones we are testing - the net and the harpoon - are simple and low cost, but could be considered more risky in certain circumstances than a robotic arm. ""On the other hand, if your piece of debris is spinning very fast, it becomes very difficult to capture it with a robotic arm and an approach with a net could work better."" He added: ""The reason we are doing this mission this way is because it is low cost. In my opinion, whether or not there are going to be real missions to remove debris will depend on cost. And I worry that if they are extremely expensive, people will think about other priorities."" Artwork: The satellite should be deployed by the station's robotic arm in May The entire RemoveDebris project is costing â¬15m (Â£13m). Half of this is coming from the European Commission; the other half is coming from the 10 partners involved. These include Airbus, which supplied the harpoon technology, and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, which assembled the spacecraft. The mission has been organised through NanoRacks, a Houston, US, company that specialises in deploying small satellites from the space station.

French rail strike set to test Macron,"This video can not be played Strikers held a protest inside Gare du Nord station in Paris France's rail network has been severely disrupted, as a wave of strikes against President Emmanuel Macron's labour reforms gets under way. The start of the strike has been dubbed ""Black Tuesday"", but the action will spread over three months, affecting two days in every five. Staff at state railway SNCF are leading the strike, but the energy and waste collection sectors are also affected. The unrest presents Mr Macron's biggest challenge since his election last May. The unions say some of the plans to overhaul the heavily indebted SNCF would pave the way for its privatisation. But Prime Minister Ãdouard Philippe denied this, saying the proposals aim to change the status quo that was ""no longer tenable"". In parliament, he added: ""If the strikers are to be respected, the millions of French people who want to go to work, because they have no choice, because they want to go to work, must also be respected."" SNCF warned that major disruptions were expected on Wednesday. With the four main rail unions observing the strike, services have been severely curtailed. Some 77% of SNCF drivers were believed to be on strike. The company said 34% of its staff overall were striking. Only one in eight high-speed TGVs is scheduled to run,externalwhile only one in five regional trains is operating. Commuter lines into Paris have also been slashed and bus services have been hugely overcrowded. Some stations were crammed for the few trains available, others were deserted. The website that measures car traffic around the capital,externalrecorded about 420km (260 miles) of jams at rush hour. How this could affect your train journey (in French),external International services are more sketchily affected.Eurostar,externalhas 75% of trains running and the Thalys services to Belgium, the Netherlands and Germany are almost normal, but there are no services to Spain, Switzerland or Italy. Riot police and protesters clashed in Paris Employees of Air France, who are demanding a 6% pay rise, are into the fourth day of industrial action. The airline is operating 75% of its flights. Travellers across Europe suffered more disruption as up to 15,000 flights across the continent were facing delays due to a technical problem. Eurocontrol, which runs the EU's air traffic system,said the fault in the system had been identifiedand that moves were under way to return the situation to normal. Unions have also called out all rubbish collectors, to push for the creation of a national collection service and better retirement options. Workers blockaded some waste treatment plants. Energy sector unions have also called strikes to demand, among other things, an end to the liberalisation of the energy markets and a review of deregulation. Thousands of students are also reportedly taking part in the strikes, in opposition to the toughening up of university entry regulations. Analysis by the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris There are three reasons why President Macron feels relatively optimistic about the rail strike. First, unlike in the last massive (and successful) general strike in 1995, this time there can have been no mistaking the government's intention to reform. Neither the public nor SNCF staff can pretend the planned changes come out of the blue. They are clearly part of the broad reform agenda for which Mr Macron was elected. Second, there is far less automatic sympathy for the SNCF than there used to be. The level of rail services has declined sharply, especially for commuters, who are as a result more open to calls for reform. Third, new options have opened up for commuters. There is home-working; car-pooling; expanded coach services. This should make it easier for workers to get round the inconvenience. All that said, these will be tense weeks for the government. Nerves are going to fray. People will get angry. Daily life will not be easy. In these circumstances, plans can go badly awry. A wrong move and public opinion could easily shift back behind the strikers. SNCF workers enjoy generous conditions, including automatic annual pay rises, early retirement, 28 days of paid annual leave and protection from dismissal. Their close relatives are also entitled to free rail tickets. The Macron government wants to phase out the special SNCF contracts, proposing to put new hires on contracts like those that apply elsewhere in industry. Platforms at Gare de Lyon station in Paris got crowded in the morning The aim is to open up the state railways to competition from 2023, in line with EU requirements. SNCF has â¬46.6bn ($57.5bn; Â£40bn) of debt. French unions strike over labour reforms Macron launches overhaul of labour laws Macron's meteoric rise - in-depth analysis The rail unions also feel their action goes beyond rail workers' conditions and marks a major test of union clout. Just over 11% of the French workforce is unionised - one of the lowest levels in the EU - but the unions traditionally punch above their weight, economically and politically. ""We're defending the French public service, not just rail workers,"" said Emmanuel Grondein, head of union Sud Rail. But Gare du Nord was empty Mr Macron's Republic On The Move party also feels the strike has wider connotations. ""We need to rid this country of its strike culture,"" spokesman Gabriel Attal said. Opposition to Mr Macron's agenda was shown on 22 March, whentens of thousands of teachers, nurses and other workers joined rail staff on strike. The BBC's Lucy Williamson in Paris says many union members see Mr Macron as the man who wants to break the power of the unions. But strikes in September failed to stop Mr Macron passing laws that make it easier for firms to hire and fire, and the majority of the public are opposed to industrial action this time.

UK-led space junk mission sent into orbitA UK-led project aims to showcase how space debris could be removed from orbit.7m8 minutes agoScience & Environment,"Artwork: The RemoveDebris mission will trial the net method of capture A UK-led experiment to tackle space junk has been sent into orbit. It takes the form of a small satellite that will practise techniques for tracking debris and capturing it. TheRemoveDebris,externalsystem is heading to the International Space Station where astronauts are expected to set the experiment running in late May. Space junk is an ever-growing problem with more than 7,500 tonnes of redundant hardware now thought to be circling the Earth. Ranging from old rocket bodies and defunct spacecraft through to screws and even flecks of paint - this material poses a collision hazard to operational missions. RemoveDebris will showcase technologies that could be used to clean up some of this techno-garbage. The 100kg demonstrator left Earth on Monday onboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket.  It should arrive at the ISS on Wednesday. China space lab comes down over South Pacific Big harpoon is 'solution to space junk' Old satellites will need 'rapid disposal' This video can not be played The junk hardware in orbit represents a collision hazard The satellite was assembled at Surrey Satellite Technology Limited The satellite will be stored at the station for a number of weeks, before being released by the orbiting platform's robotic arm to begin a series of manoeuvres. RemoveDebris carries its own ""junk"" - two small cubesats that it will eject and then track. For one of these, the ""mother"" satellite will demonstrate the laser ranging (Lidar) and camera technology needed to monitor and characterise debris in orbit; for the the other cubesat, it will actually try to snare the object with a net. There will also be a demonstration of a  small harpoon. The RemoveDebris satellite will extend a boom with a target on the end. The sharp projectile will be fired at this to learn more about how such devices move and impact a surface in micro-gravity. At the end of its mission, RemoveDebris will deploy a large membrane. This ""sail"" will increase the drag from air molecules high in the atmosphere and act to pull the satellite down to Earth much faster than would otherwise be the case. The miniature harpoon to be tested on the mission The project, which draws on expertise from across Europe, is led from the University of Surrey's Space Centre. Its principal investigator is Prof Guglielmo Aglietti. He said the jury was still out on the best way to capture and remove space junk. ""As you know, there are other people who are going with the idea of a robotic arm. All these different technologies have their advantages and disadvantages,"" he told BBC News. ""For example, the ones we are testing - the net and the harpoon - are simple and low cost, but could be considered more risky in certain circumstances than a robotic arm. ""On the other hand, if your piece of debris is spinning very fast, it becomes very difficult to capture it with a robotic arm and an approach with a net could work better."" He added: ""The reason we are doing this mission this way is because it is low cost. In my opinion, whether or not there are going to be real missions to remove debris will depend on cost. And I worry that if they are extremely expensive, people will think about other priorities."" Artwork: The satellite should be deployed by the station's robotic arm in May The entire RemoveDebris project is costing â¬15m (Â£13m). Half of this is coming from the European Commission; the other half is coming from the 10 partners involved. These include Airbus, which supplied the harpoon technology, and Surrey Satellite Technology Limited, which assembled the spacecraft. The mission has been organised through NanoRacks, a Houston, US, company that specialises in deploying small satellites from the space station.

South Africa's Winnie Mandela dies at 81,"This video can not be played Who was Winnie Mandela? South African anti-apartheid campaigner and former first lady Winnie Madikizela-Mandela has died aged 81. She and her former husband Nelson Mandela, who were both jailed, were a symbol of the country's anti-apartheid struggle for three decades. However, in later years her reputation became tainted legally and politically. Crowds of mourners and political figures flocked to her home in Soweto, in Johannesburg, after news of her death broke. Obituary: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela Winnie Mandela in six quotes Naomie Harris: 'Winnie Mandela had an awful time' Nelson Mandela: The women who loved him Family spokesman Victor Dlamini confirmed earlier on Monday that Mrs Mandela ""succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones"" following a long illness, which had seen her go in and out of hospital since the start of the year. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was born in 1936 in what is now Eastern Cape province. She was a trained social worker when she met her future husband in the 1950s. They went on to have two daughters together. They were married for a total of 38 years, although for almost three decades of that time they were separated due to Mr Mandela's long imprisonment. This video can not be played ""I know my soul is scarred"": Winnie Mandela on her and Nelson's struggle It was Mrs Madikizela-Mandela who took his baton after he was jailed for life, becoming an international symbol of resistance to apartheid. She too was jailed for her role in the fight for justice and equality. To her supporters, she became known affectionately as ""Mother of the Nation"". In a televised address President Cyril Ramaphosa - praised by Mrs Madikizela-Mandela earlier this year - called her a ""voice of defiance"" against white-minority rule. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela outside court the day her husband was sentenced to life in prison ""In the face of exploitation, she was a champion of justice and equality,"" he said on Monday. ""She as an abiding symbol of the desire of our people to be free"". Retired archbishop and Nobel laureate Desmond Tutu said she was a ""defining symbol of the struggle against apartheid"". ""Her courageous defiance was deeply inspirational to me, and to generations of activists,"" he added. This video can not be played The BBC's Mike Wooldridge watches as Nelson Mandela is released from prison Energy Minister Jeff Radebe, reading out a statement on behalf of the family, paid tribute to ""a colossus who strode the Southern African political landscape"". ""As the ANC we dip our revolutionary banner in salute of this great icon of our liberation struggle,"" he said. ""The Mandela family are deeply grateful for the gift of her life and even as our hearts break at her passing we urge all those who loved her to celebrate this most remarkable South African woman."" African National Congress (ANC) chairperson Gwede Mantashe said: ""With the departure of Mama Winnie, [we have lost] one of the very few who are left of our stalwarts and icons. She was one of those who would tell us exactly what is wrong and right, and we are going to be missing that guidance."" This video can not be played Nobel Laureate Desmond Tutu and South African President Cyril Ramaphosa paid tribute to the 'Mother of the Nation"" Analysis by Milton Nkosi, BBC News, Johannesburg I knew Winnie Madikizela-Mandela personally. We come from the same neighbourhood in Soweto. To many, she was the pride and joy of the nation, an icon in her own right - never mind the fact she was Nelson Mandela's wife. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela was also the first black social worker in the country. Her love and desire to help those in need was always burning from deep inside. But she was not nothing but sweet talk. She met the brutality of racial segregation with fire. Each time the police came to arrest her at her home in Orlando West, she held her own. She never gave in. Not one inch - and sometimes, this landed her in trouble. As anti-apartheid activist Mosioua Lekota noted in her defence: ""Those who did nothing under apartheid never made mistakes."" She will be remembered for her fight against an inhumane system, rather than for the mistakes she made in that fight. However, Mrs Madikizela-Mandela found herself mired in scandal for decades. She was accused of conducting a virtual reign of terror in parts of Soweto by other members of the ANC in the late 1980s, and heard backing the practice of ""necklacing"" - putting burning tyres around suspected informants' necks. Winnie Madikizela-Mandela's life in pictures She was also found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to six years' imprisonment for her involvement in the death of 14-year-old township militant Stompie Seipei. She always denied the allegation, and the sentence was reduced to a fine. Mrs Madikizela-Mandela (pictured in 1988) became a symbol for the anti-apartheid movement in her own right Mr Mandela, who stood by her throughout the accusations, was finally released from prison in February 1990. But two years later, their marriage crumbled. The couple divorced in 1996, but she kept his surname and maintained ties with him. She stayed involved in politics, but was again embroiled in controversy when she was convicted of fraud in 2003.

White House criticises $3bn China tariffs,"US pork products are among those affected by new tariffs imposed by China The White House has criticised China after it imposed retaliatory tariffs against the US on a range of goods, including pork and wine. Beijing put duties of up to 25% on 128 American imports following President Donald Trump's decision to slap taxes on imports of steel and aluminium. China said the move was intended to safeguard its interests and balance losses caused by the new tariffs. US stocks fell sharplyand Asia traded generally lower, amid trade war fears. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 Index lost 2.2%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 1.9%. In Asia,Japan's Nikkei 225opened down about 1.5% on Tuesday but recovered a little to close 0.45% lower. The Shanghai Composite closed down even further, dropping 0.84%, although Hong Kong's Hang Seng bucked the trend, reversing earlier losses to finish up 0.29%. What are tariffs and trade wars (and should you worry?) Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win What could China do in a US trade war? The White House reacted angrily to China's move. ""Instead of targeting fairly traded US exports, China needs to stop its unfair trading practices which are harming US national security and distorting global markets,"" spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said. She added; ""China's subsidisation and continued overcapacity is the root cause of the steel crises,"" The back-and-forth reflects rising tensions between the US and China, which President Trump has described as an ""economic enemy"". The US has taken two major steps on tariffs recently that have triggered tension with China, the first on steel and aluminium and the second on intellectual property. The global steel and aluminium tariffs were announced on 8 March. The US is using national security laws to impose the tariffs, which it says are needed to protect US producers. Certain allies such as Canada, Mexico and the European Union are in line for exemptions, pending talks. Donald Trump has vowed to cut the US trade deficit with China Chinahas challenged the US use of national security laws,externaland announced retaliatory tariffs on $3bn (Â£2.1bn) worth of US products. Those tariffs went into effect on Monday, targeting US goods including frozen pork, nuts, fresh and dried fruit, ginseng and wine. The US tariffs related to intellectual property are expected to be set out this week. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

They stem from a US investigation into the alleged theft of intellectual property and Beijing's ""Made in China 2025"" programme, which the US says puts its firms at a disadvantage and unfairly pressures them to share technology, especially in fields such as robotics and telecommunications. Up to $60bn in tariffs could be imposed on Chinese imports. China's ambassador to the US, Cui Tiankai, warned Beijing would take counter-measures of ""the same proportion"". What is a trade war and why should I worry? Reality Check: Is Trump right about US trade deficit? By Stephen McDonell, BBC News, Hong Kong China's theft of foreign intellectual property is what sparked all this in the first place, according to Washington. If international companies want to operate in China they must hand over their intellectual property for the privilege, thus delivering the likes of German high-speed rail technology into the hands of Chinese engineers. Yet now that China's retaliatory tariffs have kicked in, there are also those sympathetic with that argument who are worried that launching a potential tariff war is not the way to fix the problem. Naturally others say China has been getting away with this for years and tough measures were needed in order to force change. There is also the overall imbalance in US-China trade but a large Chinese surplus, of course, means it is potentially much more exposed during a trade war than America. For this reason Beijing will want to negotiate a way out of this escalating tariff showdown. Its first set of tariffs are relatively mild but they come in response to the first round of US tariffs and a second has already been announced. There are plenty more American companies to be hit and other nations, especially those in Europe and Asia, could soon find themselves dragged into this conflict. American businesses caught up in the dispute have raised alarms, noting that China is a large market for certain goods, including pork, soya beans and aircraft. For example, last year China was the third largest market for US pork, receiving about $1.1bn worth of products, according to the National Pork Producer Council. ""Any restriction on export markets is not a good development for US pork producers,"" Jim Monroe, a spokesman for the National Pork Producers Council, told the BBC. US companies have said that while they share some of the Trump administration's concerns, they are worried that threatening tariffs is not the best way to resolve the problems. ""The direction of what the US government is doing, and that is to apply some pressure, use some leverage, to level the playing field is the right one, although I don't think tariffs is the best way to go,"" said William Zarit. chairman of the American Chamber of Commerce in China. Mr Zarit told the BBC that members of his organisation, which represents more than 900 companies operating across China, including Intel, Dell, Honeywell and Coca-Cola, were encouraged to hear that top officials have started talking again. ""I think it shows that both sides want to solve this before it gets out of hand,"" he said. What is a trade war and why should I worry?

Obituary: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,"This video can not be played Who was Winnie Mandela? Winnie Madikizela-Mandela became a potent symbol of South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle when she was banished and jailed for campaigning for the rights of black South Africans and her husband's release. For decades she and her then-husband, the iconic Nelson Mandela, were the country's most famous political couple - but Mr Mandela divorced her in 1996. After their separation she kept his surname and they maintained ties, leading to critics accusing her of attempting to use his name for political mileage. In later life her reputation later became tainted by a fraud conviction and murder accusations, which she denied. Born in Bizana in Cape Province in 1936, she met Mr Mandela in 1957. He was married at the time to Evelyn Mase but the marriage was breaking up. The next year they married - she was a young bride, 16 years his junior, glamorous and strong-willed. However, they were destined to have little time together as political activism and a period in hiding kept Mr Mandela apart from her. Known as ""mama"" or ""mother of the nation"", controversy befell her in later life The couple had two daughters before Nelson was imprisoned, Zenani and Zindzi He was jailed for life in 1964 and only released in 1990. While he was in prison, she took on an increasingly political role, partly because of constant harassment by the South African security police. She became an international symbol of resistance to apartheid and a rallying point for poor, black township residents who demanded their freedom. Her resistance to harassment and championing of the anti-apartheid cause led to periods of imprisonment from 1969, much of it spent in solitary confinement. In 1976, the year of the Soweto riots, she was banished from the township to a remote rural area. At one stage her house was burned down, with suspicion falling on the South African security forces. This led to her being dubbed the ""Mother of the Nation"". By the mid-1980s and the start of a long period of township militancy against the white government of President P W Botha, she was back in Soweto and at the heart of the struggle. 1936: Born in Cape Province 1958: Married Nelson Mandela 1969: Jailed for 18 months for anti-apartheid activities 1976: Banished to rural area by apartheid authorities 1991: Convicted of kidnapping 1996: Divorced from Nelson Mandela 2003: Convicted of fraud Her image and activism drew to her many anti-apartheid activists, including a group of young men who became her personal bodyguards. They became known as the Mandela United Football Club. Her prominence led to great influence over young, radical township activists but also growing controversy. As activists turned on suspected police informers or collaborators, the use of rubber tyres filled with petrol as brutal murder weapons, known as ""necklaces"", became widespread. At one rally she controversially seemed to endorse their use. Even greater controversy came when she was accused by senior anti-apartheid activists of involvement in the killing of a 14-year-old township militant, Stompie Seipei. Stompie had been seized by Ms Madikizela-Mandela's bodyguards in 1989 and was later found dead. Members of the ANC leadership accused her of being behind the killing and of conducting a virtual reign of terror in parts of Soweto. The former first lady remained largely unmoved during testimony against her at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997 From prison, Mr Mandela continued to support his wife. In 1991, after his release, she was charged with the assault and kidnapping of Stompie and one of her bodyguards was charged with his murder. She denied the allegations but was found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to six years imprisonment. This was reduced to a fine by an appeal court. Her marriage to Mr Mandela broke down in the years after his release and they were divorced in 1996. President Mandela accused her of adultery, and in the same year, dismissed her as deputy minister of arts and culture - the only post she has held in government since white minority rule ended. Her split from Mr Mandela did little to harm her political standing among poor, black South Africans who saw her as their voice at a time when the ANC had adopted pro-business policies. But at the same time she became known for an increasingly lavish lifestyle, arriving to testify at Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in a white Mercedes limousine surrounded by bodyguards. In 2003, Ms Madikizela-Mandela suffered another blow when a court convicted her of fraud and theft in connection with a bank loan scandal. The sentencing magistrate compared her to a modern-day Robin Hood, fraudulently acquiring loans for people who were desperately short of money, but he said that as a prominent public figure she should have known better. An appeal judge overturned the conviction for theft, but upheld the one for fraud, handing her a three-year-and-six-month suspended sentence. This dented her career, but she remained respected in the ANC, and was an MP until her death. At the ANC conference in 2007, she was elected to the party's top decision-making body, the National Executive Committee, and in the 2009 general election, she was placed fifth on the list of ANC MPs nominated for parliament, in a clear sign that then-President Jacob Zuma saw her as an electoral asset. She would later clash with him and become political patron of the youth leader Julius Malema. Ms Madikizela-Mandela described being there for the final moments of her ex-husband's life in 2013, and appeared in a prominent position at memorial services in his honour. She and widow Graca Machel were pictured wiping away tears together while mourning After his death, she became embroiled in a legal battle over his village home, which she wanted for their two daughters, Zinzi and Zenani. The Supreme Court affirmed a decision that she held no claim to it in January 2018. The same month she was honoured with an honorary degree from Makerere University in Uganda for her anti-apartheid campaigning. Although she remained in the political limelight, she was granted leave from parliament in March 2018 due to ill health. A family spokesman confirmed her death on 2 April, aged 81. Her family said she had suffered from a ""long illness"" and had been in and out of hospital in the last months of her life. ""She succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones,"" spokesman Victor Dlamini said in a statement. Winnie Mandela's story in opera.

Is Trump right on trade deficit?,"Claim: The US is suffering from a trade imbalance, with a trade deficit of $800bn (Â£579bn) in 2017. Reality Check verdict: The President is incorrect about the US trade deficit - it was $566bn (Â£410bn) in 2017. Economists generally agree that neither trade deficits nor surpluses are necessarily 'good' or 'bad' for an economy. In a marked change of direction from his predecessors and decades of American trade policy, US President Donald Trump signalled a shift away from free trade towards more protectionist policies bysigning two proclamationswhich levied significant tariffs on imports of steel and aluminium into the United States. Part of his justification for the move was his belief that US trade deficits have hurt the US economy. In remarks at the White House announcing the trade tariff plan, President Trump said ""we lose $800bn (Â£578bn) a year on trade, every year"". It's a claim he's made repeatedly, in tweets and speeches. President Trump seems to be citing the fact that the US imported $810bn worth of goods in 2017. That was what he referenced in aJune 2016 campaign speech,externalin Pittsburgh, which many in his administration are pointing to now to suggest they've fulfilled a campaign promise. But in doing so, he's ignoring the amount of services the US exported in 2017, which totalled $242.7bn. Discounting that contribution to US trade ignores a significant part of what makes the US economy tick. This is why most economists agree that the US trade deficit in 2017 was $566bn (Â£410bn). Like many developed economies, the US has shifted over the past century from an economy primarily focused on manufacturing goods to one that is primarily composed of services. The service sector accounts for 90 million US jobs and 80% of US economic activity, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The biggest US service exports were travel and tourism, financial services like banking, and environmental services. A cargo ship being unloaded off the coast of California In the White House speech, and in recent days, President Trump has taken particular aim at China - saying the US is losing out because of a $500bn trade deficit with China, which he also mentioned during a 5 March speech. However, the US has never run a trade deficit with China that is above $337bn. Over the past ten years, the US has run an annual trade deficit with China that's hovered between $200bn and $300bn. And when it comes to steel and aluminium imports to the US, China barely ranks. Although China has nearly half of the world's steel-making capacity according to the OECD, the US imports the majority of its steel from Canada, Brazil, South Korea and Mexico. In 2017,external, Chinese steel imports accounted for just 2% of the 34 million tonnes of steel the US imported, or 3% of the total value. Allow Twitter content?

A big reason President Trump has pursued these tariffs is his desire to appeal to manufacturing workers in Democratic swing states like Ohio. He has specifically said he wants to see the US return to being a country that ""makes"" goods. In the past, he's cited statistics that he says indicate that poor trade policies have hurt the US manufacturing sector overall. For instance, in a tweet earlier in the week President Trump said that since President George H.W. Bush came into office in 1989, the US has lost 55,000 factories and six million manufacturing jobs. According to theUS Census bureau,external, the US actually lost a total of 77,314 manufacturing establishments from 1989 until 2014 (the last year for which data is available). However, establishments can encompass anything from a traditional factory to something like a bakery or a candy store, so it is hard to definitively say if more than 70,000 factories were lost in the intervening decades. This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? In terms of manufacturing employment, these numbers are slightly exaggerated. The US losta total,externalof 5.5 million manufacturing jobs since 1989. US manufacturing employmentpeaked,externalin 1979. It suffered its sharpest declines in employment in the early 1980s. Since then, manufacturing employment in America has been on the decline. Some of the decline is certainly due to unfair trade practices - but a large portion of it could be due to automation, which has resulted in fewer workers on factory floors. It bears mentioning that manufacturing employment has declined in most major western industrialised nations over the past few decades as well, although the timing of the decline has varied from country to country.

Momentum: Labour failed on anti-Semitism,"Christine Shawcroft, who quit the NEC amid a row over anti-Semitism, is part of the Momentum leadership Momentum, the Labour movement backing Jeremy Corbyn, has said that anti-Semitism in the party is more widespread than it had understood. It said in a statement: ""Accusations of anti-Semitism should not and cannot be dismissed simply as right-wing smears."" It acknowledged the ""upset and despair"" of the Jewish community and the party's ""failure"" to deal with anti-Semitism. The move came as the Labour leader promised ""watertight"" investigations into allegations of anti-Semitism. Row over Corbyn left-wing Jewish event visit Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue The Labour leader told Channel 4 News: ""We are not tolerating anti-Semitism in any form in the Labour Party."" He said the first task of the party's new general secretary, Jennie Formby, would be to appoint an in-house lawyer and ensure effective procedures were in place to deal with allegations of anti-Semitism. A Jewish member of Labour's National Executive Committee, Rhea Wolfson, said she was ""frustrated"" at the pace of action to confront anti-Semitism. But she welcomed the latest commitment. ""Jeremy has specifically asked her to make this her number one priority... so I think we'll see a speeding up of these changes,"" she said. By Eleanor Garnier, BBC News political correspondent It's been a bad week for Labour. Throughout, the party has condemned anti-Semitism and criticised those behind it - and Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for the hurt that has been caused. This warning from Momentum, a left wing campaign group set up to support the Labour leader, is significant. It follows claims from some of Mr Corbyn's supporters that allegations of anti-Semitism are a smear designed to damage him. While Momentum's National Co-ordinating Group said anti-Semitism was a problem in parts of the Left, it also said that some of Mr Corbyn's opponents were opportunistically using the issue as a way to undermine his leadership - though it added that the action of others does not reduce the group's responsibility to challenge anti-Semitism. But it will take more than words for Labour and Jeremy Corbyn to recover from the trouble the party has found itself in over anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn has faced demands to speed up investigations into a backlog of about 70 complaints of anti-Semitism, including one against former London mayor Ken Livingstone.He has previously apologisedfor the ""hurt"" caused by the failure to address cases of anti-Semitism. The party has dropped one council candidate, Roy Smart in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, who was accused of sharing posts on social media urging followers to ""question the Holocaust"". How the anti-Semitism saga unfolded Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The statement from Momentum's National Co-ordinating Group acknowledges the failure to deal with cases in a ""sufficiently decisive, swift and transparent manner"". Among those on the NCG isChristine Shawcroft, who quitLabour's disputes panel and the National Executive Committee after criticism of her opposition to the suspension of another council candidate, Alan Bull in Peterborough. Mr Bull had been due to stand in the May local elections, but was accused of sharing an article on Facebook which claimed the Holocaust was a ""hoax"". He said he reposted the article for the purpose of debate and did not agree with it. The NCH statement said: ""Current examples of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party are not only a problem of a few, extreme 'bad apples' but also of unconscious bias which manifests itself in varied, nuanced and subtle ways and is more widespread in the Labour Party than many of us had understood even a few months ago."" While it suggested that Jeremy Corbyn's opponents may be ""opportunistically using this issue as a way to undermine his leadership"", that did not diminish ""our responsibility to challenge anti-Semitism whenever and wherever it occurs"". The movement promised to explore partnerships for awareness training open to all Labour members, to back party initiatives against anti-Semitism and to push forward a programme of political education aimed at challenging conspiratorial thinking. Momentum leaders also pledged to review its constitution and procedures and to support local groups in its aim of eradicating anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination.

Seven dead in massive India caste protests,"A Supreme Court ruling has triggered the massive protest in India Eight people have died amid violent protests involving tens of thousands of protesters from the Dalit (formerly untouchable) community across India. They have taken to the streets to protest against a Supreme Court order that they say weakens a law designed to protect lower caste communities. Train services have been affected and some main roads have been blocked in a number of states. The federal government has asked the court to review its decision. In its ruling, the court had said that the Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, popularly known as the SC/ST Act, had been ""misused"" in the past. Caste violence continues to be a problem in the country.More than 40,000 crimes against lower castes were reported in 2016 alone,external, according to official statistics. India's Dalits still fighting untouchability Indian Dalit recalls protest that paralysed Mumbai YouTube channel becomes rallying point for India's Dalits Dalit leaders said the ruling made them feel ""vulnerable"". ""The SC/ST Act ensured the protection of Dalits in India by making any discrimination against our community a punishable offence. With this new Supreme Court order, these legal obligations have ended. We're all sad and shocked,"" said KP Choudhary, the general secretary of an all-India association for lower castes. Some railways and highways have been blocked In the central state of Madhya Pradesh, senior police officials told BBC Hindi that six people had died. Bans were imposed on large gatherings after protesters blocked railway tracks and set fire to vehicles. A curfew has been imposed in some parts of the state. One person has also been killed in the northern state of Rajasthan, police said. In the northern state of Punjab, exams have been postponed and all educational institutions, banks and offices shut. The state government has also suspended internet services until 11pm. Hundreds of protesters carrying swords, sticks, bats and flags forced shops to shut in several cities in the state and public transport is off the road. There have been further reports of clashes between protesters and police in parts the northern states of Uttar Pradesh, Jharkhand and Bihar. Dalit organisations also staged demonstrations in the capital, Delhi, but police said there were no report of any violence. However, roads were blocked in the city centre, causing lengthy traffic jams. Dalits are some of the country's most downtrodden citizens because of an unforgiving Hindu caste hierarchy that condemns them to the bottom of the heap. Despite the laws to protect them, discrimination remains a daily reality for the Dalit population, thought to number around 200 million. Traditionally, they have been segregated from the upper castes and are not allowed to attend the same temples, schools or even drink from the same cups as upper caste people. They do not get education and job opportunities, and are often victims of exploitation, abuse and violence. Indian men 'beaten up over moustaches' India woman fights family over 'low caste' husband's murder What is India's caste system? Lately, activists say that rising aspirations among young Dalits have improved their lives, but this has also increased violence against them by upper caste community members who are unable to accept this. ""Conflict increases where social conditions [for Dalits] may be getting slightly better,""Pratap Bhanu Mehta, vice chancellor of Ashoka University, earlier told the BBC.. Last weeka young Dalit boy was beaten to death in the western state of Gujarat, apparently for owning and riding a horse, which is seen as an ""upper caste privilege"". In October,a Dalit man was killed by a group of men for reportedly attending a traditional Hindu dance performancealso in Gujarat. The Scheduled Caste and Scheduled Tribe (Prevention of Atrocities) Act, 1989 was brought into law to prevent crimes against people belonging to lower castes and tribes in India. The act was passed as it was felt that the existing legal framework at the time did not provide adequate protection to lower castes. The act allows for instant arrests, severely limits opportunities for bail and also automatically sees the registration of criminal cases against anyone accused of committing an offence against a member of a lower caste or tribe. The government has asked the Supreme Court to review its decision It also prescribes several other stringent measures such as the attachment and forfeiture of property of an accused. The act also allows public servants to be prosecuted for neglect of duties - a significant step given that many lower caste people said their complaints were often ignored by officials who belonged to the same communities as those they were accusing. It was amended in 2015 to cover newer forms of discrimination and crimes against lower caste communities. The court said the act was ""rampantly misused"" but critics say the ruling will do more harm than good In its ruling, the court said that the act was being ""rampantly misused"", noting that 15-16% of the total number of complaints filed under the act in 2015 were false, and many cases were filed to settle personal scores and harass adversaries. It therefore stopped the automatic arrests and registration of criminal cases under the law and also made it mandatory for a preliminary inquiry to be conducted by police within seven days of an alleged incident before taking any action. The court also said it would be mandatory for the senior police official of a district to approve any arrest. It provides further protection for public servants, saying no arrest can be made without the written permission of the concerned official's appointing authority. Critics say that the ruling has diluted the law which will pave the way for officials to turn a blind eye to caste atrocities. They also say that the provisions will lead to increased violence against lower castes.

Russia accuses West of 'children's games',"Mr Lavrov also suggested last month's poisoning could be in the interests of the British government Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the UK and Western partners of playing ""children's games"" in their response to the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. He accused countries of ""disregarding all accepted behaviour"" and resorting to ""open lies and disinformation"". Twenty-nine nations have expelled diplomats over the poisoning, which the UK holds Russia responsible for. Mr Lavrov also issued fresh denials at the news conference on Monday. He made the comments in response to a question by the BBC's Steve Rosenberg about how dangerous growing tensions were between Russia and the West in comparison with the Cold War. ""In the classic Cold War,"" Sergei Lavrov said, ""there were rules and accepted behaviour"". ""I think our Western partners, I think firstly Great Britain and the USA and a few other countries that blindly follow them, have disregarded all the accepted behaviour."" Russian media accuse West of 'crusade' Russian spy: What we know so far Is this a new Cold War? ""We do not want to play children's games, but so far our partners are doing precisely that,"" he added, saying it was up to them to reduce tensions. ""When we were kids we used to say whoever started it should be the one to finish it."" This video can not be played Estonian President tells Today Western unity will not be broken During the news conference he also suggested the poisoning could be ""in the interests of the British government"" because of the ""uncomfortable situation"" they had found themselves in with Brexit. ""There are other explanations. The experts are speaking about them. They say it may well be beneficial for the British special services who are known for their ability to act with a license to kill."" ""There could be a whole number of reasons and none of them can be ruled out,"" Mr Lavrov said. The poisoning row has rumbled on for nearly a month, with the UK saying it is adamant Russia was behind it. Russia has now told the UK more than 50 of its diplomats have to leave the country, after the British government ordered a cut to 23 Russian staff over last month's Salisbury poisoning. Russia said their deeper cut is so the two nations have parity in representation. Other governments - including the United States - also ordered expulsions of scores of Russian diplomats from their countries, deepening the row. This video can not be played Eurovision-style? The BBC's Steve Rosenberg on how the Russia media is reporting the score-settling On Monday Mr Lavrov said it was wrong to target diplomats who ""by definition intended to support relations, resolve complicated situations and find way out of difficulties"". How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network? What the expulsions mean for Russia What happens when you expel a diplomat? ""In diplomacy, we have the principle of reciprocity and this is still the case. And this principle will be applied consistently,"" he said. Separately, Russia suggested the searching of an incoming Russian plane at Heathrow Airport was ""illegal"" and a ""blatant provocation"". The British government rejected the complaint,and said the search was ""routine"". Also on Monday, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov announced that US President Donald Trump had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to a meeting at the White House during their 20 March phone call, according to the TASS state media agency. ""When our presidents spoke on the phone, it was Trump who proposed holding the first meeting in Washington in the White House,"" Mr Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. ""If everything will be alright, I hope that the Americans will not back away from their own proposal to discuss the possibility of holding a summit,"" Mr Ushakov added. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders responded: ""As the President himself confirmed on March 20, hours after his last call with President Putin, the two had discussed a bilateral meeting in the 'not-too-distant future' at a number of potential venues, including the White House."" Ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned on 4 March in Salisbury with what UK investigators have concluded was a Russian nerve agent called Novichok. Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father Mr Skripal remains critically ill, but stable, but his daughter is said to be conscious and talking. The Russian Embassy in London ""insists on the right to see"" Ms Skripal, who is a Russian citizen. The UK government has said it is considering the request.

Calor gas shortages affect thousands,"Calor has apologised to customers for an ongoing delivery backlog Customers have vented their anger after a shortage of Calor gas left some without hot water and unable to heat their homes over the Easter weekend. About 3,300 Calor customers who use liquefied petroleum gas (LPG) have been affected by the delays which beganwhen Storm Emma hit in late February,external. Some said they had run out of gas despite ordering weeks in advance, while others said they are running low. Calor said it was ""extremely sorry"" but the delays could take weeks to resolve. The energy supplier has 110,000 LPG customers in Britain, and said the situation affected less than 3% of these customers. However, sinceit first announced news of the delays on 6 March,external, it has attracted hundreds of angry comments on Facebook and Twitter, as well as on the review site Trustpilot.

Some said they were concerned for family members - elderly pensioners and young children who were suffering due to not having heating, hot water, or in some cases, even the ability to cook. Others said they had been told it would take a week before Calor would be able to deliver gas canisters to them - despite the fact they had called to order new ones before they ran out of gas.

Calor blamed the closure of the Forties pipeline in the North Sea due to a leak in early December, as well as the week-long closures of the Fawley, Stanlow and Valero oil refineries. This, it said, had led to LPG stocks running low across the industry. When the weather subsequently turned icy with Storm Emma - nicknamed ""The Beast from the East"" - it was unable to meet the increased demand for LPG. It said it had now managed to deliver gas to people who reported running out three weeks ago. But it said it was still working through the backlog to get to others who had run out or were running low. A spokesman told the BBC: ""We are seeing an improvement in the situation, but it will be some weeks before we are fully back to normal. ""We have been keeping our customers updated and have had service centres open every day over Easter (apart from Easter Sunday), plus we have had drivers out making deliveries every day. ""We are extremely sorry about the situation which has arisen from the combination of two extreme events."" Around 200,000 people use LPG in the UK and Calor is the leading supplier. However, it is not the only gas firm to have experienced problems, with others including Flogas, Avantigas and Countrywide also reporting delays.

AI 'poses less risk to jobs than feared',"Food preparation work is among that most at risk of automation, says the new study Fewer people's jobs are likely to be destroyed by artificial intelligence and robots than has been suggested by a much-cited study, an OECD report says. An influential 2013forecast by Oxford University,externalsaid that about 47% of jobs in the US in 2010 and 35% in the UK were at ""high risk"" of being automated over the following 20 years. Butthe OECD puts the,externalUS figure at about 10% and the UK's at 12%. Even so, it says many more workers face their tasks significantly changing. The OECD says the previous forecasts exaggerated the impact of automation because they had relied on a broad grouping together of jobs with the same title. Its new analysis, by contrast, takes account of the differences between jobs with the same name. For example, the role of a carpenter can vary greatly depending on what type of projects a worker is involved in, how much autonomy they have, and the size of their employer. Some of those roles may be more vulnerable to automation than others. The study did, however, flag up that young people could find it harder to find work in future as entry-level posts had a higher risk of automation than jobs requiring more experience. The research was published last month, but attracted little attentionuntil covered by the Financial Times,external. The earlier study by Oxford University's Carl Frey and Michael Osborne formed the basis for projectionsby the Bank of England,external, as well as a popularrisk-prediction tool by the BBC. It also inspired several other studies that similarly produced high double-digit estimates of the percentage of jobs facing wipe-out. But the OECD said a variety of factors made some similarly-titled jobs less susceptible to automation than others, depending on whether: computers and other human labour-replacing equipment have already been adopted the role involves having to deal with complex social relationships, including caring for others and recognising cultural sensitivities the post requires lots of creativity and complex reasoning the job requires lots of physical manipulation of objects in a constantly changing work environment By referring toanother recent OECD survey,external, the organisation was able to take some of these factors into account. Overall, the economic body, which monitors the economies of the world's richer countries, predicted that 14% of jobs across 32 surveyed member nations were at high risk over the specified period. High risk was defined as there being greater than a 70% chance the role would be lost to automation. That equated to 66 million posts, it said. It added that a further 32% of jobs faced significant upheaval. Its report also highlighted variations between different global regions. The new study warns that automation appears to be making it harder for teenagers to find work Posts in Anglo-Saxon, Nordic countries and the Netherlands were less likely to be automated than those in the south and east of Europe, as well as Germany, Chile and Japan, it said. In addition, the report said it found no measurable evidence that AI was significantly impacting jobs requiring high levels of education and skill, despite what others had claimed. However, the OECD added that lower-skilled jobs involving routine tasks - including cleaners, agricultural labourers and food preparers - faced significantly more impact than previous waves of automation. It highlighted a further revelation: the risk of automation appears to be highest among the jobs typically done by teenagers. ""Youth and adults do different things at work, even when they hold jobs with the same occupational title,"" the report said. ""The warnings in some developed countries that teen jobs have been harder to come by in recent years should be taken seriously and studied in the context of job automation."" Both Prof Osborne and Dr Frey told the BBC they had not had a chance to read the study in enough detail to discuss it at this point. But one independent expert commented that any predictions of this type should be treated with caution. ""The problem with all studies attempting to apply empirical evidence to this debate is they fail to take into account the accelerating improvement in the ability of AI systems,"" said Calum Chace, author of The Economic Singularity. ""It is a foolish person who declares today the limitations of what those machines will be capable of. ""It is at least a serious possibility that within a generation - 30 years - many or most people will be unemployable because machines will be able to do whatever they could do for money better, cheaper and faster. ""We should be taking this possibility seriously and working out what we would do about it."" Robots to 'take 800 million jobs by 2030' Will a robot take your job?

Top prosecutor Alison Saunders to quit,"This video can not be played Director of Public Prosecutions Alison Saunders tells Today it was her decision to leave The director of public prosecutions in England and Wales, Alison Saunders, is to step down at the end of her five-year contract in October. While at the Crown Prosecution Service she oversaw the successful prosecution of Stephen Lawrence's killers. But recently she has faced criticism afterseveral rape trials collapseddue to evidence not being disclosed. Ms Saunders told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the service had improved during her tenure ""despite cuts"". She said it had been her decision to leave the role and that criticism of her work at the CPS (Crown Prosecution Service) was ""incredibly inaccurate"" and ""hugely insulting"" to the service's staff. The CPS faced criticism when, in December 2017, the trials of Isaac Itiary, who was accused of raping a child, and Liam Allan,both collapsed when new evidence came to light. Police and prosecutors are expected to disclose evidence that could assist the defence case or undermine the prosecution's but these cases demonstrated that evidence was not being shared early enough. It later emerged the number of prosecutions in England and Wales that had collapsed because of a failure to disclose evidence had increased by 70% in the previous two years. Review of rape cases over disclosure fears 'Justice system is working' after rape trials collapse Sex offence prosecutions at record high Ms Saunders described issues with the disclosure regime as ""extremely regrettable"" and said the problems with disclosure were part of a ""systemic failing across the justice system"" which had been going on ""for some years"". She said the job had been a ""tremendous privilege"" and she was ""proud of everything the service has achieved"" over the past five years. Head of the civil service Sir Jeremy Heywood praised her leadership of the CPS. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Saunders, who will move to multinational law firm Linklaters, had faced calls to resign in June 2015 when her decision not to prosecute Labour peer Lord Janner over claims of historical child sexual abusewas overturned by an independent QC. The CPS had said there was enough evidence to merit prosecution but that it was not in the public interest to proceed against the former MP. Alison Saunders said there was evidence against Lord Janner but decided it was not in the public interest to prosecute the case The ruling reversing that decision made Ms Saunders the first director of public prosecutions to have a major prosecuting decision reviewed and overturned. A judge later ruled that Lord Janner was unfit to stand trial. The peer's son, Daniel Janner - himself a criminal law QC - attacked the way the CPS dealt with his father's case and said Ms Saunders had been ""an appalling DPP"" who was ""regarded by those in the legal profession as someone who wasn't up to the job"". By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Alison Saunders was dealt a tough hand as head of the Crown Prosecution Service. The service has sustained major cuts that undoubtedly affected the CPS's ability to carry out its role. However, Ms Saunders' tenure has been dogged by controversies. They included her being the first DPP to be overruled on a ""victim right to review"". She decided it was not in the public interest for the late Labour peer Lord Janner to stand trial for alleged sexual abuse because he was suffering from dementia. An independent QC disagreed. There was bitter press criticism in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal when journalists were prosecuted for paying public officials for leaked information.  Nine cases were dropped as the prosecution was scaled back and only one journalist was convicted following a jury trial, but that conviction was later quashed. More recently a series of rape trials collapsed where the prosecution failed to disclose critical evidence to the defence.  That has led to a review of all rape and serious sexual assault cases, and widespread claims of systemic prosecution failings on disclosure which is a fundamental principle of our fair trial system. Ms Saunders joined the CPS as a barrister in 1986 rising to become director of public prosecutions in 2013. It was as chief crown prosecutor for London in 2012 that she oversaw the successful prosecution of two men who killed Mr Lawrence. The 18-year-old was stabbed to deathin an unprovoked and racist attack as he waited at a bus stop in south-east London in 1993. Stephen Lawrence was murdered in 1993 In the 2013 New Year Honours, she was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath for services to law and order for her work particularly after the 2011 London riots. Announcing she would be stepping down, Attorney General Jeremy Wright thanked her for her service and called her an ""accomplished CPS prosecutor whose successful record includes the prosecution of Stephen Lawrence's killers"". ""I have no doubt that she'll be greatly missed within the organisation,"" he said, adding that recruitment for her successor would begin later this month.

Momentum admits anti-Semitism 'failure',"Christine Shawcroft, who quit the NEC amid a row over anti-Semitism, is part of the Momentum leadership Momentum, the Labour movement backing Jeremy Corbyn, has said that anti-Semitism in the party is more widespread than it had understood. It said in a statement: ""Accusations of anti-Semitism should not and cannot be dismissed simply as right-wing smears."" It acknowledged the ""upset and despair"" of the Jewish community and the party's ""failure"" to deal with anti-Semitism. The move came as the Labour leader promised ""watertight"" investigations into allegations of anti-Semitism. Row over Corbyn left-wing Jewish event visit Jeremy Corbyn and Labour's anti-Semitism issue The Labour leader told Channel 4 News: ""We are not tolerating anti-Semitism in any form in the Labour Party."" He said the first task of the party's new general secretary, Jennie Formby, would be to appoint an in-house lawyer and ensure effective procedures were in place to deal with allegations of anti-Semitism. A Jewish member of Labour's National Executive Committee, Rhea Wolfson, said she was ""frustrated"" at the pace of action to confront anti-Semitism. But she welcomed the latest commitment. ""Jeremy has specifically asked her to make this her number one priority... so I think we'll see a speeding up of these changes,"" she said. By Eleanor Garnier, BBC News political correspondent It's been a bad week for Labour. Throughout, the party has condemned anti-Semitism and criticised those behind it - and Jeremy Corbyn has apologised for the hurt that has been caused. This warning from Momentum, a left wing campaign group set up to support the Labour leader, is significant. It follows claims from some of Mr Corbyn's supporters that allegations of anti-Semitism are a smear designed to damage him. While Momentum's National Co-ordinating Group said anti-Semitism was a problem in parts of the Left, it also said that some of Mr Corbyn's opponents were opportunistically using the issue as a way to undermine his leadership - though it added that the action of others does not reduce the group's responsibility to challenge anti-Semitism. But it will take more than words for Labour and Jeremy Corbyn to recover from the trouble the party has found itself in over anti-Semitism. Mr Corbyn has faced demands to speed up investigations into a backlog of about 70 complaints of anti-Semitism, including one against former London mayor Ken Livingstone.He has previously apologisedfor the ""hurt"" caused by the failure to address cases of anti-Semitism. The party has dropped one council candidate, Roy Smart in Tunbridge Wells, Kent, who was accused of sharing posts on social media urging followers to ""question the Holocaust"". How the anti-Semitism saga unfolded Anti-Semitism and anti-Zionism The statement from Momentum's National Co-ordinating Group acknowledges the failure to deal with cases in a ""sufficiently decisive, swift and transparent manner"". Among those on the NCG isChristine Shawcroft, who quitLabour's disputes panel and the National Executive Committee after criticism of her opposition to the suspension of another council candidate, Alan Bull in Peterborough. Mr Bull had been due to stand in the May local elections, but was accused of sharing an article on Facebook which claimed the Holocaust was a ""hoax"". He said he reposted the article for the purpose of debate and did not agree with it. The NCH statement said: ""Current examples of anti-Semitism within the Labour Party are not only a problem of a few, extreme 'bad apples' but also of unconscious bias which manifests itself in varied, nuanced and subtle ways and is more widespread in the Labour Party than many of us had understood even a few months ago."" While it suggested that Jeremy Corbyn's opponents may be ""opportunistically using this issue as a way to undermine his leadership"", that did not diminish ""our responsibility to challenge anti-Semitism whenever and wherever it occurs"". The movement promised to explore partnerships for awareness training open to all Labour members, to back party initiatives against anti-Semitism and to push forward a programme of political education aimed at challenging conspiratorial thinking. Momentum leaders also pledged to review its constitution and procedures and to support local groups in its aim of eradicating anti-Semitism and other forms of discrimination.

Facebook chief fires back at Apple boss,"Mr Zuckerberg has seen shares in his company fall steeply since the start of the Cambridge Analytical scandal Facebook's chief executive has defended his leadership following criticism from his counterpart at Apple. Mark Zuckerberg said it was ""extremely glib"" to suggest that because the public did not pay to use Facebook that the firm did not care about them. Last week, Apple'sTim Cook said it was,externalan ""invasion of privacy"" to traffic in users' personal lives. And when asked what he would do if he were Mr Zuckerberg, Mr Cook replied: ""I wouldn't be in that situation."" Facebook has faced intense criticism after it emerged that it had known for years that Cambridge Analytica had harvested data from about 50 million of its users, but had relied on the political consultancy to self-certify that it had deleted the information. Channel 4 Newshas since reported that at least,externalsome of the data in question is still in circulation despite Cambridge Analytica insisting it had destroyed the material. Mr Zuckerberg was asked about Mr Cook's comments during a lengthy interview given to news site Voxabout the privacy scandal,external. He also acknowledged that Facebook was still not transparent enough about some of the choices it had taken, and floated the idea of an independent panel being able to override some of its decisions. Mr Cook has spoken in public twice since Facebook's data-mining controversy began. Tim Cook had said he would not have let himself be in Mr Zuckerberg's current situation On 23 March, he took part in the China Development Forum in Beijing. ""I think that this certain situation is so dire and has become so large that probably some well-crafted regulation is necessary,"" news agencyBloomberg quoted him as saying,externalin response to a question about the social network's problems. ""The ability of anyone to know what you've been browsing about for years, who your contacts are, who their contacts are, things you like and dislike and every intimate detail of your life - from my own point of view it shouldn't exist."" Facebook haunted by 'ugly truth' memo Facebook privacy settings revamped after scandal Zuckerberg will not appear before MPs Then in an interview with MSNBC and Recode on 28 March, Mr Cook said: ""I think the best regulation is no regulation, is self-regulation. However, I think we're beyond that here."" During this second appearance,external- which has yet to be broadcast in full - he added: ""We could make a tonne of money if we monetised our customer, if our customer was our product. We've elected not to do that... Privacy to us is a human right."" Apple makes most of its profits from selling smartphones, tablets and other computers, as well as associated services such as online storage and its various media stores. This contrasts with other tech firms whose profits are largely derived from advertising, including Google, Twitter and Facebook. Facebook's reputation has been tarnished by the Cambridge Analytica revelations Mr Zuckerberghad previously told CNN,externalthat he was ""open"" to new regulations. But he defended his business model when questioned about Mr Cook's views, although he mentioned neither Apple nor its leader by name. ""I find that argument, that if you're not paying that somehow we can't care about you, to be extremely glib and not at all aligned with the truth,"" he said. ""The reality here is that if you want to build a service that helps connect everyone in the world, then there are a lot of people who can't afford to pay."" He added: ""I think it's important that we don't all get Stockholm syndrome and let the companies that work hard to charge you more convince you that they actually care more about you, because that sounds ridiculous to me."" Mr Zuckerberg also defended his leadership by invoking Amazon's chief executive. ""I make all of our decisions based on what's going to matter to our community and focus much less on the advertising side of the business,"" he said. ""I thought Jeff Bezos had an excellent saying: ""There are companies that work hard to charge you more, and there are companies that work hard to charge you less."" Elsewhere in the 49-minute interview, Mr Zuckerberg said he hoped to make Facebook more ""democratic"" by giving members a chance to challenge decisions its own review team had taken about what content to permit or ban. Eventually, he said, he wanted something like the ""Supreme Court"", in which people who did not work for the company made the ultimate call on what was acceptable speech. Mr Zuckerberg also responded to recent criticism from a UN probe into allegations of genocide against the Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar. Hundreds of thousands of Rohingya Muslims have fled Myanmar Last month,one of the human rights investigators saidFacebook had ""turned into a beast"" and had ""played a determining role"" in stirring up hatred against the group. Mr Zuckerberg claimed messages had been sent ""to each side of the conflict"" via Facebook Messenger, attempting to make them go to the same locations to fight. But he added that the firm had now set up systems to detect such activity. ""We stop those messages from going through,"" he added. ""But this is certainly something that we're paying a lot of attention to."" Facebook haunted by 'ugly truth' memo Zuckerberg's snub to MPs 'astonishing' Facebook data sharing - time to act?

Tourniquet Syndrome 'nearly cost my baby two toes',"Gemma Fraser with her daughter Orla An Edinburgh mum has described how her baby nearly lost two toes, after a strand of hair cut off circulation to them. Gemma Fraser is now warning other parents about the dangers of Tourniquet Syndrome. A strand of her own hair had bound her daughter's toes together, gradually getting tighter and acting like cheese wire. Medical experts have said the condition is more common than people think. Speaking onBBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme,Gemma Fraser told presenter Louise White about the trauma her family went through after her three-month-old daughter became a victim of Tourniquet Syndrome. A strand of Gemma's hair had somehow encircled two of Orla's toes in June last year, and the mum-of-two only noticed during a nappy change, when the toes had turned purple and were bulging. A strand of hair had cut off circulation The hair was wrapped so tightly that Gemma couldn't remove it herself, so she called an ambulance. A paramedic spent 45 minutes trying to cut the hair away. Orla was then sent to The Royal Hospital For Sick Children in Edinburgh to be checked further. After a consultation, the baby was sent home with some antibiotic cream. One of the toes healed over the next few weeks, but one of them did not. Gemma told Louise: ""It was still an open wound, and really swollen, and then pus started coming out of it."" After several more visits to the GP and the hospital, Orla was eventually referred to a plastic surgeon. ""It was still an open wound, you could peel the skin back and see inside her toe. One of the nurses eventually said she thought there was still some hair trapped inside the wound."" Orla is now happy and healthy The plastic surgeon, who was called to Sick Kids from St Johns Hospital in Livingston, had to operate on Orla without general anaesthetic as she was so young. He used an anaesthetic wipe instead, and while Gemma held a screaming Orla, the surgeon thoroughly cleaned out the wound. Gemma said it was 5 weeks between first spotting the problem, and having the surgery to remove the hair. She said she was shocked at how common the condition can be, and says she wants to let people know about it. ""One of the nurses told me about Tourniquet Syndrome, and I was just shocked when I found images of children who haven't been as lucky as Orla, and have had toes amputated."" Gemma said hair can become trapped in socks and babygrows in the washing machine, and is warning parents to check items before dressing their babies. ""When I look back, Orla was definitely out of sorts that weekend. I just wish I'd known to look for this as a possible cause."" Gemma Fraser, with baby Orla and older daughter Poppy Speaking on the same programme, midwife Cass McNamara said: ""People should be made aware, to check the baby everyday. Hair is incredibly strong and can act like fishing wire. This has led to babies having toes and fingers amputated. It can also affect the penis. ""If your baby is more fractious than usual, give him or her a good once over, to make sure there's nothing wrong. If you can see a hair, and it's easy to get off, take it off, but if it's really tight get to an A&E department as soon as possible. ""It's not just hair. The tourniquet can also be something like a strand from a wool blanket, or a loose piece of thread from socks or a babygrow.""

Israel to send African migrants to West,"African migrants at a detention facility in southern Israel Israel's prime minister has cancelled a deal with the UN to relocate African migrants living in the country, a day after reaching the agreement. Benjamin Netanyahu said he had taken the decision after consulting residents of south Tel Aviv, where many of the migrants live. He said he would now consider ""all options... to remove the infiltrators"". The fate of more than 30,000 migrants, who entered the country illegally, has long been a hugely contentious issue. The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, said Mr Netanyahu's decision was a ""disappointment"" and urged the Israeli government to ""consider the matter further"". This video can not be played The Eritrean runner fearing deportation from Israel Under the five-year plan, some 16,250 African migrants who entered the country illegally, many of them seeking asylum, would be resettled in Western nations, which Mr Netanyahu had said included Germany, Italy and Canada. Israel's unwanted African migrants For each migrant resettled overseas, Israel would give ""temporary residence"" to a migrant in Israel. However, the arrangement had drawn opposition from anti-migrant groups and from powerful politicians within his governing coalition. Canada will still take in a number of the migrants in Israel as it has a separate agreement with the Israeli government. According to Canadian reports, almost 2,000 asylum seekers who have requested either immigration status or asylum in Canada will be processed there. The issue has proven hugely controversial in Israel The UN deal had already replaced an earlier controversial plan for mass deportations to third-party countries in Africa if individuals did not go voluntarily. This had been suspended by Israel's Supreme Court. Mr Netanyahu said that agreement had failed because Rwanda had pulled out. Most of the African migrants in Israel are from Eritrea - a one-party state whose leaders have been accused of crimes against humanity by a UN inquiry - and war-torn Sudan. They say they fled danger at home and that it is not safe to return to another African country, but Israel considers the majority of African asylum seekers to be economic migrants. Most of them entered from Egypt several years ago, before a new fence was built along the desert border. This has ended most illegal crossings. Read about Eritrea More on Sudan A decision in January to offer the migrants a cash lump-sum and a plane ticket to leave Israel voluntarily or otherwise face forced expulsion was controversial in Israel. Some critics in the country and among the Jewish community abroad - including former ambassadors and Holocaust survivors - said the plan was unethical and a stain on Israel's international image. The UN refugee agency said it violated local and international laws, and large protests were held in Israel. Mr Netanyahu said the opposition was ""baseless and absurd"" and that Israel would resettle ""genuine refugees"". Activists, however, noted that only a handful of Eritreans and Sudanese had been recognised as refugees by Israel since the country took over the processing of applications from the UN in 2009.

West Brom part company with Pardew,"This video can not be played Pardew's final MOTD interview as West Brom boss West Bromwich Albion have parted company with manager Alan Pardew after eight successive league defeats. The 56-year-old wasappointed on 29 Novemberafter the Baggies sacked Tony Pulis following a run of 10 Premier League games without a victory. A2-1 home defeat by Burnleyon Saturday left bottom club Albion 10 points from safety with six games left. Coach Darren Moore has taken over the first-team and is likely to stay in charge for the rest of the season. Pardew has become the 10th permanent manager in the Premier League to leave his post this season, which is a joint record along with the 2013-14 campaign. The Baggies' statement read: ""West Bromwich Albion and Alan Pardew have agreed to mutually part company following discussions between both parties. ""Assistant head coach John Carver will also be leaving. ""The club would like to thank Alan and John for their efforts and wish them well in their future endeavours."" Pardew, a former team-mate of West Brom technical director Nick Hammond, was the club's sixth manager since 2011. West Brom won just once in 18 league games under him, taking only eight points from a possible 54. They are in their eighth successive Premier League season but have taken only 20 points from their 32 matches this campaign. Pardew's previous job in the Premier League was with Crystal Palace, who sacked him in December 2016 with the club 17th in the table. Hard to see a route back to management for Pardew - Wright Listen: West Brom pirates plotted to make Pardew walk the plank' He has managed 320 Premier League games with five different clubs. Pardew had a 34.3% win percentage at Palace, compared to 37.4% at Newcastle, 36.4% at West Ham and 26.3% at Charlton. His overall win percentage in the top flight is 34.1%. Pardew has the worst win percentage - 5.5% - of any permanent West Brom manager in the Premier League. He has won just two of his last 29 Premier League matches as a manager (D7 L20). Pardew's departure comes six weeks afterthe club sacked chairman John Williams and chief executive Martin Goodmanandfour of his players were accused of stealing a taxiduring a training camp in Barcelona. The players - Gareth Barry, Jonny Evans, Jake Livermore and Boaz Myhill - were questioned but not arrested by police, andlook to have avoided legal actionbecause of a lack of evidence. This video can not be played West Brom have had to 'repair' after incident in Barcelona - Pardew Pardew, who has also managed Reading, West Ham, Charlton, Southampton and Newcastle in an 18-year managerial career, has lost two FA Cup finals as a manager. He was named League Managers' Association Manager of the Year in 2012 after Newcastle finished fifth in the Premier League. However, he has also been involved in various controversies during his career. While West Ham boss in 2006, Pardew was involved in a confrontation with Arsenal manager Arsene Wenger, and in January 2014 he swore at Manchester City boss Manuel Pellegrini while at Newcastle. Two months after that, he was fined Â£100,000 and given a formal warning for headbutting Hull City midfielder David Meyler. Adrian Chiles, BBC Radio 5 live presenter and West Brom fan If you'd told me we'd be at this stage looking at our third manager of the season after just three wins I'd have said that was far-fetched. But it had to happen. You just can't lose as many consecutive games. If we'd had Pep Guardiola in and he'd lost that many games, we'd have had to get rid of him - that's just the way it is. I don't think anyone could accuse the board of being a quick-firing operation, I just think if anything it's too late. I'm sure Pardew's had enough, poor man, along with his assistant, and maybe the club have identified someone that can come in now and have a look at the squad before next season, have them over the summer and do something in the Championship. Darren Moore is a club legend and he'll have a lot of goodwill behind him. He can't get any worse. I must say with Pardew I can't celebrate him going because I found him to be a decent bloke and we looked to be improving when he took over. Nothing seemed to go right, the gods of football were against us. I don't know who could've come in and changed things around after Tony Pulis left. Rob Gurney, BBC WM's West Brom reporter Statistically, in the ""results business"" that is football, Pardew had nowhere to hide. The only surprise to many Albion fans is it hasn't happened before now. The ill-fated trip to Barcelona in February demonstrated that Pardew was struggling to exert any authority over the dressing room, and the time to part company was surely then. Clearly, he has accepted a smaller pay-off than he was due, to end his own personal nightmare before the full stop has been placed against this most desperate of seasons. So what now? Returning CEO Mark Jenkins told me recently that a Â£40m profit in the last financial year has already been spent - and more - meaning the club needs an overdraft for the first time in a decade. In the same interview, he also acknowledged that they need to do better as far as engaging with the fans is concerned, which is why I think a populist appointment may be the route they take. Someone with history as a player at The Hawthorns - Derek McInnes, a former Baggies' captain now very successfully in charge of Aberdeen - or Michael Appleton, another former midfielder, currently assistant to Claude Puel at Leicester. If it's either of those, or someone else, one thing's for certain - an enormous overhaul of the playing squad is required.

Israel scraps migrant deportation plan,"African migrants at a detention facility in southern Israel Israel's prime minister has cancelled a deal with the UN to relocate African migrants living in the country, a day after reaching the agreement. Benjamin Netanyahu said he had taken the decision after consulting residents of south Tel Aviv, where many of the migrants live. He said he would now consider ""all options... to remove the infiltrators"". The fate of more than 30,000 migrants, who entered the country illegally, has long been a hugely contentious issue. The UN's refugee agency, the UNHCR, said Mr Netanyahu's decision was a ""disappointment"" and urged the Israeli government to ""consider the matter further"". This video can not be played The Eritrean runner fearing deportation from Israel Under the five-year plan, some 16,250 African migrants who entered the country illegally, many of them seeking asylum, would be resettled in Western nations, which Mr Netanyahu had said included Germany, Italy and Canada. Israel's unwanted African migrants For each migrant resettled overseas, Israel would give ""temporary residence"" to a migrant in Israel. However, the arrangement had drawn opposition from anti-migrant groups and from powerful politicians within his governing coalition. Canada will still take in a number of the migrants in Israel as it has a separate agreement with the Israeli government. According to Canadian reports, almost 2,000 asylum seekers who have requested either immigration status or asylum in Canada will be processed there. The issue has proven hugely controversial in Israel The UN deal had already replaced an earlier controversial plan for mass deportations to third-party countries in Africa if individuals did not go voluntarily. This had been suspended by Israel's Supreme Court. Mr Netanyahu said that agreement had failed because Rwanda had pulled out. Most of the African migrants in Israel are from Eritrea - a one-party state whose leaders have been accused of crimes against humanity by a UN inquiry - and war-torn Sudan. They say they fled danger at home and that it is not safe to return to another African country, but Israel considers the majority of African asylum seekers to be economic migrants. Most of them entered from Egypt several years ago, before a new fence was built along the desert border. This has ended most illegal crossings.

Tesla rebuked by death crash investigators,"Tesla had acknowledged that its Autopilot function was active at the time of a crash last month Electric car-maker Tesla has been admonished by the US watchdog investigating a recent fatal crash involving one of its cars. The National Transportation Safety Board said it was ""unhappy"" the firm had made public details of the probe. The company had blogged on Friday that the Model X car'sAutopilot self-steering system,externalwas in use at the time of the accident. Walter Huang, an Apple engineer, died after his car hit a barrier. Tesla had also revealed that logs from the vehicle's computer had indicated that the 38-year-old's hands were not on the steering wheel in the six seconds prior to the collision on California's Route 101. It said the car had provided several ""hands-on"" warnings earlier in the journey. In addition, it said that the safety barrier involved had been crushed and not replaced after an earlier accident, meaning it would not have been able to reduce the force of the impact as intended. ""At this time the NTSB needs the assistance of Tesla to decode the data the vehicle recorded,"" responded the agency's spokesman Chris O'Neil in a statementfirst published by the Washington Post,external. ""In each of our investigations involving a Tesla vehicle, Tesla has been extremely co-operative on assisting with the vehicle data. ""However, the NTSB is unhappy with the release of investigative information by Tesla."" Tesla in fatal crash was on Autopilot Uber barred from resuming self-drive trial Can we trust self-drive cars? It is unusual for the agency to announce its displeasure in this manner. The Bloomberg news agency noted that the organisationhad previously expelled airlines and aircraft-makers,externalfrom other investigations in which unauthorised statements had been given. Several news reports had speculated that Tesla's Autopilot technology had been active at the time of the 23 March crash. And it is likely the firm made its announcement to avoid the detail leaking out and being confirmed without further context. There had already been a report by ABC News that Mr Huang had made complaintsabout the performance of his car's Autopilot facility,externalprior to the accident. But Tesla has downplayed the claim. ""We've been doing a thorough search of our service records and we cannot find anything suggesting that the customer ever complained to Tesla about the performance of Autopilot,"" a spokeswoman told the BBC. ""There was a concern raised once about navigation not working correctly, but Autopilot's performance is unrelated to navigation."" Tesla's semi-autonomous driving technology had been involved in an earlier fatalitywhen a Model S car collided with a lorry in 2016. The death of a woman in Arizona, who was hit by one ofUber's self-drive test vehicles in March, had also recently raised fresh concerns about the use of automated car tech on public roads. In a related development, it has emerged that Tesla has changed the way that Autopilot is controlled on its Model 3 cars. Model 3 owners can now adjust use of Autopilot without having to look at the car's display Until now, the function could be switched on and off via a steering wheel button, but other adjustments required the driver to use a touchscreen, which might distract them from the road. News site Engadget reports that its settings can now be changedvia the steering wheel's scroll buttons,external.

India's boxing coach denies Games doping,"The coach of India's men's boxing team at the Commonwealth Games has denied doping has taken place after syringes were found in the athletes' village. Santiago Nieva said one fighter had been given a vitamin injection because he was unwell. Games organisers had summoned officials from a team they would not name over a breach of the ""no-needle"" policy. It comes two days before the opening ceremony of the 2018 Games on the Gold Coast in Australia. Reports say a cleaner at the athletes' village tipped off organisers about the presence of the syringes. BBC coverage of 2018 Commonwealth Games ""I'm confident that our boxers haven't taken anything,"" Mr Nieva told Australia's 7 News. ""We had one boxer that wasn't very feeling well and the doctor has given him an injection."" Asked if the boxer was given a performance-enhancing drug, Mr Nieva said: ""No, that was a vitamin substance."" Commonwealth Games officials are analysing the syringes. In a statement the Commonwealth Games Federation said: ""The CGF has concluded its investigation into an alleged violation of the CGF's no-needle policy. ""Their findings have been escalated to the CGF's federation court, which will conduct a hearing in to the matter on Tuesday. ""For clarification, this matter is not defined as an anti-doping rule violation, but rather as an infringement of the CGF's no-needle policy, which has been introduced by major events organisers to ensure best medical practices."" Earlier the federation's chief executive, David Grevemberg, said officials from a country he declined to identify had been summoned to a meeting with the organisation's medical commission.

German dachshund museum 'a world first',"Dachshund ornaments show the centuries-old affection for the German breed A new museum in the Bavarian city of Passau celebrates Germany's - and the world's - affection for the dachshund. More than 4,500 toys and other items showcase the breed popularly called the ""sausage dog"", a symbol of Bavaria. A dachshund called Waldi was the mascot of the 1972 Munich Olympics. The Dackelmuseum was created by two former florists, whose collection was amassed over 25 years. Artist Pablo Picasso and physicist Albert Einstein were among the dachshund's many fans. The museum opened on Monday in the heart of Passau, in the elegant Residenzplatz. The curators say it is the world's biggest collection of dachshund-themed objects. ""The world needs a sausage dog museum... No other dog in the world enjoys the same kind of recognition or popularity as the symbol of Bavaria, the sausage dog,"" said co-founder Seppi KÃ¼blbeck. Canine stamps, prints with sausage dog motifs and porcelain dachshunds are on display. Germans bred dachshunds in the Middle Ages to flush out badgers and foxes from their burrows, to stop them attacking ducks and hens. The dogs' passion for hunting was a highly prized trait.

Dwayne Johnson talks of depression battle,"Johnson has starred in San Andreas, Baywatch and multiple Fast & Furious films Dwayne Johnson has thanked fans for their support after he opened up about his battle with depression. The 45-year-old discussed his mother's suicide attempt and a period he described as the ""worst time"" of his life inan interview with The Express.,external ""Got tonnes of responses to this. Thank you,"" he wrote on Twitter on Monday. ""We all go through the sludge and depression never discriminates. ""Took me a long time to realise it but the key is to not be afraid to open up. ""Especially us dudes have a tendency to keep it in. You're not alone."" The actor has previously alluded to his battle with mental health. When a fan recently told him he was suffering depression, Johnson wrote back: ""I hear you. I've battled that beast more than once."" In the new interview, which was published over the weekend, Johnson said: ""I reached a point where I didn't want to do a thing or go anywhere. I was crying constantly."" The actor also discussed the time, when he was aged 15, his mother tried to kill herself in front of him. ""She got out of the car on Interstate 65 in Nashville and walked into oncoming traffic,"" he recalled. ""Big rigs and cars were swerving out of the way. I grabbed her and pulled her back on the gravel shoulder of the road."" He added: ""What's crazy about that suicide attempt is that to this day, she has no recollection of it whatsoever.

Profile: Winnie Madikizela-Mandela,"This video can not be played Who was Winnie Mandela? Winnie Madikizela-Mandela became a potent symbol of South Africa's anti-apartheid struggle when she was banished and jailed for campaigning for the rights of black South Africans and her husband's release. For decades she and her then-husband, the iconic Nelson Mandela, were the country's most famous political couple - but Mr Mandela divorced her in 1996. After their separation she kept his surname and they maintained ties, leading to critics accusing her of attempting to use his name for political mileage. In later life her reputation later became tainted by a fraud conviction and murder accusations, which she denied. Born in Bizana in Cape Province in 1936, she met Mr Mandela in 1957. He was married at the time to Evelyn Mase but the marriage was breaking up. The next year they married - she was a young bride, 16 years his junior, glamorous and strong-willed. However, they were destined to have little time together as political activism and a period in hiding kept Mr Mandela apart from her. Known as ""mama"" or ""mother of the nation"", controversy befell her in later life The couple had two daughters before Nelson was imprisoned, Zenani and Zindzi He was jailed for life in 1964 and only released in 1990. While he was in prison, she took on an increasingly political role, partly because of constant harassment by the South African security police. She became an international symbol of resistance to apartheid and a rallying point for poor, black township residents who demanded their freedom. Her resistance to harassment and championing of the anti-apartheid cause led to periods of imprisonment from 1969, much of it spent in solitary confinement. In 1976, the year of the Soweto riots, she was banished from the township to a remote rural area. At one stage her house was burned down, with suspicion falling on the South African security forces. This led to her being dubbed the ""Mother of the Nation"". By the mid-1980s and the start of a long period of township militancy against the white government of President P W Botha, she was back in Soweto and at the heart of the struggle. 1936: Born in Cape Province 1958: Married Nelson Mandela 1969: Jailed for 18 months for anti-apartheid activities 1976: Banished to rural area by apartheid authorities 1991: Convicted of kidnapping 1996: Divorced from Nelson Mandela 2003: Convicted of fraud Her image and activism drew to her many anti-apartheid activists, including a group of young men who became her personal bodyguards. They became known as the Mandela United Football Club. Her prominence led to great influence over young, radical township activists but also growing controversy. As activists turned on suspected police informers or collaborators, the use of rubber tyres filled with petrol as brutal murder weapons, known as ""necklaces"", became widespread. At one rally she controversially seemed to endorse their use. Even greater controversy came when she was accused by senior anti-apartheid activists of involvement in the killing of a 14-year-old township militant, Stompie Seipei. Stompie had been seized by Ms Madikizela-Mandela's bodyguards in 1989 and was later found dead. Members of the ANC leadership accused her of being behind the killing and of conducting a virtual reign of terror in parts of Soweto. The former first lady remained largely unmoved during testimony against her at the Truth and Reconciliation Commission in 1997 From prison, Mr Mandela continued to support his wife. In 1991, after his release, she was charged with the assault and kidnapping of Stompie and one of her bodyguards was charged with his murder. She denied the allegations but was found guilty of kidnapping and sentenced to six years imprisonment. This was reduced to a fine by an appeal court. Her marriage to Mr Mandela broke down in the years after his release and they were divorced in 1996. President Mandela accused her of adultery, and in the same year, dismissed her as deputy minister of arts and culture - the only post she has held in government since white minority rule ended. Her split from Mr Mandela did little to harm her political standing among poor, black South Africans who saw her as their voice at a time when the ANC had adopted pro-business policies. But at the same time she became known for an increasingly lavish lifestyle, arriving to testify at Truth and Reconciliation Commission hearings in a white Mercedes limousine surrounded by bodyguards. In 2003, Ms Madikizela-Mandela suffered another blow when a court convicted her of fraud and theft in connection with a bank loan scandal. The sentencing magistrate compared her to a modern-day Robin Hood, fraudulently acquiring loans for people who were desperately short of money, but he said that as a prominent public figure she should have known better. An appeal judge overturned the conviction for theft, but upheld the one for fraud, handing her a three-year-and-six-month suspended sentence. This dented her career, but she remained respected in the ANC, and was an MP until her death. At the ANC conference in 2007, she was elected to the party's top decision-making body, the National Executive Committee, and in the 2009 general election, she was placed fifth on the list of ANC MPs nominated for parliament, in a clear sign that then-President Jacob Zuma saw her as an electoral asset. She would later clash with him and become political patron of the youth leader Julius Malema. Ms Madikizela-Mandela described being there for the final moments of her ex-husband's life in 2013, and appeared in a prominent position at memorial services in his honour. She and widow Graca Machel were pictured wiping away tears together while mourning After his death, she became embroiled in a legal battle over his village home, which she wanted for their two daughters, Zinzi and Zenani. The Supreme Court affirmed a decision that she held no claim to it in January 2018. The same month she was honoured with an honorary degree from Makerere University in Uganda for her anti-apartheid campaigning. Although she remained in the political limelight, she was granted leave from parliament in March 2018 due to ill health. A family spokesman confirmed her death on 2 April, aged 81. Her family said she had suffered from a ""long illness"" and had been in and out of hospital in the last months of her life. ""She succumbed peacefully in the early hours of Monday afternoon surrounded by her family and loved ones,"" spokesman Victor Dlamini said in a statement. Winnie Mandela's story in opera.

"Russia accuses West of 'children's games'The foreign minister hits out at diplomatic expulsions, accusing the UK over the Skripal attack.1han hour agoEurope","Mr Lavrov also suggested last month's poisoning could be in the interests of the British government Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the UK and Western partners of playing ""children's games"" in their response to the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. He accused countries of ""disregarding all accepted behaviour"" and resorting to ""open lies and disinformation"". Twenty-nine nations have expelled diplomats over the poisoning, which the UK holds Russia responsible for. Mr Lavrov also issued fresh denials at the news conference on Monday. He made the comments in response to a question by the BBC's Steve Rosenberg about how dangerous growing tensions were between Russia and the West in comparison with the Cold War. ""In the classic Cold War,"" Sergei Lavrov said, ""there were rules and accepted behaviour"". ""I think our Western partners, I think firstly Great Britain and the USA and a few other countries that blindly follow them, have disregarded all the accepted behaviour."" Russian media accuse West of 'crusade' Russian spy: What we know so far Is this a new Cold War? ""We do not want to play children's games, but so far our partners are doing precisely that,"" he added, saying it was up to them to reduce tensions. ""When we were kids we used to say whoever started it should be the one to finish it."" This video can not be played Estonian President tells Today Western unity will not be broken During the news conference he also suggested the poisoning could be ""in the interests of the British government"" because of the ""uncomfortable situation"" they had found themselves in with Brexit. ""There are other explanations. The experts are speaking about them. They say it may well be beneficial for the British special services who are known for their ability to act with a license to kill."" ""There could be a whole number of reasons and none of them can be ruled out,"" Mr Lavrov said. The poisoning row has rumbled on for nearly a month, with the UK saying it is adamant Russia was behind it. Russia has now told the UK more than 50 of its diplomats have to leave the country, after the British government ordered a cut to 23 Russian staff over last month's Salisbury poisoning. Russia said their deeper cut is so the two nations have parity in representation. Other governments - including the United States - also ordered expulsions of scores of Russian diplomats from their countries, deepening the row. This video can not be played Eurovision-style? The BBC's Steve Rosenberg on how the Russia media is reporting the score-settling On Monday Mr Lavrov said it was wrong to target diplomats who ""by definition intended to support relations, resolve complicated situations and find way out of difficulties"". How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network? What the expulsions mean for Russia What happens when you expel a diplomat? ""In diplomacy, we have the principle of reciprocity and this is still the case. And this principle will be applied consistently,"" he said. Separately, Russia suggested the searching of an incoming Russian plane at Heathrow Airport was ""illegal"" and a ""blatant provocation"". The British government rejected the complaint,and said the search was ""routine"". Also on Monday, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov announced that US President Donald Trump had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to a meeting at the White House during their 20 March phone call, according to the TASS state media agency. ""When our presidents spoke on the phone, it was Trump who proposed holding the first meeting in Washington in the White House,"" Mr Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. ""If everything will be alright, I hope that the Americans will not back away from their own proposal to discuss the possibility of holding a summit,"" Mr Ushakov added. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders responded: ""As the President himself confirmed on March 20, hours after his last call with President Putin, the two had discussed a bilateral meeting in the 'not-too-distant future' at a number of potential venues, including the White House."" Ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned on 4 March in Salisbury with what UK investigators have concluded was a Russian nerve agent called Novichok. Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father Mr Skripal remains critically ill, but stable, but his daughter is said to be conscious and talking. The Russian Embassy in London ""insists on the right to see"" Ms Skripal, who is a Russian citizen. The UK government has said it is considering the request. The Russian embassy also published a list of 27 questions,externalit said it had officially asked the British government about the poisoning. What are Novichok agents?

Poor pupils 'filling pockets with food',"Malnourished pupils with grey skin are ""filling their pockets"" with food from school canteens in poor areas due to poverty, head teachers say. The heads, from various parts of England and Wales, described differences in the appearance of some pupils. One head said: ""My children have grey skin, poor teeth, poor hair; they are thinner."" The government said measures were in place to tackle poverty. Lynn, a head teacher from a former industrial town in Cumbria, who did not want to give her full name, was one of a number of head teachers speaking to reporters at the National Education Union conference in Brighton. They were highlighting the issues faced by an increasing number of children growing up in poverty, and how their experiences affect their education. Lynn said that hunger was particularly apparent after the weekend. She said: ""Children are filling their pockets with food. In some establishments that would be called stealing. We call it survival."" Another head teacher from Nottinghamshire, Louise Regan, said: ""When you take children out to an event, maybe a sporting event, you see children of the same age from schools in an affluent area. ""It's the grey skin, the pallor. It's the pallor you really notice."" She went on: ""Monday morning is the worst. ""There are a number of families that we target that we know are going to be coming into school hungry. ""By the time it's 9.30am they are tired."" She said her school supplied some pupils with clean uniforms, and that they often came back in the same clothes, grubby, after the weekend. The school has a food bank which gives out food parcels and a supply of clothes, shoes and coats for those without. Lynn said: ""We have washing machines and we are washing the children's clothes while they do PE. ""We wouldn't have it that these children are stigmatised because their clothes are dirty."" The school also runs a summer school for three weeks over the holidays, run voluntarily by teaching staff without pay. Howard Payne, a head at an inner city school in Portsmouth, said there had been a four-fold increase in the number of children with child protection issues. ""Every one of these issues has had something to do with the poverty that they live in,"" he said. ""It's neglect. It's because they and their families don't have enough money to provide food, heating or even bedding."" Mr Payne, who provides debt counselling and family support at his school, said: ""Three weeks ago, many schools in our area closed because of the snow. ""I kept ours open because I was really worried about the children - that they wouldn't have a hot meal to eat that day."" He said about 45% of pupils came into the school to eat that day. All the heads said things were getting worse as social and emotional support services were disappearing. The comments came as the NEU published research it had carried out with the Child Poverty Action Group. It found schools were increasingly stepping in to fill the poverty gap, with almost half of the 900 respondents saying their school offered one or more anti-poverty services such as a food bank, clothes bank or even offering emergency loans to families. More than four-fifths said they saw signs of children being hungry during the day, and about the same said they saw children showing signs of poor health. Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: ""With nine children in every classroom of 30 falling below the official poverty line, it is time to rebuild the safety net for struggling families."" Lynn added: ""My families are proud. Some of these parents are working two or three jobs and can't access the benefits system. ""They are just a few pounds over - they have less money than those on benefits."" Jane Jenkins, a head teacher from Cardiff, said children in her school often only brought a slice of bread and margarine for lunch and that teachers supplemented this. ""It's really difficult and when people are asking you about standards, why we don't go up the league tables? ""That's often a secondary consideration."" The Department for Education said it wanted to create a country where everyone could go as far as their talents could take them. ""That's why we launched our social mobility action plan, which sets out measures to close the attainment gap between disadvantaged students and their peers, and targets areas that need the most support through the Â£72m Opportunity Areas programme."" A spokesman also highlighted the Â£2.5bn it invests in disadvantaged pupils through the Pupil Premium and a recent Â£26m investment in breakfast clubs.

Tourniquet Syndrome nearly cost my baby two toes',"Gemma Fraser with her daughter Orla An Edinburgh mum has described how her baby nearly lost two toes, after a strand of hair cut off circulation to them. Gemma Fraser is now warning other parents about the dangers of Tourniquet Syndrome. A strand of her own hair had bound her daughter's toes together, gradually getting tighter and acting like cheese wire. Medical experts have said the condition is more common than people think. Speaking onBBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme,Gemma Fraser told presenter Louise White about the trauma her family went through after her three-month-old daughter became a victim of Tourniquet Syndrome. A strand of Gemma's hair had somehow encircled two of Orla's toes in June last year, and the mum-of-two only noticed during a nappy change, when the toes had turned purple and were bulging. A strand of hair had cut off circulation The hair was wrapped so tightly that Gemma couldn't remove it herself, so she called an ambulance. A paramedic spent 45 minutes trying to cut the hair away. Orla was then sent to The Royal Hospital For Sick Children in Edinburgh to be checked further. After a consultation, the baby was sent home with some antibiotic cream. One of the toes healed over the next few weeks, but one of them did not. Gemma told Louise: ""It was still an open wound, and really swollen, and then pus started coming out of it."" After several more visits to the GP and the hospital, Orla was eventually referred to a plastic surgeon. ""It was still an open wound, you could peel the skin back and see inside her toe. One of the nurses eventually said she thought there was still some hair trapped inside the wound."" Orla is now happy and healthy The plastic surgeon, who was called to Sick Kids from St Johns Hospital in Livingston, had to operate on Orla without general anaesthetic as she was so young. He used an anaesthetic wipe instead, and while Gemma held a screaming Orla, the surgeon thoroughly cleaned out the wound. Gemma said it was 5 weeks between first spotting the problem, and having the surgery to remove the hair. She said she was shocked at how common the condition can be, and says she wants to let people know about it. ""One of the nurses told me about Tourniquet Syndrome, and I was just shocked when I found images of children who haven't been as lucky as Orla, and have had toes amputated."" Gemma said hair can become trapped in socks and babygrows in the washing machine, and is warning parents to check items before dressing their babies. ""When I look back, Orla was definitely out of sorts that weekend. I just wish I'd known to look for this as a possible cause."" Gemma Fraser, with baby Orla and older daughter Poppy Speaking on the same programme, midwife Cass McNamara said: ""People should be made aware, to check the baby everyday. Hair is incredibly strong and can act like fishing wire. This has led to babies having toes and fingers amputated. It can also affect the penis. ""If your baby is more fractious than usual, give him or her a good once over, to make sure there's nothing wrong. If you can see a hair, and it's easy to get off, take it off, but if it's really tight get to an A&E department as soon as possible. ""It's not just hair. The tourniquet can also be something like a strand from a wool blanket, or a loose piece of thread from socks or a babygrow.""

"Russia accuses West of 'children's games'The foreign minister hits out at diplomatic expulsions, saying the UK could be behind the Skripal attack.1h36 minutes agoEurope","Mr Lavrov also suggested last month's poisoning could be in the interests of the British government Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has accused the UK and Western partners of playing ""children's games"" in their response to the poisoning of ex-spy Sergei Skripal and his daughter. He accused countries of ""disregarding all accepted behaviour"" and resorting to ""open lies and disinformation"". Twenty-nine nations have expelled diplomats over the poisoning, which the UK holds Russia responsible for. Mr Lavrov also issued fresh denials at the news conference on Monday. He made the comments in response to a question by the BBC's Steve Rosenberg about how dangerous growing tensions were between Russia and the West in comparison with the Cold War. ""In the classic Cold War,"" Sergei Lavrov said, ""there were rules and accepted behaviour"". ""I think our Western partners, I think firstly Great Britain and the USA and a few other countries that blindly follow them, have disregarded all the accepted behaviour."" Russian media accuse West of 'crusade' Russian spy: What we know so far Is this a new Cold War? ""We do not want to play children's games, but so far our partners are doing precisely that,"" he added, saying it was up to them to reduce tensions. ""When we were kids we used to say whoever started it should be the one to finish it."" This video can not be played Estonian President tells Today Western unity will not be broken During the news conference he also suggested the poisoning could be ""in the interests of the British government"" because of the ""uncomfortable situation"" they had found themselves in with Brexit. ""There are other explanations. The experts are speaking about them. They say it may well be beneficial for the British special services who are known for their ability to act with a license to kill."" ""There could be a whole number of reasons and none of them can be ruled out,"" Mr Lavrov said. The poisoning row has rumbled on for nearly a month, with the UK saying it is adamant Russia was behind it. Russia has now told the UK more than 50 of its diplomats have to leave the country, after the British government ordered a cut to 23 Russian staff over last month's Salisbury poisoning. Russia said their deeper cut is so the two nations have parity in representation. Other governments - including the United States - also ordered expulsions of scores of Russian diplomats from their countries, deepening the row. This video can not be played Eurovision-style? The BBC's Steve Rosenberg on how the Russia media is reporting the score-settling On Monday Mr Lavrov said it was wrong to target diplomats who ""by definition intended to support relations, resolve complicated situations and find way out of difficulties"". How big is the Kremlin's diplomatic network? What the expulsions mean for Russia What happens when you expel a diplomat? ""In diplomacy, we have the principle of reciprocity and this is still the case. And this principle will be applied consistently,"" he said. Separately, Russia suggested the searching of an incoming Russian plane at Heathrow Airport was ""illegal"" and a ""blatant provocation"". The British government rejected the complaint,and said the search was ""routine"". Also on Monday, Kremlin aide Yury Ushakov announced that US President Donald Trump had invited Russian President Vladimir Putin to a meeting at the White House during their 20 March phone call, according to the TASS state media agency. ""When our presidents spoke on the phone, it was Trump who proposed holding the first meeting in Washington in the White House,"" Mr Ushakov said, according to Russian state news agency RIA Novosti. ""If everything will be alright, I hope that the Americans will not back away from their own proposal to discuss the possibility of holding a summit,"" Mr Ushakov added. White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders responded: ""As the President himself confirmed on March 20, hours after his last call with President Putin, the two had discussed a bilateral meeting in the 'not-too-distant future' at a number of potential venues, including the White House."" Ex-spy Sergei Skripal, 66, and daughter Yulia, 33, were poisoned on 4 March in Salisbury with what UK investigators have concluded was a Russian nerve agent called Novichok. Yulia Skripal, from Moscow, was found on the bench alongside her father Mr Skripal remains critically ill, but stable, but his daughter is said to be conscious and talking. The Russian Embassy in London ""insists on the right to see"" Ms Skripal, who is a Russian citizen. The UK government has said it is considering the request. The Russian embassy also published a list of 27 questions,externalit said it had officially asked the British government about the poisoning. What are Novichok agents?

Hill Street Blues creator dies aged 74,"Bochco is seen here in 1996 US television producer and writer Steven Bochco, who created some of America's best known police drama series, has died aged 74. Born in New York, he helped define modern TV drama through work like Hill Street Blues, LA Law and NYPD Blue. His award-winning innovations included story lines spread over several hour-long programmes, ensemble casts and edgy content. Bochco had been battling a rare form of leukaemia for several years. The writer was nominated for 30 Emmy awards and won 10 of them. The seven series of cop show Hill Street Blues won a further 26. The son of a painter and violin virtuoso, he  grew up in Manhattan. After studying at New York University and the Carnegie Institute of Technology, he went to work for Universal Pictures as a writer and story editor on the detective series Ironside and Columbo. From 2014 until 2016, he wrote and produced Murder in the First, a US police drama starring Taye Diggs and Kathleen Robertson. How realistic are TV cop shows? As news of Bochco's death emerged, actors and industry insiders paid tribute to a man who changed their art-form forever. Actress Debra Messing, who starred in the US sitcom Will & Grace, called him ""a pioneer, a gentleman"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Space lab comes down over South PacificChina's defunct Tiangong-1 space lab mostly burnt up on re-entering the Earth's atmosphere.10h10 hours agoScience & Environment,"China's space lab Tiangong-1 was tracked on radar China's defunct Tiangong-1 space lab mostly broke up on re-entering the Earth's atmosphere above the South Pacific, Chinese and US reports say. It re-entered the atmosphere around 00:15 GMT on Monday, China's Manned Space Engineering Office said. Tiangong-1 was launched in 2011 to carry out docking and orbit experiments. It was part of China's efforts to build a manned space station by 2022, but stopped working in March 2016. The rather vague ""above the South Pacific"" is the line from space officials. US specialists at the Joint Force Space Component Command said they had used orbit analysis technology to confirm Tiangong-1's re-entry. Astronomer Jonathan McDowell, from the Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics, tweeted that it appeared to have come down north-west of Tahiti. Allow Twitter content?

Experts had struggled to predict exactly where the lab would make its re-entry - and China's space agency wrongly suggested it would be off Sao Paulo, Brazil, shortly before the moment came. The European Space Agency said in advance that Tiangong-1 would probably break up over water, which covers much of the Earth's surface. It stressed that the chances of anyone being hit by debris from the module were ""10 million times smaller than the yearly chance of being hit by lightning"". It's not clear how much of the debris reached the Earth's surface intact. Ideally, the 10m (32ft)-long Tiangong module would have been taken out of orbit in a planned manner.

'More than half' face broadband problems,"One in five British households have experienced slow broadband speeds in the last year, according to Which. A similar number have had connection dropouts and router problems, the consumer rights group added. It polled more than 1,900 customers across 12 providers, more than half of whom reported having problems with their broadband service or price. Which said providers had ""a long way to go"" to meet customer expectations. The survey looked at the biggest providers, including BT, Sky, TalkTalk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet. Together they serve about 90% of UK broadband customers. Superfast broadband: Rural residents 'left in the lurch' Three million homes to get ultrafast broadband It said TalkTalk customers were most likely to experience ""very slow"" speeds, with 31% of them reporting problems over the last 12 months. They were followed by BT users, 23% of whom had issues. Sky came next, with 22% of its customers having complained. When it came to connection dropouts, SSE was the worst performer with almost a quarter of its customers affected. And Which said Virgin Media customers were the most likely to face router issues, and be left with no internet at all ""for hours or even days at a time"". Overall, Virgin Media customers reported feeling most dissatisfied with their service, although their top complaint was about recent price rises, with some 47% reporting an increase in the last year. Price was also the top complaint about BT, with 30% of customers reporting an increase. A Virgin Media spokesman said: ""We do everything we can to balance keeping our prices competitive while investing to meet customers' ever-increasing appetite for faster broadband and better content."" It comes despitenew measures from Ofcom,externaloffering automatic compensation for slow repairs, missed appointments and delayed installations. Alex Neill, Which's managing director of home products and services, said: ""It's clear that too many households are still suffering from substandard broadband and our research shows that providers have a long way to go before they meet their customers' expectations. ""Customers who suffer from a shoddy broadband service will welcome new measures for automatic compensation, however providers should do more to stop these problems from happening in the first place."" Digital minister Margot James said: ""Broadband has become a modern necessity, and we all know how frustrating it is when it doesn't work. ""We've introduced a raft of measures with Ofcom to help protect consumers, including receiving compensation when their service falls short, and making it easier for customers to switch provider if they're not getting what they've paid for and are entitled to.""

Tourniquet Syndrome nearly cost my baby two toes'An Edinburgh mum warns parents about Tourniquet Syndrome after her baby came close to having toes amputated.,"Gemma Fraser with her daughter Orla An Edinburgh mum has described how her baby nearly lost two toes, after a strand of hair cut off circulation to them. Gemma Fraser is now warning other parents about the dangers of Tourniquet Syndrome. A strand of her own hair had bound her daughter's toes together, gradually getting tighter and acting like cheese wire. Medical experts have said the condition is more common than people think. Speaking onBBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme,Gemma Fraser told presenter Louise White about the trauma her family went through after her three-month-old daughter became a victim of Tourniquet Syndrome. A strand of Gemma's hair had somehow encircled two of Orla's toes in June last year, and the mum-of-two only noticed during a nappy change, when the toes had turned purple and were bulging. A strand of hair had cut off circulation The hair was wrapped so tightly that Gemma couldn't remove it herself, so she called an ambulance. A paramedic spent 45 minutes trying to cut the hair away. Orla was then sent to The Royal Hospital For Sick Children in Edinburgh to be checked further. After a consultation, the baby was sent home with some antibiotic cream. One of the toes healed over the next few weeks, but one of them did not. Gemma told Louise: ""It was still an open wound, and really swollen, and then pus started coming out of it."" After several more visits to the GP and the hospital, Orla was eventually referred to a plastic surgeon. ""It was still an open wound, you could peel the skin back and see inside her toe. One of the nurses eventually said she thought there was still some hair trapped inside the wound."" Orla is now happy and healthy The plastic surgeon, who was called to Sick Kids from St Johns Hospital in Livingston, had to operate on Orla without general anaesthetic as she was so young. He used an anaesthetic wipe instead, and while Gemma held a screaming Orla, the surgeon thoroughly cleaned out the wound. Gemma said it was 5 weeks between first spotting the problem, and having the surgery to remove the hair. She said she was shocked at how common the condition can be, and says she wants to let people know about it. ""One of the nurses told me about Tourniquet Syndrome, and I was just shocked when I found images of children who haven't been as lucky as Orla, and have had toes amputated."" Gemma said hair can become trapped in socks and babygrows in the washing machine, and is warning parents to check items before dressing their babies. ""When I look back, Orla was definitely out of sorts that weekend. I just wish I'd known to look for this as a possible cause."" Gemma Fraser, with baby Orla and older daughter Poppy Speaking on the same programme, midwife Cass McNamara said: ""People should be made aware, to check the baby everyday. Hair is incredibly strong and can act like fishing wire. This has led to babies having toes and fingers amputated. It can also affect the penis. ""If your baby is more fractious than usual, give him or her a good once over, to make sure there's nothing wrong. If you can see a hair, and it's easy to get off, take it off, but if it's really tight get to an A&E department as soon as possible. ""It's not just hair. The tourniquet can also be something like a strand from a wool blanket, or a loose piece of thread from socks or a babygrow.""

BBC seeks expert gender balance by 2019,"This video can not be played The 50:50 challenge explained The BBC wants to ensure an equal number of male and female expert contributors appear on its news programmes by April 2019, the corporation has said. It stressed the scheme focuses on contributors rather than individuals who are in charge or accountable. A report on the organisation's progress will be produced in a year's time. The BBC has recently come under firefor the gender imbalance on itslist of best-paid starsand its gender pay gap of 9.3%. In 2016 research conducted by City University London,externalfound the male to female ratio for experts on the UK's broadcast news programmes between October 2015 and March 2016 stood at 3:1. BBC News at Ten had a ratio of 3.8:1 and for Radio 4's Today programme the figure was 2.8:1. BBC director general Tony Hall said seeking a 50:50 gender split would ""transform the range of expert voices across the BBC."" News, current affairs and a range of topical programmes on the BBC will follow the example set by the programme Outside Source. In January 2017 Outside Source began self monitoring the gender of those featured on its programme and has since achieved an equal balance.

"System working, CPS chief insists","No-one is in jail after being wrongly convicted due to failures to disclose evidence, the UK's top prosecutor has said ""as far as she can tell"". Alison Saunders' comments come after several rape trials collapsed when it emerged that vital evidence had not been shared with defence lawyers. The Metropolitan Police has launched a reviewof 30 sex crime cases. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Saunders said it actually showed the justice system was working. She said that the collapsed trials demonstrate that ""safeguards in place"" in the trial process prevent wrongful imprisonment. She added that ""the ever-increasing use of social media, all the digital material we obtain,"" can create a problem and that although police had to ""pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry"" it was not reasonable to expect them to explore ""every single avenue"" of what a person had ever done in their life. Collapsed rape trial man to sue police Rape prosecutions 'at record high' In December, the trials of Isaac Itiary, who was accused of raping a child, and Liam Allan. both collapsed within a week of each other when new evidence came to light. The case against Mr Allan at Croydon Crown Court was dropped after three days when it emerged that evidence on a computer disc - which police had looked through - showed there were messages in which the alleged victim had pestered him for ""casual sex"". During Mr Itiary's trial, police failed to disclose messages which showed that the girl, then 16 years old, had told the defendant she was 19. A third trial concerning an alleged rape after the 2016 Noting Hill Carnival collapsed on Monday after the defendant's legal team found undisclosed images on his mobile phone. More than a dozen photographs appeared to show the couple together in bed. Regarding the case, Ms Saunders said: ""How would anyone have known that there were photographs there until the defence had told us that they were there?"" ""The system worked. What I think should have happened in that case is that it should have happened much earlier."" Anna Soubry, a Conservative MP. said on Twitter she feared Ms Saunders was ""part of the problem"".

"London murder rate overtakes New York'sAn ex-senior Met Police officer says he is ""absolutely devastated"" by the figures for 2018.15h15 hours agoLondon","Two teenagers were stabbed to death in Camden on 20 February A spike in violent crime in London saw more murders committed in the city in February and March than there were in New York, figures show. So far in 2018, the Met Police has investigated 46 murders, compared with 50 in the US city. But, while New York's murder rate decreased from the end of January, London's rose markedly from that point. Ex-Met Police Ch Supt Leroy Logan says it is proof that ""London's violent traits have become a virus"". Statistics from the New York Police Department (NYPD) and the Metropolitan Police,reported in the Sunday Times,externaland obtained by the BBC, highlight narrowing murder rates between the two cities, which have similar population sizes. Can Scottish police help stop violent deaths in London? Met Police chief: Social media leads children to violence Nine charts on the rise of knife crime in England and Wales City Hall says it is ""deeply concerned"" by knife crime in the capital, but, along with the Met Police, insists London ""remains one of the safest [cities] in the world"". In January, the Met investigated eight murders whereas the NYPD looked into 18 killings By February, the NYPD's figures had dropped to 11, while London's rose to 15 In March, 22 murders were investigated in London while 21 inquiries were launched in New York When the figures are weighted for population, the rate of murders per 100,000 people was higher in London than in New York in February and March. The Met said it was ""concerned at the increase in murders in London"". ""One murder is one too many, and we are working hard with our partners to understand the increase and what we can all do to prevent these tragedies from happening in the first place,"" a spokesman said. However, it is a murder rate that has left Mr Logan feeling ""absolutely devastated"". Former Ch Supt Leroy Logan retired from the Met Police in 2013 after 30 years' service ""I cannot understand how things have gotten out of hand,"" he said. ""We have seen the virus of violence spreading. It is endemic in so many different parts of societies. ""It can only be dealt with in a holistic manner, because it is so holistic in its impact. ""Police can't just arrest or stop and search their way out of this problem; it has to be done in partnership with the communities.""

The Met Police has launched 44 murder investigations in 2018, 31 of which have been as a result of stabbings. The deaths of 47-year-oldLaura Cecilia Navarrete De Figueira, from Twickenham, and her sons Claudio, 10, and Joaquin, seven, are part of the same Met Police murder investigation. She was found stabbed in London, while the boys were discovered dead, along with their father, at the foot of Birling Gap, in Sussex. Croydon Central MP Sarah Jones, who chairs the all-party parliamentary group on knife crime, told theBBC's Today programmethat London could learn from New York in how to reduce violent crime. Sarah Jones says ""London needs to treat violent crime like a disease"" ""New York has been able to bring down serious violence through a public health approach,"" she said. ""We need a proper strategy that looks at all of the issues. ""Knife crime and violent crime acts like an epidemic, so you need to go in at the source to cut it off and then you need to inoculate the future young people against it. ""Going in at source means major intervention work with youth workers, inoculating means going into schools, changing the social norms, educating kids, teaching them what it is to be a man, teaching them how they don't need to carry knives."" The Met has investigated 46 murders in 2018 - of which 31 were stabbings In February, the Met's Commissioner Cressida Dick visited police in Glasgow to learn about apublic health approach which has seen murder rates in Scotland drop dramatically.

"'More than half' face broadband problemsHouseholds have seen slow internet speeds, dropouts and router issues in the last year, says Which.14m14 minutes agoBusiness","One in five British households have experienced slow broadband speeds in the last year, according to Which. A similar number have had connection dropouts and router problems, the consumer rights group added. It polled more than 1,900 customers across 12 providers, more than half of whom reported having problems with their broadband service or price. Which said providers had ""a long way to go"" to meet customer expectations. The survey looked at the biggest providers, including BT, Sky, TalkTalk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet. Together they serve about 90% of UK broadband customers. Superfast broadband: Rural residents 'left in the lurch' Three million homes to get ultrafast broadband It said TalkTalk customers were most likely to experience ""very slow"" speeds, with 31% of them reporting problems over the last 12 months. They were followed by BT users, 23% of whom had issues. Sky came next, with 22% of its customers having complained. When it came to connection dropouts, SSE was the worst performer with almost a quarter of its customers affected. And Which said Virgin Media customers were the most likely to face router issues, and be left with no internet at all ""for hours or even days at a time"". Overall, Virgin Media customers reported feeling most dissatisfied with their service, although their top complaint was about recent price rises, with some 47% reporting an increase in the last year. Price was also the top complaint about BT, with 30% of customers reporting an increase. A Virgin Media spokesman said: ""We do everything we can to balance keeping our prices competitive while investing to meet customers' ever-increasing appetite for faster broadband and better content."" It comes despitenew measures from Ofcom,externaloffering automatic compensation for slow repairs, missed appointments and delayed installations. Alex Neill, Which's managing director of home products and services, said: ""It's clear that too many households are still suffering from substandard broadband and our research shows that providers have a long way to go before they meet their customers' expectations. ""Customers who suffer from a shoddy broadband service will welcome new measures for automatic compensation, however providers should do more to stop these problems from happening in the first place."" Digital minister Margot James said: ""Broadband has become a modern necessity, and we all know how frustrating it is when it doesn't work. ""We've introduced a raft of measures with Ofcom to help protect consumers, including receiving compensation when their service falls short, and making it easier for customers to switch provider if they're not getting what they've paid for and are entitled to.""

Barristers to strike over cuts,"Barristers are to go on strike over ""relentless"" cuts which have left the criminal justice system ""broken"". The Criminal Bar Association (CBA), which represents criminal lawyers in England and Wales, is advising its members take part in ""days of action"". It also recommends its members refuse all legal aid cases from 1 April when a new fees system comes into force. The Ministry of Justice said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the position taken by the CBA. Angela Rafferty QC, chair of the CBA, has warned that prisons, courts, the police and probation services were ""underfunded and in chaos"". Hundreds of court cases axed over failings She said a lack of investment meant cases were not being properly investigated by the police and CPS, there was uncertainty and delay at court and ""unnecessary distress"" for witnesses, victims and defendants. She said the recent disclosure crisis, which led to the collapse of a number of rape trials last year, also highlighted ""the appalling state of our system"". She said the Ministry of Justice's ""already meagre and inadequate"" budget would be reduced by  Â£600m by 2019/20. She said underfunding meant the poor and vulnerable were ""being denied access to justice"", members of the public were ""at risk of miscarriages of justice"" and the  faith of the public in the jury system was being undermined by ""the chaos in courts"". ""In 2016, the Public Accounts Committee warned that the criminal justice system was close to breaking point. It is now broken,"" she added. The planned strike is timed to coincide with the introduction of the Advocates' Graduated Fee Scheme (AGFS), which comes in on 1 April and will link the amount barristers are paid for legal aid work to the complexity of a case. The Ministry of Justice said the scheme was cost neutral. However, the CBA said the government's refusal to invest in the scheme was ""the final straw"". It said barristers' fees had been cut by 40% over 20 years and the lack of investment undermined the progress made on diversity and social mobility in the profession. In a ballot of 2,300 of its members - a 55% turnout - 90% voted in favour of action. Prominent legal chambers Doughty Street, Garden Court and 25 Bedford Row are among those set to be involved. BBC legal correspondent Clive Coleman said refusing legal aid briefs would take months to have an effect and it was not clear how solid the strike action would be. However, he said it had potential to cause ""serious disruption"". A Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said it would continue to engage with the Bar. She said: ""Our reforms will reflect the actual work done in court, representing better value for the taxpayer, and will replace an archaic scheme under which barristers were able to bill by pages of evidence.

What does 'poor' really mean?,"Labour has said it willend in-work poverty within its first full termif it wins the next election. People in working families are much less likely to be living in poverty than those where no-one is in work - but working poverty has been rising in recent years. While 17% of children in a family where someone worked were living in relative poverty last year, that soared to 56% where no adult in their household worked. But, as Labour has pointed out before, most children in relative poverty are in households where someone works. That's because most households work, so they make up a greater share despite being relatively less likely to be in poverty than those children in workless households. Between 1994 and 2017, the proportion of people in working households in relative poverty rose from 13% to 18%, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) - eight million people in 2017. Although this has partly been driven by stagnating wages and rising housing costs, it also reflects how many more people are in work. ""They are better off than they would have been had they stayed out of work - but they remain in poverty,"" the IFS says. The 20-year promise that proved impossible When we talk about how many people are in poverty today in the UK, first we need to know how we define it. Currently, when the government talks about poverty, it uses either a measure of relative poverty - that is, how someone is doing financially compared with the rest of the country - or absolute poverty. To establish whether someone is living in relative poverty, the government looks at the median income - that is the midpoint where half of the working population earn more than that amount and half earn less. Then they take 60% of this middle amount and anyone who earns less than this is considered to be living in relative poverty. According to the Joseph Rowntree Foundation (JRF) charity, that's an income less than: Â£248 a week for a couple with no children Â£144 a week for a single person with no children Â£401 a week for a couple with two children aged between five and 14 Â£297 a week for single parent with two children aged between five and 14 When government talks about absolute poverty, it does the same calculation but uses the median income in 2010-11 to give a constant measure over time. While relative poverty tells you about the gap between low and middle-income households, absolute poverty is a good measure of how much the living standards of low-income households have changed over time. You can also look at these measures either before or after housing costs. The JRF says it favours the relative measure after housing costs since rising rents and property prices are a growing contributor to poverty. Absolute poverty, both before and after housing costs, has halved over the past 20 years. But while absolute poverty is falling, the reduction over the past 10 years was much smaller than it has been over comparable periods of time since the 1960s. Relative poverty, meanwhile, has remained more or less stagnant - inequality is as bad as it was two decades ago. No single measure of poverty will give you all the information, but looking at these measures gives a pretty good picture of what's going on. One problem with using relative income is that, in times of recession when lots of people's wages suffer, inequality may appear to improve as the poorest are protected through benefits and tax credits - but they are not actually any better off. Absolute poverty tells you whether people are staying the same relative to other people or getting left even further behind. But how people are faring compared to the society they live in is the internationally recognised standard of measuring poverty. Loughborough University publishes a minimum income standard which it considers to be a good measure of how much money someone needs to participate in normal life in the UK. While this is not a measure of poverty, it tries to capture changing social norms -  for example internet access may previously have been a luxury, but now a school-age child living in a house without internet access could be significantly disadvantaged when it comes to completing homework. In 2016, the university's Centre for Research in Social Policy said single people needed to earn at least Â£17,100 a year (Â£329 a week) before tax, and couples with two children at least Â£18,900 (Â£363 a week) each to achieve the minimum income standard.

What's driving schools' divide?,"Children in the north of England are finishing school with poorer grades and are less likely to go on to further education. That was the conclusion ofa report from the Children's Commissioner,,externalAnne Longfield. It's one in a line of reports pointing to the deep discrepancies that exist between England's schools in all areas of the country. And it's not always as simple as north vs south. So what's driving the divide? There were higher proportions ofchildren claiming free school meals,externalin the north of England and in the West Midlands than in most of the south in January 2017. Free school meals are often used as a measure of how many children are living with some level of disadvantage. They are available to children living in households claiming one of a range of income-dependent benefits. Once universal credit - which is replacing six existing welfare payments - is fully rolled out, free school meals will be available to households earning less than Â£7,400 a year excluding income from benefits. Universal credit: free school meals proposal keeps cliff edge And many children receiving free school meals in the north of England have been receiving them for longer than children in the south - a measure of long-term, entrenched deprivation. The link betweendeprivation and how well children do at school,externalhas been well-documented. It's very difficult to pick apart the reasons for this. In her report on children in the north of the country's experiences of education, Ms Longfield pointed out that more than half of schools in the poorest neighbourhoods in the north of England were rated less than good by Ofsted. This means children face a ""double disadvantage of being from a poor community and attending a weak school"", she said. Northern children 'too often left behind' Reality Check: Is there a north-south divide in schools? But Durham University professor Stephen Gorard suggests that schools may be given lower ratings precisely because the children they teach are more deprived. He thinks the strong correlation between how many children are claiming free lunches in a school and how likely it is to be rated less than good is unlikely to be explained by genuine differences in the quality of teaching. ""Inspections are not taking full account of the nature of disadvantage,"" Prof Gorard says. They too often mistake raw scores with how well children are being taught, he adds, cautioning that Ofsted inspectors were ""overly impressed by schools' level of attainment"" rather than looking at children's progress. Ofsted warns of north-south divide in England's schools But even accounting for that, there are stillregional differences when you look at how well schools are rated,externalin the comparably  deprived areas of the country. London has the highest proportion of outstanding schools - both overall and in its most deprived areas - and the lowest number of schools rated less than good. The north-east has the second highest proportion of outstanding schools, but also has the second highest number of schools rated less than good after Yorkshire and the Humber. In 2015, the government produced figures onmultiple indices of deprivation,externallooking at seven main things: Income Employment Health deprivation and disability Education, skills and training Barriers to housing and services Crime Living environment And this gives you a much more complicated picture - it's not quite as simple as ""south=rich, north=poor"". Some of the most and least deprived neighbourhoods can be found all over the country. The figures show that 60% of local authority districts contain at least one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England. But there are particular concentrations of deprivation in the north of England, in coastal towns and in major cities including London and Birmingham. It's important to note that this measure describes the average make-up of an area - not everyone who lives in a more deprived area will be deprived themselves and there are people living in poverty in generally well-off areas. East Jaywick in Essex came out as the most deprived town in England based on the government's multiple indices of deprivation Many parts of the south have higher proportions of pupils achieving A*- C grades at GCSE in English and maths than many parts of the north. Those are the grades generally needed to progress to post-16 education. But when you compare children from similar backgrounds, a more particular divide emerges - not between the north and the south but between London and the rest of the country. In fact the biggest gaps in attainment between the richest and poorest children were in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire and West Berkshire. Children receiving free school meals in London do much better than children receiving free school meals in all other regions. There is a much bigger gap between the achievements of the poorest children and their better-off peers in the north, than there is between children of different backgrounds in London. This gap exists all through the education system and worsens as children get older. Children receiving free school meals in London are more likely to reach the expected level of social, verbal and physical development by age four than children receiving free school meals in the rest of the country. They are also more likely to have achieved the expected standard of reading, writing and maths at the end of primary school (Year 6) and fall less far behind their richer peers than children in the rest of the country. Pupils from all backgrounds in London participate in higher education at higher rates than their peers. And those who receive free school meals in London are not just more likely than other children from low-income households to go on to higher education - they are more likely to do so than the national average. But it hasn't always been this way. In 2004, children in London were starting school behind those in the north and behind the national average, but this picture has now reversed. There's no single reason for this - rather, it is thought to be down to a series of gradual improvements over time, with concentrated efforts by schools and local and central government,starting from the mid-1990s.,external In London, the political focus on improving schools over the past two decades came with significant extra funding - something which has not materialised for northern schools. The capital's larger immigrant population is also thought to play a role in its better than average attainment. A new funding formula to determine how much money schools receive is being introduced from next year. That's the calculation used by government to decide how much money a school should receive. Every school receives the same basic amount per pupil, but this is topped up by extra funding for things like: Pupils who receive or have previously received free school meals Children in the care of the state Children with special education needs Children who speak English as an additional language Schools in areas with a high cost of living The current formula, which is soon to be replaced, is based on old data which led to discrepancies like schools in Bradford receiving Â£500 more per pupil than schools in Plymouth despite having similar demographics (because their populations were different in 2004). Urban areas in the south will receive less funding per pupil on average than those in the north and the Midlands. Rural schools generally receive less money than those in urban areas across the country. On average, schools in London receive the most funding per pupil. The new formula will close the gap slightly but schools in London will continue to receive more money per head than other regions.

CPS chief insists justice system is working,"No-one is in jail after being wrongly convicted due to failures to disclose evidence, the UK's top prosecutor has said ""as far as she can tell"". Alison Saunders' comments come after several rape trials collapsed when it emerged that vital evidence had not been shared with defence lawyers. The Metropolitan Police has launched a reviewof 30 sex crime cases. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Ms Saunders said it actually showed the justice system was working. She said that the collapsed trials demonstrate that ""safeguards in place"" in the trial process prevent wrongful imprisonment. She added that ""the ever-increasing use of social media, all the digital material we obtain,"" can create a problem and that although police had to ""pursue all reasonable lines of inquiry"" it was not reasonable to expect them to explore ""every single avenue"" of what a person had ever done in their life. Collapsed rape trial man to sue police Rape prosecutions 'at record high' In December, the trials of Isaac Itiary, who was accused of raping a child, and Liam Allan. both collapsed within a week of each other when new evidence came to light. The case against Mr Allan at Croydon Crown Court was dropped after three days when it emerged that evidence on a computer disc - which police had looked through - showed there were messages in which the alleged victim had pestered him for ""casual sex"". During Mr Itiary's trial, police failed to disclose messages which showed that the girl, then 16 years old, had told the defendant she was 19. A third trial concerning an alleged rape after the 2016 Noting Hill Carnival collapsed on Monday after the defendant's legal team found undisclosed images on his mobile phone. More than a dozen photographs appeared to show the couple together in bed. Regarding the case, Ms Saunders said: ""How would anyone have known that there were photographs there until the defence had told us that they were there?"" ""The system worked. What I think should have happened in that case is that it should have happened much earlier."" Anna Soubry, a Conservative MP. said on Twitter she feared Ms Saunders was ""part of the problem"".

"Poor pupils 'filling pockets with food'""We call it survival,"" head teachers say as they describe how poverty-hit pupils are forced to take food.6h6 hours agoFamily & Education","Malnourished pupils with grey skin are ""filling their pockets"" with food from school canteens in poor areas due to poverty, head teachers say. The heads, from various parts of England and Wales, described differences in the appearance of some pupils. One head said: ""My children have grey skin, poor teeth, poor hair; they are thinner."" The government said measures were in place to tackle poverty. Lynn, a head teacher from a former industrial town in Cumbria, who did not want to give her full name, was one of a number of head teachers speaking to reporters at the National Education Union conference in Brighton. They were highlighting the issues faced by an increasing number of children growing up in poverty, and how their experiences affect their education. Lynn said that hunger was particularly apparent after the weekend. She said: ""Children are filling their pockets with food. In some establishments that would be called stealing. We call it survival."" Another head teacher from Nottinghamshire, Louise Regan, said: ""When you take children out to an event, maybe a sporting event, you see children of the same age from schools in an affluent area. ""It's the grey skin, the pallor. It's the pallor you really notice."" She went on: ""Monday morning is the worst. ""There are a number of families that we target that we know are going to be coming into school hungry. ""By the time it's 9.30am they are tired."" She said her school supplied some pupils with clean uniforms, and that they often came back in the same clothes, grubby, after the weekend. The school has a food bank which gives out food parcels and a supply of clothes, shoes and coats for those without. Lynn said: ""We have washing machines and we are washing the children's clothes while they do PE. ""We wouldn't have it that these children are stigmatised because their clothes are dirty."" The school also runs a summer school for three weeks over the holidays, run voluntarily by teaching staff without pay. Howard Payne, a head at an inner city school in Portsmouth, said there had been a four-fold increase in the number of children with child protection issues. ""Every one of these issues has had something to do with the poverty that they live in,"" he said. ""It's neglect. It's because they and their families don't have enough money to provide food, heating or even bedding."" Mr Payne, who provides debt counselling and family support at his school, said: ""Three weeks ago, many schools in our area closed because of the snow. ""I kept ours open because I was really worried about the children - that they wouldn't have a hot meal to eat that day."" He said about 45% of pupils came into the school to eat that day. All the heads said things were getting worse as social and emotional support services were disappearing. The comments came as the NEU published research it had carried out with the Child Poverty Action Group. It found schools were increasingly stepping in to fill the poverty gap, with almost half of the 900 respondents saying their school offered one or more anti-poverty services such as a food bank, clothes bank or even offering emergency loans to families. More than four-fifths said they saw signs of children being hungry during the day, and about the same said they saw children showing signs of poor health. Alison Garnham, chief executive of the Child Poverty Action Group, said: ""With nine children in every classroom of 30 falling below the official poverty line, it is time to rebuild the safety net for struggling families."" Lynn added: ""My families are proud. Some of these parents are working two or three jobs and can't access the benefits system. ""They are just a few pounds over - they have less money than those on benefits."" Jane Jenkins, a head teacher from Cardiff, said children in her school often only brought a slice of bread and margarine for lunch and that teachers supplemented this. ""It's really difficult and when people are asking you about standards, why we don't go up the league tables? ""That's often a secondary consideration."" The Department for Education said it wanted to create a country where everyone could go as far as their talents could take them. ""That's why we launched our social mobility action plan, which sets out measures to close the attainment gap between disadvantaged students and their peers, and targets areas that need the most support through the Â£72m Opportunity Areas programme."" A spokesman also highlighted the Â£2.5bn it invests in disadvantaged pupils through the Pupil Premium and a recent Â£26m investment in breakfast clubs.

Ms Saunders, who will move to multinational law firm Linklaters, had faced calls to resign in June 2015 when her decision not to prosecute Labour peer Lord Janner over claims of historical child sexual abusewas overturned by an independent QC. The CPS had said there was enough evidence to merit prosecution but that it was not in the public interest to proceed against the former MP. Alison Saunders said there was evidence against Lord Janner but decided it was not in the public interest to prosecute the case The ruling reversing that decision made Ms Saunders the first director of public prosecutions to have a major prosecuting decision reviewed and overturned. A judge later ruled that Lord Janner was unfit to stand trial. The peer's son, Daniel Janner - himself a criminal law QC - attacked the way the CPS dealt with his father's case and said Ms Saunders had been ""an appalling DPP"" who was ""regarded by those in the legal profession as someone who wasn't up to the job"". By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Alison Saunders was dealt a tough hand as head of the Crown Prosecution Service. The service has sustained major cuts that undoubtedly affected the CPS's ability to carry out its role. However, Ms Saunders' tenure has been dogged by controversies. They included her being the first DPP to be overruled on a ""victim right to review"". She decided it was not in the public interest for the late Labour peer Lord Janner to stand trial for alleged sexual abuse because he was suffering from dementia. An independent QC disagreed. There was bitter press criticism in the wake of the phone-hacking scandal when journalists were prosecuted for paying public officials for leaked information.  Nine cases were dropped as the prosecution was scaled back and only one journalist was convicted following a jury trial, but that conviction was later quashed. More recently a series of rape trials collapsed where the prosecution failed to disclose critical evidence to the defence.  That has led to a review of all rape and serious sexual assault cases, and widespread claims of systemic prosecution failings on disclosure which is a fundamental principle of our fair trial system.

The 250 miles affecting children's futures,"Children in the north of England are finishing school with poorer grades and are less likely to go on to further education. That was the conclusion ofa report from the Children's Commissioner,,externalAnne Longfield. It's one in a line of reports pointing to the deep discrepancies that exist between England's schools in all areas of the country. And it's not always as simple as north vs south. So what's driving the divide? There were higher proportions ofchildren claiming free school meals,externalin the north of England and in the West Midlands than in most of the south in January 2017. Free school meals are often used as a measure of how many children are living with some level of disadvantage. They are available to children living in households claiming one of a range of income-dependent benefits. Once universal credit - which is replacing six existing welfare payments - is fully rolled out, free school meals will be available to households earning less than Â£7,400 a year excluding income from benefits. Universal credit: free school meals proposal keeps cliff edge And many children receiving free school meals in the north of England have been receiving them for longer than children in the south - a measure of long-term, entrenched deprivation. The link betweendeprivation and how well children do at school,externalhas been well-documented. It's very difficult to pick apart the reasons for this. In her report on children in the north of the country's experiences of education, Ms Longfield pointed out that more than half of schools in the poorest neighbourhoods in the north of England were rated less than good by Ofsted. This means children face a ""double disadvantage of being from a poor community and attending a weak school"", she said. Northern children 'too often left behind' Reality Check: Is there a north-south divide in schools? But Durham University professor Stephen Gorard suggests that schools may be given lower ratings precisely because the children they teach are more deprived. He thinks the strong correlation between how many children are claiming free lunches in a school and how likely it is to be rated less than good is unlikely to be explained by genuine differences in the quality of teaching. ""Inspections are not taking full account of the nature of disadvantage,"" Prof Gorard says. They too often mistake raw scores with how well children are being taught, he adds, cautioning that Ofsted inspectors were ""overly impressed by schools' level of attainment"" rather than looking at children's progress. Ofsted warns of north-south divide in England's schools But even accounting for that, there are stillregional differences when you look at how well schools are rated,externalin the comparably  deprived areas of the country. London has the highest proportion of outstanding schools - both overall and in its most deprived areas - and the lowest number of schools rated less than good. The north-east has the second highest proportion of outstanding schools, but also has the second highest number of schools rated less than good after Yorkshire and the Humber. In 2015, the government produced figures onmultiple indices of deprivation,externallooking at seven main things: Income Employment Health deprivation and disability Education, skills and training Barriers to housing and services Crime Living environment And this gives you a much more complicated picture - it's not quite as simple as ""south=rich, north=poor"". Some of the most and least deprived neighbourhoods can be found all over the country. The figures show that 60% of local authority districts contain at least one of the most deprived neighbourhoods in England. But there are particular concentrations of deprivation in the north of England, in coastal towns and in major cities including London and Birmingham. It's important to note that this measure describes the average make-up of an area - not everyone who lives in a more deprived area will be deprived themselves and there are people living in poverty in generally well-off areas. East Jaywick in Essex came out as the most deprived town in England based on the government's multiple indices of deprivation Many parts of the south have higher proportions of pupils achieving A*- C grades at GCSE in English and maths than many parts of the north. Those are the grades generally needed to progress to post-16 education. But when you compare children from similar backgrounds, a more particular divide emerges - not between the north and the south but between London and the rest of the country. In fact the biggest gaps in attainment between the richest and poorest children were in the southern counties of Cambridgeshire, Buckinghamshire and West Berkshire. Children receiving free school meals in London do much better than children receiving free school meals in all other regions. There is a much bigger gap between the achievements of the poorest children and their better-off peers in the north, than there is between children of different backgrounds in London. This gap exists all through the education system and worsens as children get older. Children receiving free school meals in London are more likely to reach the expected level of social, verbal and physical development by age four than children receiving free school meals in the rest of the country. They are also more likely to have achieved the expected standard of reading, writing and maths at the end of primary school (Year 6) and fall less far behind their richer peers than children in the rest of the country. Pupils from all backgrounds in London participate in higher education at higher rates than their peers. And those who receive free school meals in London are not just more likely than other children from low-income households to go on to higher education - they are more likely to do so than the national average. But it hasn't always been this way. In 2004, children in London were starting school behind those in the north and behind the national average, but this picture has now reversed. There's no single reason for this - rather, it is thought to be down to a series of gradual improvements over time, with concentrated efforts by schools and local and central government,starting from the mid-1990s.,external In London, the political focus on improving schools over the past two decades came with significant extra funding - something which has not materialised for northern schools. The capital's larger immigrant population is also thought to play a role in its better than average attainment. A new funding formula to determine how much money schools receive is being introduced from next year. That's the calculation used by government to decide how much money a school should receive. Every school receives the same basic amount per pupil, but this is topped up by extra funding for things like: Pupils who receive or have previously received free school meals Children in the care of the state Children with special education needs Children who speak English as an additional language Schools in areas with a high cost of living The current formula, which is soon to be replaced, is based on old data which led to discrepancies like schools in Bradford receiving Â£500 more per pupil than schools in Plymouth despite having similar demographics (because their populations were different in 2004). Urban areas in the south will receive less funding per pupil on average than those in the north and the Midlands. Rural schools generally receive less money than those in urban areas across the country. On average, schools in London receive the most funding per pupil. The new formula will close the gap slightly but schools in London will continue to receive more money per head than other regions.
