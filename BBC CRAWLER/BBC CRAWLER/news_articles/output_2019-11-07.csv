Cairns row 'shows why women do not report rape',"Special adviser Geraint Evans (left) sent Alun Cairns (centre) an email about Ross England in August 2018 The victim in the collapsed rape trial that led to Alun Cairns' resignation as Welsh secretary said the case shows why women do not alert police. Mr Cairnssaid he did not know about a former aide's involvement in the collapse of her trialuntil last week. But he resigned after BBC Wales obtained an emailsent to him discussing the case over a year ago. A spokesman for Alun Cairns said he and his staff supported the victim in a ""kind, caring and considerate way"". ""It is important to reiterate that Mr Cairns had no role or association with the trial.,"" the spokesman added. The victim has called for Mr Cairns to quit as a general election candidate. The politician, who still intends to stand for the Conservatives in Vale of Glamorgan, denies any wrongdoing. Timeline: Alun Cairns' resignation Alun Cairns' resignation letter in full The Conservative Party had said Mr Cairns was ""completely unaware"" until last week of the details of the case, which collapsed in April 2018 when his former aide Ross England, a witness, was accused by the trial judge of deliberate sabotage. But an email sent on 2 August 2018 shows Mr Cairns received an update regarding Mr England's situation. It was sent to Mr Cairns by Geraint Evans, his special adviser, and copied to Richard Minshull - the director of the Welsh Conservatives - and another member of staff. It said: ""I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court."" Four months after that email was sent, Mr England was selected to represent the Conservative Party in the Vale of Glamorgan for the 2021 Welsh assembly election. Who is former Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns? What does Alun Cairns' resignation mean? ""It is because of situations like this that women don't come forward and report rape,"" the victim - who cannot be named for legal reasons and who previously worked in Mr Cairns' constituency office - told BBC Wales. ""I think Alun Cairns did the right thing resigning,"" she said. ""However, I feel that the way he has handled this does not reflect well on the Conservative Party and raises serious questions as to whether he's a suitable candidate to be standing in the general election. ""What he did was to minimise my experience as a rape victim. ""He was aware that Ross England had delayed my right to justice and made me go through another trial and still felt that he was a suitable candidate. ""This brings into question his judgment and the party's judgment."" Ross England has been suspended as a Tory party candidate for the Welsh Assembly election Lord Davies of Gower, who has been the chairman of the party in Wales since 2017, said he ""deeply regrets"" the situation has arisen but added: ""There will be an apology if I find out that one should be forthcoming. ""I'm very sorry that this has happened to her. There is nothing I can do about it. It all happened before I became chairman of the party. I deeply regret it and I will deal with it very sympathetically,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. In his resignation letter, Mr Cairns said: ""This is a very sensitive matter, and in light of continued speculation, I write to tender my resignation as secretary of state for Wales. ""I will co-operate in full with the investigation under the ministerial code which will now take place and I am confident I will be cleared of any breach or wrong doing."" Ina statement issued last week, Lord Davies said he could ""categorically state"" that he and Mr Cairns were ""completely unaware of the details of the collapse of this trial until they became public this week"". Following Mr England's selection to stand as an AM, Mr Cairns endorsed the candidate as a ""friend and colleague"" with whom ""it will be a pleasure to campaign"". Mr England was suspended from his candidacy and his employment with the Conservative Party last week. At the rape trial Mr England, giving evidence, made claims he had had a casual sexual relationship with the victim, which she has denied. The judge Stephen John Hopkins had earlier told the trial evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible. He told Mr England: ""You have managed single-handed, and I have no doubt it was deliberate on your part, to sabotage this trialâ¦ get out of my court."" The defendant James Hackett, a friend of Mr England's, was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial. Ross England gave a speech at the Welsh Conservatives' conference in 2016 Mr Cairns is facing further pressure to resign his candidacy in the upcoming general election from other parties. On Wednesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn questioned the ""moral right"" of Mr Cairns to stand, while Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts said he should do the ""honourable thing"" and withdraw. Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds said he was ""not fit to represent Wales"". Assembly Tory leader Paul Davies has distanced himself from Mr England, saying he hadfallen short of the standards expected of a Conservative candidate. Shazia Awan-Scully, a former Conservative Party member who ran to be an MP in 2010, said the actions of the party ""alienate women"". ""It says everything about the moral state of the party right now that the prime minister thinks it's OK for Alun Cairns to stand as a candidate I think it's absolutely disgraceful,"" she added. A spokeswoman for the Welsh Conservatives said the party encouraged women, adding it had ""elected some strong female candidates for the forthcoming general election and look forward to selecting even more"". Other candidates standing in the Vale of Glamorgan include Sally Stephenson, for the Welsh Liberal Democrats, Belinda Loveluck-Edwards for Welsh Labour and Ian Johnson for Plaid Cymru. The close of nominations is 14 November. What does Alun Cairns' resignation mean?

Raids on homes of brothers wanted by Essex police,"Christopher (left) and Ronan Hughes are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and human trafficking Homes belonging to two brothers wanted for questioning about the deaths of 39 people in a lorry in Essex have been searched by the Irish authorities. Ronan and Christopher Hughes have links to Armagh in Northern Ireland and Monaghan in the Republic of Ireland. Two County Monaghan homes owned by the pair were among 10 properties searched by Ireland's Criminal Assets Bureau (CAB), according to police sources. CAB seized vehicles and cash as part of its year-long smuggling investigation. The bureau also secured court orders to freeze 20 bank accounts holding about â¬200,000 in total. The CAB investigation is focused on ""a group suspected of being involved in various international smuggling activities"". However, that investigation has ""intensified over the past two weeks"" according to a statement issued by gardaÃ­ (Irish police). Two lorry tractors and trailers were seized last week as part of the investigation The statement, issued on Thursday morning, said the CAB investigation was ""not linked to the ongoing Essex Police investigation"". However, it is understood that the discovery of 39 bodies in a lorry in Essex on 23 October has given added impetus to CAB's long-running investigation into international smuggling. The 10 County Monaghan properties searched by CAB staff on Thursday consisted of seven homes and three industrial premises, which were described by gardaÃ­ as sheds or yards. The items seized during the raids included two BMW cars; a Volkswagen van and a Mitsubishi Shogun. One of the cars seized in County Monaghan Cash in different currencies was also found, with CAB seizing â¬1,400, $900 and Â£600. In addition to the four vehicles seized in Monaghan on Thursday, a Northern Ireland-registered lorry and a Bulgarian-registered lorry were seized at Dublin Port last Tuesday as part of the same investigation. Garda sources also confirmed that some of the material seized belongs to 40-year-old Ronan Hughes and his 34-year-old brother Christopher. A van was also seized TheHughes brothers were identified as suspects in the lorry deaths investigationby Essex Police at the end of last month. Investigating officers said at the time the pair were wanted on suspicion of manslaughter of the 39 Vietnamese victims. Earlier on Thursday, the force saidall 39 people have been formally identifiedbut their names are not yet being released. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021.

Children in Need boss criticises chart exclusion,"Jodie Whittaker sang Coldplay's Yellow, while Olivia Colman sang Portishead's Glory Box A Children in Need album featuring stars like Jodie Whittaker and Olivia Colman has been removed from the race to be number one in this week's chart. The Official Charts Company said Got It Covered, which features actors each singing a song, was heading for the top spot in the main album chart. But it has now been moved to the compilations chart. Children in Need chief executive Simon Antrobus said he was ""deeply saddened"" by the decision. On Monday,the Official Charts Company said,externalthe album, which also includes tracks sung by David Tennant, Helena Bonham Carter and Suranne Jones, was 4,000 sales ahead in the race to be number one in the main chart. Gentleman Jack and Broadchurch actor Shaun Dooley, who covered Taylor Swift's Never Grow Up, wrote on Twitter that he was ""saddened & angry"", pointing out that the decision could stop the CD from being stocked in supermarket chart racks.

The Official Charts Company said it had decided that the album was a various artists' compilation and so should not be in the main chart. Mr Antrobus said: ""I'm deeply saddened that the industry has chosen to pull the album from the number one race after announcing it was well on its way to securing the top spot this week. ""Got It Covered is the result of an inspiring collaboration by some of the UK's biggest stars in support of disadvantaged children and young people and this very special project has clearly captured the public's imagination. ""It's sad that a charity album solely for the benefit of children should be denied the chance of further promotion and celebration which inevitably would lead to more money being raised."" David Tennant covered The Proclaimers' Sunshine on Leith, and Helena Bonham Carter performed Joni Mitchell's Both Sides Now Children in Need is the BBC's corporate charity, and the album's release came ahead of the annual fundraising night on 15 November. The recording sessions were shown ona BBC One documentary. A BBC statement said: ""This is extremely disappointing, we know many of the contributors are also saddened by the news. It's important to remember what this album is about - helping the lives of disadvantaged children in need. ""The public have been buying the album in huge volumes and that should be recognised. They should think again."" A spokesperson for the Official Charts Company apologised for not identifying it as a compilation sooner. A statement said: ""We understand and sympathise with Children In Need's concerns that their album will no longer feature in the UK's artist albums chart. ""The album is on course to take the number one spot on the compilation albums chart and be the biggest-selling album of the week - which is a huge achievement, while raising money for such a deserving cause. ""Got It Covered was described to us pre-release as an artist album, but on release it was clear that it was a various artists compilation, as it is widely credited as across retail and music services. We are sorry this fact was not picked up sooner, and we are huge supporters of all the incredible and important work Children in Need do and would urge everyone to continue to go out and buy the album.""

Scottish tourist's hand found inside shark,"Examiners found the man's hand and wedding ring inside a tiger shark A Scottish tourist is suspected to have died in a shark attack after his severed hand and wedding ring were found inside the animal. The 44-year-old man was last seen snorkelling off the French island of Reunion, near Madagascar, over the weekend. It is believed he was on a week-long holiday with his wife in Saint-Gilles. His hand, identified by his wedding ring, was found inside a tiger shark which was caught for research purposes. Local resident Erick Quelquejeu told BBC Scotland the man had left his wife for just ""a few minutes"" to go for a swim. Mr Quelquejeu told BBC Scotland the beaches have signs warning people against swimming Mr Quelquejeu said: ""It's an area enclosed by a reef, there's a very slight passage where it goes deeper into the ocean but actually it's really well protected by the reef."" He added: ""His wife was really scared by what happened. Many helicopters, many planes, swimmers and boats went to try and find the guy in the ocean but couldn't find him for a few days. ""Apparently they found a shark a few days ago with his hand so we are really not sure how it happened."" Mr Quelquejeu said that many beaches on the west coast of the island were well signposted, warning people against swimming because of previous shark attacks. There were also warnings at the airports. The island has put measures in place to protect people from shark attacks ""There are a lot of shark attacks on Reunion island but we are quite aware about that now,"" he added. ""It's something we don't hide from anybody. All the places around the island where you can't swim - where there's not a natural reef - there are signs in front of the beach to warn people. ""Even at that you have a few boats that go around the west area of the island - because that's where all the beaches are - to protect them, to watch if anyone makes that mistake anyway."" Queensland shark attack: Two British men injured at tourist spot British tourist loses foot after shark bite in Australia US dad 'punched shark five times' to save daughter The shark was among several caught on Monday and Tuesday in the Indian Ocean by the Centre de Securite Requin (CSR). It was found just over four miles (7km) from the lagoon where the man was last seen. The shark was examined on Wednesday morning. It is not yet known whether the man drowned and was subsequently eaten by the shark, or whether he was attacked by it. A spokesman for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We are providing support to the family of a British man who died while snorkelling in La Reunion and are in contact with the local authorities."" There have been two fatal shark attacks this year at Reunion, which is in the Indian Ocean. Local authorities have implemented a ban on swimming and water sports across almost all of the island's beaches following attacks in 2013. French President Emmanuel Macron said last month that he would like to see water sports reintroduced by 2022, but added that he wanted ""to be sure"" that it would be safe to do so.

Labour and Tories pledge more borrowing,"This video can not be played John McDonnell: Â£150bn fund for ""human emergency created by Tories"" Labour has promised ""investment on a scale never seen before"" to overhaul infrastructure in all areas of the UK. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says he wants to transfer power and money out of the south-east of England - and will fund his plans through borrowing. The Tories have also vowed to borrow to fund more spending, rewriting their current financial rules. Chancellor Sajid Javid denied copying Labour's plans, saying he would practise ""sensible stewardship"". But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Ed Davey warned that both parties were ""writing promises on cheques that will bounce"". Labour and the Conservatives say they want to take advantage of historically low interest rates to spend more on transport, hospitals and other infrastructure projects. They are locked in a battle for votes in the Midlands and north of England in swing seats that could decide who forms the next government on 12 December. Labour and Tories plan for a post-austerity future Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson stands down Live: Latest on the general election trail Will the Tories' Brexit-heavy campaign work? Bank warns Brexit deal would hit economic growth Both parties are also promising to shift power and control of spending out of London - but they have different ideas about how to do that. Speaking in Liverpool, Mr McDonnell promised to set up a Treasury unit in the north of England to take spending decisions out of Whitehall. The Conservatives have promised to give the north of England more control over its railways, greater powers for some elected mayors and a new economic development body. The campaign speeches over investment come as: Former Labour MPs Ian Austin and John Woodcockcalled on votersto vote for the Conservatives Pro-Remain parties Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Lib Dems agreednot to stand against each otherin dozens of seats Election officershit backat calls from the education secretary for polling stations not to be placed in schools This video can not be played Chancellor Sajid Javid attacks Labour's ""fantasy economics"" At the 2017 general election, Labour announced plans to set up a national transformation fund to overhaul the UK's transport links and infrastructure. This includes a social transformation fund, which Mr McDonnell said would now get an extra Â£100bn, providing a Â£150bn pot to be spent over the next five years. A further Â£250bn of investment will be spent across the country through the Green Transformation Fund. Mr McDonnell said the investment would help a Labour government address a ""climate emergency"", as well as a ""human emergency which has been created by the Tories"". He said his party would introduce new fiscal rules, meaning ""borrowing for investment"" would not be included in borrowing targets. He added the new approach would mean public assets created by infrastructure spending would be ""recognised both as a cost and as a benefit"". Politicians often talk of how many billions they would spend on schools, hospitals, upgrading roads, and so on. A billion is a thousand million (or Â£1,000,000,000 written in full). It used to have a different meaning in the UK. Until the 1970s, it meant a million million, but Prime Minister Harold Wilson adopted the US definition. With Â£1bn, you could pay the average full-time worker's salary nearly 33,000 times. For a government, the cash doesn't go as far. It costs Â£1bn to run the NHS across the UK for just three days, according to the King's Fund. But Mr Javid attacked Labour's investment plans, accusing the party of wanting to ""spray money round like confetti"", and indulging in ""fantasy economics"". He said the ""transformation"" in the economy since the Conservatives took power ""was not the result of some fiscal cycle"", but ""down to solid economic stewardship"". ""By far the biggest fear of business is a Corbyn-led government,"" he added. BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz Both main parties now agree that this era of unusually low interest rates provides an opportunity to borrow to invest. Both will push up the national debt. Both argue that stepping up investment now will make the UK more productive later on. The question, as ever, is how much will they borrow and how much debt they think the UK can support. Labour is adding a cool Â£150bn to its investment plans over five years, a very big sum. John McDonnell believes by spending on schools, hospitals and other infrastructure he would create a virtuous circle, a bigger economy which could afford the debt. Sajid Javid would replace the Tories' self-imposed limits on borrowing with less stringent rules, including the promise that annual investment in projects like road and rail would not exceed 3% of national output. He says the difference between his and Labour's plans is ""like night and day"" but, however they differ, debt looks set to rise. Mr Javid said his plans to increase debt as a share of national income would increase spending by ""an extra Â£20bn a year over a five year period"". He added that ""you could easily add another Â£100bn to that"" but the details would be set out in the Conservative manifesto. And he said ending the uncertainty over Brexit was ""the most important thing the economy needs right now"", and would ""unleash"" more private investment. Conservative leader Boris Johnson said the last nine years of his party's government had resulted in ""solid growth"", ""record low"" unemployment and the cost of borrowing ""at an all-time low"". ""It's thanks to the prudence of the Conservatives that we are able to make some investments in our infrastructure, in technology, in our public services and the reason we can do that is because we understand the vital importance of a strong economy,"" Mr Johnson said. He said the ""biggest threat"" currently facing the UK economy was the ""uncertainty that is still being posed to our political system by the whole Brexit debate"", but his plan was to bring back his deal in December so the UK could leave the EU in January. However, for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Davey said ""any form of Brexit"" would mean ""less tax revenue"" and would make the economy ""weaker"". ""Neither Labour or the Tories can square their spending promises today with the cost of Brexit,"" he said. ""In contrast, every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit, build a brighter future and invest the Â£50bn Remain bonus in our vital public services and tackle inequality."" We have got into something of a bidding war between the two parties. The Tories are talking about extra cash for police, for upgrading hospitals, for what they call an infrastructure revolution. John McDonnell is talking about pouring hundreds of billions for a once-in-a-generation upgrade to the country's infrastructure. They're on the same terrain - they're both talking about the end of austerity. They're both talking about a big increase in government spending, and they're both talking about paying for this by borrowing. The risk for the government is that they might be seen as ""Labour-lite"" - offering something similar, but not as ambitious. What question do you have about the general election?

Judge orders Trump to pay $2m for charity misuse,"A New York judge has ordered President Donald Trump to pay $2m (Â£1.6m) for misusing funds from his charity to finance his 2016 political campaign. The Donald J Trump Foundation closed down in 2018. Prosecutors had accused it of working as ""little more than a chequebook"" for Mr Trump's interests. Charities such as the one Mr Trump and his three eldest children headed cannot engage in politics, the judge ruled. Mr Trump hit out at the ruling, saying ""every penny"" went to charity. ""I am the only person I know, perhaps the only person in history, who can give major money to charity ($19m), charge no expense, and be attacked by the political hacks in New York State,"" he wrote in a statement posted to Twitter. What's the deal with the Trump Foundation? Trump charity sued for 'illegal conduct' He accused New York's attorney general, Letitia James, who brought the civil lawsuit, of ""deliberately mischaracterising this settlement for political purposes"" and called New York ""a corrupt state"". Judge Saliann Scarpulla said Mr Trump had ""breached his fiduciary duty"" by allowing funds raised for US veterans to be used for the Iowa primary election in 2016. The money was raised in a televised fundraiser during a Republican primary debate that Mr Trump skipped. ""I direct Mr Trump to pay the $2,000,000, which would have gone to the Foundation if it were still in existence,"" the judge wrote, saying it must be paid by Mr Trump himself and should go to eight charities he has no relationship to. Mr Trump said the case had been resolved and that he was ""happy to donate"" $2m to the Army Emergency Relief, Children's Aid Society, City Meals-on-Wheels, Give an Hour, Martha's Table, United Negro College Fund, United Way of Capital Area and the US Holocaust Memorial Museum. Ms James said Mr Trump had admitted to ""personally misusing funds at the Trump Foundation"". She had asked Judge Scarpulla to ban Mr Trump from ever running a charity again. However, this was not imposed. Donald Trump Jr, Eric Trump and Ivanka Trump - who were also directors of the Trump Foundation - are required to undergo mandatory training ""on the duties of officers and directors of charities"", Ms James said. The case was opened following aninvestigation into the Trump Foundation,externalby the Washington Post in 2016.

Holocaust survivor under guard amid death threats,"Liliana Segre has reported receiving about 200 hate messages a day An 89-year-old Holocaust survivor in Italy has been assigned police guards for protection after receiving hundreds of threats on social media. Liliana Segre, who was sent to the notorious Auschwitz death camp at 13, has been subjected to a barrage of anti-Semitic messages in recent days. It comes after Ms Segre, an Italian life senator, called for parliament to establish a committee to combat hate. The motion passed despite a lack of support by Italy's right-wing parties. Members of the nationalist League party, led by Matteo Salvini, the centre-right Forza Italia and the far-right Brothers of Italy all abstained from the vote in Milan last week. The motion called for the establishment of an extraordinary commission in Italy to combat all forms of racism, anti-Semitism, incitement to hatred and violence on ethnic and religious grounds. Ms Segre said after the vote that the abstentions made her feel ""like a Martian in the Senate"". ""I appealed to the conscience of everyone,externaland thought that a commission against hatred as a principle would be accepted by all,"" she said at the time, Italy's La Repubblica reported (in Italian). Since then, she has reported receiving as many as 200 hate messages a day. Some of the threats have been so serious that the prefect of Milan, Renato Saccone, held a meeting on Wednesday with the committee for security and public order, where it was agreed that Ms Segre needed police protection. The measures that were approved include Ms Segre being accompanied in public by two paramilitary carabinieri officers. Meanwhile, the Milan public prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation into the hate messages targeting the senator and had requested the assistance of Italy's anti-terror police.

She fled Nazi persecution in Italy with her father in December 1943. After failing to secure refuge in Switzerland, the pair were sent by train to the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland the following month, where her father and grandparents were killed. Along with other Jewish prisoners transferred from Auschwitz in January 1945, Ms Segre was taken to the RavensbrÃ¼ck concentration camp in Germany. Weeks later she was moved to another camp operated by the Nazis which was eventually liberated by the Soviet Red Army. Ms Segre was made an Italian senator for life by President Sergio Mattarella in January 2018. Italy has a population of about 30,000 Jews. More than 7,500 Italian Jews died during the Holocaust.

"Nato alliance is brain dead, says Macron","President Emmanuel Macron of France has described Nato as ""brain dead"", stressing what he sees as waning commitment to the transatlantic alliance by its main guarantor, the US. Interviewed by the Economist, he cited the US failure to consult Nato before pulling forces out of northern Syria. He also questioned whether Nato was still committed to collective defence. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, a key ally, said she disagreed with Mr Macron's ""drastic words"". Russia, which sees Nato as a threat to its security, welcomed the French president's comments as ""truthful words"". Nato, which celebrates 70 years since its founding at a London summit next month, has responded by saying the alliance remains strong. ""What we are currently experiencing is the brain death of Nato,""Mr Macron told the London-based newspaper.,external He warned European members that they could no longer rely on the US to defend the alliance, established at the start of the Cold War to bolster Western European and North American security. Does the US contribute too much to Nato? What is Nato? Article Five of Nato's founding charter stipulates that an attack on one member will produce a collective response from the alliance. But Mr Macron appeared unsure whether it was still valid when asked. ""I don't know,"" he said. The alliance, Mr Macron is quoted as saying, ""only works if the guarantor of last resort functions as such. I'd argue that we should reassess the reality of what Nato is in the light of the commitment of the United States"". The French leader urged Europe to start thinking of itself as a ""geopolitical power"" to ensure it remained ""in control"" of its destiny. President Donald Trump's abrupt decision topull most US forces out of north-eastern Syria in Octobertook European Nato members by surprise. This video can not be played A Nato military exercise in 2018 - the biggest since Cold War The move opened the way for Turkey - itself a powerful Nato member - to push into Syria and create what it termed a security zone along its border. Kurdish forces, who had been helping the US fight the Islamic State (IS) group, were expelled from the area. Mr Macron at the time criticised Nato's failure to respond to the Turkish offensive. Mr Trump has frequently accused European Nato members of failing to provide their fair share of military spending and for relying too heavily on the US for their defence. For his part, Mr Macron has already been at the forefront of moves to boost defence co-operation among European countries. However, the European Union's other main military power, the UK, emphasises the importance of Nato to European defence. Chancellor Merkel, speaking in Berlin alongside visiting Nato Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg, said Mr Macron ""used drastic words - that is not my view of co-operation in Nato"". She acknowledged there were problems, but said she did not think ""such sweeping judgements are necessary"". This video can not be played German Chancellor Angela Merkel has disagreed strongly with the French president Russia's reaction came from foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova. ""Well said. Truthful words, and ones that get to the nub of the matter,"" she posted on Facebook. ""An accurate description of Nato's current state,"" she wrote. ""Truthful words"" - the Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman's assessment Nato chief Mr Stoltenberg said the alliance remained strong. ""European allies are stepping up, investing more in defence. ""The US is increasing investments in Europe with more troops, more exercises. The reality is that we do work together. We have strengthened our collective defence. Any attempt to distance us from North America risks not only weakening the alliance, the transatlantic bond, but also weakening Europe."" With only weeks before the Nato summit, President Macron's comments suggest it might not be an entirely harmonious celebration. One key fault line has been opened up by President Trump who frequently denigrates his Nato allies. He described many of them recently as ""delinquent"" for not spending sufficiently on their own defence. Mr Macron said America was turning its back on Europe. The absence of co-ordination on strategic decision-making between the US and its Nato allies was exemplified by recent unilateral US and Turkish decisions in Syria. Turkey's actions in particular, he said, raised all sorts of questions about the fundamental security guarantees that Nato gives to all its members. What would happen, he asked, if the Syrian government attacked Turkey due to its incursion into Syria? With more members than ever and facing much more complex security challenges, Nato seems in Mr Macron's view to no longer be fit for purpose. This is about much more than one US president. Nato must defend against multiple threats which different countries perceive in different ways. And a number of allies seem less and less keen to espouse the liberal democratic values that lie at Nato's core. The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation was created in 1949 to counter the threat from the Soviet Union as the Communist country sought to expand its power in Europe. The Soviet Union, an ally in World War Two against Nazi Germany, became an adversary of the West during the Cold War. It set up its own Warsaw Pact military alliance, including the then Communist countries of eastern Europe, in 1955. That alliance was dissolved shortly before the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 and former Warsaw Pact countries, though not Russia, became Nato members in the years following. Originally set up to promote ""stability and well-being in the North Atlantic area"", Nato was faced with finding a new purpose after the demise of the Soviet Union. From the mid-1990s, Nato forces were deployed on missions in the former Yugoslavia, launching air strikes to push Serbia out of Kosovo, and in Afghanistan, where the alliance took control of peacekeeping operations. But as Nato has expanded, it has struggled to overcome Russian concerns that the alliance poses a threat on its borders.

Man jailed for dousing police officers in petrol,"Justin Jackson doused the officers during disorder as police tried to arrest a youth riding a stolen motorbike A man who doused eight police officers with a watering can full of petrol and left them fearing for their lives has been jailed. Justin Jackson, 28, doused the officers in the flammable liquid during disorder in Basildon, Essex on 5 May. One officer said that he remembered thinking at the time ""we could all go up in flames here like Roman candles"". Jackson, of Ward Close, was jailed for three years and nine months at Basildon Crown Court. He had admitted eight counts of administering a noxious substance with intent to cause injury at an earlier hearing. Justin Jackson was jailed at Basildon Crown Court Prosecutor Joe Bird told the court that disorder had broken out as police tried to arrest a youth riding a stolen motorbike and people interfered with attempts to arrest him. During this disorder, Jackson ""armed himself with a watering can full of petrol"" then ""brings it to the scene and sprays officers with it"", Mr Bird said. Temporary Supt Jonathan Baldwin said: ""At the time of the incident while being covered with petrol I remember thinking 'we could all go up in flames here like Roman candles'."" He added: ""It was one of those days I realised I might not have got home at all."" Alison Gurden, defending, said Jackson had written a letter of apology in which he said: ""I'm deeply sorry for what I've done and I can only imagine the fear they felt."" Police released aerial footage of the disorder Judge Samantha Cohen said Jackson did it to prevent them from making arrests. She said: ""Initially some (of the officers) thought they were splashed with a disfiguring acid or bleach, but when they smelled it was petrol they feared they would be set alight."" Meanwhile, Jackson's mother Janine Justin, 47, of Ward Close, was given a suspended nine-month prison sentence after being found guilty of possessing an offensive weapon in a public place. The court heard she had threatened police officers with a hammer during the disorder. After the sentencing, Supt Baldwin said that ""to say that it does not have an effect on us is incorrect"". ""We have had a lot of support from the organisation and colleagues and specialists to help us,"" he said.

Protesters forcibly cut off Bolivia mayor's hair,"Patricia Arce was covered in red paint and had her hair cut off The mayor of a small town in Bolivia has been attacked by opposition protesters who dragged her through the streets barefoot, covered her in red paint and forcibly cut her hair. Patricia Arce of the governing Mas party was handed over to police in Vinto after several hours. It is the latest in a series of violent clashes between government supporters and opponents in the wake of controversial presidential elections. At least three people have died so far. A group of anti-government protesters was blocking a bridge in Vinto, a small town in Cochabamba province in central Bolivia, as part of their ongoing demonstrations following the presidential election on 20 October. An uncertain future for Morales Why protesters are on the streets worldwide Rumours spread that two opposition protesters had been killed nearby in clashes with supporters of incumbent president, Evo Morales, prompting an angry group to march to the town hall. Police officers escorted Ms Arce to a health centre after the protesters released her The protesters accused Mayor Arce of having bussed in supporters of the president to try and break a blockade they had set up and blamed her for the reported deaths, one of which was later confirmed. Amid shouts of ""murderess, murderess"" masked men dragged her through the streets barefoot to the bridge. There, they made her kneel down, cut her hair and doused her in red paint. They also forced her to sign a resignation letter. Ms Arce was eventually handed over to the police who took her to a local health centre. Protesters also set alight parts of the town hall Her office was set alight and the windows of the town hall were smashed. The person killed in clashes between supporters and opponents of President Morales was identified as 20-year-old student Limbert GuzmÃ¡n Vasquez. Doctors said Mr GuzmÃ¡n Vasquez had a fractured skull which may have been caused by an explosive device. He is the third person to be killed since the clashes between the two sides erupted on 20 October. Bolivia's post-election clashes turn deadly as two are killed Tension has been running high since election night when the results count was inexplicably paused for 24 hours. This video can not be played ""This is not Cuba neither Venezuela,"" Bolivian protesters chanted last month The suspension prompted suspicions among supporters of opposition candidate Carlos Mesa that the result had been rigged to allow Mr Morales, who has been in power since 2006 to stay on for another five years. The final result gave Mr Morales just over the 10-percentage-point lead he needed to win outright in the first round of the presidential election. Election observers from the Organization of American States (OAS) expressed their concerns and an audit by the body is currently underway. However, Mr Mesa has rejected the audit arguing that it was agreed without his or his party's input. Mr Morales has accused Mr Mesa of staging a coup d'etat and supporters of each side have squared off in La Paz and other cities.

Bill Gates criticises Warren's wealth tax plans,"Bill Gates has become the latest billionaire to express concern for presidential hopeful Elizabeth Warren's plan for a new tax on the super-rich. At a conference, the philanthropist and Microsoft founder said it would stifle business innovation in America. Ms Warren, a Democratic front-runner in the 2020 presidential race, has offered to meet Mr Gates in response. It comes after criticism of Ms Warren's policy from figures like Jamie Dimon, head of banking giant JP Morgan. Under the original plan, households with a net worth between $50m (Â£39m) and $1bn (Â£780m) will be charged with a 2% ""wealth tax"" every year. This would rise to 3% for any households with a net worth of over $1bn. But last week, Ms Warren suggested doubling the latter rate - from 3% to 6%. She said the money raised from this new tax would be used to fund her healthcare plan, which is expected to cost the federal government $20.5tn over 10 years. Mr Gates hit back at the idea during a talk at the New York Times DealBook conference in New York on Wednesday. Are US billionaires really going to pay more tax? 'Those of us who are blessed must pay more tax' ""I'm all for super-progressive tax systems,"" he said. ""I've paid over $10bn in taxes. I've paid more than anyone in taxes. If I had to pay $20bn, it's fine. ""But when you say I should pay $100bn, then I'm starting to do a little math about what I have left over. Sorry, I'm just kidding,"" he added. ""So you really want the incentive system to be there and you can go a long ways without threatening that."" Mr Gates is the second-richest person in the world, according to Forbes magazine, with a net worth of $106.2bn. When asked if he would be willing to meet with her about the policy, Mr Gates said he wasn't sure if Ms Warren would ""sit down with somebody who has large amounts of money"". Hours after his comments, Ms Warren said she would ""love"" to meet Mr Gates to explain her plan in more detail. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tax reform has become a key talking point among contenders for the US presidential election. The debate has been partially spurred by tax reform under Donald Trump's administration, which the president dubbed ""the biggest tax cut in history"". Mr Trump said cuts would help to boost the economy, but critics argue they disproportionately benefit the country's wealthiest individuals. Earlier this year, a group of America's richest people penned an open lettercalling on presidential candidates to roll out a wealth tax on the super-rich. ""America has a moral, ethical and economic responsibility to tax our wealth more,"" they said in a letter, proposing that the money be spent on tackling climate change and economic inequality. Signatories included investor George Soros and Facebook co-founder Chris Hughes. The group said they were non-partisan and not endorsing any candidate.

Three arrested after care home slavery allegations,"Warrants were carried out at Danygraig Nursing Home (pictured) and Ashville Residential Care Home Three men have been arrested amid allegations that staff at two care homes were victims of modern day slavery. Gwent Police and the National Crime Agency (NCA) carried out warrants at Danygraig Nursing Home in Newport and Ashville Residential Care Home in Brithdir on Thursday morning. Two Newport men, aged 53 and 64 and a third from Surrey, 43, are in custody. A reception centre for potential victims has been set up. A number of police remain outside Ashville Care Home and officers are also focusing on a nearby house where local people have said a group of up to 13 women live, according to BBC Wales reporter Nelli Bird, who is at the scene. One neighbour said they saw police arrive at the house at around 06.30 GMT. Police remain at Ashville Residential Care Home The neighbour, who did not want to be named, said: ""I went to have a nose through the window. There was a lady stood there on her own. ""Then about half hour later two men came. They were going to put the door through but then they let them in through the back. ""[The women] are back and forth, they're always dragging suitcases around. ""There are men coming back and forth. They're always partying in there. ""The youngest looks about 18, oldest could be 40 or 50."" Det Ch Supt Nicky Brain said: ""The offences that are being investigated are serious... ""We would like to reassure [residents and their families] that this investigation is not as a result of any concerns raised regarding crimes committed against people residing in these homes."" Gwent Police said officers from its human trafficking team were working with partner agencies including the British Red Cross, the Salvation Army and New Pathways.

from whisky tasting and boiler suits to campaign buses and toasted marshmallows
â and there have been plenty of photo ops along the way. Hereâs a recap: That's all from us tonight, join us again tomorrow morning. Mr Corbyn reiterates Labour's pledge to scrap tuition fees. He says he cannot understand why it now ""seems extreme to provide free education"". He adds: ""The whole of society develops better when everyone is better educated and has those opportunities."" The Labour leader says it is not just about universities though, and about ""learning for life, culture and imagination"". To back that, Mr Corbyn says Labour will pledge to give every child the chance to learn music. ""But all of this takes place with our determination to run an economy fairly,"" he adds. Concluding his speech, Mr Corbyn says Labour has a ""massive huge agenda in front of us"". And he calls on his supporters to ""get our message out there... with unity, optimism and hope."" Mr Corbyn reiterates his campaign mantra that ""the NHS is not for sale"", and the crowd chants the same. But he says the first thing a Labour government will do is ""bring together [people] over Brexit"" - something he says has been his ""whole strategy"" from the start. Mr Corbyn says one family living in the north west on zero hours contracts and in private rented accommodation could have voted Leave, while another living in the same conditions but in London could have voted Remain. But he says: ""Don't set one family against the other. Bring people together. ""Because both of those families, both of those communities, need a Labour government who will deal with injustice and poverty."" Mr Corbyn explains his party's Brexit stance again,which is to renegotiate with the EU and then put it to another public vote. You can read about Labour's Brexit position in more detail here. Jeremy Corbyn comes out to the crowd singing his name. He says he is ""proud to be live at the Apollo"". ""When a few months ago I promised you a people powered election campaign the like of which the country have never seen before, I saw some people look skeptical"", he says. ""But this afternoon we passed a milestone."" The Labour leader announces the party has raised Â£1m from public donations, with the average donation being Â£26. ""I am more proud of Â£26 being donated to our campaign by people who believe in what we are doing than someone giving money who has lots of money to buy influence on our political system,"" he says. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Correspondent A Labour candidate in Aberdeenshire has quit following a row over anti-Semitism. Kate Ramsden stood down in the Gordon constituency after the Jewish Chronicle highlighted a blog post in which they said she compared Israel to an abused child that becomes an abusive adult, and claimed anti-Semitism allegations against Jeremy Corbyn were âorchestrated by the wealthy establishmentâ. Scottish Labourâs ruling body had decided to reconsider Ms Ramsdenâs candidacy. A party source said they had taken âswift and robustâ action. Itâs understood Ms Ramsden, an official with the UNISON trade union, is now subject to a Labour Party disciplinary hearing. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey comes out cheering for her Salford constituency. She says the election is ""critical"", especially when it comes to climate change. Without it being reversed, she said, the future will be ""bleak"" and ""littered with droughts, floods, crazy weather patterns and food insecurity"". But she says there is ""good news too"". Ms Long-Bailey says: ""If we take action now, not only can we reverse climate change but can use that act of saving our future as a huge economic opportunity to rebuild our entire economy."" Next to take to the stage is Angela Rayner - Labour's shadow secretary of state for education. She calls on the audience to make some noise for Jeremy Corbyn, and cheers echo round the Apollo. Mr Rayner says she is ""energised"" for the election, and describes growing up in Stockport. ""We were on the UB40.... my mum couldn't read and write,"" she says. ""I left school without qualifications, pregnant and 16."" She claims a Tory minister at the time said women like her were only getting pregnant for council houses and she felt she may not be able to achieve anything. ""Hasn't the last week shown us what this Tory nasty party is all about?"", she says. But Ms Rayner says the Labour movement will allow her to deliver for everyone with a ""National Education Service"" and show there are opportunities for people from any background. We're still waiting for Jeremy Corbyn to take to the stage - he's expected soon. In the meantime, we can tell you about Ian Byrne, who is one of the newest candidates selected a few days ago to run in Liverpool West Derby. He tells the crowd he works for a food bank and has seen ""working class solidarity"" at work. ""Politics isn't working. We need change, we need real change"", he says. The pledges made by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell this morning were ""absolutely music to my ears"", he tells the crowd. You can read about the pledges here.  Labour MP Lucy Powell is kicking off the rally in the Manchester Apollo. She apologises to the crowds for having to wait in the rain before the event, but adds: ""We love our Manchester rain"". She introduces a number of prospective candidates in the region, including those standing in Liverpool Wavertree and Hazel Grove. Each are now speaking a few words to the cheering audience as the build-up continues to Jeremy Corbyn's appearance. Labourâs Jane Aitchison paused for 12.5 seconds before answering a question about whether another Labour parliamentary candidate, Zarah Sultana, should continue to stand. Ms Sultana has apologised for a 2015 social media post, in which she said she would ""celebrate"" the deaths of Tony Blair and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 Live, Ms Aitchison went on to say that âpeople do celebrate deaths sometimesâ¦ for instance, they celebrated the death of Hitlerâ. You can watch the exchange from earlier below. This video can not be played Comments were made by a Labour parliamentary candidate. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent From the tea plant to the crisp factory - with a whisky
distillery in between - the prime ministerâs visits followed a theme today. Picture-friendly locations in specifically chosen marginal
constituencies, with protective clothing compulsory. And while Boris Johnson shared a brew with some staff - and tasted a single malt or two with the master distiller - there was a distinct
lack of any interaction which wasnât carefully controlled. Thatâs not unusual for an election campaign, especially
in the early stages when parties are close to paranoid about staying on
message. But while Mr Johnson will always deliver the goods for
the cameras, his encounters with voters tend to be a little more unpredictable. At a sensitive time, when politics is more divisive than
anyone can remember, any encounters with the general public, anywhere, are
likely to be lively. He can only stay in a bubble for so long. A Labour MP deselected for backing protesters in an LGBT teaching row will stand as an independent candidate. Roger Godsiff, who represented Birmingham Hall Green, wasbanned from standing by the party's National Executive Committee (NEC)on Wednesday. Mr Godsiff, 73, said a ""small intolerant vindictive group"" within the LGBT community had stirred up a ""witch-hunt"" against him. Read the full story here.

Boris Johnson has finished his campaign events today by visiting a crisp factory in Northern Ireland. While at the Tayto crisp factory in Tandragee, he helped sort potatoes, ate some crisps and boxed up packets to ship out. Mr Johnson told reporters he was there to tell them about his ""great deal"" for Brexit, despite Northern Ireland voting for Remain in the referendum. He said: ""[The deal] is a wonderful thing for Northern Ireland because it allows for the whole of the UK to leave while making sure there isn't any border at all between Northern Ireland and the south... and no friction between East/West."" Critics of Mr Johnson's deal, however, claim it builds a border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the Irish Sea. You can read more about Mr Johnson's Brexit deal from our Reality Check team here.

we'll do our best to answer them. Today we have been answering questions specifically from younger
people, like this one from Stephen Blaney in Manchester: Q - Can a candidate standing for a constituency demand a recount at the general election? A - According to the Electoral Commission ""any candidate or election agent may request to have the votes recounted or, following a recount, recounted again"". The final decision as to whether a recount is allowed is taken by the returning officer (though usually by the acting returning officer, as the former post is largely ceremonial), who has overall responsibility for the conduct of the election in that constituency. They will decide if the request is a reasonable one, for example when two or more candidates are separated by a small number of votes.  You can readmore answers to questions from young people here. A Conservative candidateembroiled in a row after saying during a debate on a rape case that women should ""keep their knickers on""says he stands by his apology. Nick Conrad - who made the comments when hosting a show on BBC Radio Norfolk in 2014 - apologised for the comments at the time and no further action was taken by the radio industry watchdog. But Labour has said he was not fit to be an MP and should be dropped as a candidate. Asked repeatedly by reporters whether he
should remain a candidate, Mr Conrad says: âI apologised, I stand by that
apology - that apology is so important, so heartfelt, so genuine.â He also says that he expects the Conservative Party to issue a
statement tonight. After Boris Johnson's visit to Scotland, the SNP criticises his stance towards a second referendum on independence for the country. Its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, wants to hold ""indyref2"" next year, claiming that ""it is time"" for independence. But Tory leader Boris Johnson pledged to halt the plan in its tracks. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, calls the stance ""undemocratic and ultimately untenable"". He says: âThe simple fact is that the SNP already has a cast-iron mandate for a
referendum and the Scottish people want the chance to have their say. âEveryone knows there is going to be another independence referendum. It is
inevitable. ""And with support for independence on the rise, the Tories sound
rattled and are becoming increasingly desperate."" Mr Blackford says the Tories ""canât continue to stand in the way of democracy indefinitely"", adding: ""The people of Scotland wonât stand for it.â  Phillip Lee, Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger are all running as Lib Dem candidates Our political research team regularly checks what is called the ""register of interests"" for MPs. It reveals any financial interests they have which others might ""reasonably"" consider to influence their actions or words. The team has had a look at some of the Liberal Democrats' prospective candidates. Former Tory Phillip Lee - who is now running for the party against Conservative stalwart Sir John Redwood - registered Â£80,000 of donations towards his
Wokingham campaign last week. The main donor was M7 Real Estate, owned by Richard Croft, who, like the Lib Dems, is anti-Brexit. Former Labour and The Independent Group for Change MP Chuka Umunna has received Â£20,000 from Russell
Chambers, who was donor to the so-called TIGs. And fellow ex-Labour and TIGer Luciana Berger registered Â£10,000 from a property
firm two weeks ago. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister is here in Craigavon, Northern Ireland, visiting a crisp factory. This is his last stop on a far-reaching visit across the UK today. He's come here very much to spread the message that the Conservatives are the party that will keep the union of the United Kingdom together. But of course Northern Ireland and that subject is tricky territory for him because the Brexit deal Boris Johnson has negotiated, in some people's eyes, puts an administrative border down the Irish Sea, and the DUP, whose support he would've been keen to keep, was not able to support him. So it's a tough argument for the prime minister to have to make here. Also, the alliance that we're seeing emerging between Sinn FÃ©in and the Green Party in some seats may well make it harder for the DUP and other unionist parties naturally aligned to the Conservatives to hang on to those Westminster seats.

Nativity play school polling stations row deepens,"Election officers have hit back angrily at calls from the education secretary for general election polling stations not to be placed in schools. Gavin Williamson wanted to avoid disruption to school nativity plays and Christmas concerts, which could clash with the 12 December election day. But election officers have written to the education secretary to express their ""extreme disappointment"". They say in many areas there are ""no alternatives"" to using schools. This week Mr Williamson wrote to returning officers telling them that councils would be funded to find alternative venues for polling stations - and not to use schools as places to vote. He said he wanted to make sure that ""long-planned and important events"" in schools at Christmas, such as plays and carol concerts, would not have to be cancelled. Nativity play warning over school polling stations The UK general election of 2019: A really simple guide But the announcement has prompted anger from the Association of Electoral Administrators, which is the professional body representing people who run elections. In a stinging letter to Mr Williamson, they accuse him of a ""complete lack of knowledge and understanding"". ""We question why this letter was sent out so late, after most polling stations have already been booked,"" say the election officers, who warn that arranging a December election at short notice is already challenging enough. They reject Mr Williamson's claim that ""every community"" will have alternative venues for voting, so that schools will not have to be used. ""That is simply not the case. In many parts of the United Kingdom, including towns and cities but especially in rural areas, there are simply no alternatives to the venues designated as polling places,"" says the letter from the association. Chief executive Peter Stanyon says the process of deciding where to locate polling stations has mostly taken place - and the data has been sent to printers for polling cards. He says schools are used as polling stations because they are well-known local venues and are likely to be accessible for people with disabilities - and often there are not any other practical options.

Two teens guilty of murdering Jodie Chesney,"This video can not be played Detective Inspector Perry Benton explains how the Met Police pieced together evidence to catch Jodie's killers Two teenagers have been found guilty of murdering 17-year-old Jodie Chesney in a park in east London. Jodie was stabbed in the back in a case of mistaken identity as she socialised with friends in Harold Hill on 1 March. Drug dealer Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and a 17-year-old boy were both convicted of murder following an eight-week trial at the Old Bailey. Manuel Petrovic, 20, of Romford, and a 16-year-old boy were both cleared of murder and manslaughter. Stabbed in the back and left to die As it happened: Jodie Chesney murder trial verdicts The jury spent less than six hours deliberating their verdicts on all four defendants. Judge Wendy Joseph QC said Ong-a-Kwie and the 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, would be sentenced on 18 November. Svenson Ong-a-Kwie was one of two people to be found guilty of Jodie's murder Following the guilty verdicts, Det Ch Insp Dave Whellams, of Scotland Yard, said the murder of ""girl next door"" Jodie had ""shocked a nation"". He added: ""It could have been anybody's daughter. She was a very nice girl, she had a small circle of friends, she did well at school, worked in the community. ""They have gone there purposefully to stab somebody and they have not cared who they stabbed. They stabbed a 17-year-old girl in the back for no reason."" The 17-year-old was stabbed once in the back while she was socialising with friends in Amy's Park Throughout the trial it was never disputed that Ong-a-Kwie and the teenager were the two people who went into Amy's Park on the night Jodie was stabbed. The pair blamed each other for the stabbing, while Ong-a-Kwie admitted burning his clothes with a cigarette lighter. Jurors heard Jodie had her back to her attackers and the knife almost passed right through her body. After being stabbed the teenager screamed and fell into the arms of her boyfriend Eddie Coyle, the court was told. Frantic efforts were made to save her but she was pronounced dead in a petrol station in Gants Hill about an hour later. Jodie's boyfriend Eddie Coyle described the motion the attacker used to stab her Following the verdict, Peter Chesney said his daughter's murder had ""destroyed my life"". ""I have no idea how I am going to continue with my life or even come to terms with the loss,"" he said. Jodie's sister Lucy wrote in a victim impact statement that she had been ""dreading my life rather than looking forward to it"" following the 17-year-old's death. ""Jodie was not only my sister she was my best friend. Losing her is like losing half of myself."" She added that she was now ""anxious about everything"" as ""if someone as good and pure as Jodie could be murdered, it could happen to anyone and I spend everywhere I go looking over my shoulder because of it"". Witnesses described Amy's Park as being ""very dark"" at the time of the attack Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told the jury Jodie was ""a victim of a brutal act of unprovoked violence"". He described the girl's death as ""another example"" of the ""terrible consequences of the carrying and using of knives"". ""It seems every day now in our city another young life is lost to a knife,"" he said. During his evidence, Mr Petrovic admitted driving the group to Harold Hill but denied any knowledge of what happened in Amy's Park.

"Holocaust survivor under guard amid death threatsLiliana Segre, 89, is assigned two police officers in Italy after hundreds of anti-Semitic messages.","Liliana Segre has reported receiving about 200 hate messages a day An 89-year-old Holocaust survivor in Italy has been assigned police guards for protection after receiving hundreds of threats on social media. Liliana Segre, who was sent to the notorious Auschwitz death camp at 13, has been subjected to a barrage of anti-Semitic messages in recent days. It comes after Ms Segre, an Italian life senator, called for parliament to establish a committee to combat hate. The motion passed despite a lack of support by Italy's right-wing parties. Members of the nationalist League party, led by Matteo Salvini, the centre-right Forza Italia and the far-right Brothers of Italy all abstained from the vote in Milan last week. The motion called for the establishment of an extraordinary commission in Italy to combat all forms of racism, anti-Semitism, incitement to hatred and violence on ethnic and religious grounds. Ms Segre said after the vote that the abstentions made her feel ""like a Martian in the Senate"". ""I appealed to the conscience of everyone,externaland thought that a commission against hatred as a principle would be accepted by all,"" she said at the time, Italy's La Repubblica reported (in Italian). Since then, she has reported receiving as many as 200 hate messages a day. Some of the threats have been so serious that the prefect of Milan, Renato Saccone, held a meeting on Wednesday with the committee for security and public order, where it was agreed that Ms Segre needed police protection. The measures that were approved include Ms Segre being accompanied in public by two paramilitary carabinieri officers. Meanwhile, the Milan public prosecutor's office said it had opened an investigation into the hate messages targeting the senator and had requested the assistance of Italy's anti-terror police. Tears as Greek, 92, meets Jews she saved in WW2 Child Holocaust witness reveals lucky escape aboard The Lost Train In depth: The Holocaust year by year This video can not be played Holocaust survivors: The families who werenât meant to live Ms Segre was born in Milan in 1930. She fled Nazi persecution in Italy with her father in December 1943. After failing to secure refuge in Switzerland, the pair were sent by train to the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland the following month, where her father and grandparents were killed. Along with other Jewish prisoners transferred from Auschwitz in January 1945, Ms Segre was taken to the RavensbrÃ¼ck concentration camp in Germany. Weeks later she was moved to another camp operated by the Nazis which was eventually liberated by the Soviet Red Army. Ms Segre was made an Italian senator for life by President Sergio Mattarella in January 2018. Italy has a population of about 30,000 Jews. More than 7,500 Italian Jews died during the Holocaust.

Bodies found in lorry have all been identified,"The bodies were discovered in a lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October The 39 Vietnamese people found dead in a refrigerated lorry have all been formally identified, police said. Essex Police had been working with Vietnamese officials to identify the 31 men and eight women found dead in Grays, Essex, on 23 October. A series of files have been handed to Essex senior coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray. The force said it wanted to give families time to take in the news before making the names public. The victims came from Vietnamese provinces Haiphong, Hai Duong, Nghe An, Ha Tinh, Quang Binh and Hue, according to police in the country. Assistant Chief Constable for Essex Tim Smith said identification was ""an important step"" in the investigation. The bodies were found on the Waterglade Industrial Estate after the container had travelled to nearby Purfleet from Zeebrugge, in Belgium. The driver of the lorry, Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, appeared in court last week charged with a number of offences, including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant. Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking. There have been 11 arrests in two provinces of Vietnam in relation to the deaths. Pham Thi Tra My and Nguyen Dinh Luong's families are concerned they may be among the victims Assistant Chief Constable Smith said: ""It is only right that we provide an opportunity for family members to take in the news confirming the death of their loved ones before releasing any further information. ""Our thoughts remain with the families and friends of those whose tragic journey ended on our shores."" The Reverend Simon Nguyen, who led the service, said the victims lost their lives ""seeking freedom, dignity and happiness"" A service was heldin memory of the victimsat the Church of the Holy Name and Our Lady of the Sacred Heart in east London on Saturday evening. Coroner Mrs Beasley Murray offered her ""deepest condolences"" to the victims' families. This article was based on public announcements and appeals made by Essex Police at the relevant time. Christopher Hughes denies any involvement in these offences and Essex Police has since confirmed no further action will be taken against him. Since the publication of this article, his older brother, Ronan Hughes, 41, and Maurice Robinson, 26, both of County Armagh, have pleaded guilty to manslaughter. On 21 December 2020, the Crown Court, sitting at the Old Bailey, found Eamonn Harrison, 24 of Newry, County Down, and Gheorghe Nica, 43 of Basildon, Essex, guilty of manslaughter and Christopher Kennedy, 24, of County Armagh, and Valentin Calota 38, of Birmingham, guilty of conspiring to assist illegal immigration. Alexandru-Ovidiu Hanga, 28, of Tilbury, Essex, and Gazmir Nuzi, 43, of Tottenham, north London, admitted assisting unlawful immigration. All defendants were sentenced in January 2021.

"Labour and Tories pledge more borrowingJohn McDonnell sets out investment plans, as the Tories also vow to spend on infrastructure.Election 2019Comments","This video can not be played John McDonnell: Â£150bn fund for ""human emergency created by Tories"" Labour has promised ""investment on a scale never seen before"" to overhaul infrastructure in all areas of the UK. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says he wants to transfer power and money out of the south-east of England - and will fund his plans through borrowing. The Tories have also vowed to borrow to fund more spending, rewriting their current financial rules. Chancellor Sajid Javid denied copying Labour's plans, saying he would practise ""sensible stewardship"". But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Ed Davey warned that both parties were ""writing promises on cheques that will bounce"". Labour and the Conservatives say they want to take advantage of historically low interest rates to spend more on transport, hospitals and other infrastructure projects. They are locked in a battle for votes in the Midlands and north of England in swing seats that could decide who forms the next government on 12 December. Labour and Tories plan for a post-austerity future Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson stands down Live: Latest on the general election trail Will the Tories' Brexit-heavy campaign work? Bank warns Brexit deal would hit economic growth Both parties are also promising to shift power and control of spending out of London - but they have different ideas about how to do that. Speaking in Liverpool, Mr McDonnell promised to set up a Treasury unit in the north of England to take spending decisions out of Whitehall. The Conservatives have promised to give the north of England more control over its railways, greater powers for some elected mayors and a new economic development body. The campaign speeches over investment come as: Former Labour MPs Ian Austin and John Woodcockcalled on votersto vote for the Conservatives Pro-Remain parties Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Lib Dems agreednot to stand against each otherin dozens of seats Election officershit backat calls from the education secretary for polling stations not to be placed in schools This video can not be played Chancellor Sajid Javid attacks Labour's ""fantasy economics"" At the 2017 general election, Labour announced plans to set up a national transformation fund to overhaul the UK's transport links and infrastructure. This includes a social transformation fund, which Mr McDonnell said would now get an extra Â£100bn, providing a Â£150bn pot to be spent over the next five years. A further Â£250bn of investment will be spent across the country through the Green Transformation Fund. Mr McDonnell said the investment would help a Labour government address a ""climate emergency"", as well as a ""human emergency which has been created by the Tories"". He said his party would introduce new fiscal rules, meaning ""borrowing for investment"" would not be included in borrowing targets. He added the new approach would mean public assets created by infrastructure spending would be ""recognised both as a cost and as a benefit"". Politicians often talk of how many billions they would spend on schools, hospitals, upgrading roads, and so on. A billion is a thousand million (or Â£1,000,000,000 written in full). It used to have a different meaning in the UK. Until the 1970s, it meant a million million, but Prime Minister Harold Wilson adopted the US definition. With Â£1bn, you could pay the average full-time worker's salary nearly 33,000 times. For a government, the cash doesn't go as far. It costs Â£1bn to run the NHS across the UK for just three days, according to the King's Fund. But Mr Javid attacked Labour's investment plans, accusing the party of wanting to ""spray money round like confetti"", and indulging in ""fantasy economics"". He said the ""transformation"" in the economy since the Conservatives took power ""was not the result of some fiscal cycle"", but ""down to solid economic stewardship"". ""By far the biggest fear of business is a Corbyn-led government,"" he added. BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz Both main parties now agree that this era of unusually low interest rates provides an opportunity to borrow to invest. Both will push up the national debt. Both argue that stepping up investment now will make the UK more productive later on. The question, as ever, is how much will they borrow and how much debt they think the UK can support. Labour is adding a cool Â£150bn to its investment plans over five years, a very big sum. John McDonnell believes by spending on schools, hospitals and other infrastructure he would create a virtuous circle, a bigger economy which could afford the debt. Sajid Javid would replace the Tories' self-imposed limits on borrowing with less stringent rules, including the promise that annual investment in projects like road and rail would not exceed 3% of national output. He says the difference between his and Labour's plans is ""like night and day"" but, however they differ, debt looks set to rise. Mr Javid said his plans to increase debt as a share of national income would increase spending by ""an extra Â£20bn a year over a five year period"". He added that ""you could easily add another Â£100bn to that"" but the details would be set out in the Conservative manifesto. And he said ending the uncertainty over Brexit was ""the most important thing the economy needs right now"", and would ""unleash"" more private investment. Conservative leader Boris Johnson said the last nine years of his party's government had resulted in ""solid growth"", ""record low"" unemployment and the cost of borrowing ""at an all-time low"". ""It's thanks to the prudence of the Conservatives that we are able to make some investments in our infrastructure, in technology, in our public services and the reason we can do that is because we understand the vital importance of a strong economy,"" Mr Johnson said. He said the ""biggest threat"" currently facing the UK economy was the ""uncertainty that is still being posed to our political system by the whole Brexit debate"", but his plan was to bring back his deal in December so the UK could leave the EU in January. However, for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Davey said ""any form of Brexit"" would mean ""less tax revenue"" and would make the economy ""weaker"". ""Neither Labour or the Tories can square their spending promises today with the cost of Brexit,"" he said. ""In contrast, every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit, build a brighter future and invest the Â£50bn Remain bonus in our vital public services and tackle inequality."" We have got into something of a bidding war between the two parties. The Tories are talking about extra cash for police, for upgrading hospitals, for what they call an infrastructure revolution. John McDonnell is talking about pouring hundreds of billions for a once-in-a-generation upgrade to the country's infrastructure. They're on the same terrain - they're both talking about the end of austerity. They're both talking about a big increase in government spending, and they're both talking about paying for this by borrowing. The risk for the government is that they might be seen as ""Labour-lite"" - offering something similar, but not as ambitious. What question do you have about the general election?

PC in court charged with footballer's murder,"Dalian Atkinson played for Aston Villa, Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday A police officer has been charged with the murder of retired footballer Dalian Atkinson who died after being tasered. The ex-Aston Villa striker, 48, was restrained by police officers at his father's house in Telford, Shropshire, on 15 August 2016. A second police officer, also from the West Mercia Police force, has been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm. Both were bailed after appearing at Birmingham Crown Court. The Crown Prosecution Services (CPS) has not named the officers because it believes their defence will apply for them to remain anonymous. Judge Simon Drew allowed the officers' identities to remain undisclosed over concerns there may be a threat to their lives, although this will be reviewed at a hearing next week. An alternative charge of an unlawful act manslaughter has also been put forward by the CPS for the officer charged with murder, known as ""Officer A"". The second officer, ""Officer B"", indicated she would plead not guilty and was bailed after an earlier appearance at Birmingham Magistrates' Court. Officer A did not indicate a plea but was also granted bail at a later hearing at the city's crown court. Dalian Atkinson started his career in Ipswich in the 1980s The CPS made the decision to press charges following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Mr Atkinson's family has been informed, a spokesperson said, and issued a statement welcoming the decision but they ""regret that already more than three years have passed since Dalian died"". The fast life of Dalian Atkinson Latest news from the West Midlands Police officers attended Meadow Close in Trench, Telford, where Mr Atkinson was detained outside an address at about 01:30 BST. He was taken by ambulance to the Princess Royal Hospital where he later died. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent It's rare for a police officer to be charged with murder following the death of someone they were in contact with on duty. The last time this happened in the UK was five years ago, when Anthony Long, a retired Metropolitan Police firearms officer,was charged with the murder of robbery suspect Azelle Rodney. He was shot dead in north-west London in 2005, but 10 years later Mr Long was acquitted. The exact circumstances of Dalian Atkinson's death haven't been revealed and it is not known whether the Taser contributed to, or caused, his death. However this is believed to be the first time an officer has been charged with murder after a person has been tasered by police. Relatives said the former footballer was suffering from a number of health issues and had a weak heart when the Taser was deployed. Mr Atkinson started his career at Ipswich Town before moving to Sheffield Wednesday, Real Sociedad, Aston Villa and FenerbahÃ§e in Turkey. He is best remembered for scoring the Match of the Day goal of the season in 1992-93 when he dribbled the ball from inside his own half before chipping the Wimbledon keeper from the edge of the penalty area. In a statement, West Mercia Police said: ""Our thoughts continue to remain with the family and friends of Dalian Atkinson at this difficult time."" Chief Constable Anthony Bangham said it would not be appropriate to comment on the circumstances around Mr Atkinson's death, but added he would ensure the officers in question ""have the appropriate support throughout the forthcoming criminal justice process"". The IOPC said it appreciates the ""patience"" shown during their investigation, which concluded in October 2018. Actions of a third police officer, who was also investigated over Mr Atkinson's death, were not referred to the CPS, the watchdog added. Both defendants are next expected to appear in court on 9 December. However, a hearing on Wednesday will decide whether they can be named following an application by the media. Dalian Atkinson's career Dalian Atkinson started his footballing career as an apprentice with Ipswich He signed for Sheffield Wednesday for Â£450,000 in 1989 His sole international appearance was with the England B team in 1990, against Ireland In August 1990 Atkinson moved to Spain, joining Real Sociedad for Â£1.7m Ron Atkinson signed him for a second time in July 1991 - bringing him back to England to play for Aston Villa His strike against Wimbledon was named the goal of the 1992-93 season Atkinson joined Turkish side FenerbahÃ§e in 1995, but failed to settle He later played for Manchester City as well as clubs in Saudi Arabia and South Korea Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, andsign up for local news updates direct to your phone,external.

Minimum eight-year term for doctor who killed mum,"Declan Kevin O'Neill admitted killing his mother A south Belfast doctor who received a life sentence for the murder of his mother has been told he will serve at least eight years in prison before he can be considered for release on licence. The minimum tariff was imposed during a hearing at Belfast Crown Court on Thursday. Declan O'Neill murdered his mother Anne at her parents' house in October 2017. In September, he was sentenced to life imprisonment. However, last month, a court heard the 29-year-old had been raised ""in almost third-world conditions"" and in an atmosphere of ""intimidation and bullying"". Anne O'Neill died in October 2017 Mrs O'Neill, 51, was found in the garden of her elderly parents' home in Ardmore Avenue in Finaghy on 21 October, 2017. O'Neill had attacked her with a chisel and laterpleaded guilty to murdering her. Explaining the difficulty of sentencing in the particular circumstances of the case, the judge said: ""All murders are tragic, but there is something particularly troubling about the murder of a mother by a son.  It runs against the natural order of things."" He said that the natural reaction to such an event is that ""something has gone badly wrong"", adding that the murder becomes ""stranger when one learns that the defendant is in fact a qualified medical doctor, a profession devoted to the care of others and the protection of life"". BBC News NI's Declan Harvey in court The public gallery was almost empty save for Declan O'Neill's grandfather and father - who are also the victim's father and ex-partner. They gave no reaction as the tariff was revealed. Declan O'Neill sobbed through much of the hearing, as he has done on previous occasions. It's perhaps evidence of the great remorse the court had heard he has felt since the brutal killing. He's already served almost two years in prison on remand, so they will be deducted from his eight-year prison sentence. The judge said statements provided by the defendant's sister and grandmother (Mrs O'Neill's mother) were ""unique and compelling"" in that both were ""extremely supportive of the defendant and [made] a compelling and moving plea for clemency on the defendant's behalf"". Anne O'Neill: Son who killed mother was 'controlled by her' Anne O'Neill: Son is sentenced to life for her murder However, he added that it was ""essential to remember that a person had been killed as a result of the defendant's actions"". ""Anne O'Neill's death was brutal, senseless and unnecessary,"" he said. ""Much has been said about her in the course of these remarks, but nothing that has been said should take away from this fundamental point."" A pre-sentence report assessed the likelihood of O'Neill re-offending as being low and noted that he presented with a high level of regret and is ""clearly struggling to come to terms with the consequences of his actions and repeatedly stated how much he missed his mother"". Speaking after the sentencing, PSNI Det Insp Joanne Harris described the case as ""very sad"" and ""harrowing for all concerned"". ""No matter what the circumstances are that led to the murder of Anne, no-one has the right to take another person's life,"" she said. ""I cannot imagine the distress and suffering Anne's daughter must be feeling today as she mourns for her mother, whilst also having to come to terms with the fact that her brother will be serving eight years in prison for [her] murder.""

Council criticised for 'can't vote' letter error,"Swindon Borough Council has asked people to ignore the letter as it was sent ""by mistake"" A council that wrongly warned thousands of voters they would not be able to vote in the general election has been criticised for the blunder. Swindon Borough Council admitted nearly 3,000 voters were contacted in error. Residents were toldin the letterthey would be ""removed from the Register of Electors"" as they were ""not entitled to remain registered"" at their property. The council has asked people to ignore the letter as it was sent ""by mistake"". Originally it was thought the letters had been sent to 1,500 voters but the council has since said about 3,000 people were contacted. Jennifer Miles said she had a ""borderline heart attack"" when her letter arrived at her home, adding: ""I was absolutely aghast."" ""It's these kind of things that make people nervous or disillusioned about going out to vote, and that's negative for society,"" she said. ""Swindon is a marginal constituency and the vote really, really does matter here."" By Dan O'Brien, BBC Wiltshire political reporter This is a cock-up rather than a conspiracy, but the timing is pretty dreadful. About 3,000 people were sent a letter by mistake suggesting they may not be able to vote, in a town which historically is known to be a close race at election time. The fact councils send out letters like this isn't unusual, they all regularly check up on who is registered to vote at each address to reduce the risk of voter fraud. But the error here, we're told, is who those letters got sent to. The council's printers used the wrong distribution list - if you have such a letter and it's dated  4 November, ignore it.  You will get another very soon explaining what's happened, and you will still get your polling card. South Swindon was particularly close last time around - in a constituency of 70,000, the Tories won a majority of just 2,400. So it's easy to see why political campaigners across the spectrum are worried and clearly angry about anything that could stop local people voting on 12 December. The letter, dated 4 November, said the Conservative-run council was reviewing its ""registration entitlement"" and it was the authority's ""opinion"" that the resident was ""not entitled to remain registered at this property"". Recipients were warned that if they did not appeal against the decision within 14 days they would be removed from the electoral register. Another person who received the letter, Anthony Clarkson, said: ""I couldn't believe what I was reading. I thought it must have been some sort of scam."" Swindon is historically a close race at election time Andrew Whitford, another recipient, said he thought it ""could affect the outcome of the general election and should be investigated completely"". South Swindon Labour parliamentary candidate Sarah Church said: ""Any hint of removing anyone's right to vote is simply unacceptable and a mistake on this scale is really unforgivable."" Ms Church is due to stand against Conservative Robert Buckland, the Brexit Party's Justin Stares, Liberal Democrat Stan Pajak and Steve Thompson for The Green Party. Mr Buckland called it an ""unacceptable error"" and Mr Pajak described it as a ""threat to democracy"". In a statement, the council said anyone who received a letter should ignore it. ""The error occurred after our printers used an incorrect distribution list,"" it said. The authority added it would be writing to every resident who had received a letter in error to explain what had happened and to apologise.

Labour voters should back Johnson - ex Labour MP,"This video can not be played Former Labour MP Ian Austin tells the BBC's Today programme that Jeremy Corbyn is ""completely unfit to lead our country"" Labour voters should support Boris Johnson in the general election, former Labour MP Ian Austin has said. The former minister resigned from the party in February, accusing leader Jeremy Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism. Mr Austin, MP for Dudley North, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Corbyn was ""completely unfit"" to be PM. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the comments were unsurprising as Mr Austin ""now works for the Tory party"". ""What else do you expect him to do,"" he said, ""when you are employed by the Tories you speak on behalf of the Tories?"" In response, Mr Austin said it was ""a complete lie"" to say he was working for the Tories. He said he had been appointed by the government as a trade envoy, an unpaid role, in July ""along with 27 other MPs and peers from different parties"". Live: Latest on the general election campaign Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson stands down Another ex-Labour MP, John Woodcock, said he would be voting Conservative at the election and urged others to do the same. Mr Woodcock has been appointed as special government envoy to tackle violent extremism. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak called Mr Austin's comments a ""truly devastating indictment of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership"". This video can not be played ""He's now employed by the Tories"": John McDonnell hits back at ex-Labour MP Ian Austin's comments on Corbyn Speaking to the Express and Star newspaper,,externalMr Austin also announced he would be standing down as MP for Dudley North - a seat he held at the 2017 election with a majority of just 22. He said: ""I am so sorry that it has come to this, but as has always been the case, I have to do what I think is right."" He added: ""I must do everything I can to stop Jeremy Corbyn from getting into power."" Mr Austin became a Labour councillor in Dudley in his twenties, later working as a press officer for Gordon Brown. He was elected MP for Dudley North in 2005 and served in Mr Brown's government from 2008 to 2010. Mr Austin quit the party earlier this year, blaming Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"" and accused the Labour leadership of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party. Tom Watson has said he is stepping down as Labour deputy leader His comments came afterTom Watson announced he was stepping downas Labour's deputy leader and as an MP. He said the decision was ""personal, not political"" and that he would continue to campaign for the party. But Mr Austin said: ""If Tom thought that Jeremy Corbyn was fit to lead our country and fit to form a government, then he would have been in that cabinet. Would he really be standing down?"" He said Mr Watson was ""appalled"" by ""the scandal of anti-Semitism that has poisoned the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership"". Shadow chancellor John Mc Donnell said those who had expressed anti-Semitism accounted for ""less than 0.1% of the Labour Party membership"". Asked about the Jewish Chronicle's front page - which urges non-Jewish voters not to support Labour - he said he was ""sad about it"" but insisted the party was doing ""everything they asked of us"" to tackle anti-Semitism.

Jodie Chesney: Stabbed in the back and left to die,"Jodie Chesney was stabbed to death just weeks before completing her Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award Two teenagers have been convicted of murdering teenage girl scout Jodie Chesney, who was ambushed by a drug dealer who mistook her for a rival. She was stabbed to death while simply sitting with friends in an east London park. Friday night, college is out and Jodie is looking forward to spending time with her friends. It was all planned - she would meet the group at Amy's Park in Harold Hill, Romford. There she would listen to music and unwind after a busy week. The 17-year-old had spoken to her father, Peter Chesney, that morning - 1 March. It was his birthday. ""She popped her head around the stairs and wished me a happy birthday,"" says Peter. ""She said that my present would arrive in the post the next day - and that she was sorry it was late."" Closing the door behind him, he could never have known that that would be the last time he would see his daughter alive. Sitting on a bench in the home he shared with his two daughters and his partner Joanne, Peter looks up at pictures of Jodie on top of the piano, a shrine perfectly placed on the instrument she loved playing so much. Remembering the ""shy little girl"" growing up, Peter says his daughter had started playing piano in school. ""She played really well. She loved playing classical music like Ludovico Einaudi and Beethoven."" Jodie loved the colour purple - she even dyed her hair that colour on various occasions. Her head teacher at Havering Sixth Form College, Paul Wakeling, says those who knew Jodie knew her as an ""amazingly weird"" young girl. ""She was very quirky and different as is evident by her hair colours. She was artistic and a loving and caring student."" Education was important to Jodie, and she would ""always want to do well"", her father adds. ""She loved school and her subjects. She was in the middle of studying for her A-levels in Photography, Psychology and Sociology. ""Photography was her favourite. She would often go down to the South Bank on her own and take pictures."" Her best friend Clarice Sharp, 18, describes Jodie as helping her come out of her shell. ""I was an introvert,"" she says. ""But when I met Jodie she made me realise the world was a great place to live in. ""We would go shopping together, or go to the movies. We loved pizza. I can't even eat pizza now without thinking of how we would fight over the last slice."" A determination of getting the most out of life also saw Jodie getting involved with the girl scouts. Proud to wear her scout uniform, Jodie had not long completed her Bronze and Silver Duke of Edinburgh award. ""Jodie was simply a beautiful person whose life was cut short just as she was blossoming into a wonderful young woman,"" Peter says. She was weeks away from finishing her Gold Award before she was stabbed to death. At 21:20 on 1 March, Jodie and her friends were well into their night in Amy's Park, sitting on a bench, listening to music and smoking cannabis. ""It was a normal Friday night,"" Clarice says. ""Lots of laughing and joking. ""Earlier that day we had just been chatting about make-up and some boots she had just bought."" It had been dark for some time when Jodie's boyfriend, Eddie Coyle, noticed two figures coming out of the darkness towards them. Jodie was sitting on a bench table with her back to them. Within a few minutes, calm turned to chaos for the teenager and her friends. Jodie was stabbed in the back in an unprovoked and almost silent attack by who we now knowwas 19-year-old Svenson Ong-a-Kwie. She collapsed to the ground. The knife came within millimetres of fully passing through her body. During the trial, Mr Coyle told an Old Bailey jury Jodie had ""screamed"" out in shock. ""She didn't know what had happened. We just thought they had stolen our bags,"" the 18-year-old said. ""But then she started screaming continuously, very loud, and it lasted about two minutes straight. ""Then she began to faint. At this time she was falling off the bench."" It was only when he shone his iPhone torch on to Jodie's back he realised how bad she had been hurt. The white lining of her burgundy denim jacket was covered in blood. He would later learn that Jodie's wound was 18cm deep and penetrated her right lung, causing heavy bleeding. As her attackers fled the scene, a local resident who heard the screams ran out to help and called 999. When an ambulance arrived at 21:30, Jodie showed no sign of life. Jodie's father Peter, who described his daughter as a ""proud geek"", was celebrating his birthday in Dirty Martini in central London when his brother, Dave Chesney, received news of Jodie's injury. ""My brother got a phone call to say that the police were on their way to pick me up because Jodie had been attacked,"" he says. ""As you can imagine I was deep in shock. One minute I'm laughing the next minute Jodie has been attacked."" The police told Peter they were taking him one mile north to The Royal London Hospital, Whitechapel, to see Jodie. Peter never made it to hospital - and neither did Jodie. Despite doctors performing emergency surgery en route to hospital, Jodie was pronounced dead at 22:26 on the forecourt of an Esso Garage in Gants Hill, Ilford. ""I heard over the radio someone telling them to reroute to my house because Jodie had gone,"" Peter says. ""At that moment I just lost my composure and dropped on my knees. I cried all the way home."" Throughout the night, members of Jodie's family made their way to Peter's house to offer support. ""Fences got punched, people were getting angry and then getting sad and then not understanding what was going on,"" Peter says. ""There and then - my life fell apart. ""She died, but there was no reason why she died."" Purple ribbons were tied to bollards outside the Old Bailey on the morning of Jodie Chesney's murder trial It was a miserable rainy Monday morning on 16 September 2019 - the first day of an eight-week trial of two teenagers and two men accused of Jodie's murder. It's a 13-mile journey from Peter's home in east London to the Old Bailey, though it felt like an eternity for the 39-year-old. En route he passed children wearing school uniforms on bikes on their way to Jodie's old school. Svenson Ong-a-Kwie was a known drug dealer in the Harold Hill and Collier Row areas of east London The taxi drove through rush hour traffic from Dagenham into the city - a route which Peter frequently used for his work commute. This journey, however, had a completely different feel. Speaking that day, a nervous Peter said: ""This will be the first time I come face to face with the suspects. Seeing them will make me want to destroy them. But I have to control myself. ""I just want to know why. Why Jodie? She did absolutely nothing to anybody."" Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick visited the scene where Jodie Chesney was stabbed to death The public gallery was packed with members of Jodie's family and friends, all wearing a purple ribbon in her memory. Outside the Old Bailey, purple ribbons were tied to posts and pillars, reminding passers by of the tragedy. Peter sat in the court and listened to those involved in his daughter's murder deny any involvement. It was too much for him to attend everyday. ""It was just killing me. Someone said to me why was I putting myself through this?"" he said. But one day that Peter did attend, was to hear Ong-a-Kwie's evidence. The 19-year-old told jurors he was driven to Harold Hill on the evening of 1 March to drop off drugs. Svenson Ong-a-Kwie disposed of his trainers the morning after Jodie was killed But jurors heard how Ong-a-Kwie was looking to take out a rival drug dealer who was encroaching on his turf. CCTV footage of the defendant and his 17-year-old accomplice was shown to the jury. An expert concluded Ong-a-Kwie was holding an object at waist height which reflected light. The prosecution claimed this was a knife, while Ong-a-Kwie claimed it was his mobile phone. Boyfriend of stabbed girl 'managed to catch her' Svenson Ong-a-Kwie and 17-year-old boy guilty Cell site evidence also proved Ong-a-Kwie's phone was turned off minutes before Jodie was stabbed. The prosecution claimed he mistook Jodie and her friends as his rivals, stabbing Jodie in an ""unprovoked ambush"". Ong-a-Kwie insisted it was his 17-year-old co-defendant who had stabbed Jodie that night. But witness statements from Jodie's friends proved the killer was a dark-skinned tall man in a tracksuit who stood up on the bench before swinging a knife into the innocent girl's back. Jodie's boyfriend, Eddie Coyle, was a witness during the trial His movements after the murder added to the suspicion. He burnt his clothes, dumped his trainers and threw his iPhone into a bin. This behaviour and the evidence convinced the jury, who subsequently found Ong-a-Kwie, of Collier Row, guilty of Jodie's murder. They also found the 17-year-old, of Barking, who also went into the park with Ong-a-Kwie, guilty of murder. Manuel Petrovic, and the 16-year-old boy, both of Romford, were acquitted of all charges. ""Jodie's murder was the terrible but predictable consequence of an all-too casual approach to the carrying - and using - of knives,"" prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC said. Through all the sadness and despair, Peter is determined to positively mark his daughter's life. He set up The Jodie Chesney Foundation, a charity which will aim to tackle knife crime through supporting the parents of children and youths caught up in drug dealing and violence. ""Many charities go into schools, but I think I can be inspirational because it has happened to me,"" he says. ""I can get the message across to kids and parents the real effect as to what this does. How it destroys families. ""I strongly believe it all starts at home. Parents, first and foremost, must take that responsibility - that's a given."" During the trial the prosecution said all four of the defendants accused of Jodie's murder had ""broken homes"" and had ""drifted into a life of crime"". ""What I've been told by local councillors and MPs is that no-one is really there to help the parents as much as they can be - so we are going to fill that void."" For Peter, although he has lost his daughter, he says he will not ""give in to hate"". ""I'm not going to spend my life hating and I know Jodie would not want that of me. ""She's going to want me to be the best version of myself and sitting here with hate is only going to eat me up inside.""

Jodie Chesney stabbing 'was an ambush',"Crispin Aylett QC told the jury to 'put aside any sympathies' they may have in the Jodie Chesney murder trial The fatal stabbing of a teenage girl in an east London park had ""nothing to do with drugs but everything to do with an ambush,"" a court has heard. Jodie Chesney, 17, was knifed in the back on 1 March as she chatted with friends in Harold Hill. In his closing speech, prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told the Old Bailey jury Jodie was ""a victim of a brutal act of unprovoked violence"". All four defendants, aged between 16 and 20, deny murder. Mr Aylett said Jodie's death was ""but another example"" of the ""terrible consequences of the carrying and using of knives"". He added: ""It seems every day now in our city, another young life is lost to a knife. ""I am sorry to say that your verdicts in this trial will not bring this to an end."" Manuel Petrovic and Svenson Ong-a-Kwie both admitted being drug dealers in the Harold Hill and Collier Row areas of east London Manuel Petrovic, 20, from Romford, Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, from Collier Row, a 16-year-old boy and a 17-year-old boy have been on trial since September. Mr Aylett said all four defendants had ""drifted into a life of crime whether stealing motorbikes or drug dealing"". All the details from Day 26 of the Jodie Chesney murder trial On the night Jodie died, Mr Ong-a-Kwie ""urgently"" asked Mr Petrovic for a lift from Collier Row to Harold Hill, the jury was told. Jodie Chesney had been drinking and socialising with friends in Amy's Park, Harold Hill, when she was stabbed in the back Mr Petrovic drove the group in his black Vauxhall Corsa to Retford Road and waited while Mr Ong-a-Kwie and the 17-year-old went into Amy's Park. ""This was an ambush,"" Mr Aylett added: ""The car need to be turned around so they could get away quickly. ""We now know the two in the park were Svenson and the boy, I say now know because the police were not told this before."" The trial continues.

Bank warns Brexit deal would hit economic growth,"The Bank says customs checks will hit trade flows following Brexit The Bank of England has warned that weak global growth and trade barriers created by the government's Brexit deal will hit the UK economy. It came as two Bank policymakers called for an immediate interest rate cut to support growth. The Bank voted 7-2 to keep interest rates on hold,externalat 0.75%. The Bank said the new EU withdrawal agreement struck by Prime Minister Boris Johnson had reduced the likelihood of a no-deal Brexit. The Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) that sets interest rates said this would end some of the uncertainty facing businesses and households. However, policymakers added that the transition to a new trade deal would introduce new customs checks and regulatory barriers. The MPC said its assumption of a Canada-style ""deep free-trade agreement"" between the UK and EU would ""raise administrative costs for firms"" doing business with the continent. Mark Carney, the governor of the Bank of England, said the Brexit deal had created ""the prospects for a pick-up in UK growth"". The Bank expects the annual pace of growth to rise from around 1% at the end of this year to more than 2% by the end of 2022. Mr Carney said this would be helped by ""a world that has stopped weakening and picks up a little bit"". He added: ""three-quarters of that rise in growth is driven by domestic factors  - the most important of which is a reduction in uncertainty driven by an orderly transition to a new Brexit arrangement."" However, the Bank's Monetary Policy Report,externalsaid a weaker global economy and its new assumptions about Brexit would knock 1% off UK growth over the next three years compared with its forecast in August. Policymakers believe the UK economy grew 0.4% in the three months to September this year, double their estimate in August, amid a recovery in the UK's dominant services sector. However, growth in the final quarter of the year is expected to fall back to 0.2%. How big is the UK's economy? Spending pledges by the government are expected to boost growth in the coming years. The Bank also cited research that showed the current level of business investment is about 11% lower because of Brexit uncertainty. For the first time, Bank policymakers changed their assumption about the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. They had previously assumed an average of a range of Brexit outcomes that filter through to the economy over 15 years. It now assumes the government will strike a free-trade agreement with Brussels that will keep goods tariffs at zero but introduce customs checks at the border. With the transition period currently due to expire at the end of 2020, the drag on growth from new regulatory barriers will now be more immediate. Policymakers said: ""As a result, trade flows are likely to fall and some companies might exit the market."" Diverging regulations are also expected to hit a wide variety of sectors across the EU, from law to banking. The Bank also suggested that trade deals with new partners would be years away, reflecting the fact that ""it typically takes several years for new trade deals to be negotiated and implemented"". Michael Saunders and Jonathan Haskel, two of the Bank's external rate-setters, voted to cut interest rates to 0.5%, from the current rate of 0.75%. They said inflation, which currently stands at 1.7%, suggested that there was little risk that the economy would overheat in the medium term if interest rates were cut. The MPC expects inflation, as measured by the consumer prices index (CPI), to fall to about 1.2% by next spring as the impact of the government's energy price cap kicks in. This is well below the Bank's 2% target. While the unemployment rate remains below 4%, which is its lowest since the 1970s, Mr Saunders and Mr Haskel said they believed recent data suggested the ""labour market was turning"". They also said there was a risk that world growth could be weaker and Brexit uncertainties could persist for longer than the MPC's assumptions. Financial markets believe interest rates will be cut to 0.5% in the coming year, and Mr Carney said the MPC would respond to developments in the economy accordingly. Lower interest rates are good news for borrowers and bad news for savers, as commercial banks use the Bank of England as a reference point for the rates they offer on mortgages and savings accounts. Bank governor Mark Carney is due to stand down from his role on 31 January next year. However, at the Bank's news conference, he opened the door to staying on beyond that date. He said that he had already agreed to extend his term twice, in order to ensure the financial system was prepared for Brexit and also to ensure a proper handover to his successor. Mr Carney said it was understandable that a decision on the new governor had not been made, ""given the priority"" that the Brexit negotiations have taken. He committed to making sure that the transition to the new governor was ""smooth"". Could Bank of England get its first female governor?

Mexico makes mammoth archaeological discovery,"The traps were around two metres deep and 25 metres wide At least 14 woolly mammoth skeletons have been uncovered in Mexico in traps built by humans about 15,000 years ago. The two pits in Tultepec north of Mexico City are the first mammoth traps to be discovered, officials say. Early hunters may have herded the elephant-sized mammals into the traps using torches and branches. The recent discovery of more than 800 mammoth bones could change our understanding of how early humans hunted the enormous animals. Mexico's National Institute of Anthropology and History (INAH) saysmore traps could be uncovered in the area north of Mexico City,external. Last mammoths 'died of thirst' Archaeologists thought early humans only killed mammoths if the animals were trapped or hurt. However, INAH's discovery of the human-built traps could mean such hunts were planned. Diego Prieto HernÃ¡ndez, director of the institute, said the discovery ""represents a watershed, a turning point in what we until now imagined to be the interaction between hunter-gatherers with these huge herbivores"". The two pits are about 1.7m (5ft 6in) deep and 25m in diameter. Excavations at the site have been taking place for 10 months. Some of the bones showed physical signs of being hunted Mammoths are thought to have been the same size as modern day elephants 824 bones have been recovered from the archaeological site The remains were found during excavations for a waste containment site Road workers dig up woolly mammoth bones Ivory DNA reveals mammoth secret Fossilised remains of a mammoth found under Mexican village This video can not be played Exploring a Bronze Age underwater archaeological site Ancient skeleton fetches mammoth price Mammoth tusk 'dates back 12,000 years' LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while officials hit out at looters Biden praises Carter's character as former president's coffin heads to Georgia Henry Zeffman: Market trouble threatens Labour's economic plans The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Murder accused denies 'throwing friend under bus',"Jodie Chesney was killed a few weeks before completing her Gold Duke of Edinburgh Award One of Jodie Chesney's alleged killers has been accused of throwing his business partner ""under the bus"" over the teenager's death. Drug dealer Manuel Petrovic drove Svenson Ong-a-Kwie and two youths to the park where Jodie was fatally stabbed on 1 March. Mr Petrovic denied he was trying to ""rewrite the truth"". He, along with Mr Ong-a-Kwie and two youths, aged 16 and 17, deny murder and are on trial at the Old Bailey. Cross-examining Mr Petrovic, Mr Ong-a-Kwie's lawyer accused him of distancing himself from his co-accused. What happened on day 16 of the Jodie Chesney murder trial? Charles Sherrard QC said: ""What I suggest is that you have, from the minute you were arrested, decided your best tactic is to present yourself as a particular type of person - somebody who is too nice, the older brother type, and wherever possible, distanced yourself from Svenson."" Mr Petrovic replied: ""That's not correct."" Manuel Petrovic (left) described Svenson Ong-a-Kwie (far right) as ""business associates"" Mr Sherrard continued: ""And in distancing yourself you have chosen to rewrite the truth and metaphorically throw him under the bus."" The 20-year-old repeated: ""That's not correct."" Mr Sherrard asserted that it was Mr Petrovic that 19-year-old Mr Ong-a-Kwie turned to when he needed a lift to Harold Hill on the night of 1 March. He turned to him again when he needed fresh clothes and trusted him with a ""drug line"", it was claimed. But Mr Petrovic told jurors: ""It was more business associates than friends but I would not not class him as a friend."" Asked why he picked up Ong-a-Kwie on 1 March, leaving customers waiting, he said: ""It's not out of the blue, he would help me out on occasions so I would try to help him out too.""

Drug dealer guilty of murdering Jodie Chesney,"This video can not be played Detective Inspector Perry Benton explains how the Met Police pieced together evidence to catch Jodie's killers Two teenagers have been found guilty of murdering 17-year-old Jodie Chesney in a park in east London. Jodie was stabbed in the back in a case of mistaken identity as she socialised with friends in Harold Hill on 1 March. Drug dealer Svenson Ong-a-Kwie, 19, and a 17-year-old boy were both convicted of murder following an eight-week trial at the Old Bailey. Manuel Petrovic, 20, of Romford, and a 16-year-old boy were both cleared of murder and manslaughter. Stabbed in the back and left to die As it happened: Jodie Chesney murder trial verdicts The jury spent less than six hours deliberating their verdicts on all four defendants. Judge Wendy Joseph QC said Ong-a-Kwie and the 17-year-old boy, who cannot be named for legal reasons, would be sentenced on 18 November. Svenson Ong-a-Kwie was one of two people to be found guilty of Jodie's murder Following the guilty verdicts, Det Ch Insp Dave Whellams, of Scotland Yard, said the murder of ""girl next door"" Jodie had ""shocked a nation"". He added: ""It could have been anybody's daughter. She was a very nice girl, she had a small circle of friends, she did well at school, worked in the community. ""They have gone there purposefully to stab somebody and they have not cared who they stabbed. They stabbed a 17-year-old girl in the back for no reason."" The 17-year-old was stabbed once in the back while she was socialising with friends in Amy's Park Throughout the trial it was never disputed that Ong-a-Kwie and the teenager were the two people who went into Amy's Park on the night Jodie was stabbed. The pair blamed each other for the stabbing, while Ong-a-Kwie admitted burning his clothes with a cigarette lighter. Jurors heard Jodie had her back to her attackers and the knife almost passed right through her body. After being stabbed the teenager screamed and fell into the arms of her boyfriend Eddie Coyle, the court was told. Frantic efforts were made to save her but she was pronounced dead in a petrol station in Gants Hill about an hour later. Jodie's boyfriend Eddie Coyle described the motion the attacker used to stab her Following the verdict, Peter Chesney said his daughter's murder had ""destroyed my life"". ""I have no idea how I am going to continue with my life or even come to terms with the loss,"" he said. Jodie's sister Lucy wrote in a victim impact statement that she had been ""dreading my life rather than looking forward to it"" following the 17-year-old's death. ""Jodie was not only my sister she was my best friend. Losing her is like losing half of myself."" She added that she was now ""anxious about everything"" as ""if someone as good and pure as Jodie could be murdered, it could happen to anyone and I spend everywhere I go looking over my shoulder because of it"". Witnesses described Amy's Park as being ""very dark"" at the time of the attack Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told the jury Jodie was ""a victim of a brutal act of unprovoked violence"". He described the girl's death as ""another example"" of the ""terrible consequences of the carrying and using of knives"". ""It seems every day now in our city another young life is lost to a knife,"" he said. During his evidence, Mr Petrovic admitted driving the group to Harold Hill but denied any knowledge of what happened in Amy's Park. He told jurors he was ""glad he was arrested because he had nothing to hide"".

"Labour and Tories pledge more borrowingJohn McDonnell sets out investment plans, as the Tories also vow to spend on infrastructure.","This video can not be played John McDonnell: Â£150bn fund for ""human emergency created by Tories"" Labour has promised ""investment on a scale never seen before"" to overhaul infrastructure in all areas of the UK. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says he wants to transfer power and money out of the south-east of England - and will fund his plans through borrowing. The Tories have also vowed to borrow to fund more spending, rewriting their current financial rules. Chancellor Sajid Javid denied copying Labour's plans, saying he would practise ""sensible stewardship"". But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Ed Davey warned that both parties were ""writing promises on cheques that will bounce"". Labour and the Conservatives say they want to take advantage of historically low interest rates to spend more on transport, hospitals and other infrastructure projects. They are locked in a battle for votes in the Midlands and north of England in swing seats that could decide who forms the next government on 12 December. Labour and Tories plan for a post-austerity future Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson stands down Live: Latest on the general election trail Will the Tories' Brexit-heavy campaign work? Bank warns Brexit deal would hit economic growth Both parties are also promising to shift power and control of spending out of London - but they have different ideas about how to do that. Speaking in Liverpool, Mr McDonnell promised to set up a Treasury unit in the north of England to take spending decisions out of Whitehall. The Conservatives have promised to give the north of England more control over its railways, greater powers for some elected mayors and a new economic development body. The campaign speeches over investment come as: Former Labour MPs Ian Austin and John Woodcockcalled on votersto vote for the Conservatives Pro-Remain parties Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Lib Dems agreednot to stand against each otherin dozens of seats Election officershit backat calls from the education secretary for polling stations not to be placed in schools This video can not be played Chancellor Sajid Javid attacks Labour's ""fantasy economics"" At the 2017 general election, Labour announced plans to set up a national transformation fund to overhaul the UK's transport links and infrastructure. This includes a social transformation fund, which Mr McDonnell said would now get an extra Â£100bn, providing a Â£150bn pot to be spent over the next five years. A further Â£250bn of investment will be spent across the country through the Green Transformation Fund. Mr McDonnell said the investment would help a Labour government address a ""climate emergency"", as well as a ""human emergency which has been created by the Tories"". He said his party would introduce new fiscal rules, meaning ""borrowing for investment"" would not be included in borrowing targets. He added the new approach would mean public assets created by infrastructure spending would be ""recognised both as a cost and as a benefit"". Politicians often talk of how many billions they would spend on schools, hospitals, upgrading roads, and so on. A billion is a thousand million (or Â£1,000,000,000 written in full). It used to have a different meaning in the UK. Until the 1970s, it meant a million million, but Prime Minister Harold Wilson adopted the US definition. With Â£1bn, you could pay the average full-time worker's salary nearly 33,000 times. For a government, the cash doesn't go as far. It costs Â£1bn to run the NHS across the UK for just three days, according to the King's Fund. But Mr Javid attacked Labour's investment plans, accusing the party of wanting to ""spray money round like confetti"", and indulging in ""fantasy economics"". He said the ""transformation"" in the economy since the Conservatives took power ""was not the result of some fiscal cycle"", but ""down to solid economic stewardship"". ""By far the biggest fear of business is a Corbyn-led government,"" he added. BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz Both main parties now agree that this era of unusually low interest rates provides an opportunity to borrow to invest. Both will push up the national debt. Both argue that stepping up investment now will make the UK more productive later on. The question, as ever, is how much will they borrow and how much debt they think the UK can support. Labour is adding a cool Â£150bn to its investment plans over five years, a very big sum. John McDonnell believes by spending on schools, hospitals and other infrastructure he would create a virtuous circle, a bigger economy which could afford the debt. Sajid Javid would replace the Tories' self-imposed limits on borrowing with less stringent rules, including the promise that annual investment in projects like road and rail would not exceed 3% of national output. He says the difference between his and Labour's plans is ""like night and day"" but, however they differ, debt looks set to rise. Mr Javid said his plans to increase debt as a share of national income would increase spending by ""an extra Â£20bn a year over a five year period"". He added that ""you could easily add another Â£100bn to that"" but the details would be set out in the Conservative manifesto. And he said ending the uncertainty over Brexit was ""the most important thing the economy needs right now"", and would ""unleash"" more private investment. Conservative leader Boris Johnson said the last nine years of his party's government had resulted in ""solid growth"", ""record low"" unemployment and the cost of borrowing ""at an all-time low"". ""It's thanks to the prudence of the Conservatives that we are able to make some investments in our infrastructure, in technology, in our public services and the reason we can do that is because we understand the vital importance of a strong economy,"" Mr Johnson said. He said the ""biggest threat"" currently facing the UK economy was the ""uncertainty that is still being posed to our political system by the whole Brexit debate"", but his plan was to bring back his deal in December so the UK could leave the EU in January. However, for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Davey said ""any form of Brexit"" would mean ""less tax revenue"" and would make the economy ""weaker"". ""Neither Labour or the Tories can square their spending promises today with the cost of Brexit,"" he said. ""In contrast, every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit, build a brighter future and invest the Â£50bn Remain bonus in our vital public services and tackle inequality."" We have got into something of a bidding war between the two parties. The Tories are talking about extra cash for police, for upgrading hospitals, for what they call an infrastructure revolution. John McDonnell is talking about pouring hundreds of billions for a once-in-a-generation upgrade to the country's infrastructure. They're on the same terrain - they're both talking about the end of austerity. They're both talking about a big increase in government spending, and they're both talking about paying for this by borrowing. The risk for the government is that they might be seen as ""Labour-lite"" - offering something similar, but not as ambitious. What question do you have about the general election?

Jodie's sister Lucy wrote in a victim impact statement that she had been ""dreading my life rather than looking forward to it"" following the 17-year-old's death. ""Jodie was not only my sister she was my best friend. Losing her is like losing half of myself."" She added that she was now ""anxious about everything"" as ""if someone as good and pure as Jodie could be murdered, it could happen to anyone and I spend everywhere I go looking over my shoulder because of it"". Witnesses described Amy's Park as being ""very dark"" at the time of the attack Prosecutor Crispin Aylett QC told the jury Jodie was ""a victim of a brutal act of unprovoked violence"". He described the girl's death as ""another example"" of the ""terrible consequences of the carrying and using of knives"". ""It seems every day now in our city another young life is lost to a knife,"" he said. During his evidence, Mr Petrovic admitted driving the group to Harold Hill but denied any knowledge of what happened in Amy's Park. He told jurors he was ""glad he was arrested because he had nothing to hide"".

Scottish tourist's hand found inside sharkThe 44-year-old man is feared to have been killed in a shark attack after he went snorkelling on holiday.Scotland,"Examiners found the man's hand and wedding ring inside a tiger shark A Scottish tourist is suspected to have died in a shark attack after his severed hand and wedding ring were found inside the animal. The 44-year-old man was last seen snorkelling off the French island of Reunion, near Madagascar, over the weekend. It is believed he was on a week-long holiday with his wife in Saint-Gilles. His hand, identified by his wedding ring, was found inside a tiger shark which was caught for research purposes. Local resident Erick Quelquejeu told BBC Scotland the man had left his wife for just ""a few minutes"" to go for a swim. Mr Quelquejeu told BBC Scotland the beaches have signs warning people against swimming Mr Quelquejeu said: ""It's an area enclosed by a reef, there's a very slight passage where it goes deeper into the ocean but actually it's really well protected by the reef."" He added: ""His wife was really scared by what happened. Many helicopters, many planes, swimmers and boats went to try and find the guy in the ocean but couldn't find him for a few days. ""Apparently they found a shark a few days ago with his hand so we are really not sure how it happened."" Mr Quelquejeu said that many beaches on the west coast of the island were well signposted, warning people against swimming because of previous shark attacks. There were also warnings at the airports. The island has put measures in place to protect people from shark attacks ""There are a lot of shark attacks on Reunion island but we are quite aware about that now,"" he added. ""It's something we don't hide from anybody. All the places around the island where you can't swim - where there's not a natural reef - there are signs in front of the beach to warn people. ""Even at that you have a few boats that go around the west area of the island - because that's where all the beaches are - to protect them, to watch if anyone makes that mistake anyway.""

"Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pact","This video can not be played The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have agreed not to stand against each other. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have formed an electoral pact, agreeing not to stand against each other in dozens of seats. The deal between the three anti-Brexit parties will cover 60 constituencies across England and Wales. Chair of the Unite to Remain group Heidi Allen said it was ""an opportunity to tip the balance of power"". The three parties all support another Brexit referendum and want the UK to remain in the EU. Their pact means that, in Wales, two of the parties will agree not to field a candidate, boosting the third candidate's chances of picking up the Remain vote. In England, it will simply be a two-way agreement between the Lib Dems and the Greens. Lib Dem candidate Layla Moran said the Unite to Remain group had approached Labour about pacts, but ""they said no [and] they didn't even enter into those conversations"". In a speech in Liverpool earlier, Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: ""We will never enter pacts, coalitions, or deals like that - ever."" And the SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""If other parties want to deliver a Remain message in Scotland, they know they have to get behind the SNP."" Thursday marks exactly five weeks until the UK general election on 12 December. What is tactical voting? Labour plans to shift power to the North Students more likely to vote tactically on Brexit Your Questions Answered: Who can stand for election? ""We are delighted that an agreement has been reached,"" said Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""This is a significant moment for all people who want to support Remain candidates across the country."" The pact follows a similar deal earlier this year in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, when Plaid Cymru and the Greens agreed not to put forward a candidate but instead gave way to the Lib Dems' Jane Dodds. Shewent on to defeatthe Conservative incumbent, Chris Davies. Lib Dem MP Jane Dodds (third from left) celebrates her by-election win Analysis by BBC political analyst Peter Barnes It's impossible to know in advance whether this will affect who wins any of the constituencies. None of them would have had a different result in 2017 if Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Green votes had been added together. It's also likely that Brexit will have a bigger influence on how people vote at this election, so the idea of having a united candidate for Remain could give them a boost. There are some seats already held by one of the parties where their majorities will be bolstered, such as Arfon and Bath. And there are other places where it makes it a bit easier to win, such as Cheltenham, Montgomeryshire and Winchester - all places the Lib Dems are gunning for - and Ynys Mon, a target for Plaid. In England, the Greens will stand aside for the Lib Dems in 40 seats including Totnes, York Outer, Winchester and Twickenham. And the Green Party will run unchallenged by the Lib Dems in nine seats including the Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Exeter and Brighton Pavilion - where Caroline Lucas is the Greens' only MP. The pact comes afterPlaid Cymru's leader Adam Price wroteto several pro-Remain parties earlier this year, calling on them to work together in a snap general election. In Wales, the plan will involve the Lib Dems and Greens standing their candidates aside for Plaid Cymru in seven seats including Pontypridd. The deal does not involve the Ceredigion seat - which is currently held by Plaid Cymru but is a top election target for the Lib Dems. However Mike Powell, who had been the Lib Dem candidate in Pontypridd, said he would run as an independent against Plaid Cymru. He told Radio 4's World at One: ""I think the people deserve to have an opportunity to vote for someone who is going to represent the people of Pontypridd, rather than standing to represent a cause to remove Wales from the United Kingdom. ""I know there is an awful lot of members in the Welsh Liberal Democrats who are extremely unhappy with the way these negotiations have been dealt with."" The prospective parliamentary candidates for Pontypridd chosen by their parties so far include Alex Davies-Jones (Labour), Steve Bayliss (the Brexit Party) and Fflur Elin (Plaid Cymru). Read more about the pact in Wales In Northern Ireland the Green Party has said it will not stand candidates in East, West or North Belfast. Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey said she was ""prepared to put the need to have pro-Remain MPs returned ahead of party interest"". Sinn Fein leader Michelle O'Neill welcomed the move, which she said would maximise ""the representation of pro-Remain and progressive candidates facing down DUP Brexiteers across Belfast"". Last week, Brexit Party leader Nigel Faragecalled on Boris Johnsonto form a similar election pact. He wanted the PM to drop his Brexit deal and then agree to stand aside candidates for each other. Mr Johnsonrejected the offerand said he would not enter election pacts.

Fly-tipping incidents rise across England,"This video can not be played Councils say it costs the taxpayer millions of pounds a year to clean up fly-tipping Councils in England dealt with more than one million incidents of fly-tipping last year, official figures show. It was an 8% rise on the 998,000 in 2017-18, with nearly two thirds of incidents made up of household waste. The most common places for the illegal dumping of waste were pavements and roads. The Local Government Association (LGA) said fly-tipping cost taxpayers ""more than Â£57m a year to clear up"". The figures suggest the number of fly-tipping incidents - 1,072,000 in 2018-19 - was the highest for a decade. However, in notes accompanying the statistics the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) said councils had ""changed the way they capture and report fly-tips over the past few years, so the changes over time should be interpreted with some care."" Maz Noakes is part of a group of litter picking volunteers called the Wombles of Willenhall. Ms Noakes said some volunteers in Willenhall spend two to three hours every week cleaning up the area The 69-year-old said the group regularly saw evidence of fly-tipping. The wombles are supported by Walsall Council but Ms Noakes says its enforcement teams, the officials responsible for finding and prosecuting fly-tippers, ""need to do more"". ""Although they claim to be taking action... this isn't noticeable,"" she said. ""Over the years we have given them evidence of perpetrators,"" she added, ""there have been many times we have gone through stinking bags of rubbish and found loads of information, but nothing ever seems to be done."" ""People say that school kids need educating about litter, and although I wholeheartedly agree with this, they are not responsible for the used nappies, carrier bags of human excrement and bags of stinking food waste that we pick up regularly,"" she added. Councillor Garry Perry, from Walsall Council, said the group's work was ""amazing"", but the authority could not always name and shame those reported for fly-tipping. ""This year we have issued 17 fixed penalty notices for fly-tipping,"" Mr Perry said, including 12 Â£400 fines and five Â£150 fines. The council previously said it had spent Â£1.7m over five yearscleaning up fly-tipped waste,external. The official figures show a slight drop in fly-tipping incidents in 2018-19, with 4,265 cases compared with 4,267 the year before. Election voters mistakenly told 'you can't vote' Are these Bonfire Night traditions fizzling out? One million Christmas lights man pulls plug Councils carried out almost half a million enforcement actions in 2018-19, ranging from investigations to issuing fixed penalties and pursuing prosecutions. The number of penalty notices - which can see people charged up to Â£400 - has continued to increase, up 11% to 76,000 last year. In Camden there were 25,765 incidents, more than double the year before and equivalent to 98 incidents for every 1,000 people living in the London borough. A spokeswoman said the rise was due to an app it had launched to make it easier for residents to report illegal dumping. ""Thanks to the increased reporting we have been able to take action on more cases,"" she said. In September, Coventry Council's head of environmental services, Craig Hickin, said twelve new cameras would be set up after locals in the areas worst affected by fly-tipping. He said residents in those places were ""loathe"" to pass on information to the council. ""They fear for their safety and there is a degree of apathy as to what can be done about it,"" Mr Hickin said. Some councils have resorted to setting up CCTV cameras in fly-tipping hot spots, to make it easier to identify those committing offences. In London, Barking and Dagenham Council postsvideo clips of fly-tippers,externalonline on what it calls the ""wall of shame"". A council spokesman said: ""Every episode has led to at least one person being caught and fined."" ""Residents have backed our campaign and we have had examples of a husband reporting his wife and a woman who handed herself in after being spotted by a family friend,"" he added. A fly-tipping offence is committed when a person illegally dumps household, industrial, commercial or other waste without a licence. Fly-tipping is punishable by a fine of up to Â£50,000 or 12 months imprisonment if an offender is convicted in a Magistrates' Court, but sentences can be more severe if dealt with by a Crown Court. However, the LGA said its analysis had found nobody convicted of fly-tipping had received the maximum fine or prison sentence since the new guideline were introduced in 2014. By law councils are responsible for dealing with smaller scale fly-tips on public land, while larger or hazardous incidents are dealt with by the Environment Agency. Landlords are responsible for legally disposing of fly-tipped waste on private land. The Country Land and Business Association (CLA), which represents rural businesses, farmers and landowners, say the local authority figures do not represent the ""true scale"" of fly-tipping, as they do not include figures for waste dumped on private land. Sarah Hendry, from the CLA, said: ""Our members are all too tired of not only cleaning up other people's rubbish but paying for the privilege of doing so."" She said on average it cost about Â£1,000 to clean up fly-tipping for a private landowner, with many businesses suffering ""multiple incidents"". ""This can quickly affect the bottom line dramatically,"" Ms Hendry added. The government said it could not comment on the figures because of purdah restrictions dueto the upcoming UK general election.

Camilla pulls out of event due to illness,"The Duchess of Cornwall visited a farmers' market with her husband, Prince of Wales, on Wednesday afternoon The Duchess of Cornwall has pulled out of a memorial event due to a chest infection, Clarence House has said. The 72-year-old was due to visit the Field of Remembrance in the grounds of Westminster Abbey with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex on Thursday. However, a spokeswoman said that Camilla's doctor told her to cancel her engagements because the infection had ""got progressively worse"" of late. The duchess also missed an event on Wednesday due to the illness. She and the Prince of Wales were pictured on a visit to a farmers' market in west London earlier that day. But the duchess was forced to cancel her scheduled appearance at a gala dinner in London to mark the 200-year anniversary of Prince Albert's birth. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex stood with veterans during a rendition of the Last Post during their visit to Westminster Abbey Members of the Royal Family have been taking part in memorial events ahead of Remembrance Sunday. On Thursday, Camilla, who is patron of the Poppy Factory, had been due to attend the 91st Westminster remembrance alongside Prince Harry and Meghan. It is thought the event would have been her first public outing alongside the couple without her husband, the Prince of Wales. Baby Archie gets first teeth and begins crawling Camilla sends cake to Test Match Special team Duchess thanks MP for letter of 'solidarity' The Duke and Duchess of Sussex paid their respects to servicemen and women who have died in conflicts by planting tiny crosses in the grounds of Westminster Abbey. About 70.000 small crosses have been erected by regiments and military units since the tradition began in 1928. Regiments, military associations and other organisations have laid crosses in the grounds During the visit, Harry spoke with his great-grandmother's former driver Arthur Barty, who was representing his former unit The Black Watch. Mr Barty, who drove the Queen Mother for 27 years until her death in 2002, said: ""I covered almost 100,000 miles with the Queen Mother. ""I never thought for a minute I would meet His Royal Highness or Her Royal Highness but it was an absolute pleasure to chat to them."" On Sunday, the Queen will lead senior royals in paying tribute to those who have lost their lives in armed conflict during the Remembrance Sunday service at the Cenotaph in Whitehall. Last year, the Duke of Edinburgh, 97, did not attend the service, havingretired from his public duties in 2017.

Son who killed his mother was 'controlled by her',"Declan Kevin O'Neill admitted killing his mother A Belfast doctor who killed his mother had been raised by her ""in almost third-world conditions"" and in an atmosphere of ""intimidation and bullying"", a court has heard. Anne O'Neill, 51, was found in the garden of her parents' home at Ardmore Avenue in Finaghy on 21 October, 2017. Her son, Declan Kevin O'Neill, 29, attacked her with a chisel. Headmitted murdering her in court in September. It was a ""brutal killing"" during which neighbours heard her screams for help, prosecutors said. However, relatives asked the court to show ""mercy"" as Mrs O'Neill, a retired nurse, had been a ""controlling personality"" who had driven her son ""beyond his limits"". The judge will rule on the conditions of O'Neill's sentence next Thursday. The court was told how Anne O'Neill's children had grown up with ""relentless emotional violence"" and ""domestic abuse"". They slept on mattresses, in a home which had no bathroom and little furniture - their clothes were kept in cardboard boxes. Anne O'Neill died in October 2017 During the attack, the victim was heard to scream ""leave me alone, Declan"" and ""somebody help me"". She suffered severe head injuries. Her son was arrested at the apartment he shared with his partner a short time later. Police found the shower had been recently used, clothes were in the washing machine and a bag with a rubber mask, tape and metal chisel was lying in a communal area of the building. Traces of Mrs O'Neill's blood and hair was found on the chisel and in O'Neill's car. by Declan Harvey, BBC News NI The litany of abuse Anne O'Neill's children claimed they suffered was both shocking and upsetting in court. As family members watched from the public gallery, Declan O'Neill shook continuously and sobbed in the dock. At one point, Mr Justice Colton reflected that it was difficult to avoid concluding Anne O'Neill herself had a mental illness. Defence lawyers said O'Neill, of Malone Avenue, changed his plea to guilty and ""surrendered his [legal] fight"" in September to spare any further distress to his family. It was argued he would have been able to argue diminished responsibility due to his mental state at the time of the killing. ""His mother controlled his daily life,"" the court was told. The victim's mother said in a statement: ""There are too many examples of the controlled life they had to lead for me to begin to explain."" The victim's daughter revealed in her statement to the court that her mother had on one occasion ""held me by the throat against a wall"" and ""hit me with a brush"". She said the children had a lifetime of their mother calling them names and ""being horrible"" and it had ""a profound effect"". It was ""a very difficult upbringing"", she said. ""I always knew the way she treated us was not normal. ""Our whole childhood and right into our adult lives was destroyed,"" she added. She said both children were ""trapped"" and Anne O'Neill ""constantly blackmailed"" them. Following his arrest, O'Neill told police in an interview: ""I didn't mean to. ""I just couldn't take anymore. ""You don't know what it's like every day - thousands of pounds of debts in my name. ""[She] keeps taking money off me.""

'Terminator' gets 30 years for DR Congo crimes,"Bosco Ntaganda looks on in the courtroom of the ICC ahead of his verdict A former Congolese rebel leader has been sentenced to 30 years for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Bosco Ntaganda, nicknamed ""Terminator"", was convicted on 18 counts including murder, rape, sexual slavery and using child soldiers. Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) found in July that fighters loyal to Ntaganda had carried out gruesome massacres of civilians. The sentence is the longest the ICC has handed down. This story contains details some readers might find disturbing As Ntaganda listened intently, judge Robert Fremr ran through an extensive list of atrocities carried out by Ntaganda's men, including rape and sexually enslavement of young children. Judge Fremr highlighted the case of a 13-year-old rape victim who underwent years of surgery and developed a long-lasting fear that caused her to drop out of school. He told the defendant there were no real mitigating circumstance in his case, but said his crimes, ""despite their gravity and his degree of culpability"", did not merit a life sentence. Ntaganda has already appealed against his conviction. Ntaganda listened while the judge read a list of atrocities Profile: Bosco Ntaganda Ntaganda was the first person to be convicted of sexual slavery by the ICC and overall the fourth person the court has convicted since its creation in 2002. The Rwanda-born 46-year-old former rebel was involved in numerous armed conflicts in both Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.He surrendered at the US embassy in Rwandain 2013. Analysts said it was an act of self-preservation, motivated by the danger he was in after losing a power-struggle within his M23 rebel group. Anna Holligan at the Hague Once famous for his pencil moustache and penchant for cowboy hats, Bosco Ntaganda, in a red tie and dark suit, appeared a picture of calm conformity in court as the harrowing evidence against him was read out. The public gallery was packed - not with friends, family and supporters, but students, journalists and human rights groups keen to witness Ntaganda go down in history as the first person to be convicted by the ICC of sexual crimes. It was something of a victory for the victims, particularly the women, that the court recognised gender violence and acknowledged rape as a weapon of war. Ntaganda was also the first suspect to voluntarily surrender to the court, but judges were not convinced he'd done the honourable thing. They believed he had flip-flopped between sides - fighting for the rebels, then the state army - and that when his luck in Congo was running out he surrendered to the Hague as simply an act of self-preservation. Next is the issue of reparations and how much compensation the ICC should award the survivors, many of whom risked their lives to testify and reveal Ntaganda's true face. Born in 1973 in Rwanda, where he grew up Fled to DR Congo as a teenager after attacks on fellow ethnic Tutsis At 17, he began his fighting days - alternating between being a rebel and a soldier in both Rwanda and DR Congo 2002-3: Militia leader in Congolese region of Ituri 2006: Indicted by the ICC for allegedly recruiting child soldiers in Ituri In charge of troops who carried out 2008 Kiwanji massacre of 150 people 2009: Integrated into Congolese national army and made a general 2012: Defects from the army, sparking a new rebellion which forces 800,000 from their homes 2013: Surrenders to US embassy in Kigali, Rwanda, after splits in his rebel group 2019: Found guilty of war crimes at the ICC and sentenced to 30 years In July, a three-judge bench found Ntaganda guilty on all 18 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the mineral-rich north-eastern region of Ituri between 2002 and 2003. Ntaganda was a ""key leader"" who gave orders to ""target and kill civilians"", Judge Fremr said in the ruling. Prosecutors had said Ntaganda was key in planning and running operations for the Union of Congolese Patriots (UCP) rebels and its military wing, the Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC). The armed group conducted attacks against people perceived not to belong to the Hema ethnic group, the ICC found. In one attack, fighters killed 49 captured people in a banana field behind a village using ""sticks and batons as well as knives and machetes"". ""Men, women and children and babies were found in the field. Some bodies were found naked, some had hands tied up, some had their heads crushed. Several bodies were disembowelled or otherwise mutilated,"" Judge Fremr said. Violence in the region has killed more than 60,000 people since 1999 as militias battle each other for control of scarce mineral resources, rights groups say. Gaius Kowene, BBC News, Kinshasa Many are happy that Ntaganda will finally pay for his atrocities in the east. He went from being in an armed group to becoming an army commander as part of a peace deal. As a result his victims had to watch him go around as the big boss in armoured vehicles, commanding troops and being respected. Some thought that this day would never come, as he had benefitted from the peace process. But in Ituri where these atrocities were committed, a small group of people still see him as a hero. They think that if he had not intervened in the conflict in the east they could have been massacred. The judges ruled that Ntaganda had personally killed a Catholic priest while the fighters he commanded ran rampage in the region. The crimes took place when Ntaganda served as the deputy chief of general staff to UCP leader Thomas Lubanga. In 2012 Lubanga became the first person to be convicted by the ICC and was sentenced to 14 years. This video can not be played The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Bosco Ntaganda, known as ""The Terminator"", in 2006 All of those convicted so far by the ICC are from Africa. A fifth person, Jean-Pierre Bemba, the former vice-president of DR Congo, was initially found guilty of war crimes before being cleared on appeal last year. Ntaganda fought under the command of Rwanda's current president, Paul Kagame, when Mr Kagame was leader of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) fighting to end the 1994 genocide against his ethnic group, the Tutsi. After Rwanda's unrest spilled over into neighbouring DR Congo, Ntaganda flipped between fighting rebellions and serving in national armies - both Rwandan and Congolese. In 2012, he became the founding member of the M23 rebel group after he defected with hundreds of soldiers from the Congolese national army. His fighters later took over DR Congo's eastern city of Goma before agreeing to withdraw. At least 800,000 people reportedly fled their homes. The M23 rebel group was eventually defeated by Congolese government forces in 2013.

Labour and Tories plan for a post-austerity future,"Both major political parties have dropped a key target that would see the national debt falling over time. The move will allow tens or even hundreds of billions more in investment spending on hospitals, schools, housing and public transport. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said Labour would change the way public spending is accounted for, freeing it up to spend. Chancellor Sajid Javid also plans to relax his debt rules and spend more. He said his new rule would allow 3% of GDP in investment on public infrastructure projects - potentially an additional Â£100bn over current plans. Next government 'set to break spending rules' Public spending 'to rocket' in next Parliament This would allow the party to spend more on hospitals, schools, roads, railways and broadband, he said. Mr Javid said he still expected the debt to be lower at the end of the next parliament, but this was not a hard-and-fast stricture. Like Labour, he also channelled some of the same arguments about taking advantage of cheap borrowing. Labour's plan is a major revolution in fiscal targeting, designed to allow hundreds of billions in extra investment spending to grow public sector assets. Mr McDonnell described the new approach as targeting ""public sector net worth"", saying that it was akin to how companies report their balance sheets. It also builds on a new set of figures that the Office for National Statistics has started to report regularly. It means there will be little incentive to use off-balance sheet mechanisms, such as the much-criticised Private Finance Initiative. But it also means a much more generous treatment for Labour's plan to nationalise some privately owned utilities, because the funding required will be offset by the acquisition of the asset - the company. It is radical too. It relies on the continuation of the current very low borrowing rates offered to governments around the world. And while there is an emerging international consensus on taking advantage of these cheap rates to boost growth, at a time when central banks are running out of ammunition, there is a limit. There is a new post-austerity consensus on spending more for the future. The dividing line is whether it is tens of billions required or hundreds of billions. And who voters trust to spend it well.

Johnson says he had 'no choice' over election,"This video can not be played Johnson: 'Come with us to get Brexit done' Boris Johnson has launched the Conservative Party's election campaign, saying his Brexit deal ""delivers everything I campaigned for"". Surrounded by supporters holding signs with messages including ""Get Brexit Done"", he told activists he had ""no choice"" but to hold an election. Parliament is ""paralysed"" and ""blocked"", he said in Birmingham. He said once Brexit was done, a Tory government could get on with ""better education"" and ""better infrastructure"". Earlier, the prime minister met the Queen at Buckingham Palace, marking the official start of the election period in the run-up to the 12 December poll. But Mr Johnson's plans to grab the headlines for his party's campaign launch were blown off course by the resignation of a cabinet minister - an unusual event during an election campaign. Welsh Secretary Alun Cairnshas quit the cabinetafter claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial. It comes after two Conservative candidates were forced to apologise for comments about victims of the Grenfell tragedy. Live: Election campaigning officially begins A really simple guide to the UK general election Do MPs still get paid - and other election questions Opening the party's campaign launch, the Mayor of the West Midlands, Andy Street said the party's success in the area showed ""when Conservatives work together at all levels we can do tremendous things"". Home Secretary Priti Patel followed, telling a crowd of supporters: ""This election is a choice between real change or simply more uncertainty, more dither and more delay."" And Conservative Party chairman James Cleverly said: ""We need to break the Brexit deadlock and get on with delivering on voters priorities - something the last Parliament proved incapable of doing."" Mr Johnson told the audience the deadlock over Brexit had been like a ""bendy bus jack-knifed on a yellow box junction [which] no-one can get round it and it is blocking in every direction"". ""We can't go on like this,"" he added. He said the thing he was ""most proud of"" during his 100 days in office was his Brexit deal. Turning his fire on his election opponents, Mr Johnson accused the Labour Party of ""always running out of other people's money"" and despite making a raft of his own spending promises, the party leader said Labour ""know themselves that their policies for the economy are ruinous"". Instead, he says voters should ""come with us"" and support Tory measures on education, the police and immigration. In contrast, he said a Labour victory would result in another referendum and a second vote on Scottish independence. ""If I come back with a working majority, I will get Parliament working again."" Elsewhere, as the starting pistol is fired on five weeks of official campaigning: The Green Party has launched its campaign witha promise to invest Â£100bna year on climate action for a decade The Liberal Democrats have pledged to spend Â£2.2bn a year on mental health services, funded by a 1% rise to income tax Tory MP Andrew Bridgen has apologised ""unreservedly"" forcomments about the Grenfell Fire Tragedy Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns resignedover claims he knew about a former aide's role in the ""sabotage"" of a rape trial Labour's ruling body have not endorsed Chris Williamson, Stephen Hepburn and Roger Godsiff as candidates for the party ""If it sticks we'll be fine"" - hammer the core message, again and again, and plot a path to victory. That's how one cabinet minister reckons the Tories can win. After the last couple of extremely bumpy days for their party, they are hoping this will be a campaign where surprises are not a regular feature. Instead, they and many of their colleagues reckon the plea for a majority to sort out the Brexit-induced mess of the last few years super fast will find resonance on the doorsteps, saying they are already hearing voters quote back the '""get Brexit done"" slogan. Another cabinet minister says ""it's not Parliament versus the people, it's more positive than the pitchfork, but it feels good on the ground - we are hearing from a lot of people they do reckon it's Parliament that's out of touch"". Events of the last 48 hours have shown already,as I wrote on Tuesday night, that events come crashing into parties' hopes and fears pretty fast and knock them off course. There is another fear among some Conservatives though. The strategy coming out of Tory HQ is crystal clear - end the political agony of Brexit, attract extra Leave voters who are fed up, while hanging on to as many of their existing seats as they can. But, with such a Brexit-heavy message, will they - can they - do both at the same time? Read more from Laura This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""I've been wanting to chew my own tie in frustration"" Parliament was dissolved - or formally shut down - at just after midnight, meaning all MPs revert to being members of the public. Government ministers keep their posts. The PM's audience with the Queen lasted about 20 minutes. While the election has already been approved by MPs, the monarch still needed to sign a royal proclamation confirming the end of the last Parliament. At his own campaign event, Mr Corbyn said he would be a ""very different kind of prime minister"" who ""only seeks power in order to share power"". Could this be a climate change election? Where does Labour stand on Brexit? Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?,external He said Labour is ""well prepared and utterly determined"" to win power to ""transform"" the country and said recent comments by Tory candidates about the Grenfell tragedy were ""shameful"" and suggested his opponents felt there were ""above us all"". He said the election was a once-in-a-generation chance to ""tear down the barriers that are holding people back"" and to ""rebuild"" the NHS, schools and the police force. The Labour leader said his Brexit strategy was to unite people, with a second referendum on a ""sensible set of proposals"" rather than the ""disaster"" of a US trade deal with Donald Trump. Mr Corbynhas previously saida new Scottish independence referendum was not ""desirable or necessary"" - but the SNP's Nicola Sturgeonsaid she believedLabour would give the go-ahead for one if in government.

Police officer charged with murdering footballer,"Dalian Atkinson played for Aston Villa, Ipswich Town and Sheffield Wednesday A police officer has been charged with the murder of retired footballer Dalian Atkinson who died after being tasered. The ex-Aston Villa striker, 48, was restrained by police officers at his father's house in Telford, Shropshire, on 15 August 2016. A second police officer, also from the West Mercia Police force, has been charged with assault causing actual bodily harm. Both were bailed after appearing at Birmingham Crown Court. The Crown Prosecution Services (CPS) has not named the officers because it believes their defence will apply for them to remain anonymous. Judge Simon Drew allowed the officers' identities to remain undisclosed over concerns there may be a threat to their lives, although this will be reviewed at a hearing next week. An alternative charge of an unlawful act manslaughter has also been put forward by the CPS for the officer charged with murder, known as ""Officer A"". The second officer, ""Officer B"", indicated she would plead not guilty and was bailed after an earlier appearance at Birmingham Magistrates' Court. Officer A did not indicate a plea but was also granted bail at a later hearing at the city's crown court. Dalian Atkinson started his career in Ipswich in the 1980s The CPS made the decision to press charges following an investigation by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Mr Atkinson's family has been informed, a spokesperson said, and issued a statement welcoming the decision but they ""regret that already more than three years have passed since Dalian died"". The fast life of Dalian Atkinson Latest news from the West Midlands Police officers attended Meadow Close in Trench, Telford, where Mr Atkinson was detained outside an address at about 01:30 BST. He was taken by ambulance to the Princess Royal Hospital where he later died. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent It's rare for a police officer to be charged with murder following the death of someone they were in contact with on duty. The last time this happened in the UK was five years ago, when Anthony Long, a retired Metropolitan Police firearms officer,was charged with the murder of robbery suspect Azelle Rodney. He was shot dead in north-west London in 2005, but 10 years later Mr Long was acquitted. The exact circumstances of Dalian Atkinson's death haven't been revealed and it is not known whether the Taser contributed to, or caused, his death. However this is believed to be the first time an officer has been charged with murder after a person has been tasered by police. Relatives said the former footballer was suffering from a number of health issues and had a weak heart when the Taser was deployed. Mr Atkinson started his career at Ipswich Town before moving to Sheffield Wednesday, Real Sociedad, Aston Villa and FenerbahÃ§e in Turkey. He is best remembered for scoring the Match of the Day goal of the season in 1992-93 when he dribbled the ball from inside his own half before chipping the Wimbledon keeper from the edge of the penalty area. In a statement, West Mercia Police said: ""Our thoughts continue to remain with the family and friends of Dalian Atkinson at this difficult time."" Chief Constable Anthony Bangham said it would not be appropriate to comment on the circumstances around Mr Atkinson's death, but added he would ensure the officers in question ""have the appropriate support throughout the forthcoming criminal justice process"". The IOPC said it appreciates the ""patience"" shown during their investigation, which concluded in October 2018. Actions of a third police officer, who was also investigated over Mr Atkinson's death, were not referred to the CPS, the watchdog added. Both defendants are next expected to appear in court on 9 December. However, a hearing on Wednesday will decide whether they can be named following an application by the media. Dalian Atkinson's career Dalian Atkinson started his footballing career as an apprentice with Ipswich He signed for Sheffield Wednesday for Â£450,000 in 1989 His sole international appearance was with the England B team in 1990, against Ireland In August 1990 Atkinson moved to Spain, joining Real Sociedad for Â£1.7m Ron Atkinson signed him for a second time in July 1991 - bringing him back to England to play for Aston Villa His strike against Wimbledon was named the goal of the 1992-93 season Atkinson joined Turkish side FenerbahÃ§e in 1995, but failed to settle He later played for Manchester City as well as clubs in Saudi Arabia and South Korea Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, andsign up for local news updates direct to your phone,external.

City traders: We want to work 9 to 4,"City traders have urged UK and European exchanges to cut trading hours to improve work-life balance. They say the long hours are bad for mental health and are not exactly family-friendly. ""It's hard to find childcare at five o'clock in the morning,"" said April Day, head of equities at the Association for Financial Markets in Europe (AFME). The idea is for exchanges to open 09:00 to 16:00, instead of 08:00 to 16:30. The AFME is pushing for the change alongside fellow trader body the Investment Association. Shorter trading hours on equity markets would cut pressure on traders and attract a more diverse range of workers, it said. Millennial men demand better parental leave UK one of 'least family friendly' countries in Europe Stock market trading has traditionally been seen as male-dominated, lagging behind other areas of financial services in terms of attracting women into roles, The AFME's Ms Day said her organisation had been lobbying stock exchanges in London, Paris, Germany and the Nordic region. ""A shorter working day would improve flexibility for employees and attract a more diverse range of individuals on to trading floors,"" she added. The London Stock Exchange said it would launch a consultation on the request. Traders in the UK and elsewhere in Europe normally work for a few hours either side of the current 8.5 trading hours, Ms Day said. By contrast, US exchanges are open for 6.5 hours and Asian exchanges for 6. A knock-on effect of having a smaller intake of women in junior positions means that there are relatively few women in senior management positions in investment and banking trading, Ms Day said. Juggling work and childcare responsibilities can be a challenge for both men and women, she added. Nikki Martin has worked in the City for almost 20 years as a money manager and trader. After having a daughter she said she needed to hire a nanny so she could leave the house at 05:30 to arrive at work on time. Fitting in work and client meetings sometimes means late nights. ""When I have client dinners that I need to attend it pretty much kills me as getting to bed at, say, eleven with a four-thirty alarm is not pleasant, not to mention the fact that I don't see my child as much as I would like to,"" she says. ""It is a long day, it is a stressful job and doing this five days a week leads to burn out,"" she says. Nowadays she works one or two days a week from home. But she says she knows so many women that have left the industry or have moved sideways because ""bringing up a child is just not compatible with the job"". ""Shorter trading hours in my mind would undoubtedly go some way towards rectifying this issue."" Long hours in a high-pressure job can also exacerbate any mental health difficulties traders may be suffering, Ms Day added. Galina Dimitrova, director of capital markets at the Investment Association, concurred: ""We have heard many deeply moving stories of traders' mental health and personal life being impacted by their working hours. ""Whilst it is no silver bullet, we hope this European-wide review could start to lead to a step change in more efficient markets to the benefit of savers and those who operate them."" The London Stock Exchange said it strongly supported improving diversity and workplace culture in the City. It said the call from the trader associations was ""an important suggestion for a European-wide adjustment to trading hours"". ""We intend to consider the request in a formal consultation with London Stock Exchange's global members and customers,"" it added.

The Scottish government wants to hold a new ballot in 2020 and has tabled the Referendums Bill to pave the way. There have been calls for parts of the bill to be amended, in particular over whether the Electoral Commission would test the question for ""indyref2"". Constitution Secretary Mike Russell told MSPs he would discuss the issue of an indyref2 question with the Electoral Commission and introduce an amendment requiring a short bill to instigate the referendum. Adam Tomkins, speaking for the Scottish Tories, insisted his party would oppose any attempt at another independence referendum every step of the way. This was echoed by Labour MSP Alex Rowley who said ""the bill is flawed, vote it down"". Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie backed the bill but called for the indyref2 question to be tested. The Lib Dems reiterated their opposition through Mike Rumbles, who called it ""bad legislation"". Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell highlights the constitution committee came to unanimous agreement about the bill in its report, yet now three parties are denouncing the bill. I have accepted virtually all the recommendations the committee made, he argues. He suggests this is about some parties in the chamber having contempt for the views of Scottish people. The Tory contribution to this debate is ""entirely bogus"", as is the attack on the question Mr Russell states. The cabinet secretary says the majority of people agree the same question should be used. Tory MSP Murdo Fraser Murdo Fraser says the approach of ministers to bring forward a referendum without primary legislation was slammed by witnesses before the constitution committee. Closing for the Tories, Mr Fraser welcomes the cabinet secretary agreeing now that a constitutional referendum would need primary legislation, in his words a ""short bill"". He warns the cabinet secretary's use of the term short bill better not be to avoid scrutiny. The Tory MSP reiterates the point the Electoral Commission wants to retest the independence question, as the context may have changed. He accuses the SNP government of attempting to gerrymander any future referendum. Closing for Labour, Alex Rowley says the bill as it currently stands is not fit for purpose. This alone is reason enough not to support the bill he says, but added to this is that it is being used to instigate another independence referendum. Independence would cause further and even greater chaos than the EU referendum, Mr Rowley argues. He urges the chamber to reject this bill. Allow Twitter content?

Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles says it is the Scottish government's right to waste taxpayers money on this bill but he warns it will pay for it electorally. He suggests ministers have no suggestions, apart from independence, as to what this bill could be used for. Mr Rumbles says he does not expect the SNP or Greens to give up on their pursuit of independence, but he does expect the 2014 result to be respected for longer. ""This is an example of bad legislation and this is an example of what this parliament was not designed to do: to just ram it through regardless."" Mr Harvie says issues around political interference and dark money must be addressed. ""The integrity of our democracy is clearly under threat,"" says the Green MSP, who calls for legislation to tackle this. Digital campaigning is now a core part of elections and deserves the same level of regulation, he adds. Mr Harvie warns against misleading information going viral and becoming unchallengeable. The Electoral Commission would want to assess the wording of the question for a new Scottish independence vote even if it was the same one used in 2014. A Scottish government official has suggestedthis would be unnecessary as the question is already ""tested"". But the election watchdog said it would want to review the question in the light of possible new evidence. The Scottish government said the 2014 vote provided a clear precedent for a simple, straightforward question. Read more. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie says the evidence in favour of setting out a framework for referendums is clear. But he accepts changes do need to be made to this bill. He says no question can be so urgent that primary legislation is not required, nor so important that scrutiny  can be disposed of. Mr Harvie criticises suggestions a future independence referendum could use the terms 'leave' and 'remain', because they are too strongly associated with the question of EU membership. It is overwhelmingly clear any proposal to re-frame independence around leave and remain would be rejected during question testing, he argues, though he agrees question testing should go ahead. Boris Johnson has ruled out granting permission for a second vote on Scottish independence while he is prime minister. Mr Johnson said his government would not give the go-ahead for another legally-binding referendum. Last weekend thousands of independence supporters have heard Nicola Sturgeon call for ""Scotland's future to be put into Scotland's hands"". The first minister told a major rally in Glasgow the time would come to break away from the ""chaos of Westminster"" in a second independence poll next year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said a new Scottish independence referendum was not ""desirable or necessary"". However Mr Corbyn has not ruled out allowing indyref2 if he becomes prime minister. Meanwhile Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie has pledged to stop indyref2 ""dead in its tracks"" even if pro independence parties win a majority in Scotland. And Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie has said there was a mandate to hold indyref2 and refusal to grant one could result in an even bigger majority of pro-independence parties returning to Holyrood in 2021. Alex Rowley goes somewhat off topic as he lists UK-wide pledges from Labour. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh intervenes to say this sounds like Mr Rowley is reading out the Labour manifesto and calls for an end to his electioneering. Rather than trying to rig a referendum the government should bring a halt to this legislation, says Scottish Labour's Brexit spokesperson. ""This bill is flawed; vote it down.""

Mr Rowley says trade with the rest of the UK is worth Â£50bn and a hard border with England would endanger this. This bill is not required at this time after we've gone through years of Tory austerity, the Labour MSP insists. An independent Scotland would be shaped by foreign direct investment, low taxes and austerity according to the Growth Commission he says. Labour MSP Alex Rowley Alex Rowley questions whether there is a need for this bill. The Labour MSP asks if the people of Scotland are demanding more referendums. He says: ""The people of Scotland are sick fed up with constitutional conflict."" ""This bill is only really about one referendum and in fairness the SNP have made no secret of that."" ""This is the SNP indyref2 bill."" Labour cannot support this bill as he believes it would create even more uncertainty and chaos. Turning to the role of the Electoral Commission, the Tory MSP insists referendum questions must be tested but the bill as it stands would allow ministers to bypass the commission. He says expert and independent testing is key to establishing and maintaining confidence. ""The Electoral Commission's full role must be restored,"" Mr Tomkins says. This is a bad bill which paves the way for a second independence referendum the people of Scotland do not want, he insists. Mr Tomkins says it is astonishing that there is a provision in the bill for a referendum to be called by ""a click of his ministerial fingers"". The Tory MSP argues experts call for section one to be removed from the bill with primary legislation being necessary for any future referendum in Scotland. He warns against ruling by diktat and reiterates the call for the provision to be excised. Mr Russell intervenes to argue secondary legislation is not ruling by ""clicking his fingers"". Tory MSP Adam Tomkins says this bill, for the SNP, is not about referendums in general but about indyref2. There is no issue other than independence which the SNP proposes to put to the people of Scotland, he states. Scottish Tory MSPs will oppose any attempt to have another referendum every step of the way and, as such, they will vote against this bill at each and every stage, Mr Tomkins confirms. Mr Tomkins argues if the general principles of this bill are bad it's details are worse and he accuses the Scottish government of attempting to ""rig"" the process. The committee also want changes to strip back the powers of ministers to call referendums and set the conditions for them. The bill as it stands would create a general structure for a contest so ministers can set the date, question and campaign period for any referendum without passing a new bill. The committee recommended this be changed so that new primary legislation was required for any referendum on a constitutional issue. They also said the margin of victory in any poll should be a simple majority. A petition had been lodged with the parliament calling for a two-thirds majority to be required for victory in a new independence ballot, but this was rejected by the committee and has also been dismissed by the Scottish Conservatives.

Celtic fans stabbed by masked men in Rome,"Two Celtic fans were taken to hospital after being stabbed by masked men outside a bar in Rome. The men had been drinking in the Flann O'Brien pub ahead of Thursday's Europa League match against Lazio. Both fans are understood to have been stabbed in the leg but their injuries are not life-threatening. One of the men, aged 52, is still in hospital but the other has been released. Police said an investigation was ongoing. Tensions were high after warnings that Lazio fans wanted revenge fora controversial banner unfurled by Celtic fansat a match in Glasgow last month. This video can not be played Lazio v Celtic: 'We just want the fans to have a celebration' - Neil Lennon The banner showed the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini hanging upside down. Lazio v Celtic, team news & preview 'Lennon has proved a point in Europe' Celtic have good belief for Lazio test - Lennon A statement released by Celtic said: ""Celtic can confirm that two fans have been injured after being stabbed last night. Both will receive every support from the club and the British consulate in Rome. ""Again, we would strongly advise supporters to closely follow all guidance issued by the club."" The club has also issued safety advice,externalto fans ahead of the match. BBC Scotland's sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin, who is in Rome for the game, said local police and Celtic officials were ""well aware"" of the threat of reprisals. He said: ""Lazio are a club that has right-wing leanings and their fans have a reputation for violence. ""There were reports of violence last night around 11 o'clock local time and a police source told me that two men had been taken to hospital. ""Both had been stabbed in the leg and both, I am told, were Celtic fans. Reports this morning suggested that one of the men is a German. ""There were also reports on social media last night that other bars around the city were attacked."" Fans were targeted at the Flann O'Brien pub He added: ""In terms of the Flann O'Brien pub, I'm told that around five or six masked men appeared from a side street and started to attack the Celtic fans randomly, for no apparent reason."" About 10,000 Celtic fans are expected in Rome for the match and an extra 1,000 police officers will be on the streets. Chris McLaughlin told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""They are used to dealing with large European games and large domestic fixtures here in Rome. ""So they were well aware and, to be fair, well prepared for this. But there were warnings from Celtic for fans not to wear their colours when they were out and about on the streets last night. ""The police said to me, we don't have a problem with that. The Celtic fans can come here, they can party, they can drink - we are ready. Of course, when it comes to situations like this, there is only so much the police can do. ""Most fans I spoke to said they would heed the warnings, won't wear Celtic tops at night and will stay within the bars. Most said they were quite happy to be here and the locals had been very welcoming. But what happened in some of the bars last night is clearly worrying."" Celtic fan Keith Allan said violence erupted ""from nowhere"" after a group of Italian men entered the bar. He said: ""The Lazio boys came in the top door and worked their way through the boozer. They were asking all the Scottish boys if they had spare tickets. ""Then they came outside and one of them just stabbed a Scottish boy in the leg. Then it all kicked off and he got battered with a chair."" Celtic fan Keith Allan witnessed the violence Mr Allan, from York, added: ""All the Celtic boys came into the pub and staff pulled all the shutters down. Then the police came and got rid of all the Lazio fans. They were kicking hell out of the doors and windows. ""It was quite scary, but there are a lot of Celtic boys in town. "" In a separate incident elsewhere in Rome, Celtic fans were also targeted at the Baccanale bar. Travelling supporter Sam Houston, from Jordanhill in Glasgow, said about 15 hooded men threw chairs at the pub's locked windows and doors in a bid to get to fans inside. Celtic fans had previously held up a banner showing Italian dictator Benito Mussolini hanging upside down He said: ""We retreated to the back of the bar and the staff put the big metal shutters down and we just had to wait. ""It was horrible. We had heard all the stuff about the warnings that have been put in place. But we thought that if we were in this quiet pub we would be fine. ""We weren't singing, we weren't drawing attention to ourselves - were just having a quiet drink. ""But this group were definitely out looking for Celtic fans."" He added: ""We had no idea what they were carrying or if they had weapons. ""No-one was going to act brave and try and fight back. We were all just staying at the back of the bar and fearing for our lives. ""After about 15 minutes, the bar staff told us it was all clear. We headed out and a group of riot police who were out looking for the gangs escorted us to a taxi rank and we got away safely.""

Nativity play school polling stations row deepensElection officers hit back angrily at call to stop using schools for polling stations.Family & Education,"Election officers have hit back angrily at calls from the education secretary for general election polling stations not to be placed in schools. Gavin Williamson wanted to avoid disruption to school nativity plays and Christmas concerts, which could clash with the 12 December election day. But election officers have written to the education secretary to express their ""extreme disappointment"". They say in many areas there are ""no alternatives"" to using schools. This week Mr Williamson wrote to returning officers telling them that councils would be funded to find alternative venues for polling stations - and not to use schools as places to vote. He said he wanted to make sure that ""long-planned and important events"" in schools at Christmas, such as plays and carol concerts, would not have to be cancelled. Nativity play warning over school polling stations The UK general election of 2019: A really simple guide But the announcement has prompted anger from the Association of Electoral Administrators, which is the professional body representing people who run elections. In a stinging letter to Mr Williamson, they accuse him of a ""complete lack of knowledge and understanding"". ""We question why this letter was sent out so late, after most polling stations have already been booked,"" say the election officers, who warn that arranging a December election at short notice is already challenging enough. They reject Mr Williamson's claim that ""every community"" will have alternative venues for voting, so that schools will not have to be used. ""That is simply not the case. In many parts of the United Kingdom, including towns and cities but especially in rural areas, there are simply no alternatives to the venues designated as polling places,"" says the letter from the association. Chief executive Peter Stanyon says the process of deciding where to locate polling stations has mostly taken place - and the data has been sent to printers for polling cards. He says schools are used as polling stations because they are well-known local venues and are likely to be accessible for people with disabilities - and often there are not any other practical options. The move not to use schools for polling stations had been backed by head teachers' leader Geoff Barton. He said many schools would have Christmas events scheduled - and he questioned whether schools were really ""suitable venues"" for voting, particularly when elections had become more frequent.

"Lufthansa scraps 1,300 flights in 48-hour strike","The union has warned that further strikes could come ""at any time"" Lufthansa has cancelled 1,300 flights after it lost a last-minute legal bid to halt a strike by cabin crew. The two-day action over pay and conditions began at midnight local time. About 180,000 passengers are set to face travel disruption. The UFO union said it would hit all Lufthansa flights from German airports. Flights by Lufthansa's other airlines including Eurowings, Swiss, Austrian Airlines, and Brussels Airlines are not affected, the airline said. Lufthansa has cancelled 700 flights on Thursday and 600 on Friday, amounting to about one-fifth of its planned flights over the 48-hour period. Thousands of passengers are set to face disruption It said it regretted the inconvenience caused, adding: ""We will do everything we can to minimise the impact of this massive strike on our customers."" On Wednesday, a Frankfurt labour court rejected Lufthansa's application to prevent the strike, which is part of a long-running dispute at the airline. Lufthansa has said passengers travelling between German airports can exchange their tickets online for rail tickets. Other passengers will be offered alternative flights.

"West Coast Rail prices could rise, warns watchdog","The UK's competition watchdog has raised concerns train ticket prices could rise under the new operators of the West Coast Rail franchise. FirstGroup and Trenitalia won the contract to run the rail route between London Euston and Glasgow or Edinburgh. The Competition and Markets Authority said that on 21 routes, passengers would have little or no option but to choose a service run by FirstGroup. FirstGroup said there were no competition issues on most routes. The CMA said that following the first phase of an investigation into the new contract, it discovered that on 17 routes between Preston and Scotland passengers could only choose from West Coast Rail, operated by the joint venture between FirstGroup and Trenitalia, or from TransPennine Express, which is operated solely by FirstGroup. It also pointed out that there were four routes between Oxenholme in the Lake District and Carlisle where travellers could only choose between the joint venture, TransPennine Express, and from one other company. ""The CMA is concerned this could lead to higher fares and less availability of cheaper tickets because train passengers would have no alternatives, or limited options, to choose from,"" it said. A spokesman for FirstGroup, said: ""We have been discussing our plans for the new West Coast Partnership franchise with the CMA for several months and we are pleased that on the vast majority of routes, it has found no competition issues. ""Now that this update gives more clarity, we look forward to submitting our proposals which we envisage will satisfy their concerns."" The CMA said that in previous cases, when it had raised competition concerns with rail companies, its concerns were resolved ""by the companies agreeing to price caps on affected lines"". But it said that if FirstGroup and Trenitalia's proposals to guard against higher prices were insufficient, the CMA would launch a more in-depth investigation into the issue. FirstGroup and Trenitalia won the contract to run the West Coast Rail franchise following a controversial process that saw Stagecoach banned from bidding for the contractin a row over pensions.

'Terminator' gets 30 years for DR Congo crimesBosco Ntaganda is the first person convicted of sexual slavery by the International Criminal Court.Africa,"Bosco Ntaganda looks on in the courtroom of the ICC ahead of his verdict A former Congolese rebel leader has been sentenced to 30 years for war crimes and crimes against humanity. Bosco Ntaganda, nicknamed ""Terminator"", was convicted on 18 counts including murder, rape, sexual slavery and using child soldiers. Judges at the International Criminal Court (ICC) found in July that fighters loyal to Ntaganda had carried out gruesome massacres of civilians. The sentence is the longest the ICC has handed down. This story contains details some readers might find disturbing As Ntaganda listened intently, judge Robert Fremr ran through an extensive list of atrocities carried out by Ntaganda's men, including rape and sexually enslavement of young children. Judge Fremr highlighted the case of a 13-year-old rape victim who underwent years of surgery and developed a long-lasting fear that caused her to drop out of school. He told the defendant there were no real mitigating circumstance in his case, but said his crimes, ""despite their gravity and his degree of culpability"", did not merit a life sentence. Ntaganda has already appealed against his conviction. Ntaganda listened while the judge read a list of atrocities Profile: Bosco Ntaganda Ntaganda was the first person to be convicted of sexual slavery by the ICC and overall the fourth person the court has convicted since its creation in 2002. The Rwanda-born 46-year-old former rebel was involved in numerous armed conflicts in both Rwanda and the Democratic Republic of Congo.He surrendered at the US embassy in Rwandain 2013. Analysts said it was an act of self-preservation, motivated by the danger he was in after losing a power-struggle within his M23 rebel group. Anna Holligan at the Hague Once famous for his pencil moustache and penchant for cowboy hats, Bosco Ntaganda, in a red tie and dark suit, appeared a picture of calm conformity in court as the harrowing evidence against him was read out. The public gallery was packed - not with friends, family and supporters, but students, journalists and human rights groups keen to witness Ntaganda go down in history as the first person to be convicted by the ICC of sexual crimes. It was something of a victory for the victims, particularly the women, that the court recognised gender violence and acknowledged rape as a weapon of war. Ntaganda was also the first suspect to voluntarily surrender to the court, but judges were not convinced he'd done the honourable thing. They believed he had flip-flopped between sides - fighting for the rebels, then the state army - and that when his luck in Congo was running out he surrendered to the Hague as simply an act of self-preservation. Next is the issue of reparations and how much compensation the ICC should award the survivors, many of whom risked their lives to testify and reveal Ntaganda's true face. Born in 1973 in Rwanda, where he grew up Fled to DR Congo as a teenager after attacks on fellow ethnic Tutsis At 17, he began his fighting days - alternating between being a rebel and a soldier in both Rwanda and DR Congo 2002-3: Militia leader in Congolese region of Ituri 2006: Indicted by the ICC for allegedly recruiting child soldiers in Ituri In charge of troops who carried out 2008 Kiwanji massacre of 150 people 2009: Integrated into Congolese national army and made a general 2012: Defects from the army, sparking a new rebellion which forces 800,000 from their homes 2013: Surrenders to US embassy in Kigali, Rwanda, after splits in his rebel group 2019: Found guilty of war crimes at the ICC and sentenced to 30 years In July, a three-judge bench found Ntaganda guilty on all 18 counts of war crimes and crimes against humanity committed in the mineral-rich north-eastern region of Ituri between 2002 and 2003. Ntaganda was a ""key leader"" who gave orders to ""target and kill civilians"", Judge Fremr said in the ruling. Prosecutors had said Ntaganda was key in planning and running operations for the Union of Congolese Patriots (UCP) rebels and its military wing, the Patriotic Forces for the Liberation of Congo (FPLC). The armed group conducted attacks against people perceived not to belong to the Hema ethnic group, the ICC found. In one attack, fighters killed 49 captured people in a banana field behind a village using ""sticks and batons as well as knives and machetes"". ""Men, women and children and babies were found in the field. Some bodies were found naked, some had hands tied up, some had their heads crushed. Several bodies were disembowelled or otherwise mutilated,"" Judge Fremr said. Violence in the region has killed more than 60,000 people since 1999 as militias battle each other for control of scarce mineral resources, rights groups say. Gaius Kowene, BBC News, Kinshasa Many are happy that Ntaganda will finally pay for his atrocities in the east. He went from being in an armed group to becoming an army commander as part of a peace deal. As a result his victims had to watch him go around as the big boss in armoured vehicles, commanding troops and being respected. Some thought that this day would never come, as he had benefitted from the peace process. But in Ituri where these atrocities were committed, a small group of people still see him as a hero. They think that if he had not intervened in the conflict in the east they could have been massacred. The judges ruled that Ntaganda had personally killed a Catholic priest while the fighters he commanded ran rampage in the region. The crimes took place when Ntaganda served as the deputy chief of general staff to UCP leader Thomas Lubanga. In 2012 Lubanga became the first person to be convicted by the ICC and was sentenced to 14 years. This video can not be played The ICC issued an arrest warrant for Bosco Ntaganda, known as ""The Terminator"", in 2006 All of those convicted so far by the ICC are from Africa. A fifth person, Jean-Pierre Bemba, the former vice-president of DR Congo, was initially found guilty of war crimes before being cleared on appeal last year. Ntaganda fought under the command of Rwanda's current president, Paul Kagame, when Mr Kagame was leader of the Rwanda Patriotic Front (RPF) fighting to end the 1994 genocide against his ethnic group, the Tutsi. After Rwanda's unrest spilled over into neighbouring DR Congo, Ntaganda flipped between fighting rebellions and serving in national armies - both Rwandan and Congolese. In 2012, he became the founding member of the M23 rebel group after he defected with hundreds of soldiers from the Congolese national army. His fighters later took over DR Congo's eastern city of Goma before agreeing to withdraw. At least 800,000 people reportedly fled their homes. The M23 rebel group was eventually defeated by Congolese government forces in 2013.

The CMA said that following the first phase of an investigation into the new contract, it discovered that on 17 routes between Preston and Scotland passengers could only choose from West Coast Rail, operated by the joint venture between FirstGroup and Trenitalia, or from TransPennine Express, which is operated solely by FirstGroup. It also pointed out that there were four routes between Oxenholme in the Lake District and Carlisle where travellers could only choose between the joint venture, TransPennine Express, and from one other company. ""The CMA is concerned this could lead to higher fares and less availability of cheaper tickets because train passengers would have no alternatives, or limited options, to choose from,"" it said. A spokesman for FirstGroup, said: ""We have been discussing our plans for the new West Coast Partnership franchise with the CMA for several months and we are pleased that on the vast majority of routes, it has found no competition issues. ""Now that this update gives more clarity, we look forward to submitting our proposals which we envisage will satisfy their concerns."" The CMA said that in previous cases, when it had raised competition concerns with rail companies, its concerns were resolved ""by the companies agreeing to price caps on affected lines"". But it said that if FirstGroup and Trenitalia's proposals to guard against higher prices were insufficient, the CMA would launch a more in-depth investigation into the issue. FirstGroup and Trenitalia won the contract to run the West Coast Rail franchise following a controversial process that saw Stagecoach banned from bidding for the contractin a row over pensions.

"Inside Block Six: The prison wing holding 2,000 Taliban"," The prison wing that holds 2,000 Taliban By Auliya Atrafi and Claire Press Warning: This article contains descriptions some readers may find upsetting. Pul-e-Charkhi prison, on the outskirts of Afghanistan's capital Kabul, is surrounded by colossal grey stone walls topped with barbed wire, and guarded by numerous watch towers and huge steel gates. Of the 10,000 inmates, about one fifth areTaliban- Afghanistan's hardline Islamist insurgent group. Taliban inmate Mawlawi Fazel Bari says he wasn't born a fighter, but after five years in prison, he says he’s never felt more ready to die. “I have become so frustrated.  I never thought I would carry out a suicide motor-bomb, but now, by god I swear I will.” For the time being, Bari will remain incarcerated at the top-security jail. But the prison is one of a number across the country that has been releasing Taliban prisoners in unprecedented numbers, as part of a goodwill gesture by a government locked out of peace talks. The Taliban’s long-term aim is to restore the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan - its system of governance while it was in power between 1996 and 2001 - which introduced Sharia, or Islamic law, and a harsh regime, banning women from public life and introducing punishments including stonings and amputations. It is not clear how any future Taliban regime would operate. Hundreds of thousands of people have died in Afghanistan since US-led forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001, including tens of thousands of civilians. The Taliban prisoners were open during our visit about their motivations and grievances, but reluctant to talk about their specific activities. But we do know that Mawlawi Fazel Bari joined the Taliban 15 years ago and became a commander for the group in Helmand province, fighting Afghan and international forces in that region. Bari’s tiny prison cell is packed with Taliban members. There are queues out into the corridor - some men hunkering down in the doorways, others looking down from three-tier-high bunk beds. One elderly inmate sits on the floor, silently chanting over long prayer beads. The floor is a sea of red carpet and cushions, and across all four walls there is a mosaic of posters depicting images of the Islamic holy sites of Mecca and Medina, as well as generic idyllic scenes - bouquets of flowers, waterfalls, even ice cream cones. The cell has been decorated to invoke a vision of paradise, reflecting the inmates’  fundamental belief that if they are killed in action they will go straight to heaven. Next to the walls are improvised shelves piled high with heavy books on Islamic literature and the Koran. Bari begins to preach and all eyes turn to him. He is also a former senior scholar, and as such his fellow inmates hold him in high regard. “I tell you this,” he says, “as long as there is one foreign soldier in Afghanistan, peace is not possible.” The Taliban in Afghanistan were accused of providing a sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda movement - blamed for the co-ordinated terror attacks on the US in September 2001. After 19 years of war between the Taliban and the US-led forces, the conflict in Afghanistan is now the longest in US history. President Donald Trump seemed close to a deal with the Taliban in September. Buthe abruptly called off peace talksafter the militants admitted responsibility for a bomb blast in Kabul that killed 12, including a US soldier. The US says it still has at least 13,000 troops in the country. As part of a draft deal with the Taliban - currently off the table following the break down of talks - it promised to reduce them to 8,600 within the first five months of it being signed. Mr Trump pledged during his 2016 presidential campaign that he would end the US war in Afghanistan. But many critics believe without involving the Afghan government - so far not included in the peace talks - such a withdrawal could leave the country in chaos.

But many critics believe that without involving the Afghan government - so far not included in the peace talks - such a withdrawal could leave the country in chaos. Walking into Block Six feels like entering Taliban territory. The long corridors are full of Taliban inmates moving freely around - shaving, showering, cooking. Bari’s cellmates hail from all walks of Afghan life. They are former teachers, farmers, traders and drivers who have been tried and convicted of also belonging to the Taliban -  found guilty of a variety of roles, from collecting taxes, to patrolling as a foot soldier, to planting bombs. Elders such as Bari co-ordinate the daily prison schedule - leading inmates through hours of worship and Islamic studies. During meal times and the prisoners’ designated hour outside, politics dominates the conversation. Many say that they were initially motivated to join the Taliban out of revenge, often in retaliation against airstrikes. “When the American forces carried out an airstrike over my village [15 years ago] my neighbour and his two wives died, but their youngest, a boy called Rahmatullah, survived,” says Bari. “I adopted the boy and helped him to study. But every time he heard the sound of helicopters overhead, he would run to me screaming: ‘They have come to kill me.’” He says he was motivated to join the war after he saw “too many mosques being destroyed, and women and children killed”. Another Taliban elder in the prison, Mullah Sultan, also says he wanted to stand against the “atrocities” he witnessed. “As an Afghan I saw it as my right to raise my voice and say I don’t accept these invaders,” he says. Over the past decade the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops by the US-led coalition has been offset by an increase in airstrikes, which are frequently inaccurate, incurring substantial civilian losses. In the first half of 2019, the UN says thatmore civilians were killed by Afghan and US-led forces than by Taliban forces. However, insurgent forces including the Taliban have been responsible for most civilian deaths over the past decade, according to the UN. If the Taliban inmates say developments on the battlefield are motivating young men to join the Taliban, they also appear to be fuelling their grievances while in prison. Leaders like Bari are believed to receive sermons from their superiors, and even from Sheikh Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban’s supreme leader, and then pass down their teachings directly to the prisoners. News on the peace talks, when they were going on, was also eagerly shared. “We know the foreigners are tired,” says Mullah Sultan. “We believe they are on their knees and will soon be on their way. We Afghans will live together under the umbrella of Sharia [Islamic law] and an Islamic system.”   Walking into Block Six feels like entering Taliban territory.

And their unity and clear chains of command appear to have given them more influence within the prison. As a result they sometimes represent the entire population of Pul-e-Charkhi to lobby for better conditions. The guards recognise that they present a united front, who, as another Taliban prison elder, Mawlawi Mamur, tells us, “will die for each other’s rights”. The guards say the relationship between themselves and the Taliban prisoners is collaborative. “The sense of co-operation is very strong between us and the Taliban inmate leaders,” says 28-year-old guard Rahmudin, the commander of Block Six. “There are up to 2,000 inmates at any one time, so we need their co-operation and to solve their problems.” But regular strikes by Taliban inmates in Pul-e-Charkhi over their conditions suggest the relationship is not always mutual. The inmates told the BBC that they regularly hold hunger strikes by sewing their lips together or piercing bicycle spokes through their mouths to protest against what they claim to be poor conditions at the prison such as inadequate medical attention, slow legal processing and the mistreatment of prisoners by guards. There are also reports of Taliban prisoners attacking the prison guards, even sometimes taking control of part of the prison. The BBC contacted the Ministry of Interior Affairs to verify these reports but did not receive a response. However every few months it receives photos of the strikes, and calls and messages pleading for help. Earlier this year, clashes between prisoners and guards resulted in the deaths of four inmates and the injury of 33 other people, including 20 police officers. 	Unconfirmed reports said that the inmates had been demonstrating about a lack of health facilities, but a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Affairs told the BBC at the time that the clashes followed a check for drugs and was instigated by drug dealers in the prison. Pul-e-Charkhi prison from above Pul-e-Charkhi prison from above Living for years in such volatile conditions serves to harden the attitudes of these prisoners. And some of them have been, or are due to be, released in unprecedented numbers. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said in June that some 887 Taliban prisoners would be freed from Pul-e-Charkhi and other prisons. It is traditional for the president to announce dozens of prisoner releases to celebrate the Islamic festival of Eid, but this was an unprecedented gesture which critics have interpreted as a show of power by a government excluded from the US-Taliban peace talks. The Taliban refused to hold direct negotiations with the government as they do not recognise its legitimacy. Bari is due to serve his sentence for another two years, although he is adamant that when he is freed he will continue his jihad, or holy war. “When I am released from here I will rejoin my ranks. Before I was 20% [committed], but now I am 100% committed to carrying on my jihad and defending my country.” One of those who has been released under the presidential pardons is his friend and former cellmate Qari Sayed Muhammed, now home in Taliban territory.

Before I was 20% [committed], but now I am 100% committed to carrying on my jihad and defending my country.” One of those who has been released under the presidential pardons is his friend and former cellmate Qari Sayed Muhammed, now home in Taliban territory. Qari Sayed Muhammed, 32, lives in Balkh province, northern Afghanistan - deep in Taliban territory. He spent six years in Pul-e-Charkhi prison. As the only remaining male in his family - his father and two brothers were killed while he was in jail - he says for now he must stay at home to run the family farm. He believes that of those prisoners recently freed, he is one of only a handful who are still alive. “I believe 95% of those recently released have rejoined the Taliban and a lot of them have already died,” he says. While his former fellow inmate Bari was motivated by revenge, Muhammed says he joined the Taliban - at 18 years old, along with 15 of his friends - as a way of escaping police harassment. “Harassment is a part of village life. Often, if someone told the police lies about us, they would harass us. So we thought if they are going to arrest us anyway, we might as well take our fate into our own hands.” Violence and corruption within Afghan police forces has beenacknowledged as a widespread problem across the countryby several human rights organisations. There are, however, a multitude of reasons why a young Afghan man might join the Taliban - a reaction to indiscriminate shooting and shelling; unemployment; a desire for war booty such as weapons, vehicles and ammunition which they can later sell; and even peer pressure. One of Muhammed’s first jobs for the Taliban was collecting its mandatory taxes. Riding out on motorbikes in a unit of six men or fewer, he would demand money from every opium farm - legal in Taliban territory - from across four districts. As a foot soldier, Muhammed says there was no official salary, but all his expenses were covered, from ammunition and fuel to mobile credit. He says it was some three years later - with the war intensifying across the country - that his motivation shifted, and he embraced the Taliban’s jihad or holy war against all foreign troops. “I was 21 when I slung a gun over my shoulder. I remember thinking I was entering into a battle against the infidels, for the defence of Muslims. This thought has stayed with me and will until the end.” Following the ideology of a jihadi, he says whenever he feared for his life he would try to counter concerns for his family with the thought that he would be fulfilling his religious duty if he were to be killed. He describes a mission during which his unit was ambushed in a village on flat ground, and he was being fired on with a Russian machine gun. “It’s during these moments that your brain starts working really fast. You begin thinking: 'What will happen to my household? My children? My wife?' That's when the devil tries to distract you, tempt you into thinking about your family. But I tried to focus all my attention on the fact that I was serving Allah.” Muhammed was captured by the Afghan intelligence services in 2013 and sent to Pul-e-Charki. He believes, of the 15 young men with whom he first left his village to join the Taliban, only two are still alive.

Only 20%-30% of the country is controlled by the government, and the Taliban now control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any point since 2001, according to research by the   Foundation for Defense of Democracies'  Long War Journal in October. Opportunities for young men are slim, and many feel the obvious choice is to join the fighting. But often where they are born can determine who they fight for. When Nematullah was 24 years old and living in Kunar Province, eastern Afghanistan, he decided to devote his life to the Afghan National Army. His story reflects the potential for bureaucratic chaos in a nation in turmoil. Nematullah on his farm Nematullah on his farm After three years of travelling and fighting all over Afghanistan, Nematullah and his unit were sent to guard an isolated outpost in the mountainous region of Chinartu, Uruzgan province. Small cells of Taliban would frequently attack the outpost, and Nematullah and his fellow soldiers got used to the routine of exchanging a few rounds until their adversaries were driven back. But one night, the Taliban attacked in huge numbers. Nematullah’s unit was overwhelmed. “The fighting went on forever and as dawn broke we ran out of ammo,” he says. “They handcuffed and blindfolded us. Then beat us with the end of their guns. They called us infidels, slaves of the non-Muslims. “As they led us away, I was counting every step towards death.” Only days later, Nematullah’s family was contacted by the Afghan Ministry of Defence to tell them their son had been killed and they were to come and collect their son’s body from the morgue. Within hours of receiving the closed coffin, the family held a funeral for their lost son. They were told the casket had been sealed shut because his body was unrecognisable. For 18 months, his family, including his new fiancé, continued to make daily visits to his grave, bringing fresh flowers and offering their prayers.

For 18 months, his family, including his new fiancé, continued to make daily visits to his grave, bringing fresh flowers and offering their prayers.   Back in Uruzgan, Nematullah had been taken deep into the mountains, to a huge winding network of caves. Along with 54 other captives, he was made to dig his own cell from out of the rock face. For a year and a half, he shared his self-built cell with 11 other men, all Afghan army and police recruits. Their hands and feet were chained for almost 24 hours a day. Nematullah remembers the Taliban giving them so little bread, the monotony of captivity was almost as bad as the hunger. Until finally, one evening around midnight, Nematullah and his cell mates were awoken by the deafening sound of explosions all around them. They were positioned directly beneath an airstrike, and the destruction it created allowed them to break free. The first thing he did was to ring his father. “‘It's me, Nemat,’ I said. To which my father replied, ‘Which Nemat?’ ‘Your son,’ I said. But he still didn't believe me.’” Only several selfies later, did his father finally believe that his son was alive. Arriving home to Kunar on the first day of Ramadan, word had already spread of his return. A party was under way, but before rejoining his family, Nematullah had one important visit to make - to the graveyard to offer a prayer for his fellow fallen soldier. Since his return, Nematullah and recently married wife have not stopped their daily visits to the grave of the unidentified soldier. They say he is now their brother and their responsibility. Such cases of mistaken identity are not unique - the BBC has learned of several such incidents, of kidnapped Afghan soldiers returning home to find their family have buried the wrong body after being given a sealed coffin by the government. The Afghan government has declined to comment. Despite the trauma of being held captive, Nematullah says he must return to the battlefield and continue to serve his country.

Since his return, Nematullah and recently married wife have not stopped their daily visits to the grave of the unidentified soldier. They say he is now their brother and their responsibility. Such cases of mistaken identity are not unique - the BBC has learned of several such incidents, of kidnapped Afghan soldiers returning home to find their family have buried the wrong body after being given a sealed coffin by the government. The Afghan government has declined to comment. Despite the trauma of being held captive, Nematullah says he must return to the battlefield and continue to serve his country. Decades of war have left many ordinary civilians feeling paralysed, and those wielding the least power and facing the most insecurity are women and children. For those women living in major government-controlled cities, life has changed dramatically since the days of Taliban rule. With the formation of an elected government, and Afghan and allied forces creating a relative level of security, more girls have gone to school, and more women have gone to work. Under Taliban rule,girls’ access to education was almost zero. Since thenliteracy has climbed to 37% of adolescent girls, although this is still one of the lowest rates in the world. However, for those living in the Taliban-controlled areas, women’s freedom to access education and work remains limited, and many fear if the group were to gain more power, their freedoms would be further curtailed. Sola (C) with her mother Nargis (R) Sola (C) with her mother Nargis (R) “Women will lose out of course,” says Nargis, a 30-year-old teacher and mother of six who lives in the north of Kabul. “They won’t be allowed to be educated, or go to work -  we will lose the most.” The Taliban have stated thatthey are now committed to women’s rights,but many critics are sceptical about how far the Taliban have transformed themselves. Nargis is one of them. “I doubt that the Taliban have changed. Because as they talk peace, explosions continue, killing our Muslim brothers and mothers. What change is that?” Nargis says the arrival of the Taliban and the subsequent unrest is the reason she missed out on an education. “I was in class four of school when the Taliban came. Fighting began and schools were closed down. Girls weren’t allowed to leave their house. I was only nine or 10 when I took to the scarf [was forced to wear the hijab] and sat at home, never leaving it out of fear. We then migrated to Pakistan - school was left behind.  After returning home, now I realise I’m missing a lot.” She is adamant that her youngest daughter, eight-year-old Sola who is currently in school, will not suffer the same fate. What Sola has already been educated in is the violence of war - she recently witnessed the horror of a Taliban suicide bomber. “I saw a bomb go off. I saw young people die,” she says. “I was really scared, I was crying; my mum held on to me, put me in a taxi and brought us home.” As the daily violence continues unabated across Afghanistan, peace talks seem to be the country’s only hope for change. However, getting first the US and Taliban around the table, and then including the Afghan government in the talks, seems a tough order. The Afghan government say they will only meet the Taliban if a month-long ceasefire is agreed by all sides. In response the Taliban have said they will only sit down with the government after the full withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country. So it is perhaps unsurprising that civilians like Nargis are sceptical of any lasting change in the country. “I don't think peace will come. Afghanistan has become a cloth which everyone pulls in a different direction. It’s difficult to distinguish who is a friend and who is a foe,” she says. “Whether it's the Americans, the Taliban or the government that takes over - our demand is just peace.” Some names have been changed.

LiveLiveFirst minister's questions1 minute ago,"MSPs back the Referendums (Scotland) Bill which lays the groundwork for a new Scottish independence referendum Nicola Sturgeon is quizzed at FMQs with the general election campaign fully underway Jackson Carlaw and the first minister clash over subject choices Richard Leonard raises the childrenâs ward at St Johnâs Hospital; the FM insisted safety is paramount Willie Rennie says Raigmore Hospital is nearly full up while FM highlights record NHS staffing and funding Louise Wilson and Craig Hutchison MSPs vote to back the general principles of theReferendums (Scotland) Bill,external, with 65 MSPs backing it and 55 against. The Scottish government wants to hold a new ballot in 2020 and has tabled the Referendums Bill to pave the way. There have been calls for parts of the bill to be amended, in particular over whether the Electoral Commission would test the question for ""indyref2"". Constitution Secretary Mike Russell told MSPs he would discuss the issue of an indyref2 question with the Electoral Commission and introduce an amendment requiring a short bill to instigate the referendum. Adam Tomkins, speaking for the Scottish Tories, insisted his party would oppose any attempt at another independence referendum every step of the way. This was echoed by Labour MSP Alex Rowley who said ""the bill is flawed, vote it down"". Scottish Green Party co-convener Patrick Harvie backed the bill but called for the indyref2 question to be tested. The Lib Dems reiterated their opposition through Mike Rumbles, who called it ""bad legislation"". Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell highlights the constitution committee came to unanimous agreement about the bill in its report, yet now three parties are denouncing the bill. I have accepted virtually all the recommendations the committee made, he argues. He suggests this is about some parties in the chamber having contempt for the views of Scottish people. The Tory contribution to this debate is ""entirely bogus"", as is the attack on the question Mr Russell states. The cabinet secretary says the majority of people agree the same question should be used. Tory MSP Murdo Fraser Murdo Fraser says the approach of ministers to bring forward a referendum without primary legislation was slammed by witnesses before the constitution committee. Closing for the Tories, Mr Fraser welcomes the cabinet secretary agreeing now that a constitutional referendum would need primary legislation, in his words a ""short bill"". He warns the cabinet secretary's use of the term short bill better not be to avoid scrutiny. The Tory MSP reiterates the point the Electoral Commission wants to retest the independence question, as the context may have changed. He accuses the SNP government of attempting to gerrymander any future referendum. Closing for Labour, Alex Rowley says the bill as it currently stands is not fit for purpose. This alone is reason enough not to support the bill he says, but added to this is that it is being used to instigate another independence referendum. Independence would cause further and even greater chaos than the EU referendum, Mr Rowley argues. He urges the chamber to reject this bill. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Rumbles says the message from the Scottish government is clear they don't want the Electoral Commission to mess with their independence question. Mr Russell intervenes to says he has accepted the recommendations of the constitution committee. The Lib Dem MSP hits back arguing the Brexit secretary only said he would come to an agreement with the commission, not that it was right. He accuses the government of proceeding ""with this fraud of a bill"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles says it is the Scottish government's right to waste taxpayers money on this bill but he warns it will pay for it electorally. He suggests ministers have no suggestions, apart from independence, as to what this bill could be used for. Mr Rumbles says he does not expect the SNP or Greens to give up on their pursuit of independence, but he does expect the 2014 result to be respected for longer. ""This is an example of bad legislation and this is an example of what this parliament was not designed to do: to just ram it through regardless."" Mr Harvie says issues around political interference and dark money must be addressed. ""The integrity of our democracy is clearly under threat,"" says the Green MSP, who calls for legislation to tackle this. Digital campaigning is now a core part of elections and deserves the same level of regulation, he adds. Mr Harvie warns against misleading information going viral and becoming unchallengeable. The Electoral Commission would want to assess the wording of the question for a new Scottish independence vote even if it was the same one used in 2014. A Scottish government official has suggestedthis would be unnecessary as the question is already ""tested"". But the election watchdog said it would want to review the question in the light of possible new evidence. The Scottish government said the 2014 vote provided a clear precedent for a simple, straightforward question. Read more. Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie says the evidence in favour of setting out a framework for referendums is clear. But he accepts changes do need to be made to this bill. He says no question can be so urgent that primary legislation is not required, nor so important that scrutiny  can be disposed of. Mr Harvie criticises suggestions a future independence referendum could use the terms 'leave' and 'remain', because they are too strongly associated with the question of EU membership. It is overwhelmingly clear any proposal to re-frame independence around leave and remain would be rejected during question testing, he argues, though he agrees question testing should go ahead. Boris Johnson has ruled out granting permission for a second vote on Scottish independence while he is prime minister. Mr Johnson said his government would not give the go-ahead for another legally-binding referendum. Last weekend thousands of independence supporters have heard Nicola Sturgeon call for ""Scotland's future to be put into Scotland's hands"". The first minister told a major rally in Glasgow the time would come to break away from the ""chaos of Westminster"" in a second independence poll next year. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said a new Scottish independence referendum was not ""desirable or necessary"". However Mr Corbyn has not ruled out allowing indyref2 if he becomes prime minister. Meanwhile Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie has pledged to stop indyref2 ""dead in its tracks"" even if pro independence parties win a majority in Scotland. And Scottish Greens co-leader Patrick Harvie has said there was a mandate to hold indyref2 and refusal to grant one could result in an even bigger majority of pro-independence parties returning to Holyrood in 2021. Alex Rowley goes somewhat off topic as he lists UK-wide pledges from Labour. Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh intervenes to say this sounds like Mr Rowley is reading out the Labour manifesto and calls for an end to his electioneering. Rather than trying to rig a referendum the government should bring a halt to this legislation, says Scottish Labour's Brexit spokesperson. ""This bill is flawed; vote it down.""

Mr Rowley says trade with the rest of the UK is worth Â£50bn and a hard border with England would endanger this. This bill is not required at this time after we've gone through years of Tory austerity, the Labour MSP insists. An independent Scotland would be shaped by foreign direct investment, low taxes and austerity according to the Growth Commission he says. Labour MSP Alex Rowley Alex Rowley questions whether there is a need for this bill. The Labour MSP asks if the people of Scotland are demanding more referendums. He says: ""The people of Scotland are sick fed up with constitutional conflict."" ""This bill is only really about one referendum and in fairness the SNP have made no secret of that."" ""This is the SNP indyref2 bill."" Labour cannot support this bill as he believes it would create even more uncertainty and chaos. Turning to the role of the Electoral Commission, the Tory MSP insists referendum questions must be tested but the bill as it stands would allow ministers to bypass the commission. He says expert and independent testing is key to establishing and maintaining confidence. ""The Electoral Commission's full role must be restored,"" Mr Tomkins says. This is a bad bill which paves the way for a second independence referendum the people of Scotland do not want, he insists. Mr Tomkins says it is astonishing that there is a provision in the bill for a referendum to be called by ""a click of his ministerial fingers"". The Tory MSP argues experts call for section one to be removed from the bill with primary legislation being necessary for any future referendum in Scotland. He warns against ruling by diktat and reiterates the call for the provision to be excised. Mr Russell intervenes to argue secondary legislation is not ruling by ""clicking his fingers"". Tory MSP Adam Tomkins says this bill, for the SNP, is not about referendums in general but about indyref2. There is no issue other than independence which the SNP proposes to put to the people of Scotland, he states. Scottish Tory MSPs will oppose any attempt to have another referendum every step of the way and, as such, they will vote against this bill at each and every stage, Mr Tomkins confirms. Mr Tomkins argues if the general principles of this bill are bad it's details are worse and he accuses the Scottish government of attempting to ""rig"" the process. The committee also want changes to strip back the powers of ministers to call referendums and set the conditions for them. The bill as it stands would create a general structure for a contest so ministers can set the date, question and campaign period for any referendum without passing a new bill. The committee recommended this be changed so that new primary legislation was required for any referendum on a constitutional issue. They also said the margin of victory in any poll should be a simple majority. A petition had been lodged with the parliament calling for a two-thirds majority to be required for victory in a new independence ballot, but this was rejected by the committee and has also been dismissed by the Scottish Conservatives.

UK TV's streaming service BritBox goes live,"Downton Abbey is among the programmes available at launch BritBox, a streaming service offering shows from ITV, the BBC, Channel 4 and Channel 5, has launched in the UK. Downton Abbey, Gavin & Stacey, Wolf Hall, Love Island and Broadchurch are among the shows available. C4 and C5 have come on board after ITV and the BBC announced BritBox as a way to get into the paid streaming market. The service will cost Â£5.99 per month and will mostly feature classic series, but will also include new shows, beginning with Lambs of God. The drama stars The Handmaid's Tale's Ann Dowd, The End of the F****** World's Jessica Barden and Essie Davis from The White Princess as nuns living on a remote island. It was originally shown on Australian TV in July. Jessica Barden, Essie Davis and Ann Dowd star in Lambs of God Reemah Sakaan, ITV's group director for streaming, said there was a ""whole slate of original programmes"" in development for BritBox. While the service would be a second or third subscription for many viewers, it will be able to rival the likes of Netflix, Amazon Prime and Apple TV+, she said. ""It's got the widest range of UK box sets of any service,"" she said. ""Ostensibly the other streamers are US-focused so they make dramas for the US market, whereas BritBox is the faces, people and places that you know."" Some archive programmes that have been on services like Netflix will now move to BritBox, she said. ""For some time we've been bringing our shows back home and now that we've got a destination in BritBox, that's something we'll be doing more actively. We'll still be working in partnership with Netflix and Amazon and all of the other streamers."" Clockwise from top left: Gavin & Stacey, Love Island, Victoria and Happy Valley are on BritBox BritBox - Â£5.99 per month for HD and multi-screen viewing Netflix - Â£5.99 for basic package rising to Â£8.99 for a standard plan, including HD on two screens Amazon Prime - Â£5.99 on up to three screens simultaneously Now TV - Â£8.99 for entertainment pass, with optional extras - Cinema Pass (Â£11.99), Sports (Â£33.99), Kids (Â£3.99) YouTube Premium - Â£11.99 Dramas on the service at launch include Cracker, Prime Suspect, Brideshead Revisited and Ashes to Ashes; while comedies include Absolutely Fabulous, Extras, Blackadder and Fawlty Towers. More than 600 classic episodes of Doctor Who - broadcast between 1963 and 1989 - will be available to stream for the first time by Christmas. Shows and movies from Channel 4 and Film4's back catalogue will be available in 2020, and original shows from Comedy Central UK will also feature. Sakaan said having a big catalogue of classic shows ""shouldn't be underestimated"" by those assessing BritBox's chances of success. ""The new battleground, quite often in streaming, are shows like Friends, which are 20 years old and are the top performers,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. By Amol Rajan, BBC media editor Coming over a decade aftera similar idea was first mooted,external, BritBox is entering a much more crowded marketplace. What we don't know is how good the product will be, in terms of the quality and uniqueness of the content, and the user experience. And we also don't know just how big the market for subscription-based video-on-demand services around the world is. Several big American companies, including Disney, are launching new services, betting that this market is still immature. BritBox is launching with a similar hope. The obvious criticism - that it contains a lot of repeats - means the user experience and a high quality of curation will be vital. The broadcasters have been in negotiations for years, because they have very different needs and interests. The BBC wouldn't want to damage iPlayer too much. ITV, Channel 4 and Channel 5 need to keep their advertisers on side. That they have all reached agreement despite these different priorities shows they feel they simply have to make a big, joint play in the streaming market. What a pity, though, that regulators didn't have the foresight to see that a decade ago. Seinfeld and Big Bang Theory deals prove old is gold in streaming wars Traditional TV holding off streaming, Ofcom says Streaming TV: 'Not everyone will survive' Some of the biggest hits of recent years, such as Killing Eve, Peaky Blinders and Bodyguard, will not be on BritBox at first. This is either because existing deals are in place with other streaming services, or because they are still on the broadcasters' own catch-up platforms. Shows are not expected to appear on BritBox until they have dropped off the BBC iPlayer, ITV Hub and All 4, which do not require paid subscriptions. The BBCwas recently given permissionto keep programmes on iPlayer for one year. TV critic Scott Bryan said the idea of rival channels teaming up to try to compete with the likes of Netflix was ""quite big news"". ""The issue is whether people are willing to pay towards them,"" he continued. ""And it will be interesting to see which shows end up being on which service. ""Some shows might be a co-production between the BBC and Netflix for example, and that might end up on Netflix. ""So for many of us there's going to be a lot of confusion trying to work out which show is going to be on which platform."" On social media, some users questioned why they were being asked to shell out to watch programmes they had effectively already paid for. Allow Twitter content?

Responding to that point in July, BBC director generalLord Hall compared BritBox with releasing a programme on DVD. ""That was the BBC saying, there's a secondary market - you pay for content after we've shown it,"" he said. ""This is just a modern-day version of that, and an even better version of that, because it used to be infuriating when you'd seen a programme on the BBC and you couldn't get hold of the DVD."" Any money the corporation makes will be put back in to programme-making, he said. ""I think this is wins all round for the licence fee payers.""

It shows Miss Millane leaving the Base Backpackers hostel and walking to the Sky City entertainment complex, where she met and embraced the 27-year-old defendant, who cannot be be named for legal reasons. CCTV footage shows Grace Millane The trial earlier heard howthe man accused of Miss Millane's murder went on a further Tinder date while her body was in a suitcase in his hotel room. The suspectdenies murder. Grace Millane's parents are attending the trial in Auckland Miss Millane, was last seen in Auckland on 1 December, before her body was found a week later. 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Referring to the messages she sent during the date, a letter by her university friend Ameena Ashcroft was read to the jury. In it, she said Miss Millane told her she was ""getting smashed"" and the date was going ""really good"". The prosecution believes the suspect was not concerned or distressed by the death In the hours before she disappeared Miss Millane and the defendant were seen at a burger bar in the Sky City development, before going to a Mexican cafe and then the Bluestone Room in Durham Lane. In the hours before she disappeared Miss Millane and the defendant were seen in the Sky City Development Footage shows they spent just over an hour at the venue, during which time the defendant leaned across and kissed Miss Millane lightly, before then putting his hand on the back of her head and kissing her in a more sustained manner. They continued kissing and talking for a while, before leaving and walking arm-in-arm down the street and into the lobby of CityLife at 21:40. They entered the lifts and Miss Millane followed the accused out of the lift to his apartment on the third floor of the hotel. Prosecutors allege she was strangled to death in the apartment. On the face of it  this was, as the lead prosecutor put it , ""the sort of evening many a young person travelling the world would enjoy"". Meeting someone, touring bars, drinking and chatting. There were lots of smiles from Grace Millane on the CCTV footage played to the court room . A text message exchange with a friend in one of those bars read out in court was an emoji-packed carefree stream of consciousness from a young woman having a good time. But knowing what happened next meant watching those shots of Grace was chilling. I'm told the Millane family had already been taken through the CCTV by police. Later there were images of a different sort. Seen only by the jurors - intimate pictures of Grace Millane that the killer took on his phone after Grace had died. Her mother Gillian sobbed as a police detective in the witness box was asked about the pictures - until it became too much and she hurried out - unable to bear hearing any more. The defence team argues Ms Millane died by accident during consensual sex, saying ""acts designed to enhance sexual pleasure went wrong"". The court has been told he buried her later in a suitcase in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland. This video can not be played Members of Grace Millane's family carried her coffin Miss Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family. The young woman had been on a round-the-world trip, travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following six weeks in South America. The trial is expected to last one month.

CCTV footage shows Grace Millane The trial earlier heard howthe man accused of Miss Millane's murder went on a further Tinder date while her body was in a suitcase in his hotel room. The suspectdenies murder. Grace Millane's parents are attending the trial in Auckland Miss Millane, was last seen in Auckland on 1 December, before her body was found a week later. 'Solo backpacking didn't kill Grace' Referring to the messages she sent during the date, a letter by her university friend Ameena Ashcroft was read to the jury. In it, she said Miss Millane told her she was ""getting smashed"" and the date was going ""really good"". The prosecution believes the suspect was not concerned or distressed by the death In the hours before she disappeared Miss Millane and the defendant were seen at a burger bar in the Sky City development, before going to a Mexican cafe and then the Bluestone Room in Durham Lane. In the hours before she disappeared Miss Millane and the defendant were seen in the Sky City Development Footage shows they spent just over an hour at the venue, during which time the defendant leaned across and kissed Miss Millane lightly, before then putting his hand on the back of her head and kissing her in a more sustained manner. They continued kissing and talking for a while, before leaving and walking arm-in-arm down the street and into the lobby of CityLife at 21:40. They entered the lifts and Miss Millane followed the accused out of the lift to his apartment on the third floor of the hotel. Prosecutors allege she was strangled to death in the apartment. On the face of it  this was, as the lead prosecutor put it , ""the sort of evening many a young person travelling the world would enjoy"". Meeting someone, touring bars, drinking and chatting. There were lots of smiles from Grace Millane on the CCTV footage played to the court room . A text message exchange with a friend in one of those bars read out in court was an emoji-packed carefree stream of consciousness from a young woman having a good time. But knowing what happened next meant watching those shots of Grace was chilling. I'm told the Millane family had already been taken through the CCTV by police. Later there were images of a different sort. Seen only by the jurors - intimate pictures of Grace Millane that the killer took on his phone after Grace had died. Her mother Gillian sobbed as a police detective in the witness box was asked about the pictures - until it became too much and she hurried out - unable to bear hearing any more. The defence team argues Ms Millane died by accident during consensual sex, saying ""acts designed to enhance sexual pleasure went wrong"". The court has been told he buried her later in a suitcase in the Waitakere Ranges, near Auckland. This video can not be played Members of Grace Millane's family carried her coffin Miss Millane's death prompted an outpouring of public grief in New Zealand with the country's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern apologising to her family. The young woman had been on a round-the-world trip, travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks, following six weeks in South America. The trial is expected to last one month.

"Labour voters should back Johnson - ex Labour MPFormer Labour minister Ian Austin said Jeremy Corbyn is ""completely unfit"" to lead the country.Election 2019","This video can not be played Former Labour MP Ian Austin tells the BBC's Today programme that Jeremy Corbyn is ""completely unfit to lead our country"" Labour voters should support Boris Johnson in the general election, former Labour MP Ian Austin has said. The former minister resigned from the party in February, accusing leader Jeremy Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism. Mr Austin, MP for Dudley North, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Corbyn was ""completely unfit"" to be PM. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the comments were unsurprising as Mr Austin ""now works for the Tory party"". ""What else do you expect him to do,"" he said, ""when you are employed by the Tories you speak on behalf of the Tories?"" In response, Mr Austin said it was ""a complete lie"" to say he was working for the Tories. He said he had been appointed by the government as a trade envoy, an unpaid role, in July ""along with 27 other MPs and peers from different parties"". Live: Latest on the general election campaign Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson stands down Another ex-Labour MP, John Woodcock, said he would be voting Conservative at the election and urged others to do the same. Mr Woodcock has been appointed as special government envoy to tackle violent extremism. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak called Mr Austin's comments a ""truly devastating indictment of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership"". This video can not be played ""He's now employed by the Tories"": John McDonnell hits back at ex-Labour MP Ian Austin's comments on Corbyn Speaking to the Express and Star newspaper,,externalMr Austin also announced he would be standing down as MP for Dudley North - a seat he held at the 2017 election with a majority of just 22. He said: ""I am so sorry that it has come to this, but as has always been the case, I have to do what I think is right."" He added: ""I must do everything I can to stop Jeremy Corbyn from getting into power."" Mr Austin became a Labour councillor in Dudley in his twenties, later working as a press officer for Gordon Brown. He was elected MP for Dudley North in 2005 and served in Mr Brown's government from 2008 to 2010. Mr Austin quit the party earlier this year, blaming Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"" and accused the Labour leadership of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party. Tom Watson has said he is stepping down as Labour deputy leader His comments came afterTom Watson announced he was stepping downas Labour's deputy leader and as an MP. He said the decision was ""personal, not political"" and that he would continue to campaign for the party. But Mr Austin said: ""If Tom thought that Jeremy Corbyn was fit to lead our country and fit to form a government, then he would have been in that cabinet. Would he really be standing down?"" He said Mr Watson was ""appalled"" by ""the scandal of anti-Semitism that has poisoned the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership"". Shadow chancellor John Mc Donnell said those who had expressed anti-Semitism accounted for ""less than 0.1% of the Labour Party membership"". Asked about the Jewish Chronicle's front page - which urges non-Jewish voters not to support Labour - he said he was ""sad about it"" but insisted the party was doing ""everything they asked of us"" to tackle anti-Semitism.

Actress's MeToo moment shocks French cinema,"AdÃ¨le Haenel said she had tried to cut off links with the director at the age of 15 The French film world has been shaken by the account of an award-winning actress who says she was sexually harassed as a young teenager by the director of her first film. AdÃ¨le Haenel decided to speak out about her alleged abuse after watching the documentary Leaving Neverland. The film explored the singer Michael Jackson's relationships with children. ""It changed my perspective,"" she said in a long and emotional interview with the Mediapart news website. ""It made me see I had too long clung to the version of [film director] Christophe Ruggia, that it had all been a story of loveâ¦ It made me understand the mechanisms of control and fascination,"" she said. Haenel, who is now 30, was only 12 when she was cast in Ruggia's film Les Diables (The Devils). She played an autistic orphan who sets out with her brother to find their parents. Ruggia (C) has admitted to errors in his conduct but has denied allegations of molestation According to Mediapart's investigation - which included around 30 other witnesses - Ruggia is said to have developed an obsession with his young star. Other actors and technicians on the set spoke of the unhealthy atmosphere. The pair travelled together to promote the film and later he is said to have invited her to his home. Haenel says that this was where he first touched and tried to kiss her, and told her of his love. At 15, plunged into a deep emotional crisis, she tried to cut off links with Ruggia and sought help from people in his entourage - but few showed sympathy. AdÃ¨le Haenel has twice won awards at France's annual CÃ©sars This week the Society of French Film Directors, of which Ruggia has served several terms as co-president, dismissed him from its ranks, the first time it has taken the step. Haenel has refused to file a judicial complaint, saying she does not trust the French judicial system. However, on the basis of her published testimony, the public prosecutor has opened an investigation into ""sexual aggression on a minor carried out by someone in authority"". Ruggia has denied the charges of sexual molestation, but admitted to having made ""errors"" in his conduct towards Haenel. ""I did not see that my adulation for her, and the hopes I placed in her, might - given her young age - come across at times as irksome. If this is what happened... I ask her pardon,"" he said in a statement. ""My social exclusion is now under way, and there is nothing I can do to escape it."" Ruggia, who is now 54, has made only a handful of films, none of which has had much success. In recent years he has been an outspoken champion of the rights of immigrants. AdÃ¨le Haenel has appeared in more than 25 films, and twice won Cesar awards - France's equivalent of the Oscars. Supporters of the MeToo movement hoped the affair might end theomerta-style code of silence,which they say still holds sway in the French film industry and stops many actresses speaking out about harassment. ""I believe it is a kind of turning-point. It is the first time an internationally recognised actress, who is so highly esteemed, has opened up on the issue,"" said Veronique Le Bris, who runs a website on women in film. ""Adele, your courage is a gift of incomparable generosity.... You are breaking such a heavy silence,"" the actress Marion Cotillard wrote on social media. Allow Instagram content?

Why a NZ MP used 'OK boomer' in parliament,"This video can not be played Watch how ChlÃ¶e Swarbrick shuts down heckler A 25-year-old New Zealand politician has admitted making ""some people very mad"" by using a viral phrase in parliament. ChlÃ¶e Swarbrick told an older lawmaker ""OK boomer"" after they interrupted her speech on climate change. There was little reaction in parliament but she soon began trending online. She has also been accused of ageism. A ""boomer"" is shorthand for a baby boomer - someone born between 1946 and 1964. 'OK Boomer' has earned me $25,000, says student Barack Obama challenges 'woke' culture Taylor Swift opens up about being 'cancelled' In internet parlance, ""OK boomer"" is a derogatory phrase used primarily by the next generations to show their indignation towards older people deemed indifferent to their concerns. It is used widely on platforms like Twitter and TikTok. ""Boomer is a state of mind,""Ms Swarbrick told Stuff.,external ""I think you can see from the way that that meme has evolved that it is symbolic of the collective frustration that young people in particular feel to placing evidence in fact time after time in the debate and in the argument and being met with dogma,"" she said. She also wondered whether by using the phrase so publicly she had inadvertently killed it off. Ms Swarbrick was commenting on the Zero Carbon bill, which aims to reduce net carbon emissions in New Zealand to zero by 2050, when she used the phrase. ""Mr Speaker, how many world leaders, for how many decades have seen and known what is coming but have decided that it is more politically expedient to keep it behind closed doors. My generation and the generations after me do not have that luxury,"" she said. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

At this point in her speech, she was interrupted by an older member of parliament, reported to be opposition spokesman for climate change, Todd Muller. Ms Swarbrick paused, gestured with her right hand and said: ""OK boomer."" The zero carbon bill at the centre of the debate was voted into law on Thursday, with historic cross-party support. On social media, the Green MP - elected in 2017 - has been hailed as a ""queen"" for using the term. But some critics see ""OK boomer"" as ageist.

Left-handed women's quirk over sense of smell,"Scientists say they have discovered a biological anomaly that could change how we understand our sense of smell. The studyin the journal Neuron,externalshows some people can smell normally, despite missing the part of the brain that is considered to be crucial for smell - the olfactory bulbs. Lacking bulbs should cause anosmia (being unable to smell). Curiously, the phenomenon mostly affects left-handed women, and has never been detected in men. So how do we smell a fresh mug of coffee, a garden flower or even a newborn's soiled nappy? Current science says odours enter the nose where they excite nerve endings. This creates an electrical signal that travels up to a specialised part of the brain called the olfactory bulbs. They process the signals coming from the nose to work out what we are sniffing. Except researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel have found people who have a normal sense of smell even though they are bulb-less. Brain scan on the left shows a pair of bulbs, which are missing in the patient on the right. The scientists stumbled across the first example when doing brain scans of people with a healthy sense of smell as part of a completely unrelated study. Researcher Prof Noam Sobel told BBC News: ""We could not find any sign of olfactory bulb in her brain, it's an anomaly - this does not make sense, right?"" The woman was left-handed and the researchers wanted to compare her brain to other left-handed women, to see what was going on. They only had to scan another nine brains before they found another woman with no bulbs, but a cracking sense of smell. ""It was overwhelmingly shocking, this started ringing all the bells,"" Prof Sobel said. The team then turned to a public library of 1,113 brain scans - theHuman Connectome Project,external- and found yet more examples. The phenomenon has never been detected in men, but is present in more than 4% of left-handed women. Prof Sobel said he had ""absolutely no clue"" why gender and left-handedness seem to be involved. There are a number of ideas, but only more research will tell which is correct. One possibility is the women do have olfactory bulbs, but they are so small they cannot be detected on brain scans. However, this does not explain how they retain such a good sense of smell with such compromised bulbs. Another explanation is the brain's ability to adapt, known as plasticity. If a child is born without olfactory bulbs, then maybe another part of the brain takes on the bulb's aroma-discerning responsibilities. But the researchers have raised a more controversial explanation which challenges current understanding of smell. They argue the bulbs may not be involved in recognising smells and instead have a different role, potentially for locating a smell rather than identifying it. ""It's a dramatic alternative,"" said Prof Sobel. He added: ""My hunch is the olfactory bulbs may be more important for the 'where'."" ""The fact that their olfactory ability is virtually identical to that of normal subjects is very surprising,"" Prof Matthew Cobb of the University of Manchester told the BBC. Prof Cobb, author of the forthcoming bookSmell: A Very Short Introductionsays the living brain is very flexible, and may be compensating for a lack of olfactory bulbs. ""For example, there is a man in Marseille whose cortex - the region of the brain generally thought to be involved in higher intellectual functions - is compressed into a tiny sliver of cells, yet he is of average intelligence and holds down a job as a civil servant. ""In China, a young woman has no cerebellum - the structure at the base of the brain involved in co-ordination - and although she does have slurred speech and poor coordination, these symptoms are nowhere near as serious as animal studies would suggest they should be.""

Injuries as West End theatre ceiling caves in,"This video can not be played Actor Wendell Pierce apologised for the roof collapse Several people were injured when parts of a ceiling collapsed during a Piccadilly Theatre show in London's West End. The venue in Denman Street was packed on Wednesday for a performance of the Arthur Miller play Death of a Salesman, starring US actor Wendell Pierce. Audience members ""heard dripping sounds indicating water was coming through the ceiling,"" according to the theatre production company. More than 1,000 people were evacuated. Four people were taken to hospital after three men and two women were treated at the scene by paramedics. ""We are ascertaining the extent of the situation, and will be providing an update on future performances as soon as possible,"" the Ambassador Theatre Group said. The production team said three special performances of the play would take place at the Young Vic theatre on Friday night, as well as a matinee and evening performance on Saturday. The performances at the Piccadilly Theatre for the rest of the week have been cancelled. Rescue units were sent to the theatre by London Fire Brigade after the collapse Wendell Pierce, who plays Willy Loman in the show which opened on Monday, said: ""First, I hope those injured last night are recovered and healing. ""Their well-being is the most important thing. I am also so grateful that the Death of a Salesman company is able to continue performances of Arthur Miller's great play. ""The nightly audience response has been overwhelming, and I would like to thank the Young Vic for enabling us to continue on this special journey. ""In the time-honoured tradition of the theatre, the show must go on."" He apologised for having to stop the performance and evacuate the theatre. A video shared on social media shows the US actor outside the venue asking the crowd to come back and see the play another time. ""We're so honoured that you came tonight. We are so sorry that this happened,"" he said. Ticket holders for the cancelled performances will be contacted to make arrangements for the performances at the Young Vic. Wendell Pierce with Dominic West (left), his co-star from acclaimed crime drama The Wire, at the play's opening night on Monday BBC journalist Iain Haddow, who was in the audience, said the collapse happened about 20 minutes into the show. He said that before the ceiling caved in there had been a steady drop of water ""which turned progressively into a stream"" - although it was not raining at the time - and said there was some panic when the ceiling fell in. He said that outside the theatre there was scaffolding and building work going on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Celtic fans' stabbed by masked men in Rome,"Two Celtic fans were taken to hospital after being stabbed by masked men outside a bar in Rome. The men had been drinking in the Flann O'Brien pub ahead of Thursday's Europa League match against Lazio. Both fans are understood to have been stabbed in the leg but their injuries are not life-threatening. One of the men, aged 52, is still in hospital but the other has been released. Police said an investigation was ongoing. Tensions were high after warnings that Lazio fans wanted revenge fora controversial banner unfurled by Celtic fansat a match in Glasgow last month. This video can not be played Lazio v Celtic: 'We just want the fans to have a celebration' - Neil Lennon The banner showed the Italian dictator Benito Mussolini hanging upside down. Lazio v Celtic, team news & preview 'Lennon has proved a point in Europe' Celtic have good belief for Lazio test - Lennon A statement released by Celtic said: ""Celtic can confirm that two fans have been injured after being stabbed last night. Both will receive every support from the club and the British consulate in Rome. ""Again, we would strongly advise supporters to closely follow all guidance issued by the club."" The club has also issued safety advice,externalto fans ahead of the match. BBC Scotland's sports news correspondent Chris McLaughlin, who is in Rome for the game, said local police and Celtic officials were ""well aware"" of the threat of reprisals. He said: ""Lazio are a club that has right-wing leanings and their fans have a reputation for violence. ""There were reports of violence last night around 11 o'clock local time and a police source told me that two men had been taken to hospital. ""Both had been stabbed in the leg and both, I am told, were Celtic fans. Reports this morning suggested that one of the men is a German. ""There were also reports on social media last night that other bars around the city were attacked."" Fans were targeted at the Flann O'Brien pub He added: ""In terms of the Flann O'Brien pub, I'm told that around five or six masked men appeared from a side street and started to attack the Celtic fans randomly, for no apparent reason."" About 10,000 Celtic fans are expected in Rome for the match and an extra 1,000 police officers will be on the streets. Chris McLaughlin told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""They are used to dealing with large European games and large domestic fixtures here in Rome. ""So they were well aware and, to be fair, well prepared for this. But there were warnings from Celtic for fans not to wear their colours when they were out and about on the streets last night. ""The police said to me, we don't have a problem with that. The Celtic fans can come here, they can party, they can drink - we are ready. Of course, when it comes to situations like this, there is only so much the police can do. ""Most fans I spoke to said they would heed the warnings, won't wear Celtic tops at night and will stay within the bars. Most said they were quite happy to be here and the locals had been very welcoming. But what happened in some of the bars last night is clearly worrying."" Celtic fan Keith Allan said violence erupted ""from nowhere"" after a group of Italian men entered the bar. He said: ""The Lazio boys came in the top door and worked their way through the boozer. They were asking all the Scottish boys if they had spare tickets. ""Then they came outside and one of them just stabbed a Scottish boy in the leg. Then it all kicked off and he got battered with a chair."" Celtic fan Keith Allan witnessed the violence Mr Allan, from York, added: ""All the Celtic boys came into the pub and staff pulled all the shutters down. Then the police came and got rid of all the Lazio fans. They were kicking hell out of the doors and windows. ""It was quite scary, but there are a lot of Celtic boys in town. "" In a separate incident elsewhere in Rome, Celtic fans were also targeted at the Baccanale bar. Travelling supporter Sam Houston, from Jordanhill in Glasgow, said about 15 hooded men threw chairs at the pub's locked windows and doors in a bid to get to fans inside. Celtic fans had previously held up a banner showing Italian dictator Benito Mussolini hanging upside down He said: ""We retreated to the back of the bar and the staff put the big metal shutters down and we just had to wait. ""It was horrible. We had heard all the stuff about the warnings that have been put in place. But we thought that if we were in this quiet pub we would be fine. ""We weren't singing, we weren't drawing attention to ourselves - were just having a quiet drink. ""But this group were definitely out looking for Celtic fans."" He added: ""We had no idea what they were carrying or if they had weapons. ""No-one was going to act brave and try and fight back. We were all just staying at the back of the bar and fearing for our lives. ""After about 15 minutes, the bar staff told us it was all clear. We headed out and a group of riot police who were out looking for the gangs escorted us to a taxi rank and we got away safely.""

"Inside Block Six: The prison wing holding 2,000 TalibanInside Block Six: The prison wing holding 2,000 Taliban"," The prison wing that holds 2,000 Taliban By Auliya Atrafi and Claire Press Warning: This article contains descriptions some readers may find upsetting. Pul-e-Charkhi prison, on the outskirts of Afghanistan's capital Kabul, is surrounded by colossal grey stone walls topped with barbed wire, and guarded by numerous watch towers and huge steel gates. Of the 10,000 inmates, about one fifth areTaliban- Afghanistan's hardline Islamist insurgent group. Taliban inmate Mawlawi Fazel Bari says he wasn't born a fighter, but after five years in prison, he says he’s never felt more ready to die. “I have become so frustrated.  I never thought I would carry out a suicide motor-bomb, but now, by god I swear I will.” For the time being, Bari will remain incarcerated at the top-security jail. But the prison is one of a number across the country that has been releasing Taliban prisoners in unprecedented numbers, as part of a goodwill gesture by a government locked out of peace talks. The Taliban’s long-term aim is to restore the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan - its system of governance while it was in power between 1996 and 2001 - which introduced Sharia, or Islamic law, and a harsh regime, banning women from public life and introducing punishments including stonings and amputations. It is not clear how any future Taliban regime would operate. Hundreds of thousands of people have died in Afghanistan since US-led forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001, including tens of thousands of civilians. The Taliban prisoners were open during our visit about their motivations and grievances, but reluctant to talk about their specific activities. But we do know that Mawlawi Fazel Bari joined the Taliban 15 years ago and became a commander for the group in Helmand province, fighting Afghan and international forces in that region. Bari’s tiny prison cell is packed with Taliban members. There are queues out into the corridor - some men hunkering down in the doorways, others looking down from three-tier-high bunk beds. One elderly inmate sits on the floor, silently chanting over long prayer beads. The floor is a sea of red carpet and cushions, and across all four walls there is a mosaic of posters depicting images of the Islamic holy sites of Mecca and Medina, as well as generic idyllic scenes - bouquets of flowers, waterfalls, even ice cream cones. The cell has been decorated to invoke a vision of paradise, reflecting the inmates’  fundamental belief that if they are killed in action they will go straight to heaven. Next to the walls are improvised shelves piled high with heavy books on Islamic literature and the Koran. Bari begins to preach and all eyes turn to him. He is also a former senior scholar, and as such his fellow inmates hold him in high regard. “I tell you this,” he says, “as long as there is one foreign soldier in Afghanistan, peace is not possible.” The Taliban in Afghanistan were accused of providing a sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda movement - blamed for the co-ordinated terror attacks on the US in September 2001. After 19 years of war between the Taliban and the US-led forces, the conflict in Afghanistan is now the longest in US history. President Donald Trump seemed close to a deal with the Taliban in September. Buthe abruptly called off peace talksafter the militants admitted responsibility for a bomb blast in Kabul that killed 12, including a US soldier. The US says it still has at least 13,000 troops in the country. As part of a draft deal with the Taliban - currently off the table following the break down of talks - it promised to reduce them to 8,600 within the first five months of it being signed. Mr Trump pledged during his 2016 presidential campaign that he would end the US war in Afghanistan. But many critics believe without involving the Afghan government - so far not included in the peace talks - such a withdrawal could leave the country in chaos.

But many critics believe that without involving the Afghan government - so far not included in the peace talks - such a withdrawal could leave the country in chaos. Walking into Block Six feels like entering Taliban territory. The long corridors are full of Taliban inmates moving freely around - shaving, showering, cooking. Bari’s cellmates hail from all walks of Afghan life. They are former teachers, farmers, traders and drivers who have been tried and convicted of also belonging to the Taliban -  found guilty of a variety of roles, from collecting taxes, to patrolling as a foot soldier, to planting bombs. Elders such as Bari co-ordinate the daily prison schedule - leading inmates through hours of worship and Islamic studies. During meal times and the prisoners’ designated hour outside, politics dominates the conversation. Many say that they were initially motivated to join the Taliban out of revenge, often in retaliation against airstrikes. “When the American forces carried out an airstrike over my village [15 years ago] my neighbour and his two wives died, but their youngest, a boy called Rahmatullah, survived,” says Bari. “I adopted the boy and helped him to study. But every time he heard the sound of helicopters overhead, he would run to me screaming: ‘They have come to kill me.’” He says he was motivated to join the war after he saw “too many mosques being destroyed, and women and children killed”. Another Taliban elder in the prison, Mullah Sultan, also says he wanted to stand against the “atrocities” he witnessed. “As an Afghan I saw it as my right to raise my voice and say I don’t accept these invaders,” he says. Over the past decade the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops by the US-led coalition has been offset by an increase in airstrikes, which are frequently inaccurate, incurring substantial civilian losses. In the first half of 2019, the UN says thatmore civilians were killed by Afghan and US-led forces than by Taliban forces. However, insurgent forces including the Taliban have been responsible for most civilian deaths over the past decade, according to the UN. If the Taliban inmates say developments on the battlefield are motivating young men to join the Taliban, they also appear to be fuelling their grievances while in prison. Leaders like Bari are believed to receive sermons from their superiors, and even from Sheikh Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban’s supreme leader, and then pass down their teachings directly to the prisoners. News on the peace talks, when they were going on, was also eagerly shared. “We know the foreigners are tired,” says Mullah Sultan. “We believe they are on their knees and will soon be on their way. We Afghans will live together under the umbrella of Sharia [Islamic law] and an Islamic system.”   Walking into Block Six feels like entering Taliban territory.

And their unity and clear chains of command appear to have given them more influence within the prison. As a result they sometimes represent the entire population of Pul-e-Charkhi to lobby for better conditions. The guards recognise that they present a united front, who, as another Taliban prison elder, Mawlawi Mamur, tells us, “will die for each other’s rights”. The guards say the relationship between themselves and the Taliban prisoners is collaborative. “The sense of co-operation is very strong between us and the Taliban inmate leaders,” says 28-year-old guard Rahmudin, the commander of Block Six. “There are up to 2,000 inmates at any one time, so we need their co-operation and to solve their problems.” But regular strikes by Taliban inmates in Pul-e-Charkhi over their conditions suggest the relationship is not always mutual. The inmates told the BBC that they regularly hold hunger strikes by sewing their lips together or piercing bicycle spokes through their mouths to protest against what they claim to be poor conditions at the prison such as inadequate medical attention, slow legal processing and the mistreatment of prisoners by guards. There are also reports of Taliban prisoners attacking the prison guards, even sometimes taking control of part of the prison. The BBC contacted the Ministry of Interior Affairs to verify these reports but did not receive a response. However every few months it receives photos of the strikes, and calls and messages pleading for help. Earlier this year, clashes between prisoners and guards resulted in the deaths of four inmates and the injury of 33 other people, including 20 police officers. 	Unconfirmed reports said that the inmates had been demonstrating about a lack of health facilities, but a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Affairs told the BBC at the time that the clashes followed a check for drugs and was instigated by drug dealers in the prison.

And some of them have been, or are due to be, released in unprecedented numbers. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said in June that some 887 Taliban prisoners would be freed from Pul-e-Charkhi and other prisons. It is traditional for the president to announce dozens of prisoner releases to celebrate the Islamic festival of Eid, but this was an unprecedented gesture which critics have interpreted as a show of power by a government excluded from the US-Taliban peace talks. The Taliban refused to hold direct negotiations with the government as they do not recognise its legitimacy. Bari is due to serve his sentence for another two years, although he is adamant that when he is freed he will continue his jihad, or holy war. “When I am released from here I will rejoin my ranks. Before I was 20% [committed], but now I am 100% committed to carrying on my jihad and defending my country.” One of those who has been released under the presidential pardons is his friend and former cellmate Qari Sayed Muhammed, now home in Taliban territory.

Before I was 20% [committed], but now I am 100% committed to carrying on my jihad and defending my country.” One of those who has been released under the presidential pardons is his friend and former cellmate Qari Sayed Muhammed, now home in Taliban territory. Qari Sayed Muhammed, 32, lives in Balkh province, northern Afghanistan - deep in Taliban territory. He spent six years in Pul-e-Charkhi prison. As the only remaining male in his family - his father and two brothers were killed while he was in jail - he says for now he must stay at home to run the family farm. He believes that of those prisoners recently freed, he is one of only a handful who are still alive. “I believe 95% of those recently released have rejoined the Taliban and a lot of them have already died,” he says. While his former fellow inmate Bari was motivated by revenge, Muhammed says he joined the Taliban - at 18 years old, along with 15 of his friends - as a way of escaping police harassment. “Harassment is a part of village life. Often, if someone told the police lies about us, they would harass us. So we thought if they are going to arrest us anyway, we might as well take our fate into our own hands.” Violence and corruption within Afghan police forces has beenacknowledged as a widespread problem across the countryby several human rights organisations. There are, however, a multitude of reasons why a young Afghan man might join the Taliban - a reaction to indiscriminate shooting and shelling; unemployment; a desire for war booty such as weapons, vehicles and ammunition which they can later sell; and even peer pressure. One of Muhammed’s first jobs for the Taliban was collecting its mandatory taxes. Riding out on motorbikes in a unit of six men or fewer, he would demand money from every opium farm - legal in Taliban territory - from across four districts. As a foot soldier, Muhammed says there was no official salary, but all his expenses were covered, from ammunition and fuel to mobile credit. He says it was some three years later - with the war intensifying across the country - that his motivation shifted, and he embraced the Taliban’s jihad or holy war against all foreign troops. “I was 21 when I slung a gun over my shoulder. I remember thinking I was entering into a battle against the infidels, for the defence of Muslims. This thought has stayed with me and will until the end.” Following the ideology of a jihadi, he says whenever he feared for his life he would try to counter concerns for his family with the thought that he would be fulfilling his religious duty if he were to be killed. He describes a mission during which his unit was ambushed in a village on flat ground, and he was being fired on with a Russian machine gun. “It’s during these moments that your brain starts working really fast. You begin thinking: 'What will happen to my household? My children? My wife?' That's when the devil tries to distract you, tempt you into thinking about your family. But I tried to focus all my attention on the fact that I was serving Allah.” Muhammed was captured by the Afghan intelligence services in 2013 and sent to Pul-e-Charki. He believes, of the 15 young men with whom he first left his village to join the Taliban, only two are still alive.

Only 20%-30% of the country is controlled by the government, and the Taliban now control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any point since 2001, according to research by the   Foundation for Defense of Democracies'  Long War Journal in October. Opportunities for young men are slim, and many feel the obvious choice is to join the fighting. But often where they are born can determine who they fight for. When Nematullah was 24 years old and living in Kunar Province, eastern Afghanistan, he decided to devote his life to the Afghan National Army. His story reflects the potential for bureaucratic chaos in a nation in turmoil. Nematullah on his farm Nematullah on his farm After three years of travelling and fighting all over Afghanistan, Nematullah and his unit were sent to guard an isolated outpost in the mountainous region of Chinartu, Uruzgan province. Small cells of Taliban would frequently attack the outpost, and Nematullah and his fellow soldiers got used to the routine of exchanging a few rounds until their adversaries were driven back. But one night, the Taliban attacked in huge numbers. Nematullah’s unit was overwhelmed. “The fighting went on forever and as dawn broke we ran out of ammo,” he says. “They handcuffed and blindfolded us. Then beat us with the end of their guns. They called us infidels, slaves of the non-Muslims. “As they led us away, I was counting every step towards death.” Only days later, Nematullah’s family was contacted by the Afghan Ministry of Defence to tell them their son had been killed and they were to come and collect their son’s body from the morgue. Within hours of receiving the closed coffin, the family held a funeral for their lost son. They were told the casket had been sealed shut because his body was unrecognisable. For 18 months, his family, including his new fiancé, continued to make daily visits to his grave, bringing fresh flowers and offering their prayers.

When Nematullah was 24 years old and living in Kunar Province, eastern Afghanistan, he decided to devote his life to the Afghan National Army. His story reflects the potential for bureaucratic chaos in a nation in turmoil. After three years of travelling and fighting all over Afghanistan, Nematullah and his unit were sent to guard an isolated outpost in the mountainous region of Chinartu, Uruzgan province. Small cells of Taliban would frequently attack the outpost, and Nematullah and his fellow soldiers got used to the routine of exchanging a few rounds until their adversaries were driven back. But one night Taliban attacked in huge numbers. Nematullah’s unit was overwhelmed. “The fighting went on forever and as dawn broke we ran out of ammo,” he says. “They handcuffed and blindfolded us. Then beat us with the end of their guns. They called us infidels, slaves of the non-Muslims. “As they led us away, I was counting every step towards death.” Only days later, Nematullah’s family was contacted by the ministry of defence to tell them their son had been killed and they were to come and collect his body from the morgue. Within hours of receiving the closed coffin, the family held a funeral for their lost son. They were told the casket had been sealed shut because his body was unrecognisable. For 18 months, his family, including his new fiancé, continued to make daily visits to his grave, bringing fresh flowers and offering their prayers.   Back in Uruzgan, Nematullah had been taken deep into the mountains, to a huge winding network of caves. Along with 54 other captives, he was made to dig his own cell from out of the rock face. For a year and a half, he shared his self-built cell with 11 other men, all Afghan army and police recruits. Their hands and feet were chained for almost 24 hours a day. Nematullah remembers the Taliban giving them so little bread, the monotony of captivity was almost as bad as the hunger. Until finally, one evening around midnight, Nematullah and his cell mates were awoken by the deafening sound of explosions all around them. They were positioned directly beneath an airstrike, and the destruction it created allowed them to break free. The first thing he did was to ring his father. “‘It's me, Nemat,’ I said. To which my father replied, ‘Which Nemat?’ ‘Your son,’ I said. But he still didn't believe me.’” Only several selfies later, did his father finally believe that his son was alive. Arriving home to Kunar on the first day of Ramadan, word had already spread of his return. A party was under way, but before rejoining his family, Nematullah had one important visit to make - to the graveyard to offer a prayer for his fellow fallen soldier. Since his return, Nematullah and recently married wife have not stopped their daily visits to the grave of the unidentified soldier. They say he is now their brother and their responsibility. Such cases of mistaken identity are not unique - the BBC has learned of several such incidents, of kidnapped Afghan soldiers returning home to find their family have buried the wrong body after being given a sealed coffin by the government. The Afghan government has declined to comment. Despite the trauma of being held captive, Nematullah says he must return to the battlefield and continue to serve his country.

Decades of war have left many ordinary civilians feeling paralysed, and those wielding the least power and facing the most insecurity are women and children. For those women living in major government-controlled cities, life has changed dramatically since the days of Taliban rule. With the formation of an elected government, and Afghan and allied forces creating a relative level of security, more girls have gone to school, and more women have gone to work. Under Taliban rule,girls’ access to education was almost zero. Since thenliteracy has climbed to 37% of adolescent girls, although this is still one of the lowest rates in the world. However, for those living in the Taliban-controlled areas, women’s freedom to access education and work remains limited, and many fear if the group were to gain more power, their freedoms would be further curtailed. Sola (C) with her mother Nargis (R) Sola (C) with her mother Nargis (R) “Women will lose out of course,” says Nargis, a 30-year-old teacher and mother of six who lives in the north of Kabul. “They won’t be allowed to be educated, or go to work -  we will lose the most.” The Taliban have stated thatthey are now committed to women’s rights,but many critics are sceptical about how far the Taliban have transformed themselves. Nargis is one of them. “I doubt that the Taliban have changed. Because as they talk peace, explosions continue, killing our Muslim brothers and mothers. What change is that?” Nargis says the arrival of the Taliban and the subsequent unrest is the reason she missed out on an education. “I was in class four of school when the Taliban came. Fighting began and schools were closed down. Girls weren’t allowed to leave their house. I was only nine or 10 when I took to the scarf [was forced to wear the hijab] and sat at home, never leaving it out of fear. We then migrated to Pakistan - school was left behind.  After returning home, now I realise I’m missing a lot.” She is adamant that her youngest daughter, eight-year-old Sola who is currently in school, will not suffer the same fate. What Sola has already been educated in is the violence of war - she recently witnessed the horror of a Taliban suicide bomber. “I saw a bomb go off. I saw young people die,” she says. “I was really scared, I was crying; my mum held on to me, put me in a taxi and brought us home.” As the daily violence continues unabated across Afghanistan, peace talks seem to be the country’s only hope for change. However, getting first the US and Taliban around the table, and then including the Afghan government in the talks, seems a tough order. The Afghan government say they will only meet the Taliban if a month-long ceasefire is agreed by all sides. In response the Taliban have said they will only sit down with the government after the full withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country. So it is perhaps unsurprising that civilians like Nargis are sceptical of any lasting change in the country. “I don't think peace will come. Afghanistan has become a cloth which everyone pulls in a different direction. It’s difficult to distinguish who is a friend and who is a foe,” she says. “Whether it's the Americans, the Taliban or the government that takes over - our demand is just peace.” Some names have been changed.

"Lib Dems, Greens and Plaid agree election pactThe pro-Remain parties will later announce details of the deal - but it could cover up to 70 seats.Election 2019","This video can not be played The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have agreed not to stand against each other. The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have formed an electoral pact, agreeing not to stand against each other in dozens of seats. The deal between the three anti-Brexit parties will cover 60 constituencies across England and Wales. Chair of the Unite to Remain group Heidi Allen said it was ""an opportunity to tip the balance of power"". The three parties all support another Brexit referendum and want the UK to remain in the EU. Their pact means that, in Wales, two of the parties will agree not to field a candidate, boosting the third candidate's chances of picking up the Remain vote. In England, it will simply be a two-way agreement between the Lib Dems and the Greens. Lib Dem candidate Layla Moran said the Unite to Remain group had approached Labour about pacts, but ""they said no [and] they didn't even enter into those conversations"". In a speech in Liverpool earlier, Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, said: ""We will never enter pacts, coalitions, or deals like that - ever."" And the SNP's Stephen Gethins said: ""If other parties want to deliver a Remain message in Scotland, they know they have to get behind the SNP."" Thursday marks exactly five weeks until the UK general election on 12 December. What is tactical voting? Labour plans to shift power to the North Students more likely to vote tactically on Brexit Your Questions Answered: Who can stand for election? ""We are delighted that an agreement has been reached,"" said Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson. ""This is a significant moment for all people who want to support Remain candidates across the country."" The pact follows a similar deal earlier this year in the Brecon and Radnorshire by-election, when Plaid Cymru and the Greens agreed not to put forward a candidate but instead gave way to the Lib Dems' Jane Dodds. Shewent on to defeatthe Conservative incumbent, Chris Davies. Lib Dem MP Jane Dodds (third from left) celebrates her by-election win Analysis by BBC political analyst Peter Barnes It's impossible to know in advance whether this will affect who wins any of the constituencies. None of them would have had a different result in 2017 if Liberal Democrat, Plaid Cymru and Green votes had been added together. It's also likely that Brexit will have a bigger influence on how people vote at this election, so the idea of having a united candidate for Remain could give them a boost. There are some seats already held by one of the parties where their majorities will be bolstered, such as Arfon and Bath. And there are other places where it makes it a bit easier to win, such as Cheltenham, Montgomeryshire and Winchester - all places the Lib Dems are gunning for - and Ynys Mon, a target for Plaid. In England, the Greens will stand aside for the Lib Dems in 40 seats including Totnes, York Outer, Winchester and Twickenham. And the Green Party will run unchallenged by the Lib Dems in nine seats including the Isle of Wight, Bristol West, Exeter and Brighton Pavilion - where Caroline Lucas is the Greens' only MP. The pact comes afterPlaid Cymru's leader Adam Price wroteto several pro-Remain parties earlier this year, calling on them to work together in a snap general election. In Wales, the plan will involve the Lib Dems and Greens standing their candidates aside for Plaid Cymru in seven seats including Pontypridd. The deal does not involve the Ceredigion seat - which is currently held by Plaid Cymru but is a top election target for the Lib Dems. However Mike Powell, who had been the Lib Dem candidate in Pontypridd, said he would run as an independent against Plaid Cymru. He told Radio 4's World at One: ""I think the people deserve to have an opportunity to vote for someone who is going to represent the people of Pontypridd, rather than standing to represent a cause to remove Wales from the United Kingdom. ""I know there is an awful lot of members in the Welsh Liberal Democrats who are extremely unhappy with the way these negotiations have been dealt with."" The prospective parliamentary candidates for Pontypridd chosen by their parties so far include Alex Davies-Jones (Labour), Steve Bayliss (the Brexit Party) and Fflur Elin (Plaid Cymru). Read more about the pact in Wales In Northern Ireland the Green Party has said it will not stand candidates in East, West or North Belfast. Green Party NI leader Clare Bailey said she was ""prepared to put the need to have pro-Remain MPs returned ahead of party interest"". Sinn Fein leader Michelle O'Neill welcomed the move, which she said would maximise ""the representation of pro-Remain and progressive candidates facing down DUP Brexiteers across Belfast"". Last week, Brexit Party leader Nigel Faragecalled on Boris Johnsonto form a similar election pact. He wanted the PM to drop his Brexit deal and then agree to stand aside candidates for each other. Mr Johnsonrejected the offerand said he would not enter election pacts.

Students more likely to vote tactically on Brexit,"More than half of students are ready to vote tactically in the general election, with Brexit the key factor, according to research. The analysis from the Higher Education Policy Institute (Hepi) says 53% will vote in a way to maximise the chances of their side of the Brexit divide. The poll of more than 1,000 undergraduates shows 74% oppose Brexit. Hepi director Nick Hillman says for many students it would be ""full-on tactical voting because of Brexit"". The 12 December election date means many students will be back in their family home for Christmas -but they will still have the option to vote in their university constituency, or from their home address. But the polling analysis from Hepi, using data from YouthSight polling firm, shows more students expecting to vote tactically than in the previous election, with Brexit driving much of the decision making. The polling shows 53% would vote tactically, 15% would be unwilling and 33% were ""neutral"". In 2017, there were 47% ready to vote tactically. Tactical voting for students could be choosing in which seat to vote or whether to back a candidate more likely to win, who otherwise might not be their first choice. Mr Hillman says rather than student-focused issues - such as tuition fees - Brexit seems more influential on voting intentions. Will student vote go missing in a December election? Views from a midlands marginal: What are young voters concerned about? How to register to vote in an election Was the 2017 'youthquake' an electoral myth? According to the pollsters, Brexit seems to be intensifying as a factor for student voters, rather than diminishing. Among student voters, 70% want another referendum and 75% expect Brexit to have a negative impact on their future prospects. For student voters, 71% said Brexit would have an influence on their voting. In the 2017 general election, the student vote was seen as delivering some big swings to Labour, helping them to take seats with a significant student population, such as Canterbury and Portsmouth South. But Mr Hillman, a former special adviser to a Conservative universities minister, says this is now a different student electorate. ""Most of today's full-time undergraduates were not at university when the 2016 referendum took place, nor when the 2017 election occurred,"" he said. ""They are literally different people to past student voters. But the majority of today's students are strongly pro-Remain. They want another referendum and most say Brexit could affect how they vote at this election. ""A sizeable number are willing to consider full-on tactical voting because of Brexit."" The survey was carried out across UK universities in October, before the election was called. Youthsight, which conducted the poll, has a panel of 150,000 people aged 16-30 which it uses for research projects. Your Questions Answered: Can EU citizens vote?

"Labour voters should back Johnson - ex Labour MPFormer Labour minister Ian Austin said Jeremy Corbyn is ""completely unfit"" to lead our country.Election 2019","This video can not be played Former Labour MP Ian Austin tells the BBC's Today programme that Jeremy Corbyn is ""completely unfit to lead our country"" Labour voters should support Boris Johnson in the general election, former Labour MP Ian Austin has said. The former minister resigned from the party in February, accusing leader Jeremy Corbyn of failing to tackle anti-Semitism. Mr Austin, MP for Dudley North, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Mr Corbyn was ""completely unfit"" to be PM. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell said the comments were unsurprising as Mr Austin ""now works for the Tory party"". ""What else do you expect him to do,"" he said, ""when you are employed by the Tories you speak on behalf of the Tories?"" In response, Mr Austin said it was ""a complete lie"" to say he was working for the Tories. He said he had been appointed by the government as a trade envoy, an unpaid role, in July ""along with 27 other MPs and peers from different parties"". Live: Latest on the general election campaign Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson stands down Another ex-Labour MP, John Woodcock, said he would be voting Conservative at the election and urged others to do the same. Mr Woodcock has been appointed as special government envoy to tackle violent extremism. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak called Mr Austin's comments a ""truly devastating indictment of Jeremy Corbyn's leadership"". This video can not be played ""He's now employed by the Tories"": John McDonnell hits back at ex-Labour MP Ian Austin's comments on Corbyn Speaking to the Express and Star newspaper,,externalMr Austin also announced he would be standing down as MP for Dudley North - a seat he held at the 2017 election with a majority of just 22. He said: ""I am so sorry that it has come to this, but as has always been the case, I have to do what I think is right."" He added: ""I must do everything I can to stop Jeremy Corbyn from getting into power."" Mr Austin became a Labour councillor in Dudley in his twenties, later working as a press officer for Gordon Brown. He was elected MP for Dudley North in 2005 and served in Mr Brown's government from 2008 to 2010. Mr Austin quit the party earlier this year, blaming Mr Corbyn for ""creating a culture of extremism and intolerance"" and accused the Labour leadership of failing to tackle anti-Semitism in the party. Tom Watson has said he is stepping down as Labour deputy leader His comments came afterTom Watson announced he was stepping downas Labour's deputy leader and as an MP. He said the decision was ""personal, not political"" and that he would continue to campaign for the party. But Mr Austin said: ""If Tom thought that Jeremy Corbyn was fit to lead our country and fit to form a government, then he would have been in that cabinet. Would he really be standing down?"" He said Mr Watson was ""appalled"" by ""the scandal of anti-Semitism that has poisoned the Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn's leadership"". Shadow chancellor John Mc Donnell said those who had expressed anti-Semitism accounted for ""less than 0.1% of the Labour Party membership"". Asked about the Jewish Chronicle's front page - which urges non-Jewish voters not to support Labour - he said he was ""sad about it"" but insisted the party was doing ""everything they asked of us"" to tackle anti-Semitism.

Trump used aid as leverage over Ukraine - diplomat,"This video can not be played President Trump made a characteristically fiery speech at the rally A senior US diplomat has testified that the Trump administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless it agreed to investigate Mr Trump's leading US presidential rival. Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, told impeachment hearings he had a ""clear understanding"" aid would be withheld pending an investigation. Mr Trump denies any abuse of power. Public impeachment hearings will begin next Wednesday, with Mr Taylor set to be the first witness called. Mr Taylor testified in a closed-door impeachment hearing last month, and a transcript of his evidence was released to the public on Wednesday. He told a congressional committee that two state department officials said Mr Trump would not ""sign a cheque"" for nearly $400m (Â£311m) in US military aid until Ukrainian officials announced an investigation into Democratic presidential contender and former US Vice-President Joe Biden. Mr Biden's son Hunter previously sat on the board of the Ukrainian oil company Burisma. President Trump has claimed without evidence that Joe Biden used his position as vice-president to quash an investigation into Burisma. Mr Taylor stopped short of directly implicating Mr Trump. He said that the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was behind the drive to get Ukraine to announce an investigation into the Bidens. Asked if the president was directing these activities, he replied: ""I don't know."" The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? How easy is it to impeach a president? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means However, Mr Taylor said he had also been told by Gordon Sondland, the US envoy to the EU, that Mr Trump ""was adamant"" Ukraine's president must personally announce an investigation into Burisma. Mr Taylor's evidence prompted Mr Sondland this week to change his own story. Mr Sondland had initially testified there were no preconditions to the US military aid. But following Mr Taylor's testimony he provided a letter through his lawyer to the committee saying that he now remembered telling a Ukrainian official that US aid ""likely"" hinged on the Ukrainians agreeing to announce the corruption investigation requested by Mr Trump. Mr Trump denies using US aid as a bargaining chip to target a domestic political rival. Also on Thursday, US media reported that Mr Trump had asked the attorney general, William Barr, to hold a news conference to declare that the president had broken no laws during his July call with the Ukrainian president. This phone call triggered a whistleblower's complaint against Mr Trump and the subsequent impeachment inquiry. Mr Barr, a Trump appointee who has proven a staunch ally of the president, reportedly refused to do so. Mr Trump denied it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, who is overseeing the inquiry, told reporters on Wednesday that the evidence for presidential wrongdoing was growing. He said: ""We are getting an increasing appreciation for just what took place during the course of the last year - and the degree to which the president enlisted whole departments of government in the illicit aim to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political opponent."" Next week's Capitol Hill impeachment hearings will be broadcast live, with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers questioning witnesses. George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and Bill Taylor have all testified in the ongoing impeachment inquiry By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor Seeing it in black and white lays it out very clearly. The US military aid - plus a visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president - was the prize. But there would be no prize if the Ukrainians did not announce an investigation into the Bidens. The other thing you get from this transcript is the sense of shock that seasoned officials like Bill Taylor had, this sense that all normal rules had been suspended, that these dealings were all going through a side channel led by the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and the State Department was playing no role in it. Then you see Taylor's utter astonishment at the idea that military aid - aid vital to the Ukrainians - was going to be withheld, out of the blue. He's on a call and suddenly he hears, ""We're stopping it"". The transcript of his evidence is shocking, and it sets the stage for blockbuster hearings next week. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.

What is 2019's word of the year?,"Environmental campaigners in Edinburgh during a mass global ""climate strike"" protest in September A phrase which hit headlines after millions of people joined climate change protests around the world has been named 2019's word of the year. ""Climate strike"" was picked by Collins Dictionary after being used on average 100 times more this year than in 2018. The term was first recorded four years ago when pupils skipped school to protest over global warming - but the movement has grown over the last year. Collins said it has also recognised the word ""non-binary"" as a specific term. Lexicographers said it added non-binary in recognition of ""changes in how people relate to each other and define themselves"". Non-binary people do not identify as either male or female and often prefer the pronouns they or them instead of he or she. It comes after pop star Sam Smithsaid this yearthat they identified as non-binary, joining other celebrities including Me Too campaigner Rose McGowan and Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness. Singer Sam Smith said ""I'm not male or female"" during an interview in March Also added by Collins are the terms ""double down"", ""influencer"", ""hopepunk"" (a TV genre) and ""deepfake (""a digital imaging technique""). The 2019 word of the year - which will get its own entry in the next edition of the dictionary - is defined by Collins as ""a form of protest in which people absent themselves from education or work in order to join demonstrations demanding action to counter climate change"". It is the second year in a row that an environmental term has been picked as word of the year, after ""single-use""in 2018. The term climate strike was first registered in November 2015 during the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris when the first event of its kind took place. But the movement was reignited thanks to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg. The schoolgirls seeking to save the world On 20 August 2018, Thunberg sat outside Sweden's parliament carrying a ""school strike for climate change"" sign and saying she was refusing to attend classes until Swedish politicians took action. Greta Thunberg is credited with launching the wave of school strikes for climate change this year The movement snowballed with students around the world missing school to demand action on global warming, andin Septembermillions of people took part in a global climate strike.

Several injured in West End theatre ceiling fallScreaming was heard as the ceiling collapsed about 20 minutes into a performance.London,"This video can not be played Actor Wendell Pierce apologised for the roof collapse Several people were injured when parts of a ceiling collapsed during a Piccadilly Theatre show in London's West End. The venue in Denman Street was packed on Wednesday for a performance of the Arthur Miller play Death of a Salesman, starring US actor Wendell Pierce. Audience members ""heard dripping sounds indicating water was coming through the ceiling,"" according to the theatre production company. More than 1,000 people were evacuated. Four people were taken to hospital after three men and two women were treated at the scene by paramedics. ""We are ascertaining the extent of the situation, and will be providing an update on future performances as soon as possible,"" the Ambassador Theatre Group said. The production team said three special performances of the play would take place at the Young Vic theatre on Friday night, as well as a matinee and evening performance on Saturday. The performances at the Piccadilly Theatre for the rest of the week have been cancelled. Rescue units were sent to the theatre by London Fire Brigade after the collapse Wendell Pierce, who plays Willy Loman in the show which opened on Monday, said: ""First, I hope those injured last night are recovered and healing. ""Their well-being is the most important thing. I am also so grateful that the Death of a Salesman company is able to continue performances of Arthur Miller's great play. ""The nightly audience response has been overwhelming, and I would like to thank the Young Vic for enabling us to continue on this special journey. ""In the time-honoured tradition of the theatre, the show must go on."" He apologised for having to stop the performance and evacuate the theatre. A video shared on social media shows the US actor outside the venue asking the crowd to come back and see the play another time. ""We're so honoured that you came tonight. We are so sorry that this happened,"" he said. Ticket holders for the cancelled performances will be contacted to make arrangements for the performances at the Young Vic. Wendell Pierce with Dominic West (left), his co-star from acclaimed crime drama The Wire, at the play's opening night on Monday BBC journalist Iain Haddow, who was in the audience, said the collapse happened about 20 minutes into the show. He said that before the ceiling caved in there had been a steady drop of water ""which turned progressively into a stream"" - although it was not raining at the time - and said there was some panic when the ceiling fell in. He said that outside the theatre there was scaffolding and building work going on. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Trump lashes out at Louisiana rally,"This video can not be played President Trump made a characteristically fiery speech at the rally A senior US diplomat has testified that the Trump administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless it agreed to investigate Mr Trump's leading US presidential rival. Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, told impeachment hearings he had a ""clear understanding"" aid would be withheld pending an investigation. Mr Trump denies any abuse of power. Public impeachment hearings will begin next Wednesday, with Mr Taylor set to be the first witness called. Mr Taylor testified in a closed-door impeachment hearing last month, and a transcript of his evidence was released to the public on Wednesday. He told a congressional committee that two state department officials said Mr Trump would not ""sign a cheque"" for nearly $400m (Â£311m) in US military aid until Ukrainian officials announced an investigation into Democratic presidential contender and former US Vice-President Joe Biden. Mr Biden's son Hunter previously sat on the board of the Ukrainian oil company Burisma. President Trump has claimed without evidence that Joe Biden used his position as vice-president to quash an investigation into Burisma. Mr Taylor stopped short of directly implicating Mr Trump. He said that the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was behind the drive to get Ukraine to announce an investigation into the Bidens. Asked if the president was directing these activities, he replied: ""I don't know."" The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? How easy is it to impeach a president? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means However, Mr Taylor said he had also been told by Gordon Sondland, the US envoy to the EU, that Mr Trump ""was adamant"" Ukraine's president must personally announce an investigation into Burisma. Mr Taylor's evidence prompted Mr Sondland this week to change his own story. Mr Sondland had initially testified there were no preconditions to the US military aid. But following Mr Taylor's testimony he provided a letter through his lawyer to the committee saying that he now remembered telling a Ukrainian official that US aid ""likely"" hinged on the Ukrainians agreeing to announce the corruption investigation requested by Mr Trump. Mr Trump denies using US aid as a bargaining chip to target a domestic political rival. Also on Thursday, US media reported that Mr Trump had asked the attorney general, William Barr, to hold a news conference to declare that the president had broken no laws during his July call with the Ukrainian president. This phone call triggered a whistleblower's complaint against Mr Trump and the subsequent impeachment inquiry. Mr Barr, a Trump appointee who has proven a staunch ally of the president, reportedly refused to do so. Mr Trump denied it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, who is overseeing the inquiry, told reporters on Wednesday that the evidence for presidential wrongdoing was growing. He said: ""We are getting an increasing appreciation for just what took place during the course of the last year - and the degree to which the president enlisted whole departments of government in the illicit aim to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political opponent."" Next week's Capitol Hill impeachment hearings will be broadcast live, with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers questioning witnesses. George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and Bill Taylor have all testified in the ongoing impeachment inquiry By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor Seeing it in black and white lays it out very clearly. The US military aid - plus a visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president - was the prize. But there would be no prize if the Ukrainians did not announce an investigation into the Bidens. The other thing you get from this transcript is the sense of shock that seasoned officials like Bill Taylor had, this sense that all normal rules had been suspended, that these dealings were all going through a side channel led by the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and the State Department was playing no role in it. Then you see Taylor's utter astonishment at the idea that military aid - aid vital to the Ukrainians - was going to be withheld, out of the blue. He's on a call and suddenly he hears, ""We're stopping it"". The transcript of his evidence is shocking, and it sets the stage for blockbuster hearings next week. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.

Chinese group 'is favourite to buy British Steel',"China's Jingye Group has emerged as the frontrunner to buy British Steel out of insolvency, according to reports. A possible deal has emerged after a preliminary offer from Turkish company Ataer faltered in late October, leaving the company in limbo. Since May, British Steel has been kept running by the government as it seeks a buyer for the business. The Official Receiver, which is handling the insolvency process, declined to comment. Some 5,000 jobs hang in the balance at British Steel's Scunthorpe plant, and another 20,000 in the supply chain. Fresh doubts about British Steel as bid hopes fade British Steel: 'We fear for our town's future' Jingye Group, which also makes steel, is reportedly looking to reach an agreement in principle by next Monday. A spokesperson for Jingye confirmed talks are ongoing but would not provide detail on the timing of any potential bid. Its chairman, Li Ganpo, visited British Steel sites last week and met with Scunthorpe MP Nic Dakin and Andrew Percy, representative for the Brigg and Goole constituency. Mr Percy said he had been assured that if Jingye succeeds in buying British Steel, it would protect the company. ""They have assured us that if they do progress with this acquisition, they have every intention of investing to expand production to serve the UK and European market,"" he told the Grimsby Telegraph. ""That's really important and what they wanted from us was assurance from the government and the council about support we could give and we said we are committed to work together for that."" British Steel was put into compulsory liquidation in May after rescue talks with the government broke down. Ataer - which is a subsidiary of Turkey's state military retirement scheme Oyak and owns 50% of the country' biggest steel producer - signed a preliminary agreement to buy British Steel in August. But hopes faded in October when the Official Receiver said the parties had failed to agree terms. There is no guarantee an agreement will be struck with Jingye, which has returned to the bidding process after having previously pulled out. If an offer is formally tabled it would also take weeks of legal work and administration to finalise. According to the Financial Times, the Chinese firm would aim to increase production at Scunthorpe from 2.5 million tonnes each year to more than 3 million. It also wants to upgrade the plant and improve efficiency, although it reportedly views cutting costs as crucial as well. Jingye was founded in 1994 and has 23,500 employees. Along with steel it also owns interests in hotels, chemicals and real estate.It is not the only bidder left in the race for British Steel. UK-based industrial metals conglomerate Liberty House is considered to be an outside contender. Talks with Ataer are also continuing, the Official Receiver said in late October.

from whisky tasting and boiler suits to campaign buses and toasted marshmallows
â and there have been plenty of photo ops along the way. Hereâs a recap: That's all from us tonight, join us again tomorrow morning. Mr Corbyn reiterates Labour's pledge to scrap tuition fees. He says he cannot understand why it now ""seems extreme to provide free education"". He adds: ""The whole of society develops better when everyone is better educated and has those opportunities."" The Labour leader says it is not just about universities though, and about ""learning for life, culture and imagination"". To back that, Mr Corbyn says Labour will pledge to give every child the chance to learn music. ""But all of this takes place with our determination to run an economy fairly,"" he adds. Concluding his speech, Mr Corbyn says Labour has a ""massive huge agenda in front of us"". And he calls on his supporters to ""get our message out there... with unity, optimism and hope."" Mr Corbyn reiterates his campaign mantra that ""the NHS is not for sale"", and the crowd chants the same. But he says the first thing a Labour government will do is ""bring together [people] over Brexit"" - something he says has been his ""whole strategy"" from the start. Mr Corbyn says one family living in the north west on zero hours contracts and in private rented accommodation could have voted Leave, while another living in the same conditions but in London could have voted Remain. But he says: ""Don't set one family against the other. Bring people together. ""Because both of those families, both of those communities, need a Labour government who will deal with injustice and poverty."" Mr Corbyn explains his party's Brexit stance again,which is to renegotiate with the EU and then put it to another public vote. You can read about Labour's Brexit position in more detail here. Jeremy Corbyn comes out to the crowd singing his name. He says he is ""proud to be live at the Apollo"". ""When a few months ago I promised you a people powered election campaign the like of which the country have never seen before, I saw some people look skeptical"", he says. ""But this afternoon we passed a milestone."" The Labour leader announces the party has raised Â£1m from public donations, with the average donation being Â£26. ""I am more proud of Â£26 being donated to our campaign by people who believe in what we are doing than someone giving money who has lots of money to buy influence on our political system,"" he says. Glenn CampbellBBC Scotland Political Correspondent A Labour candidate in Aberdeenshire has quit following a row over anti-Semitism. Kate Ramsden stood down in the Gordon constituency after the Jewish Chronicle highlighted a blog post in which they said she compared Israel to an abused child that becomes an abusive adult, and claimed anti-Semitism allegations against Jeremy Corbyn were âorchestrated by the wealthy establishmentâ. Scottish Labourâs ruling body had decided to reconsider Ms Ramsdenâs candidacy. A party source said they had taken âswift and robustâ action. Itâs understood Ms Ramsden, an official with the UNISON trade union, is now subject to a Labour Party disciplinary hearing. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey comes out cheering for her Salford constituency. She says the election is ""critical"", especially when it comes to climate change. Without it being reversed, she said, the future will be ""bleak"" and ""littered with droughts, floods, crazy weather patterns and food insecurity"". But she says there is ""good news too"". Ms Long-Bailey says: ""If we take action now, not only can we reverse climate change but can use that act of saving our future as a huge economic opportunity to rebuild our entire economy."" Next to take to the stage is Angela Rayner - Labour's shadow secretary of state for education. She calls on the audience to make some noise for Jeremy Corbyn, and cheers echo round the Apollo. Mr Rayner says she is ""energised"" for the election, and describes growing up in Stockport. ""We were on the UB40.... my mum couldn't read and write,"" she says. ""I left school without qualifications, pregnant and 16."" She claims a Tory minister at the time said women like her were only getting pregnant for council houses and she felt she may not be able to achieve anything. ""Hasn't the last week shown us what this Tory nasty party is all about?"", she says. But Ms Rayner says the Labour movement will allow her to deliver for everyone with a ""National Education Service"" and show there are opportunities for people from any background. We're still waiting for Jeremy Corbyn to take to the stage - he's expected soon. In the meantime, we can tell you about Ian Byrne, who is one of the newest candidates selected a few days ago to run in Liverpool West Derby. He tells the crowd he works for a food bank and has seen ""working class solidarity"" at work. ""Politics isn't working. We need change, we need real change"", he says. The pledges made by Jeremy Corbyn and John McDonnell this morning were ""absolutely music to my ears"", he tells the crowd. You can read about the pledges here.  Labour MP Lucy Powell is kicking off the rally in the Manchester Apollo. She apologises to the crowds for having to wait in the rain before the event, but adds: ""We love our Manchester rain"". She introduces a number of prospective candidates in the region, including those standing in Liverpool Wavertree and Hazel Grove. Each are now speaking a few words to the cheering audience as the build-up continues to Jeremy Corbyn's appearance. Labourâs Jane Aitchison paused for 12.5 seconds before answering a question about whether another Labour parliamentary candidate, Zarah Sultana, should continue to stand. Ms Sultana has apologised for a 2015 social media post, in which she said she would ""celebrate"" the deaths of Tony Blair and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Speaking to Emma Barnett on BBC Radio 5 Live, Ms Aitchison went on to say that âpeople do celebrate deaths sometimesâ¦ for instance, they celebrated the death of Hitlerâ. You can watch the exchange from earlier below. This video can not be played Comments were made by a Labour parliamentary candidate. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent From the tea plant to the crisp factory - with a whisky
distillery in between - the prime ministerâs visits followed a theme today. Picture-friendly locations in specifically chosen marginal
constituencies, with protective clothing compulsory. And while Boris Johnson shared a brew with some staff - and tasted a single malt or two with the master distiller - there was a distinct
lack of any interaction which wasnât carefully controlled. Thatâs not unusual for an election campaign, especially
in the early stages when parties are close to paranoid about staying on
message. But while Mr Johnson will always deliver the goods for
the cameras, his encounters with voters tend to be a little more unpredictable. At a sensitive time, when politics is more divisive than
anyone can remember, any encounters with the general public, anywhere, are
likely to be lively. He can only stay in a bubble for so long. A Labour MP deselected for backing protesters in an LGBT teaching row will stand as an independent candidate. Roger Godsiff, who represented Birmingham Hall Green, wasbanned from standing by the party's National Executive Committee (NEC)on Wednesday. Mr Godsiff, 73, said a ""small intolerant vindictive group"" within the LGBT community had stirred up a ""witch-hunt"" against him. Read the full story here. The stage is set for Jeremy Corbyn to hold a Labour rally in Manchester tonight. A number of his shadow cabinet are due to speak before the leader takes the stage.

Boris Johnson has finished his campaign events today by visiting a crisp factory in Northern Ireland. While at the Tayto crisp factory in Tandragee, he helped sort potatoes, ate some crisps and boxed up packets to ship out. Mr Johnson told reporters he was there to tell them about his ""great deal"" for Brexit, despite Northern Ireland voting for Remain in the referendum. He said: ""[The deal] is a wonderful thing for Northern Ireland because it allows for the whole of the UK to leave while making sure there isn't any border at all between Northern Ireland and the south... and no friction between East/West."" Critics of Mr Johnson's deal, however, claim it builds a border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland in the Irish Sea.

people, like this one from Stephen Blaney in Manchester: Q - Can a candidate standing for a constituency demand a recount at the general election? A - According to the Electoral Commission ""any candidate or election agent may request to have the votes recounted or, following a recount, recounted again"". The final decision as to whether a recount is allowed is taken by the returning officer (though usually by the acting returning officer, as the former post is largely ceremonial), who has overall responsibility for the conduct of the election in that constituency. They will decide if the request is a reasonable one, for example when two or more candidates are separated by a small number of votes.  You can readmore answers to questions from young people here. A Conservative candidateembroiled in a row after saying during a debate on a rape case that women should ""keep their knickers on""says he stands by his apology. Nick Conrad - who made the comments when hosting a show on BBC Radio Norfolk in 2014 - apologised for the comments at the time and no further action was taken by the radio industry watchdog. But Labour has said he was not fit to be an MP and should be dropped as a candidate. Asked repeatedly by reporters whether he
should remain a candidate, Mr Conrad says: âI apologised, I stand by that
apology - that apology is so important, so heartfelt, so genuine.â He also says that he expects the Conservative Party to issue a
statement tonight. After Boris Johnson's visit to Scotland, the SNP criticises his stance towards a second referendum on independence for the country. Its leader, Nicola Sturgeon, wants to hold ""indyref2"" next year, claiming that ""it is time"" for independence. But Tory leader Boris Johnson pledged to halt the plan in its tracks. The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, calls the stance ""undemocratic and ultimately untenable"". He says: âThe simple fact is that the SNP already has a cast-iron mandate for a
referendum and the Scottish people want the chance to have their say. âEveryone knows there is going to be another independence referendum. It is
inevitable. ""And with support for independence on the rise, the Tories sound
rattled and are becoming increasingly desperate."" Mr Blackford says the Tories ""canât continue to stand in the way of democracy indefinitely"", adding: ""The people of Scotland wonât stand for it.â  Phillip Lee, Chuka Umunna and Luciana Berger are all running as Lib Dem candidates Our political research team regularly checks what is called the ""register of interests"" for MPs. It reveals any financial interests they have which others might ""reasonably"" consider to influence their actions or words. The team has had a look at some of the Liberal Democrats' prospective candidates. Former Tory Phillip Lee - who is now running for the party against Conservative stalwart Sir John Redwood - registered Â£80,000 of donations towards his
Wokingham campaign last week. The main donor was M7 Real Estate, owned by Richard Croft, who, like the Lib Dems, is anti-Brexit. Former Labour and The Independent Group for Change MP Chuka Umunna has received Â£20,000 from Russell
Chambers, who was donor to the so-called TIGs. And fellow ex-Labour and TIGer Luciana Berger registered Â£10,000 from a property
firm two weeks ago. Jonathan BlakeBBC political correspondent The prime minister is here in Craigavon, Northern Ireland, visiting a crisp factory. This is his last stop on a far-reaching visit across the UK today. He's come here very much to spread the message that the Conservatives are the party that will keep the union of the United Kingdom together. But of course Northern Ireland and that subject is tricky territory for him because the Brexit deal Boris Johnson has negotiated, in some people's eyes, puts an administrative border down the Irish Sea, and the DUP, whose support he would've been keen to keep, was not able to support him. So it's a tough argument for the prime minister to have to make here. Also, the alliance that we're seeing emerging between Sinn FÃ©in and the Green Party in some seats may well make it harder for the DUP and other unionist parties naturally aligned to the Conservatives to hang on to those Westminster seats.

"US city removes Martin Luther King's name from streetVoters overwhelmingly backed the removal, months after the council changed the name to honour King.","This video can not be played The moment Americans learned of MLK's death Voters in Kansas City, Missouri, overwhelmingly approved the removal of Martin Luther King's name from a major road, months after it was renamed. The proposal to remove Dr King's name claimed almost 70% of a public vote, preliminary results show. The council voted in January to rename The Paseo, a 10 mile (16km) boulevard in the city's mostly black east side. But the change sparked a battle, with opponents arguing that residents had not been properly consulted. Some residents said they felt their neighbourhood was losing its identity. Opponents of the name change set up the Save The Paseo group earlier this year. In April, it gathered enough signatures to put the removal to a vote. More than 1,000 streets worldwide are said to bear the name of Dr King, with at least 955 found in the US. Kansas City is one of the only major US cities without a street named after the civil rights icon. Martin Luther King is honoured by many cities, including Berkeley California Those who wanted Dr King's name removed said they respect his legacy, but criticised the council's decision to push the change through by waiving a requirement that 75% of property owners on the boulevard should approve it. ""I overwhelmingly heard from my constituents that they did not want it,"" Alissia Canady, who served as councilwoman for the district that encompasses The Paseo, told the BBC.

Ex-Twitter employees 'spied for Saudis',"Two former employees of Twitter have been charged in the US with spying for Saudi Arabia. The charges, unsealed on Wednesday in San Francisco, allege that Saudi agents sought personal information about Twitter users including known critics of the Saudi government. Court documents,externalnamed the two as Ahmad Abouammo, a US citizen, and Ali Alzabarah, from Saudi Arabia. A third person, Saudi citizen Ahmed Almutairi, is also accused of spying. The New York Times says it is the first time that Saudi citizens have been charged with spying inside the United States. Ahmad Abouammo appeared in a Seattle court on Wednesday and was remanded in custody pending another hearing due on Friday. He is also charged with falsifying documents and making false statements to the FBI. The criminal complaint says he provided the FBI with a falsified, back-dated invoice charging an unnamed Saudi official $100,000 for ""consulting services"". Mr Abouammo is said to have left his job as a media partnership manager for Twitter in 2015. Mr Alzabarah, a former Twitter engineer, is accused of accessing the personal data of more than 6,000 Twitter users in 2015 after being recruited by Saudi agents. Trump defends Saudi ties despite Khashoggi murder Saudi Arabia country profile One of the Twitter accounts he allegedly accessed also appeared in a note found in a Saudi official's email account, revealing the level of detail Mr Alzabarah was able to obtain about the user. According to the complaint, the note read: ""This one is a professional. He's a Saudi that uses encryption... We tracked him and found that 12 days ago he signed in once without encryption from IP [redacted] at 18:40 UTC on 05/25/2015. This one does not use a cell phone at all, just a browser. He's online right using Firefox form [sic] a windows machine."" Mr Alzabarah was confronted by his supervisors and placed on administrative leave before fleeing to Saudi Arabia with his wife and daughter, investigators said. The charges allege the third person - Mr Almutairi - acted as an intermediary between the two Twitter employees and Saudi officials. Mr Alzabarah and Mr Almutairi are both believed to be in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government allegedly paid the men hundreds of thousands of dollars. One man also received a luxury Hublot watch, worth about $20,000 (Â£15,500). In a statement, Twitter said it recognised ""the lengths bad actors will go to"" to try to undermine its service. It added: ""We understand the incredible risks faced by many who use Twitter to share their perspectives with the world and to hold those in power accountable. We have tools in place to protect their privacy and their ability to do their vital work."" This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing?

Trump lambasts Democrats in defiant rally speech,"This video can not be played President Trump made a characteristically fiery speech at the rally A senior US diplomat has testified that the Trump administration threatened to withhold military aid from Ukraine unless it agreed to investigate Mr Trump's leading US presidential rival. Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, told impeachment hearings he had a ""clear understanding"" aid would be withheld pending an investigation. Mr Trump denies any abuse of power. Public impeachment hearings will begin next Wednesday, with Mr Taylor set to be the first witness called. Mr Taylor testified in a closed-door impeachment hearing last month, and a transcript of his evidence was released to the public on Wednesday. He told a congressional committee that two state department officials said Mr Trump would not ""sign a cheque"" for nearly $400m (Â£311m) in US military aid until Ukrainian officials announced an investigation into Democratic presidential contender and former US Vice-President Joe Biden. Mr Biden's son Hunter previously sat on the board of the Ukrainian oil company Burisma. President Trump has claimed without evidence that Joe Biden used his position as vice-president to quash an investigation into Burisma. Mr Taylor stopped short of directly implicating Mr Trump. He said that the president's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, was behind the drive to get Ukraine to announce an investigation into the Bidens. Asked if the president was directing these activities, he replied: ""I don't know."" The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? How easy is it to impeach a president? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means However, Mr Taylor said he had also been told by Gordon Sondland, the US envoy to the EU, that Mr Trump ""was adamant"" Ukraine's president must personally announce an investigation into Burisma. Mr Taylor's evidence prompted Mr Sondland this week to change his own story. Mr Sondland had initially testified there were no preconditions to the US military aid. But following Mr Taylor's testimony he provided a letter through his lawyer to the committee saying that he now remembered telling a Ukrainian official that US aid ""likely"" hinged on the Ukrainians agreeing to announce the corruption investigation requested by Mr Trump. Mr Trump denies using US aid as a bargaining chip to target a domestic political rival. Also on Thursday, US media reported that Mr Trump had asked the attorney general, William Barr, to hold a news conference to declare that the president had broken no laws during his July call with the Ukrainian president. This phone call triggered a whistleblower's complaint against Mr Trump and the subsequent impeachment inquiry. Mr Barr, a Trump appointee who has proven a staunch ally of the president, reportedly refused to do so. Mr Trump denied it. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, who is overseeing the inquiry, told reporters on Wednesday that the evidence for presidential wrongdoing was growing. He said: ""We are getting an increasing appreciation for just what took place during the course of the last year - and the degree to which the president enlisted whole departments of government in the illicit aim to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political opponent."" Next week's Capitol Hill impeachment hearings will be broadcast live, with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers questioning witnesses. George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and Bill Taylor have all testified in the ongoing impeachment inquiry By Jon Sopel, BBC North America editor Seeing it in black and white lays it out very clearly. The US military aid - plus a visit to the White House for the Ukrainian president - was the prize. But there would be no prize if the Ukrainians did not announce an investigation into the Bidens. The other thing you get from this transcript is the sense of shock that seasoned officials like Bill Taylor had, this sense that all normal rules had been suspended, that these dealings were all going through a side channel led by the president's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and the State Department was playing no role in it. Then you see Taylor's utter astonishment at the idea that military aid - aid vital to the Ukrainians - was going to be withheld, out of the blue. He's on a call and suddenly he hears, ""We're stopping it"". The transcript of his evidence is shocking, and it sets the stage for blockbuster hearings next week. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber. Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached, but neither was convicted. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached.

The proposal to remove Dr King's name claimed almost 70% of a public vote, preliminary results show. The council voted in January to rename The Paseo, a 10 mile (16km) boulevard in the city's mostly black east side. But the change sparked a battle, with opponents arguing that residents had not been properly consulted. Some residents said they felt their neighbourhood was losing its identity.

"Trump impeachment hearings to go public next weekThe investigation has until now been held behind closed doors, but will be televised.","George Kent, Marie Yovanovitch and Bill Taylor have all testified in the ongoing impeachment inquiry Congressional Democrats have announced the first public hearings next week in an inquiry that may seek to remove President Donald Trump from office. Three state department officials will testify first. So far lawmakers from three key House committees have heard from witnesses behind closed doors. The impeachment inquiry centres on claims that Mr Trump pressured Ukraine to publicly announce an investigation into political rival Joe Biden. Mr Trump denies any abuse of power. The impeachment story explained Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? House Intelligence Committee chairman Adam Schiff, who is overseeing the inquiry, told reporters on Wednesday that an impeachment case was building against the president. He said: ""We are getting an increasing appreciation for just what took place during the course of the last year - and the degree to which the president enlisted whole departments of government in the illicit aim to get Ukraine to dig up dirt on a political opponent."" Mr Trump has been making discredited corruption claims about former US vice-president Joe Biden, whose son Hunter Biden once worked for a Ukrainian gas company. How easy is it to impeach a president? What Trump's Ukraine phone call really means The Capitol Hill hearings will now be broadcast live, with both Democratic and Republican lawmakers questioning witnesses. One of the first to appear will be Bill Taylor, acting US ambassador to Ukraine, who delivered some of the most explosive private testimony last month. On Wednesday - a week ahead of his scheduled public hearing - House Democrats releaseda transcript of his evidence,external. It shows Mr Taylor told lawmakers it was his ""clear understanding"" that the president had withheld nearly $400m (Â£310m) in US military aid because he wanted Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Joe Biden is a Democratic front-runner for the presidential election a year from now. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? Also scheduled to testify publicly next Wednesday is career state department official George Kent. Mr Kent reportedly told lawmakers that department officials had been sidelined as the White House put political appointees in charge of Ukraine policy. He testified that he had been warned to ""lay low"" by a superior after expressing concern about Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, who was lobbying Ukraine to investigate the Bidens. Mr Giuliani has denied wrongdoing. Former US ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch, who was recalled in May after falling from favour with the White House, is due to testify on Friday next week. She told the hearing last month that she had felt threatened by Mr Trump's remark to Ukraine's president that was ""going to go through some things"". This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims The military aid to Ukraine was released in September, after a whistleblower raised the alarm about a 25 July phone call in which Mr Trump asked the Ukrainian president to investigate the Bidens. The whistleblower's complaint prompted House Democrats to launch the impeachment inquiry. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office. If, following the hearings, the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial. A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict and remove the president - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber.

Will the Tories' Brexit-heavy campaign work?,"""If it sticks we'll be fine"" - hammer the core message, again and again, and plot a path to victory. That's how one cabinet minister reckons the Tories can win. After the last couple of extremely bumpy days for their party, they are hoping this will be a campaign where surprises are not a regular feature. Instead, they and many of their colleagues reckon the plea for a majority to sort out the Brexit-induced mess of the last few years super fast will find resonance on the doors, saying they are already hearing voters quote back the '""get Brexit done"" slogan. Another cabinet minister says ""it's not Parliament versus the people, it's more positive than the pitchfork, but it feels good on the ground - we are hearing from a lot of people they do reckon it's Parliament that's out of touch"". Events of the last 48 hours have shown already,as I wrote on Tuesday night, that events come crashing into parties' hopes and fears pretty fast and knock them off course. Conservative Party launches election campaign What does Alun Cairns' resignation mean? There is another fear among some Conservatives though. The strategy coming out of Tory HQ is crystal clear - end the political agony of Brexit, attract extra Leave voters who are fed up, while hanging on to as many of their existing seats as they can. But, with such a Brexit-heavy message, will they - can they - do both at the same time? One former minister (one of a tiny number who predicted a hung Parliament last time round!) fears ""this campaign is for the 52%, and the problem is that it is not the same electorate"". In their area, the highest turnout in the 2016 referendum was in a Labour part of the constituency, where people chose overwhelmingly to Leave. But in general elections in that same ward, the turnout is lowest. And it's not just the question that's been much discussed - would Leave voters who wouldn't normally dream of voting Tory vote for Boris Johnson because of Brexit - that matters. It's how motivated that group will be. The same senior Tory worries there just won't be enough voters and many of their normal voters are so cross about Brexit that, ""we have lost the professional classes"". No-one would deny that Brexit has changed the political arithmetic, but the sums may not add up for the Conservatives at all. Other senior figures argue that it won't be as one dimensional. One cabinet minister says ""the pool is larger than during the referendum. There will be a strong economy argument that will work in Lib Dem-facing seats"" - broadly hoping there will be a reason for those Remain-tending Tories to stick with the party. There's a big speech from the chancellor tomorrow morning that might start to build that too. One No 10 insider says ""we have to appeal to a bunch of richer, better-educated Tory Remainers who might be tempted by the Lib Dems"". That is why another minister is so relieved their party is going into the election with a Brexit deal. ""It's changed everything,"" they say. In other words, they don't have to knock on doors and argue for leaving the EU in eight weeks' time with potential economic turmoil. Around the country in the next few weeks, Boris Johnson and his team of Vote Leavers will make arguments as bold and likely as brash as they did in 2016. But it's not the same year, not the same political atmosphere, and potentially, not the same voters who'll make the difference. A predictably unpredictable election campaign Johnson says he had 'no choice' over election Election poll tracker: How do the parties compare?

"What is 2019's word of the year?Woke, upcycling, femtech and prorogue were all hotly tipped - but what was chosen to sum up 2019?UKThe anger and worship inside Block Six","Environmental campaigners in Edinburgh during a mass global ""climate strike"" protest in September A phrase which hit headlines after millions of people joined climate change protests around the world has been named 2019's word of the year. ""Climate strike"" was picked by Collins Dictionary after being used on average 100 times more this year than in 2018. The term was first recorded four years ago when pupils skipped school to protest over global warming - but the movement has grown over the last year. Collins said it has also recognised the word ""non-binary"" as a specific term. Lexicographers said it added non-binary in recognition of ""changes in how people relate to each other and define themselves"". Non-binary people do not identify as either male or female and often prefer the pronouns they or them instead of he or she. It comes after pop star Sam Smithsaid this yearthat they identified as non-binary, joining other celebrities including Me Too campaigner Rose McGowan and Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness. Singer Sam Smith said ""I'm not male or female"" during an interview in March Also added by Collins are the terms ""double down"", ""influencer"", ""hopepunk"" (a TV genre) and ""deepfake (""a digital imaging technique""). The 2019 word of the year - which will get its own entry in the next edition of the dictionary - is defined by Collins as ""a form of protest in which people absent themselves from education or work in order to join demonstrations demanding action to counter climate change"". It is the second year in a row that an environmental term has been picked as word of the year, after ""single-use""in 2018. The term climate strike was first registered in November 2015 during the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris when the first event of its kind took place. But the movement was reignited thanks to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg. The schoolgirls seeking to save the world On 20 August 2018, Thunberg sat outside Sweden's parliament carrying a ""school strike for climate change"" sign and saying she was refusing to attend classes until Swedish politicians took action. Greta Thunberg is credited with launching the wave of school strikes for climate change this year The movement snowballed with students around the world missing school to demand action on global warming, andin Septembermillions of people took part in a global climate strike. BBC Newsfirst appeared to use the termon its website in February 2019, andused it again the following daywhen covering the wave of protests in the UK. 2018:Single-use 2017:Fake news 2016:,externalBrexit 2015:,externalBinge-watch 2014:,externalPhotobomb 2013:,externalGeek The Oxford English Dictionary also choose their own word of the year, opting for ""toxic"" in 2018, ""youthquake"" in 2017 and ""post-truth"" in 2016.

The anger and worship inside Block Six," The prison wing that holds 2,000 Taliban By Auliya Atrafi and Claire Press Warning: This article contains descriptions some readers may find upsetting. Pul-e-Charkhi prison, on the outskirts of Afghanistan's capital Kabul, is surrounded by colossal grey stone walls topped with barbed wire, and guarded by numerous watch towers and huge steel gates. Of the 10,000 inmates, about one fifth areTaliban- Afghanistan's hardline Islamist insurgent group. Taliban inmate Mawlawi Fazel Bari says he wasn't born a fighter, but after five years in prison, he says he’s never felt more ready to die. “I have become so frustrated.  I never thought I would carry out a suicide motor-bomb, but now, by god I swear I will.” For the time being, Bari will remain incarcerated at the top-security jail. But the prison is one of a number across the country that has been releasing Taliban prisoners in unprecedented numbers, as part of a goodwill gesture by a government locked out of peace talks. The Taliban’s long-term aim is to restore the Islamic Emirate in Afghanistan - its system of governance while it was in power between 1996 and 2001 - which introduced Sharia, or Islamic law, and a harsh regime, banning women from public life and introducing punishments including stonings and amputations. It is not clear how any future Taliban regime would operate. Hundreds of thousands of people have died in Afghanistan since US-led forces toppled the Taliban government in 2001, including tens of thousands of civilians. The Taliban prisoners were open during our visit about their motivations and grievances, but reluctant to talk about their specific activities. But we do know that Mawlawi Fazel Bari joined the Taliban 15 years ago and became a commander for the group in Helmand province, fighting Afghan and international forces in that region. Bari’s tiny prison cell is packed with Taliban members. There are queues out into the corridor - some men hunkering down in the doorways, others looking down from three-tier-high bunk beds. One elderly inmate sits on the floor, silently chanting over long prayer beads. The floor is a sea of red carpet and cushions, and across all four walls there is a mosaic of posters depicting images of the Islamic holy sites of Mecca and Medina, as well as generic idyllic scenes - bouquets of flowers, waterfalls, even ice cream cones. The cell has been decorated to invoke a vision of paradise, reflecting the inmates’  fundamental belief that if they are killed in action they will go straight to heaven. Next to the walls are improvised shelves piled high with heavy books on Islamic literature and the Koran. Bari begins to preach and all eyes turn to him. He is also a former senior scholar, and as such his fellow inmates hold him in high regard. “I tell you this,” he says, “as long as there is one foreign soldier in Afghanistan, peace is not possible.” The Taliban in Afghanistan were accused of providing a sanctuary to Osama Bin Laden and the al-Qaeda movement - blamed for the co-ordinated terror attacks on the US in September 2001. After 19 years of war between the Taliban and the US-led forces, the conflict in Afghanistan is now the longest in US history. President Donald Trump seemed close to a deal with the Taliban in September. Buthe abruptly called off peace talksafter the militants admitted responsibility for a bomb blast in Kabul that killed 12, including a US soldier. The US says it still has at least 13,000 troops in the country. As part of a draft deal with the Taliban - currently off the table following the break down of talks - it promised to reduce them to 8,600 within the first five months of it being signed. Mr Trump pledged during his 2016 presidential campaign that he would end the US war in Afghanistan. But many critics believe without involving the Afghan government - so far not included in the peace talks - such a withdrawal could leave the country in chaos.

But many critics believe that without involving the Afghan government - so far not included in the peace talks - such a withdrawal could leave the country in chaos. Walking into Block Six feels like entering Taliban territory. The long corridors are full of Taliban inmates moving freely around - shaving, showering, cooking. Bari’s cellmates hail from all walks of Afghan life. They are former teachers, farmers, traders and drivers who have been tried and convicted of also belonging to the Taliban -  found guilty of a variety of roles, from collecting taxes, to patrolling as a foot soldier, to planting bombs. Elders such as Bari co-ordinate the daily prison schedule - leading inmates through hours of worship and Islamic studies. During meal times and the prisoners’ designated hour outside, politics dominates the conversation. Many say that they were initially motivated to join the Taliban out of revenge, often in retaliation against airstrikes. “When the American forces carried out an airstrike over my village [15 years ago] my neighbour and his two wives died, but their youngest, a boy called Rahmatullah, survived,” says Bari. “I adopted the boy and helped him to study. But every time he heard the sound of helicopters overhead, he would run to me screaming: ‘They have come to kill me.’” He says he was motivated to join the war after he saw “too many mosques being destroyed, and women and children killed”. Another Taliban elder in the prison, Mullah Sultan, also says he wanted to stand against the “atrocities” he witnessed. “As an Afghan I saw it as my right to raise my voice and say I don’t accept these invaders,” he says. Over the past decade the gradual withdrawal of foreign troops by the US-led coalition has been offset by an increase in airstrikes, which are frequently inaccurate, incurring substantial civilian losses. In the first half of 2019, the UN says thatmore civilians were killed by Afghan and US-led forces than by Taliban forces. However, insurgent forces including the Taliban have been responsible for most civilian deaths over the past decade, according to the UN. If the Taliban inmates say developments on the battlefield are motivating young men to join the Taliban, they also appear to be fuelling their grievances while in prison. Leaders like Bari are believed to receive sermons from their superiors, and even from Sheikh Hibatullah Akhundzada, the Taliban’s supreme leader, and then pass down their teachings directly to the prisoners. News on the peace talks, when they were going on, was also eagerly shared. “We know the foreigners are tired,” says Mullah Sultan. “We believe they are on their knees and will soon be on their way. We Afghans will live together under the umbrella of Sharia [Islamic law] and an Islamic system.”   Walking into Block Six feels like entering Taliban territory.

And their unity and clear chains of command appear to have given them more influence within the prison. As a result they sometimes represent the entire population of Pul-e-Charkhi to lobby for better conditions. The guards recognise that they present a united front, who, as another Taliban prison elder, Mawlawi Mamur, tells us, “will die for each other’s rights”. The guards say the relationship between themselves and the Taliban prisoners is collaborative. “The sense of co-operation is very strong between us and the Taliban inmate leaders,” says 28-year-old guard Rahmudin, the commander of Block Six. “There are up to 2,000 inmates at any one time, so we need their co-operation and to solve their problems.” But regular strikes by Taliban inmates in Pul-e-Charkhi over their conditions suggest the relationship is not always mutual. The inmates told the BBC that they regularly hold hunger strikes by sewing their lips together or piercing bicycle spokes through their mouths to protest against what they claim to be poor conditions at the prison such as inadequate medical attention, slow legal processing and the mistreatment of prisoners by guards. There are also reports of Taliban prisoners attacking the prison guards, even sometimes taking control of part of the prison. The BBC contacted the Ministry of Interior Affairs to verify these reports but did not receive a response. However every few months it receives photos of the strikes, and calls and messages pleading for help. Earlier this year, clashes between prisoners and guards resulted in the deaths of four inmates and the injury of 33 other people, including 20 police officers. 	Unconfirmed reports said that the inmates had been demonstrating about a lack of health facilities, but a spokesperson for the Ministry of Interior Affairs told the BBC at the time that the clashes followed a check for drugs and was instigated by drug dealers in the prison.

And some of them have been, or are due to be, released in unprecedented numbers. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani said in June that some 887 Taliban prisoners would be freed from Pul-e-Charkhi and other prisons. It is traditional for the president to announce dozens of prisoner releases to celebrate the Islamic festival of Eid, but this was an unprecedented gesture which critics have interpreted as a show of power by a government excluded from the US-Taliban peace talks. The Taliban refused to hold direct negotiations with the government as they do not recognise its legitimacy. Bari is due to serve his sentence for another two years, although he is adamant that when he is freed he will continue his jihad, or holy war. “When I am released from here I will rejoin my ranks. Before I was 20% [committed], but now I am 100% committed to carrying on my jihad and defending my country.” One of those who has been released under the presidential pardons is his friend and former cellmate Qari Sayed Muhammed, now home in Taliban territory.

Before I was 20% [committed], but now I am 100% committed to carrying on my jihad and defending my country.” One of those who has been released under the presidential pardons is his friend and former cellmate Qari Sayed Muhammed, now home in Taliban territory. Qari Sayed Muhammed, 32, lives in Balkh province, northern Afghanistan - deep in Taliban territory. He spent six years in Pul-e-Charkhi prison. As the only remaining male in his family - his father and two brothers were killed while he was in jail - he says for now he must stay at home to run the family farm. He believes that of those prisoners recently freed, he is one of only a handful who are still alive. “I believe 95% of those recently released have rejoined the Taliban and a lot of them have already died,” he says. While his former fellow inmate Bari was motivated by revenge, Muhammed says he joined the Taliban - at 18 years old, along with 15 of his friends - as a way of escaping police harassment. “Harassment is a part of village life. Often, if someone told the police lies about us, they would harass us. So we thought if they are going to arrest us anyway, we might as well take our fate into our own hands.” Violence and corruption within Afghan police forces has beenacknowledged as a widespread problem across the countryby several human rights organisations. There are, however, a multitude of reasons why a young Afghan man might join the Taliban - a reaction to indiscriminate shooting and shelling; unemployment; a desire for war booty such as weapons, vehicles and ammunition which they can later sell; and even peer pressure. One of Muhammed’s first jobs for the Taliban was collecting its mandatory taxes. Riding out on motorbikes in a unit of six men or fewer, he would demand money from every opium farm - legal in Taliban territory - from across four districts. As a foot soldier, Muhammed says there was no official salary, but all his expenses were covered, from ammunition and fuel to mobile credit. He says it was some three years later - with the war intensifying across the country - that his motivation shifted, and he embraced the Taliban’s jihad or holy war against all foreign troops. “I was 21 when I slung a gun over my shoulder. I remember thinking I was entering into a battle against the infidels, for the defence of Muslims. This thought has stayed with me and will until the end.” Following the ideology of a jihadi, he says whenever he feared for his life he would try to counter concerns for his family with the thought that he would be fulfilling his religious duty if he were to be killed. He describes a mission during which his unit was ambushed in a village on flat ground, and he was being fired on with a Russian machine gun. “It’s during these moments that your brain starts working really fast. You begin thinking: 'What will happen to my household? My children? My wife?' That's when the devil tries to distract you, tempt you into thinking about your family. But I tried to focus all my attention on the fact that I was serving Allah.” Muhammed was captured by the Afghan intelligence services in 2013 and sent to Pul-e-Charki. He believes, of the 15 young men with whom he first left his village to join the Taliban, only two are still alive.

He says it was some three years later - with the war intensifying across the country - that his motivation shifted, and he embraced the Taliban’s jihad or holy war against all foreign troops. “I was 21 when I slung a gun over my shoulder. I remember thinking I was entering into a battle against the infidels, for the defence of Muslims. This thought has stayed with me and will until the end.” Following the ideology of a jihadi, he says whenever he feared for his life he would try to counter concerns for his family with the thought that he would be fulfilling his religious duty if he were to be killed. He describes a mission during which his unit was ambushed in a village on flat ground, and he was being fired on with a Russian machine gun. “It’s during these moments that your brain starts working really fast. You begin thinking: 'What will happen to my household? My children? My wife?' That's when the devil tries to distract you, tempt you into thinking about your family. But I tried to focus all my attention on the fact that I was serving Allah.” Muhammed was captured by the Afghan intelligence services in 2013 and sent to Pul-e-Charki. He believes, of the 15 young men with whom he first left his village to join the Taliban, only two are still alive. After decades of war, Afghanistan has become a patchwork of different territories. Only 20%-30% of the country is controlled by the government, and the Taliban now control or contest more territory in Afghanistan than at any point since 2001, according to research by the   Foundation for Defense of Democracies'  Long War Journal in October. Opportunities for young men are slim, and many feel the obvious choice is to join the fighting. But often where they are born can determine who they fight for. When Nematullah was 24 years old and living in Kunar Province, eastern Afghanistan, he decided to devote his life to the Afghan National Army. His story reflects the potential for bureaucratic chaos in a nation in turmoil. Nematullah on his farm Nematullah on his farm After three years of travelling and fighting all over Afghanistan, Nematullah and his unit were sent to guard an isolated outpost in the mountainous region of Chinartu, Uruzgan province. Small cells of Taliban would frequently attack the outpost, and Nematullah and his fellow soldiers got used to the routine of exchanging a few rounds until their adversaries were driven back. But one night, the Taliban attacked in huge numbers. Nematullah’s unit was overwhelmed. “The fighting went on forever and as dawn broke we ran out of ammo,” he says. “They handcuffed and blindfolded us. Then beat us with the end of their guns. They called us infidels, slaves of the non-Muslims. “As they led us away, I was counting every step towards death.” Only days later, Nematullah’s family was contacted by the Afghan Ministry of Defence to tell them their son had been killed and they were to come and collect their son’s body from the morgue. Within hours of receiving the closed coffin, the family held a funeral for their lost son. They were told the casket had been sealed shut because his body was unrecognisable. For 18 months, his family, including his new fiancé, continued to make daily visits to his grave, bringing fresh flowers and offering their prayers.

Back in Uruzgan, Nematullah had been taken deep into the mountains, to a huge winding network of caves. Along with 54 other captives, he was made to dig his own cell from out of the rock face.

Until finally, one evening around midnight, Nematullah and his cell mates were awoken by the deafening sound of explosions all around them. They were positioned directly beneath an airstrike, and the destruction it created allowed them to break free. The first thing he did was to ring his father. “‘It's me, Nemat,’ I said. To which my father replied, ‘Which Nemat?’ ‘Your son,’ I said. But he still didn't believe me.’” Only several selfies later, did his father finally believe that his son was alive. Arriving home to Kunar on the first day of Ramadan, word had already spread of his return. A party was under way, but before rejoining his family, Nematullah had one important visit to make - to the graveyard to offer a prayer for his fellow fallen soldier. Since his return, Nematullah and recently married wife have not stopped their daily visits to the grave of the unidentified soldier. They say he is now their brother and their responsibility. Such cases of mistaken identity are not unique - the BBC has learned of several such incidents, of kidnapped Afghan soldiers returning home to find their family have buried the wrong body after being given a sealed coffin by the government. The Afghan government has declined to comment. Despite the trauma of being held captive, Nematullah says he must return to the battlefield and continue to serve his country.

Decades of war have left many ordinary civilians feeling paralysed, and those wielding the least power and facing the most insecurity are women and children. For those women living in major government-controlled cities, life has changed dramatically since the days of Taliban rule. With the formation of an elected government, and Afghan and allied forces creating a relative level of security, more girls have gone to school, and more women have gone to work. Under Taliban rule,girls’ access to education was almost zero. Since thenliteracy has climbed to 37% of adolescent girls, although this is still one of the lowest rates in the world. However, for those living in the Taliban-controlled areas, women’s freedom to access education and work remains limited, and many fear if the group were to gain more power, their freedoms would be further curtailed. Sola (C) with her mother Nargis (R) Sola (C) with her mother Nargis (R) “Women will lose out of course,” says Nargis, a 30-year-old teacher and mother of six who lives in the north of Kabul. “They won’t be allowed to be educated, or go to work -  we will lose the most.” The Taliban have stated thatthey are now committed to women’s rights,but many critics are sceptical about how far the Taliban have transformed themselves. Nargis is one of them. “I doubt that the Taliban have changed. Because as they talk peace, explosions continue, killing our Muslim brothers and mothers. What change is that?” Nargis says the arrival of the Taliban and the subsequent unrest is the reason she missed out on an education. “I was in class four of school when the Taliban came. Fighting began and schools were closed down. Girls weren’t allowed to leave their house. I was only nine or 10 when I took to the scarf [was forced to wear the hijab] and sat at home, never leaving it out of fear. We then migrated to Pakistan - school was left behind.  After returning home, now I realise I’m missing a lot.” She is adamant that her youngest daughter, eight-year-old Sola who is currently in school, will not suffer the same fate. What Sola has already been educated in is the violence of war - she recently witnessed the horror of a Taliban suicide bomber. “I saw a bomb go off. I saw young people die,” she says. “I was really scared, I was crying; my mum held on to me, put me in a taxi and brought us home.” As the daily violence continues unabated across Afghanistan, peace talks seem to be the country’s only hope for change. However, getting first the US and Taliban around the table, and then including the Afghan government in the talks, seems a tough order. The Afghan government say they will only meet the Taliban if a month-long ceasefire is agreed by all sides. In response the Taliban have said they will only sit down with the government after the full withdrawal of all foreign troops from the country. So it is perhaps unsurprising that civilians like Nargis are sceptical of any lasting change in the country. “I don't think peace will come. Afghanistan has become a cloth which everyone pulls in a different direction. It’s difficult to distinguish who is a friend and who is a foe,” she says. “Whether it's the Americans, the Taliban or the government that takes over - our demand is just peace.” Some names have been changed.

Ex-Twitter employees accused of spying for Saudis,"Two former employees of Twitter have been charged in the US with spying for Saudi Arabia. The charges, unsealed on Wednesday in San Francisco, allege that Saudi agents sought personal information about Twitter users including known critics of the Saudi government. Court documents,externalnamed the two as Ahmad Abouammo, a US citizen, and Ali Alzabarah, from Saudi Arabia. A third person, Saudi citizen Ahmed Almutairi, is also accused of spying. The New York Times says it is the first time that Saudi citizens have been charged with spying inside the United States. Ahmad Abouammo appeared in a Seattle court on Wednesday and was remanded in custody pending another hearing due on Friday. He is also charged with falsifying documents and making false statements to the FBI. The criminal complaint says he provided the FBI with a falsified, back-dated invoice charging an unnamed Saudi official $100,000 for ""consulting services"". Mr Abouammo is said to have left his job as a media partnership manager for Twitter in 2015. Mr Alzabarah, a former Twitter engineer, is accused of accessing the personal data of more than 6,000 Twitter users in 2015 after being recruited by Saudi agents. Trump defends Saudi ties despite Khashoggi murder Saudi Arabia country profile One of the Twitter accounts he allegedly accessed also appeared in a note found in a Saudi official's email account, revealing the level of detail Mr Alzabarah was able to obtain about the user. According to the complaint, the note read: ""This one is a professional. He's a Saudi that uses encryption... We tracked him and found that 12 days ago he signed in once without encryption from IP [redacted] at 18:40 UTC on 05/25/2015. This one does not use a cell phone at all, just a browser. He's online right using Firefox form [sic] a windows machine."" Mr Alzabarah was confronted by his supervisors and placed on administrative leave before fleeing to Saudi Arabia with his wife and daughter, investigators said. The charges allege the third person - Mr Almutairi - acted as an intermediary between the two Twitter employees and Saudi officials. Mr Alzabarah and Mr Almutairi are both believed to be in Saudi Arabia. The Saudi government allegedly paid the men hundreds of thousands of dollars. One man also received a luxury Hublot watch, worth about $20,000 (Â£15,500). In a statement, Twitter said it recognised ""the lengths bad actors will go to"" to try to undermine its service. It added: ""We understand the incredible risks faced by many who use Twitter to share their perspectives with the world and to hold those in power accountable. We have tools in place to protect their privacy and their ability to do their vital work."" This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing?

"What is 2019's word of the year?Woke, upcycling, femtech and prorogue were all hotly tipped - but which word was chosen to sum up 2019?UKThe anger and worship inside Block Six","Environmental campaigners in Edinburgh during a mass global ""climate strike"" protest in September A phrase which hit headlines after millions of people joined climate change protests around the world has been named 2019's word of the year. ""Climate strike"" was picked by Collins Dictionary after being used on average 100 times more this year than in 2018. The term was first recorded four years ago when pupils skipped school to protest over global warming - but the movement has grown over the last year. Collins said it has also recognised the word ""non-binary"" as a specific term. Lexicographers said it added non-binary in recognition of ""changes in how people relate to each other and define themselves"". Non-binary people do not identify as either male or female and often prefer the pronouns they or them instead of he or she. It comes after pop star Sam Smithsaid this yearthat they identified as non-binary, joining other celebrities including Me Too campaigner Rose McGowan and Queer Eye star Jonathan Van Ness. Singer Sam Smith said ""I'm not male or female"" during an interview in March Also added by Collins are the terms ""double down"", ""influencer"", ""hopepunk"" (a TV genre) and ""deepfake (""a digital imaging technique""). The 2019 word of the year - which will get its own entry in the next edition of the dictionary - is defined by Collins as ""a form of protest in which people absent themselves from education or work in order to join demonstrations demanding action to counter climate change"". It is the second year in a row that an environmental term has been picked as word of the year, after ""single-use""in 2018. The term climate strike was first registered in November 2015 during the UN Climate Change Conference in Paris when the first event of its kind took place. But the movement was reignited thanks to Swedish teenage activist Greta Thunberg. The schoolgirls seeking to save the world On 20 August 2018, Thunberg sat outside Sweden's parliament carrying a ""school strike for climate change"" sign and saying she was refusing to attend classes until Swedish politicians took action. Greta Thunberg is credited with launching the wave of school strikes for climate change this year The movement snowballed with students around the world missing school to demand action on global warming, andin Septembermillions of people took part in a global climate strike. BBC Newsfirst appeared to use the termon its website in February 2019, andused it again the following daywhen covering the wave of protests in the UK. 2018:Single-use 2017:Fake news 2016:,externalBrexit 2015:,externalBinge-watch 2014:,externalPhotobomb 2013:,externalGeek The Oxford English Dictionary also choose their own word of the year, opting for ""toxic"" in 2018, ""youthquake"" in 2017 and ""post-truth"" in 2016.

Labour plans to shift power and investment north,"This video can not be played John McDonnell: Â£150bn fund for ""human emergency created by Tories"" Labour has promised ""investment on a scale never seen before"" to overhaul infrastructure in all areas of the UK. Shadow Chancellor John McDonnell says he wants to transfer power and money out of the south-east of England - and will fund his plans through borrowing. The Tories have also vowed to borrow to fund more spending, rewriting their current financial rules. Chancellor Sajid Javid denied copying Labour's plans, saying he would practise ""sensible stewardship"". But Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesman Ed Davey warned that both parties were ""writing promises on cheques that will bounce"". Labour and the Conservatives say they want to take advantage of historically low interest rates to spend more on transport, hospitals and other infrastructure projects. They are locked in a battle for votes in the Midlands and north of England in swing seats that could decide who forms the next government on 12 December. Labour and Tories plan for a post-austerity future Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson stands down Live: Latest on the general election trail Will the Tories' Brexit-heavy campaign work? Bank warns Brexit deal would hit economic growth Both parties are also promising to shift power and control of spending out of London - but they have different ideas about how to do that. Speaking in Liverpool, Mr McDonnell promised to set up a Treasury unit in the north of England to take spending decisions out of Whitehall. The Conservatives have promised to give the north of England more control over its railways, greater powers for some elected mayors and a new economic development body. The campaign speeches over investment come as: Former Labour MPs Ian Austin and John Woodcockcalled on votersto vote for the Conservatives Pro-Remain parties Plaid Cymru, the Green Party and the Lib Dems agreednot to stand against each otherin dozens of seats Election officershit backat calls from the education secretary for polling stations not to be placed in schools This video can not be played Chancellor Sajid Javid attacks Labour's ""fantasy economics"" At the 2017 general election, Labour announced plans to set up a national transformation fund to overhaul the UK's transport links and infrastructure. This includes a social transformation fund, which Mr McDonnell said would now get an extra Â£100bn, providing a Â£150bn pot to be spent over the next five years. A further Â£250bn of investment will be spent across the country through the Green Transformation Fund. Mr McDonnell said the investment would help a Labour government address a ""climate emergency"", as well as a ""human emergency which has been created by the Tories"". He said his party would introduce new fiscal rules, meaning ""borrowing for investment"" would not be included in borrowing targets. He added the new approach would mean public assets created by infrastructure spending would be ""recognised both as a cost and as a benefit"". Politicians often talk of how many billions they would spend on schools, hospitals, upgrading roads, and so on. A billion is a thousand million (or Â£1,000,000,000 written in full). It used to have a different meaning in the UK. Until the 1970s, it meant a million million, but Prime Minister Harold Wilson adopted the US definition. With Â£1bn, you could pay the average full-time worker's salary nearly 33,000 times. For a government, the cash doesn't go as far. It costs Â£1bn to run the NHS across the UK for just three days, according to the King's Fund. But Mr Javid attacked Labour's investment plans, accusing the party of wanting to ""spray money round like confetti"", and indulging in ""fantasy economics"". He said the ""transformation"" in the economy since the Conservatives took power ""was not the result of some fiscal cycle"", but ""down to solid economic stewardship"". ""By far the biggest fear of business is a Corbyn-led government,"" he added. BBC business correspondent Simon Gompertz Both main parties now agree that this era of unusually low interest rates provides an opportunity to borrow to invest. Both will push up the national debt. Both argue that stepping up investment now will make the UK more productive later on. The question, as ever, is how much will they borrow and how much debt they think the UK can support. Labour is adding a cool Â£150bn to its investment plans over five years, a very big sum. John McDonnell believes by spending on schools, hospitals and other infrastructure he would create a virtuous circle, a bigger economy which could afford the debt. Sajid Javid would replace the Tories' self-imposed limits on borrowing with less stringent rules, including the promise that annual investment in projects like road and rail would not exceed 3% of national output. He says the difference between his and Labour's plans is ""like night and day"" but, however they differ, debt looks set to rise. Mr Javid said his plans to increase debt as a share of national income would increase spending by ""an extra Â£20bn a year over a five year period"". He added that ""you could easily add another Â£100bn to that"" but the details would be set out in the Conservative manifesto. And he said ending the uncertainty over Brexit was ""the most important thing the economy needs right now"", and would ""unleash"" more private investment. Conservative leader Boris Johnson said the last nine years of his party's government had resulted in ""solid growth"", ""record low"" unemployment and the cost of borrowing ""at an all-time low"". ""It's thanks to the prudence of the Conservatives that we are able to make some investments in our infrastructure, in technology, in our public services and the reason we can do that is because we understand the vital importance of a strong economy,"" Mr Johnson said. He said the ""biggest threat"" currently facing the UK economy was the ""uncertainty that is still being posed to our political system by the whole Brexit debate"", but his plan was to bring back his deal in December so the UK could leave the EU in January. However, for the Liberal Democrats, Mr Davey said ""any form of Brexit"" would mean ""less tax revenue"" and would make the economy ""weaker"". ""Neither Labour or the Tories can square their spending promises today with the cost of Brexit,"" he said. ""In contrast, every vote for the Liberal Democrats is a vote to stop Brexit, build a brighter future and invest the Â£50bn Remain bonus in our vital public services and tackle inequality."" We have got into something of a bidding war between the two parties. The Tories are talking about extra cash for police, for upgrading hospitals, for what they call an infrastructure revolution. John McDonnell is talking about pouring hundreds of billions for a once-in-a-generation upgrade to the country's infrastructure. They're on the same terrain - they're both talking about the end of austerity. They're both talking about a big increase in government spending, and they're both talking about paying for this by borrowing. The risk for the government is that they might be seen as ""Labour-lite"" - offering something similar, but not as ambitious. What question do you have about the general election?

Left-handed women anomaly over sense of smell,"Scientists say they have discovered a biological anomaly that could change how we understand our sense of smell. The studyin the journal Neuron,externalshows some people can smell normally, despite missing the part of the brain that is considered to be crucial for smell - the olfactory bulbs. Lacking bulbs should cause anosmia (being unable to smell). Curiously, the phenomenon mostly affects left-handed women, and has never been detected in men. So how do we smell a fresh mug of coffee, a garden flower or even a newborn's soiled nappy? Current science says odours enter the nose where they excite nerve endings. This creates an electrical signal that travels up to a specialised part of the brain called the olfactory bulbs. They process the signals coming from the nose to work out what we are sniffing. Except researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel have found people who have a normal sense of smell even though they are bulb-less. Brain scan on the left shows a pair of bulbs, which are missing in the patient on the right. The scientists stumbled across the first example when doing brain scans of people with a healthy sense of smell as part of a completely unrelated study. Researcher Prof Noam Sobel told BBC News: ""We could not find any sign of olfactory bulb in her brain, it's an anomaly - this does not make sense, right?"" The woman was left-handed and the researchers wanted to compare her brain to other left-handed women, to see what was going on. They only had to scan another nine brains before they found another woman with no bulbs, but a cracking sense of smell. ""It was overwhelmingly shocking, this started ringing all the bells,"" Prof Sobel said. The team then turned to a public library of 1,113 brain scans - theHuman Connectome Project,external- and found yet more examples. The phenomenon has never been detected in men, but is present in more than 4% of left-handed women. Prof Sobel said he had ""absolutely no clue"" why gender and left-handedness seem to be involved. There are a number of ideas, but only more research will tell which is correct. One possibility is the women do have olfactory bulbs, but they are so small they cannot be detected on brain scans. However, this does not explain how they retain such a good sense of smell with such compromised bulbs. Another explanation is the brain's ability to adapt, known as plasticity. If a child is born without olfactory bulbs, then maybe another part of the brain takes on the bulb's aroma-discerning responsibilities. But the researchers have raised a more controversial explanation which challenges current understanding of smell. They argue the bulbs may not be involved in recognising smells and instead have a different role, potentially for locating a smell rather than identifying it. ""It's a dramatic alternative,"" said Prof Sobel. He added: ""My hunch is the olfactory bulbs may be more important for the 'where'."" ""The fact that their olfactory ability is virtually identical to that of normal subjects is very surprising,"" Prof Matthew Cobb of the University of Manchester told the BBC. Prof Cobb, author of the forthcoming bookSmell: A Very Short Introductionsays the living brain is very flexible, and may be compensating for a lack of olfactory bulbs.

City removes Martin Luther King's name from street,"This video can not be played The moment Americans learned of MLK's death Voters in Kansas City, Missouri, overwhelmingly approved the removal of Martin Luther King's name from a major road, months after it was renamed. The proposal to remove Dr King's name claimed almost 70% of a public vote, preliminary results show. The council voted in January to rename The Paseo, a 10 mile (16km) boulevard in the city's mostly black east side. But the change sparked a battle, with opponents arguing that residents had not been properly consulted. Some residents said they felt their neighbourhood was losing its identity. Opponents of the name change set up the Save The Paseo group earlier this year. In April, it gathered enough signatures to put the removal to a vote. More than 1,000 streets worldwide are said to bear the name of Dr King, with at least 955 found in the US. Kansas City is one of the only major US cities without a street named after the civil rights icon. Martin Luther King is honoured by many cities, including Berkeley California Those who wanted Dr King's name removed said they respect his legacy, but criticised the council's decision to push the change through by waiving a requirement that 75% of property owners on the boulevard should approve it. ""I overwhelmingly heard from my constituents that they did not want it,"" Alissia Canady, who served as councilwoman for the district that encompasses The Paseo, told the BBC. ""There were African American property owners that did not agree with this way of honouring Dr King."" The woman still protesting over Martin Luther King Race relations 50 years after Selma US judge rules to save Confederate statues Ms Canady, who is black, said the council had been aware that ""the political will was not there"". ""They rushed to put the signs up with the hope that once the signs were up people would be afraid to take them down. That was the rhetoric: Kansas City can't be the city that takes Dr King's name down,"" Ms Canady says. The Kansas City Chapter of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC) - an organisation founded by Dr King - led efforts to keep the street's name in his honour. They did not respond to a request for comment. Martin Luther King was the most visible and inspirational figure in the US civil rights movement Rev Vernon Howard, president of Kansas City's SCLC, told The Associated Press news agency that renaming the street Dr Martin Luther King Jr Boulevard was meant to be a symbol for the city's black children. ""Only if you are a black child growing up in the inner city lacking the kind of resources, lacking the kinds of images and models for mentoring, modelling, vocation and career, can you actually understand what that name on that sign can mean to a child in this community,"" Mr Howard said. If the sign is taken down ""the reverse will be true"", he added. Tensions between the SCLU and Save The Paseo reached a high point last Sunday, when a silent protest was staged at a church rally held by those pushing to keep Dr King's name. Protesters refused requests by pastors to sit down, fuelling accusations of racism. But Ms Canady, who worked with Save The Paseo, says the charges are ""a deflection of what the real issue was"". She continued: ""Residents should not be silenced by special interest groups."" ""We pushed a reset button,"" Ms Canady said. ""Now everyone has to go back to the drawing board to find a way where we can all celebrate Dr King, and that's a huge opportunity for Kansas City.""

MSPs to debate indyref2 'framework' legislation,"Nicola Sturgeon wants to hold a referendum in the second half of 2020 Further legislation would need to be tabled at Holyrood before a new referendum on independence could be held, ministers have confirmed. The Scottish government wants to hold a new ballot in 2020 and has tabled the Referendums Bill to pave the way. However MSPs have now been told that a further ""short bill"" will be needed to legislate for an independence vote. The pro-UK parties have opposed the Referendums Bill at Holyrood, but is set to pass with SNP and Green backing. The issue of a referendum has become a key topic of debate in the general election campaign, with the SNP putting it ""at the heart"" of their platform and Labour and the Conservatives disputing whether they would agree to hold one in future. Look back on the debate on Holyrood Live Ministers urged to agree indyref2 question test First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants to have a new vote in the second half of 2020, and has targeted having the Referendums (Scotland) Bill in law ""by the new year"" as part of the preparations for this. She has also pledged to formally request a transfer of power from Westminster - similar to the agreement prior to the 2014 referendum, which she said would put the legality of the vote ""beyond any doubt"" - before Christmas. Holyrood's three pro-UK parties oppose the bill, but are outnumbered by the pro-independence SNP and Greens The legislation sets the general framework for any referendum, and as drafted would give ministers the power to set the date, question and campaign period of any poll later. However after complaints that this handed too much leeway to ministers, Holyrood's constitution committee said new primary legislation should be needed for any ballot on a constitutional issue. Constitutional Relations Secretary Mike Russell told MSPs that he was ""happy to accept this"", underlining that this would mean further legislation would now be needed before a new independence poll. He said: ""I agree that normally a short bill should be the way to trigger a referendum and I can confirm that any proposal for a future Scottish independence referendum should now require a short bill."" Mr Russell also said he would reconsider the issue of whether the Electoral Commission would be allowed to test the question of any future independence referendum. The watchdog would normally be brought in to test the question for any plebiscite, but the bill as it stands would not require this if the ""yes"" or ""no"" question used in 2014 was repeated. Mr Russell has previously argued that there is no need to re-test questions, and Ms Sturgeon has claimed the move was part of an attempt to ""rig"" the referendum by her opponents. The Scottish government has argued that the 2014 referendum provides ""clear precedent"" for a question The Commission ""firmly recommend"" they are allowed to test again, and Holyrood's constitution committee unanimously said ministers ""must recognise the weight of evidence in favour"" of this and come to an agreement with the watchdog. On Thursday, Mr Russell offered instead to amend the bill to give previously tested questions a ""shelf life"" of two parliamentary terms. However, he added: ""Some of those who propose testing every question even if it has been tested before are doing so out of principle, and I respect that. ""I entirely accept that it is right for me to look at this issue again in the light of those views and the evidence that the committee has received and consider if I should go even further. ""I am therefore in agreement that I should discuss the matter with the Electoral Commission and come back at stage two with any proposal that may arise from those discussions."" Mr Russell may ultimately be forced to back down, as Scottish Green co-leader Patrick Harvie said the case for his ""shelf life"" proposal was ""not overwhelming"". He said politicians could not choose to only trust independent watchdogs when they agree with their decisions, saying: ""If there is time to conduct question testing, then I struggle to see why that testing should be dispensed with."" Mike Russell said he was read to ""look again"" at the issue of Electoral Commission testing The legislation looks set to pass through Holyrood with support from the SNP and Greens - but all three of the unionist opposition parties said they would oppose it. The Scottish Conservatives have pledged to oppose independence ""every step of the way"", and said they would vote against the ""bad bill"" at every stage. Constitution spokesman Adam Tomkins said it was ""vital"" that the Electoral Commission is ""not only permitted, but required by law"" to test all referendum questions. He said there was ""no good reason"" for avoiding testing, calling the move ""nothing other than another ill-conceived power grab from a minister desperate for indyref2"". Labour's Alex Rowley said there was no need for a new independence vote until the ""current constitutional crisis"" of Brexit is resolved, saying it was ""impossible to put a clear proposition to the Scottish people"" at present. He said the ""flawed"" Referendums Bill was ""the SNP indyref2 bill"" and an attempt to ""rig"" the vote, saying Labour could not support it on that basis. And Lib Dem MSP Mike Rumbles said the bill was a ""fraud"" and a ""waste of taxpayers money"", and said the SNP would ""face electoral consequences sooner rather than later"".

Unregulated housing for children 'must be stopped'The education secretary writes to councils about the use of unregistered accommodation for teens in care.,"Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said media reports had highlighted issues over the use of unregulated accommodation for children in care The education secretary has written to council leaders in England to express ""concern"" over the use of unregulated accommodation to house under-16s. Gavin Williamson said these placements for children in care should be ""eliminated"". This type of accommodation is not registered to deliver care. But in October,Newsnight foundthat more than 100 children under 16 in England and Wales were living in such places, on any given night. Mr Williamson said he could not ""imagine a circumstance under which a child under the age of 16 should be living in an independent or semi-independent setting"". Sent-away children are 'easy victims' Action needed against 'rogue' teen homes 'My boyfriend was killed in the care system' The unregulated homes failing to protect children Unregulated accommodation is often flats and houses with support workers on site or visiting, but can also be hostels and lodgings or even hotels and holiday parks. Running an unregistered home that provides support but not care for children under 16 is not illegal. But it is potentially a criminal offence to run a children's home that provides care without registering with the regulator Ofsted or the Welsh Care Inspectorate. ""I am concerned about the number of children under 16 placed in settings that are not registered with Ofsted, so should not be delivering care, and I am certain that you will want to pay immediate and close attention to those placements,"" Mr Williamson wrote to local authority chief executives. ""I look forward to working together to make sure these types of placements are eliminated,"" he added. ""Such settings must only be used for older children who are ready to live with the level of independence afforded by these settings."" Teenagers in semi-independent care are treated as young adults and expected to do things like open bank accounts, wash clothes and buy food. 'Amy', who lived in an unregulated home when she was 17, said the minister's concern was ""completely right"". ""It's just neglect to put under 16s in these places,"" she told Newsnight.
