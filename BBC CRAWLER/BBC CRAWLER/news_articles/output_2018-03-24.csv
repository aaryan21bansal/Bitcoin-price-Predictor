Tributes paid for hostage-swap policeman,"Lt Col Beltrame suffered fatal injuries after volunteering to trade places with a female hostage Tributes are pouring in for a French police officer who died saving the lives of hostages in a supermarket siege by an Islamist gunman on Friday. Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was shot and stabbed after he traded places with one of the captives following a shooting spree in southern France. Flags are being flown at half-mast at gendarmerie bases across France. His brother Cedric said Col Beltrame ""didn't have a chance"", adding that his actions were ""beyond the call of duty"". ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would,"" Col Beltrame's brother Cedric told a French radio station on Saturday. Speaking to the BBC, Col Beltrame's cousin Florence Nicolic described the officeras a person who was ""so good at his job"". ""Even though we were surprised and shocked when we heard what happened we were not surprised in the sense that that's the thing he would do without hesitation,"" Ms Nicolic said. The supermarket was sealed off by police as the siege unfolded French President Emmanuel Macron also paid tribute to the officer, saying that Col Beltrame ""fell as a hero"" after showing ""exceptional courage and selflessness"", adding that he deserved ""the respect and admiration of the whole nation"". UK PM Theresa May said the ""sacrifice and courage"" of the police officer would not be forgotten. His actions helped bring an end to the siege that left three people dead. The radical Islamist gunman, 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, was eventually shot and killed by police. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what Mr Macron called an act of ""Islamist terrorism"". Lakdim was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. Prosecutors are reportedly questioning two people in connection with the attacks, one of whom is thought to be the gunman's partner while the other is believed to be a friend. Col Beltrame was a highly-regarded member of the Gendarmerie Nationale and was described by France's president on Saturday as someone who ""fought until the end and never gave up"". He graduated in 1999 from France's leading military academy in Saint Cyr and in 2003 became one of just a handful of candidates chosen to join the gendarmerie's elite security response group GSIGN. He was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and was later awarded the Cross for Military Valour for his peacekeeping work. On his return to France, Col Beltrame joined the country's Republican Guard and was tasked with protecting the presidential palace. In 2017, he was named deputy chief of the Gendarmerie Nationale in the French region of Aude, home to the medieval town of Carcassonne, where Lakdim began his deadly shooting spree on Friday. As recently as December, Col Beltrame took part in a simulated terror attack on a local supermarket in the region. Col Beltrame becomes the seventh member of France's security forces to be killed in such attacks since 2012. The violence began on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where Lakdim hijacked a car. He killed a passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injured the driver. He then shot at a group of policemen who were out jogging, wounding one of them. This video can not be played Eye-witness says French hostage-taker ran after him Lakdim is then believed to have driven a short distance to the small town of TrÃ¨bes, where he stormed into the Super-U supermarket, shouting, ""I am a soldier of Daesh [Islamic State]!"" He killed two people - a customer and a store worker - before seizing others as hostages. Mr Collomb told reporters on Friday that police officers had managed to get some people out of the supermarket but the gunman had held one woman back as a human shield. It was at this point, he said, that Col Beltrame had volunteered to swap himself for her. As he did so, he left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so that police outside could monitor the situation. When police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed and Col Beltrame was mortally wounded. After the announcement of his death early on Saturday,France's Gendarmerie Nationale - a police force part of the military - honoured its fallen ""comrade"",external, saying Col Beltrame ""gave his life for the freedom of the hostages"". Lakdim, was born in April 1992 in Morocco and had French nationality. He was known to French intelligence services. Prosecutor Francois Molins said Lakdim had been on an extremist watch-list due to ""his radicalisation and his links with the Salafist movement"", a hardline offshoot of Sunni Islam. However, subsequent investigations by intelligence services had not turned up any signs he would act, he said. In 2011, Lakdim was found guilty of carrying a prohibited weapon and in 2015 he was convicted for drug use and refusing a court order, Mr Molins said. Earlier, Mr Collomb said that though Lakdim had been known to authorities as a petty criminal, they ""did not think he had been radicalised"". Lakdim lived in an apartment in Carcassonne with his parents and several sisters. A neighbour saw him taking one of his sisters to school on Friday morning. The family's apartment was raided by police on Friday afternoon.

Vote Leave 'broke spending limits',"Shahmir Sanni told Channel 4 News that the official Brexit campaign used a different group, BeLeave, to overspend Vote Leave broke the law during the EU referendum by exceeding legal spending limits, a Brexit activist has claimed. Shahmir Sanni told Channel 4 News,externalthat the official Brexit campaign used a different group, BeLeave, to overspend. Vote Leave chief Dominic Cummings has already denied the claim and said he checked with the Electoral Commission before donating money to the group. Mr Sanni has also criticised Vote Leave manager Stephen Parkinson, his ex-boyfriend, for outing him as gay. ""I know that, that Vote Leave cheatedâ¦ I know that, that people have been lied to and that the referendum wasn't legitimate,"" Mr Sanni told Channel 4 News. ""Leaving the European Union, I agree with. ""But I don't agree with losing what it means to be British in that process; losing what it means to follow the rules; losing what it means to be quite literally a functioning democracy."" Electoral Commission reopens Vote Leave probe The Electoral Commission is already looking into whether Vote Leave spent more than it was entitled to during the campaign. Brexit Secretary David Davis told the BBC it was the job of the commission, not ministers, to make a judgement, while foreign secretary and Vote Leave frontman Boris Johnson dismissed the claims as ""utterly ludicrous"". Labour's Tom Watson said that ""if needs be"" the police should investigate too. Mr Sanni told the Observer,externalthat Vote Leave donated Â£625,000 to the founder of BeLeave, Darren Grimes, before the June 2016 referendum. Vote Leave would have gone over its campaign spending limit of Â£7m if it had spent the money. Mr Sanni claimed Mr Grimes was not in control of how the money from Vote Leave was spent and everything they did they passed through ground campaign manager Mr Parkinson - who is now the prime minister's political secretary. He told the newspaper that most of the donation went to Canadian data firm Aggregate IQ, which has been linked to Cambridge Analytica - the firm facing claims it amassed the data of millions of people without their consent. Mr Sanni said he and two other pro-Brexit friends reported the overspending allegation to the Electoral Commission on Thursday. Vote Leave chief denies Cambridge Analytica links Cummings hits out ""In effect they used BeLeave to overspend, and not just by a small amountâ¦ Almost two thirds of a million pounds makes all the difference and it wasn't legal,"" said Mr Sanni, who first worked as a Vote Leave outreach volunteer before working for BeLeave. ""They say that it wasn't coordinated, but it was. And so the idea thatâ¦ the campaign was legitimate is false."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend, Mr Sanni said his lawyers would be presenting ""recommendations to MPs"" at a news conference in London on Monday. Vote Leave has previously said it made the donation to Mr Grimes because it was coming up to its Â£7m spending limit and wanted a way of using the Â£9.2m it had raised from individuals and companies on campaigning activities. The campaign separately spent Â£2.7m on the services of AIQ in the run-up to the EU referendum. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a blog on Friday, Mr Cummings denied allegations of links between his campaign and Cambridge Analytica and said the claims were ""factually wrong, hopelessly confused, or nonsensical"". Lawyers for AIQ told Channel 4 News that it had ""never entered into a contract with Cambridge Analytica"" and it had ""never knowingly been involved in any illegal activity"". In a ""personal statement"" issued to Channel 4 News, Stephen Parkinson denied the allegations and said he was confident he had stayed within the law and spending rules ""at all times"". He said he was ""saddened"" by the ""factually incorrect and misleading"" statements from Mr Sanni, who now works for the Taxpayer's Alliance. Earlier, Mr Sanni said - in a statement issued through his lawyers - that Mr Parkinson had outed him as gay in his original response. Mr Sanni, a British Pakistani, said he was forced to tell his family and that relatives in Pakistan could be in danger as a result. Allow Twitter content?

""That is the capacity in which I gave Shahmir advice and encouragement, and I can understand if the lines became blurred for him, but I am clear that I did not direct the activities of any separate campaign groups,"" he said. Mr Grimes told Channel 4 News he denied the allegations. A solicitor for Vote Leave told the programme the campaign had been cleared twice on this issue by the Electoral Commission. This video can not be played Carole Cadwalladr and Isabel Oakeshott debate any links between Vote Leave and Cambridge Analytica The Electoral Commission said: ""The commission has a number of investigations open in relation to campaigners at the EU referendum; it does not comment on live investigations.""

But Brexit campaigning Tory MP John Redwood told Sky News Vote Leave had twice been cleared of breaching the rules. He added: ""If it's got to be investigated again, well then, so be it.

Ex-spy asked Putin if he could return,"This video can not be played Skripal 'regretted being double agent' Sergei Skripal wrote to President Putin asking to be allowed to return home, a friend of the former spy told the BBC. Vladimir Timoshkov said Mr Skripal denied he was ""a traitor"" and asked for ""complete forgiveness"". The Kremlin denies receiving such a letter. Mr Skripal was jailed in Russia in 2006, but was pardoned and freed four years later as part of a spy-swap - which saw him come to Britain. He and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33 were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Mr Skripal was ""shunned"" after being convicted of treason and his old classmates felt he had betrayed his country, said Mr Timoshkov - a school friend of Mr Skripal's. He told the BBC he had reconnected with Mr Skripal through his daughter Yulia after the conviction and in 2012 spoke to his old friend on the telephone for half an hour. According to Mr Timoshkov, Mr Skripal did not see himself as a ""traitor"" because the ""oath he had sworn was to his socialist Motherland, the Soviet Union, not Russia"". He regretted being ""a double agent"" because his life had become ""all messed up"", his friend claimed. He also asked to be allowed to return to Russia because he wanted to see his mother, brother and other relatives. The Kremlin denies receiving a letter from Mr Skripal. The UK's military research base, Porton Down, said a group of nerve agents known as Novichok were used in the poisoning of Mr Skripal and his daughter. The site's chief executive told the BBC there is ""no way"" any nerve agent held at Porton Down could be linked to the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter. Gary Aitkenhead said suggestions by Russia that the proximity of the labs to the incident in Salisbury might be somehow suspicious were ""frustrating"". He said the laboratory had the ""highest levels"" of controls and security.

Modern headlights 'blinding drivers',"The RAC has said new technology has made headlights brighter Drivers are being temporarily blinded by modern vehicle headlights, according to an RAC survey. Two-thirds of drivers say they are ""regularly dazzled"" by oncoming headlights even though they are dipped,the survey of 2,061 motorists suggests.,external And 67% of those said it can take up to five seconds for their sight to clear with a further 10% claiming the effect on their eyes lasts up to 10 seconds. The RAC said advances in headlight technology were causing the problem. About 15% of those drivers polled said they had nearly suffered a collision as a result of being dazzled by other drivers using full-beam headlights. RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said: ""The intensity and brightness of some new car headlights is clearly causing difficulty for other road users. ""Headlight technology has advanced considerably in recent years, but while that may be better for the drivers of those particular vehicles, it is presenting an unwanted, new road safety risk for anyone driving towards them or even trying to pull out at a junction."" All cars sold for road use in the UK have to be fitted with headlamps that conform to standards set by the EU in line with the UN's World Forum for Harmonization of Vehicle Regulations. AUN working party is currently looking at the issue,externalof headlight glare with its next meeting due to be held at the end of next month.

"Plaid pledges independence referendumIn a conference speech, Adam Price called Wales ""a wealthy country whose people live in poverty"".","This video can not be played Adam Price says a poll on Wales' constitutional future would be held after two terms of Plaid government An independence referendum, national air carrier and energy grid would be created under a Plaid Cymru government, the party has said. In a speech at the party's conference in Llangollen, Denbighshire, Adam Price outlined what two terms of a Plaid government would hope to achieve. Mr Price made several proposals for a ""vibrant, confident, successful nation"" to be achieved by 2030. He also called Wales ""a wealthy country whose people live in poverty"". Mr Price, AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said the party will ""tackle the myth"" Wales is a poor nation by claiming, in terms of per capita income, it is richer than ""every nation in Asia bar two, every nation in the Americas bar two, and richer than more than half of Europe"". Under the pledge, if elected, Plaid Cymru would establish a Wales national carrier with direct connections to the Americas and mainland Europe, create a national energy grid, set up a national housing company and provide free university education for Welsh students. A referendum on Wales' constitutional future would be held at the end of the second term of a Plaid government, which Mr Price said would ""ask this coming generation where they want Wales to be mid-century and will include independence as a realistic option"", he said.

The week Facebook's value plunged $58bn,"Mark Zuckerberg-founded Facebook shares fell on news of a historic data issue Facebook ended the week $58bn lower in value after its handling of a historic data breach. Its founder Mark Zuckerberg apologised for data breaches that affected 50 million users. The apology did not stop investors from selling shares in Facebook, with many wondering just how bad the damage would be for the social network. The breach was called a ""light bulb"" moment for users,spawning the social media trend #deletefacebook. All the negative headlines led to some advertisers saying ""enough is enough"". Shares in the social media company fell from $176.80 on Monday to around $159.30 by Friday night. Facebook's initial public offering in 2012 priced shares at $38 each, giving the company a market valuation of close to $104bn. Following steady user growth and a dominant space in the digital advertising market ensuring revenues, Facebook's share price climbed to $190 by February this year. Brian Wieser, senior analyst at Pivotal Research, said he had one of the most negative outlooks for Facebook's share price on Wall Street. ""I had a $152 price target on Facebook for 2018 - and that was before the events of this week"". Mr Wieser said the share price slump showed investors were wary of increased regulation and users leaving the platform ""but there's little risk of advertisers leaving Facebook. Where else would they go?"" Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf said the week had been a ""damaging episode"" in Facebook's history. ""One of the secrets of Facebook's success has been that the more people who use Facebook, the more integral it becomes to its customers. Unfortunately for Facebook, the same dynamic cuts in the opposite direction if it loses a meaningful number of users as a result of this scandal. "" Advertising firm M&C Saatchi's founding director David Kershaw said the revelations that a 2014 Facebook quiz essentially harvested data from users and their connected friends without consent have led to a backlash from advertisers. ""Clients have come to the point, quite rightly, where enough is enough, "" Mr Kershaw said. Advertisers Mozilla and Commerzbank on Wednesday suspended ads on the social media platform. On Friday tech entrepreneurElon Musk had the official Facebook pages for his companies Telsa and Space X deleted. ""Make no mistake Facebook is an amazing medium from the advertiser's point of view because of the accuracy of its targeting - which comes from data. But I think those large companies are very nervous to be associated with a medium where the data is being abused, particularly in a political context,"" Mr Kershaw said. Facebook has come under scrutiny for how it used to share user data Mr Kershaw told the BBC any change in Facebook's data protection policy was more likely to come from the threat of a withdrawal of ""hard money from advertisers rather than consumers running hashtag [campaigns] on Twitter,"" referring to the #DeleteFacebook and #BoycottFacebook hashtags that have become popular. UK advertising group ISBA met Facebook on Friday and said its ""constructive and challenging"" summit had convinced the group that the social media company was taking steps to ""rapidly address public and advertiser concerns"", including app audits and face-to-face meetings with individual UK advertising clients. It will take some time before it becomes clear if the advertising industry's dissatisfaction with Facebook leads to them actually pulling their money out of the social network, or whether the howls of condemnation amount to mere posturing from a group of concerned clients. The Facebook founder tried to reassure users ""the most important actions to prevent this from happening again today we have already taken years ago."" However, Passion Capital tech investor Eileen Burbidge, who is also on the Prime Minister's Business Advisory Group, said Facebook's reassurance to users and clients took too long. ""The fact that it took them five days to come out with a statement, which happened to be a fair, sensible and comprehensive statement, was just far too long,"" Mrs Burbidge said. ""I think they were just really tone deaf for too many days."" The technology venture capitalist said Facebook underestimated the consumer backlash that occurred once their data was used for political purposes. Facebook user data may have been used by political consultants in the 2016 US election Cambridge Analytica is at the centre of a row over whether it used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum. ""Some people are using the term 'political manipulation'. ""They [Facebook] assumed they had already taken care of this... as they had already changed their terms of service, for example,"" Mrs Burbidge said. In Mr Zuckerberg's online statement he offered a timeline of how Facebook's data permission agreements with users and other companies had changed since the 2014 personality quiz app was able to scrape data from quiz takers and their contacts without their express permission. Mrs Burbidge said there may need to be new regulation over political campaigning ""which really hasn't kept up with social media"". Technology writer Kate Bevan said the week's events have woken Facebook's users up to the fact that the platform's games, quizzes and apps could harvest their data for more serious intents. ""This week feels to me like a real light bulb moment where people are understanding that it's not just clicking 'like' on Facebook, it's giving your data away"". The sentiment was echoed by the European Union's commissioner for justice, consumers and gender equality Vera Jourova whosaid the Cambridge Analytica allegations had been ""a huge wake-up call"" for Facebook usersabout the demand for their data.

Plaid pledges independence referendum,"This video can not be played Adam Price says a poll on Wales' constitutional future would be held after two terms of Plaid government An independence referendum, national air carrier and energy grid would be created under a Plaid Cymru government, the party has said. In a speech at the party's conference in Llangollen, Denbighshire, Adam Price outlined what two terms of a Plaid government would hope to achieve. Mr Price made several proposals for a ""vibrant, confident, successful nation"" to be achieved by 2030. He also called Wales ""a wealthy country whose people live in poverty"". Mr Price, AM for Carmarthen East and Dinefwr, said the party will ""tackle the myth"" Wales is a poor nation by claiming, in terms of per capita income, it is richer than ""every nation in Asia bar two, every nation in the Americas bar two, and richer than more than half of Europe"". Under the pledge, if elected, Plaid Cymru would establish a Wales national carrier with direct connections to the Americas and mainland Europe, create a national energy grid, set up a national housing company and provide free university education for Welsh students. A referendum on Wales' constitutional future would be held at the end of the second term of a Plaid government, which Mr Price said would ""ask this coming generation where they want Wales to be mid-century and will include independence as a realistic option"", he said.

Lost wheelchair strands Gardner on plane,"Frank Gardner said Heathrow had a ""casual disregard"" for disabled passengers BBC journalist Frank Gardner has criticised Heathrow Airport for how it treats disabled passengers after being kept nearly two hours on a plane as staff said they had lost his wheelchair When he landed on Saturday morning on a flight, Gardner's wheelchair was taken to the terminal, rather than the plane door, leaving him stranded. He said: ""That is your legs gone. It is a basic human right."" A Heathrow spokesman apologised and said it would investigate. Gardner landed at the London airport after returning from a trip to Ethiopia to be told ground staff had ""lost"" his wheelchair. It took 100 minutes for staff to locate his chair and bring it to the plane, finally allowing him to disembark. Tweeting throughout the incident, he said he was ""utterly sick"" of it repeatedly happening when he lands at Heathrow. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""There are hundreds, possibly thousands of others who have this experience and all we get is these platitudes from Heathrow Airport, calling me by my first name and saying they have created a case number for you. ""Nothing changes, it goes on and on happening and it is just so frustrating."" He added: ""If you can't walk and your wheelchair has been taken away to the terminal, that is your legs gone, that is your mobility gone. ""It is a basic human right so I am pretty seething about it.""

Couple fight Hemsby insurance decision,"This video can not be played Hemsby cliff-top homes demolition captured in drone footage A couple say they will fight a decision by insurers not to pay out after their coastal home was ravaged by storms. Stephen and Carol Chadwick's cliff top house in Hemsby, Norfolk, was destroyed afterstrong winds tore away six metres of sand in two days. It is one of five ""dangerous"" properties being dismantled over the weekend by demolitions teams. Speaking from his home in Hertfordshire, Mr Chadwick described the week's events as ""like a death"". I thought I'd have a good 10 to 15 years here Clifftop homes remain precarious Hemsby homes demolition begins Three of the five houses on The Marrams have already been demolished, Great Yarmouth Borough Council confirmed. An aerial of the demolition work shows diggers on the beach and the clifftop working together Diggers arrived at the clifftop in Hemsby at 05:30 GMT on Saturday Mr Chadwick, who lives in Waltham Cross, bought the chalet in September as ""an escape"" after spending childhood summers in the area with his parents. He said he paid Â£162 upfront for insurance and that the policy had ""gone through"" without any problems. ""We got a phone call on Friday to say we weren't covered because of 'erosion' - but this was caused by the storms and winds. ""If it had been refused, or too high, I wouldn't have bought the place."" Carol and Stephen Chadwick said the last seven days have been ""surreal"", ""like a death"" A letter from the couple's insurance agents, Staffordshire-based Davies Group, said insurer Modus Underwriting will ""not pay for loss or damage caused by subsidence, heave or landslip"", or ""caused by river or coastal erosion"". ""It is well documented that the area in which your property is situated has been affected by coastal erosion,"" the letter reads. ""As such the pending damage to the property is inevitable rather than fortuitous."" The Chadwicks will return to the east coast on Monday to meet council officials, and have vowed to ""find the strength"" to fight the decision. Demolition teams dismantled one of the homes in an hour on Saturday morning A total of 13 properties, a mix of holiday chalets and permanent homes, had to be evacuated because the storm damage. Council spokesman David Wiles said: ""Building control surveyors and environmental services officers are constantly reviewing the situation with respect to the remaining eight properties, which are at significant risk of being lost through the further settlement of the cliffs. ""The council has been speaking to, and will continue to speak with, the homeowners to discuss the way forward."" It is understood the demolition team can only persist with the work during low tides, with diggers on the beach and the cliff top working together. It is the second time in five years that the area has beenseverely damaged by a storm surge.

Most wanted Briton arrested in Bulgaria,"Roy Lawrence Piechocki was arrested after being found in a rented flat in a block in Veliko Tarnovo, Bulgaria A British man wanted by police for seven years has been arrested in Bulgaria, authorities say. Roy Lawrence Piechocki, 56, has been wanted by Interpol since 2011 for 10 counts of sexually exploiting a minor in the United States. Piechocki, from Hillingdon in west London, was arrested after being found in a rented flat in a block in Veliko Tarnovo, police said. He is now being held in the local police detention centre. The Ministry of Interior said it was the result of a two-month investigation that was a joint effort between local police, the Bulgarian special cybercrime unit and the FBI. Piechocki had fake identity papers and had altered his appearance, police said. Bulgarian police also confiscated three computer devices, which they say contained pornographic images of young children.

Smith 'stood by principles' on Brexit,"This video can not be played Owen Smith says Labour ""needs to speak out strongly"" against the risks of Brexit Owen Smith says he ""stood by his principles"" in calling for another EU referendum - a move which resulted in his sacking from Labour's shadow cabinet. The former shadow Northern Ireland secretary said Jeremy Corbyn had made a ""mistake"" in firing him. He also said the party should ""shift its position"" on Brexit. Mr Smith was asked to stand down on Friday after he wrote an article for the Guardian calling for a second vote. Speaking about his sacking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""I think it is a mistake, for Jeremy Corbyn in particular, who has always understood the value of people standing by their principles. ""It is the position that he has often adopted, and it is certainly a value in him that others have extolled."" ""In truth I think that is all I have done. I have stood by my principles."" Labour frontbencher backs second EU vote EU adopts guidelines for next Brexit phase Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row Mr Smith said leaving the EU was ""the biggest economic crisis that our country will have faced for many, many generations"" and he believed Labour should stand against it. Referring to Mr Corbyn's views on Brexit as ""a more Eurosceptic position"", he added: ""It's the first instance that I can think of in living memory of a government pursuing a policy that they know is going to make our economy smaller and reduce people's livelihoods and life chances and I cannot understand why we in Labour would support that."" Party figures have criticised Mr Corbyn's decision to sack Mr Smith, with Labour peer Peter Hain describing the dismissal as a ""Stalinist purge"". The former Northern Ireland secretary said Mr Smith was widely respected for his work in the role. Labour MP Chuka Umunna said it was ""extraordinary"" that the shadow minister had been sacked for advocating a Brexit policy which, he said, had wide support in the party. Fellow MP Anna Turley said Mr Smith's departure was ""disappointing"" and he would be a loss to the front bench, while former cabinet minister Ben Bradshaw told Mr Smith he was ""very sorry"" to see him go. Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith went head to head in the 2016 Labour leadership contest By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent In a phone call from Jeremy Corbyn and what a source described as a ""civil conversation"", Owen Smith was told he was being sacked. Mr Smith's comments on Brexit policy were seemingly a step too far for the party leadership, who'd welcomed him back into the fold after his leadership challenge in 2016. The angry response from some MPs has again laid bare their opposition to Jeremy Corbyn as leader. But Mr Corbyn's grip on power in the party has never been stronger. The fact that he can make this move without fear of open rebellion, is a demonstration of that. However shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said although Mr Smith was ""a valued colleague"", he could not sit on the opposition front bench while advancing ""a position which was simply not Labour Party policy"". Ms Abbott, who in November told constituents she would push for a referendum on the final Brexit deal - before clarifying shewanted a Parliamentary vote- said Mr Smith would be able to ""make a contribution to the debate"" outside the shadow cabinet. BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said supporters of Mr Corbyn thought Mr Smith ""wasn't very collegiate"" and had defied collective responsibility. Mr Watt also reported that friends of Mr Smith complained that journalists knew about the sacking before Mr Corbyn phoned him - a claim disputed by the Labour leader's office. Mr Smith has been replaced by Rochdale MP and shadow housing minister Tony Lloyd. Mr Corbyn said that Mr Lloyd was ""highly experienced"" and ""committed to ensuring that peace in Northern Ireland is maintained"", as well as helping to steer the devolution deal ""back on track"". Tony Lloyd was previously shadow minister for housing, communities and local government In a tweet, Mr Smith said his concerns about Brexit, which he outlined in aGuardian,externalarticle, were shared by other supporters and members of the Labour party.

In the article, Mr Smith called for Labour to back membership of the EU single market. The Labour leader announced last month that the party wanted the UK to be a permanent member of a customs union with the EU after Brexit. But Mr Smith, who unsuccessfully challenged Mr Corbyn for the party leadership in 2016, insisted Labour needed to do more than ""just back a soft Brexit or guarantee a soft border in Ireland"". He wrote: ""If we insist on leaving the EU then there is realistically only one way to honour our obligations under the Good Friday Agreement and that is to remain members of both the customs union and the single market.""

Mount Etna is 'sliding towards the sea',"Etna is a big draw for scientists and tourists because of its constant fiery rumblings Europe's most active volcano, Mount Etna, is sliding towards the sea. Scientists have established that the whole structure on the Italian island of Sicily is edging in the direction of the Mediterranean at a rate of 14mm per year. The UK-led team says the situation will need careful monitoring because it may lead to increased hazards at Etna in the future. The group has published its findings in the Bulletin of Volcanology,external. ""I would say there is currently no cause for alarm, but it is something we need to keep an eye on, especially to see if there is an acceleration in this motion,"" lead author Dr John Murray told BBC News. Space project to monitor all volcanoes The Open University geologist has spent almost half a century studying Europe's premier volcano. In that time, he has placed a network of high-precision GPS stations around the mountain to monitor its behaviour. This instrumentation is sensitive to millimetric changes in the shape of the volcanic cone; and with 11 years of data it is now obvious, he says, that the mountain is moving in an east-south-east direction, on a general track towards the coastal town of Giarre, which is about 15km away. Essentially, Etna is sliding down a very gentle slope of 1-3 degrees. This is possible because it is sitting on an underlying platform of weak, pliable sediments. Dr Murray's team has conducted lab experiments to illustrate how this works. The group believes it is the first time that basement sliding of an entire active volcano has been directly observed. Mount Etna is close to the east coast of Sicily On the human scale, a movement of 14mm/yr - that is 1.4m over a hundred years - will seem very small, and it is. But geological investigations elsewhere in the world have shown that extinct volcanoes that display this kind of trend can suffer catastrophic failures on their leading flank as they drift downslope. Stresses can build up that lead eventually to devastating landslides. Dr Murray and colleagues stress such behaviour is very rare and can take many centuries, even thousands of years, to develop to a critical stage. Certainly, there is absolutely no evidence that this is about to happen at Etna. Local residents should not be alarmed, the Open University scientist said. ""The 14mm/yr is an average; it varies from year to year,"" he explained. ""The thing to watch I guess is if in 10 years' time the rate of movement has doubled - that would be a warning. If it's halved, I'd say there really is nothing to worry about."" Of more immediate concern is the confounding effect this sliding could have for the day-to-day assessment of the volcano. Scientists get hints that eruptive activity is about to occur when magma bulges upwards and deforms the shape of the mountain. To gain an unambiguous view of this inflation, researchers will need to subtract the general E-S-E motion.

Tributes paid for hostage-swap policemanFrance mourns an officer who died saving the lives of hostages held by an Islamist gunman.,"Lt Col Beltrame suffered fatal injuries after volunteering to trade places with a female hostage Tributes are pouring in for a French police officer who died saving the lives of hostages in a supermarket siege by an Islamist gunman on Friday. Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was shot and stabbed after he traded places with one of the captives following a shooting spree in southern France. Flags are being flown at half-mast at gendarmerie bases across France. His brother Cedric said Col Beltrame ""didn't have a chance"", adding that his actions were ""beyond the call of duty"". ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would,"" Col Beltrame's brother Cedric told a French radio station on Saturday. Speaking to the BBC, Col Beltrame's cousin Florence Nicolic described the officeras a person who was ""so good at his job"". ""Even though we were surprised and shocked when we heard what happened we were not surprised in the sense that that's the thing he would do without hesitation,"" Ms Nicolic said. The supermarket was sealed off by police as the siege unfolded French President Emmanuel Macron also paid tribute to the officer, saying that Col Beltrame ""fell as a hero"" after showing ""exceptional courage and selflessness"", adding that he deserved ""the respect and admiration of the whole nation"". UK PM Theresa May said the ""sacrifice and courage"" of the police officer would not be forgotten. His actions helped bring an end to the siege that left three people dead. The radical Islamist gunman, 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, was eventually shot and killed by police. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what Mr Macron called an act of ""Islamist terrorism"". Lakdim was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. Prosecutors are reportedly questioning two people in connection with the attacks, one of whom is thought to be the gunman's partner while the other is believed to be a friend. Col Beltrame was a highly-regarded member of the Gendarmerie Nationale and was described by France's president on Saturday as someone who ""fought until the end and never gave up"". He graduated in 1999 from France's leading military academy in Saint Cyr and in 2003 became one of just a handful of candidates chosen to join the gendarmerie's elite security response group GSIGN. He was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and was later awarded the Cross for Military Valour for his peacekeeping work. On his return to France, Col Beltrame joined the country's Republican Guard and was tasked with protecting the presidential palace. In 2017, he was named deputy chief of the Gendarmerie Nationale in the French region of Aude, home to the medieval town of Carcassonne, where Lakdim began his deadly shooting spree on Friday. As recently as December, Col Beltrame took part in a simulated terror attack on a local supermarket in the region. Col Beltrame becomes the seventh member of France's security forces to be killed in such attacks since 2012. The violence began on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where Lakdim hijacked a car. He killed a passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injured the driver. He then shot at a group of policemen who were out jogging, wounding one of them. This video can not be played Eye-witness says French hostage-taker ran after him Lakdim is then believed to have driven a short distance to the small town of TrÃ¨bes, where he stormed into the Super-U supermarket, shouting, ""I am a soldier of Daesh [Islamic State]!"" He killed two people - a customer and a store worker - before seizing others as hostages. Mr Collomb told reporters on Friday that police officers had managed to get some people out of the supermarket but the gunman had held one woman back as a human shield. It was at this point, he said, that Col Beltrame had volunteered to swap himself for her. As he did so, he left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so that police outside could monitor the situation. When police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed and Col Beltrame was mortally wounded. After the announcement of his death early on Saturday,France's Gendarmerie Nationale - a police force part of the military - honoured its fallen ""comrade"",external, saying Col Beltrame ""gave his life for the freedom of the hostages"". Lakdim, was born in April 1992 in Morocco and had French nationality. He was known to French intelligence services. Prosecutor Francois Molins said Lakdim had been on an extremist watch-list due to ""his radicalisation and his links with the Salafist movement"", a hardline offshoot of Sunni Islam. However, subsequent investigations by intelligence services had not turned up any signs he would act, he said. In 2011, Lakdim was found guilty of carrying a prohibited weapon and in 2015 he was convicted for drug use and refusing a court order, Mr Molins said. Earlier, Mr Collomb said that though Lakdim had been known to authorities as a petty criminal, they ""did not think he had been radicalised"". Lakdim lived in an apartment in Carcassonne with his parents and several sisters. A neighbour saw him taking one of his sisters to school on Friday morning. The family's apartment was raided by police on Friday afternoon.

Charges over boy's waterslide death,"The VerrÃ¼ckt waterslide includes a drop of almost 169ft (52m) A former executive at an amusement park in the US state of Kansas has been charged over the death of a 10-year-old boy killed on a waterslide in 2016, US media report. Tyler Miles, an ex-director of operations at the Schlitterbahn Water Park, was charged on several counts including involuntary manslaughter. The boy who died, Caleb Schwab, suffered head injuries when his raft went airborne and he struck a pole. Mr Miles pleaded not guilty on Friday. He was later released on bail, which had been set at $50,000 (Â£35,000), CBS News reports. It follows a 19-month investigation into the incident involving Caleb Schwab, the son of state politician Scott Schwab, which occurred on 8 August 2016 in a three-person raft on the VerrÃ¼ckt ride at the water park in Kansas City. The ride includes a drop of almost 169ft (52m) at 65mph (105km/h). According to the criminal indictment presented to the court,the slide had been examined by experts who found evidence indicating that other rafts had gone airborne,externaland collided with overhead poles and netting before the fatality, ABC News reported. The indictment added that examiners believed that the VerrÃ¼ckt ride ""violated nearly all aspects of the longstanding industry safety standards"". It alleges that those responsible for the ride's operation, including the Schlitterbahn company, attempted to conceal information from law enforcement. On Friday, Schlitterbahn said in a company statement that it was ""deeply disappointed"" that Mr Miles was being personally charged over the ""terrible accident"". ""Throughout his employment with us, our operations director, Tyler, demonstrated the highest dedication to safety, from the training of our lifeguards and ride operators, to ensuring all rides have operated in accordance with our strict protocols"" the statement reads. A spokeswoman for Schlitterbahn, Winter Prosapio, said: ""Our review of the facts and circumstances of the accident has never shown any evidence of criminal conduct on the part of anyone."" The company has said it plans to contest the allegations. Mr Miles is scheduled for trial on 10 September.

France lauds policeman 'who fell a hero',"Lt Col Beltrame suffered fatal injuries after volunteering to trade places with a female hostage Tributes are pouring in for a French police officer who died saving the lives of hostages in a supermarket siege by an Islamist gunman on Friday. Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was shot and stabbed after he traded places with one of the captives following a shooting spree in southern France. Flags are being flown at half-mast at gendarmerie bases across France. His brother Cedric said Col Beltrame ""didn't have a chance"", adding that his actions were ""beyond the call of duty"". ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would,"" Col Beltrame's brother Cedric told a French radio station on Saturday. Speaking to the BBC, Col Beltrame's cousin Florence Nicolic described the officeras a person who was ""so good at his job"". ""Even though we were surprised and shocked when we heard what happened we were not surprised in the sense that that's the thing he would do without hesitation,"" Ms Nicolic said. The supermarket was sealed off by police as the siege unfolded French President Emmanuel Macron also paid tribute to the officer, saying that Col Beltrame ""fell as a hero"" after showing ""exceptional courage and selflessness"", adding that he deserved ""the respect and admiration of the whole nation"". UK PM Theresa May said the ""sacrifice and courage"" of the police officer would not be forgotten. His actions helped bring an end to the siege that left three people dead.

Mass rallies on US gun control begin,"This video can not be played Emma Gonzalez demonstrated the power of silence during her speech Hundreds of thousands of protesters have taken to the streets across the US to call for tighter gun control. The March For Our Lives movement arose after 17 deaths in a school shooting in Parkland, Florida, last month. Student leader and Parkland survivor Emma Gonzalez gave a powerful speech at the main Washington DC event. After listing the names of the victims, she stayed silent on stage for six minutes, 20 seconds - the time it took for them to be killed. This video can not be played 'Our message to the world is...' More than 800 sister protests were planned nationwide and abroad, with solidarity events taking place in Edinburgh, London, Geneva, Sydney and Tokyo. As events began to draw to a close on the US east coast, they continued on the west, including a major demonstration in Los Angeles. As it happened: March For Our Lives In pictures: Marches across the US and worldwide Huge crowds - including a high proportion of young people and children - gathered along Pennsylvania Avenue, with placards reading ""Protect kids not guns"" and ""Am I next?"". Singers Ariana Grande, Miley Cyrus and Lin-Manuel Miranda, the man behind hit musical Hamilton, performed on a stage erected in front of the US Capitol building. Jennifer Hudson - who has lost her mother, brother and nephew to gun violence - sang Bob Dylan's The Times They Are a-Changin The music was interspersed with speeches from impassioned youth leaders. ""We will continue to fight for our dead friends,"" said speaker Delaney Tarr, a Parkland student. This video can not be played ""He pulls out a silver pistol and points it in my face"" - student Mya Middleton speaks of her chilling encounter with a gunman Some came from children who are just 11 years old, including Naomi Wadler, from Virginia, who spoke ""to represent African-American girls whose stories don't make the front page of every national newspaper"". The 11-year-old American with a rallying cry By Marianna Brady, BBC News, Washington The crowds started to gather in the early hours of the morning outside the US Capitol. Chants for ""no more NRA"" and ""no more guns"" erupt every few minutes at random. ""He was my soulmate,"" said Victoria Gonzalez, looking down at a sign of her boyfriend Joaquin Oliver. Valentine's Day - 14 February - started off as a great day for Victoria. ""Joaquin and I exchanged gifts in the morning and he walked me to class. I was so happy."" Later that day, she would learn that Joaquin was one of 17 people shot and killed at Marjory Stoneman Douglas school. ""It wasn't real,"" she said, standing in a crowd of several thousand ahead of the march. ""It's taken a while for it to sink in. I'm here today so no-one ever has to face this again. It gives me a lot of hope seeing how many people are out here supporting us. It feels like the whole entire world is on our side,"" Victoria said. Read on: 'It feels like the world is on our side' The 14 February massacre at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parklandwas one of a long line of school shootings in the US but the worst since Sandy Hook in 2012, when 26 people were killed. Campaigning by Parkland students gained widespread support, with Ms Gonzalez one of the most outspoken figures, gaining more than a million Twitter followers in a matter of weeks. A tearful Emma Gonzalez during her minutes of silence Survivors of other shootings have also joined the movement, alongside relatives of gun violence victims and anyone moved by their stories. The students staged a nationwide school walk-outearlier this month. They want to seize on public outrage to convince US politicians to take decisive action such as banning the sale of assault weapons. The teenagers taking on the US gun lobby On Thursday,16-year-old Jaelynn Willey died, after being shot in the head by a classmate in Maryland earlier in the week. A second student was injured in the attack. Although the turnout during Saturday's marches has been huge, the issue still divides Americans. The right to bear arms is protected under the second amendment of the US constitution and the National Rifle Association (NRA) gun lobby remains highly influential. Why I'm marching on Washington America's gun culture in 10 charts On Saturday afternoon, the White House released a statement praising the ""many courageous young Americans exercising their First Amendment rights today"". It outlined steps the government is taking to tackle gun violence: Banning bump stocks (devices which allow semi-automatic rifles to fire like machine-guns) Enacting the STOP School Violence Act, which seeks to improve school security Increasing training for students, staff and local law enforcement. Improving criminal background records so gun buyers are properly vetted before making a purchase Some protesters were disappointed that President Donald Trump, who is at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida for the weekend, did not personally tweet a message of support during the protests. What do young conservatives think? This video can not be played Sandy Hook survivors march with Parkland There were protests all across the nation, from New York and Los Angeles to Houston and Anchorage, Alaska. A demonstration was also held in Parkland, with relatives of the victims speaking to crowds. In Scotland, families affected by the 1996 school shooting in Dunblane helda solidarity gathering outside the US consulate in Edinburgh. In London, several hundred people - a mix of US immigrants and allies - also met at the new US embassy in Vauxhall.

The NRA sued the state, saying the law was unconstitutional Several major companies cut ties with the NRAamid a #BoycottNRA campaign, while chains like Walmart and Dick's Sporting Goodsannounced new restrictions on gun sales. Some 69% of Americans think gun laws should be tightened, according to a new poll by the Associated Press and the NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, up from 61% in October 2016.

Ex-spy asked Putin if he could returnA school friend says Sergei Skripal wanted to go home to see relatives and denied being a 'traitor'.7h7 hours agoUK,"This video can not be played Skripal 'regretted being double agent' Sergei Skripal wrote to President Putin asking to be allowed to return home, a friend of the former spy told the BBC. Vladimir Timoshkov said Mr Skripal denied he was ""a traitor"" and asked for ""complete forgiveness"". The Kremlin denies receiving such a letter. Mr Skripal was jailed in Russia in 2006, but was pardoned and freed four years later as part of a spy-swap - which saw him come to Britain. He and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33 were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Mr Skripal was ""shunned"" after being convicted of treason and his old classmates felt he had betrayed his country, said Mr Timoshkov - a school friend of Mr Skripal's. He told the BBC he had reconnected with Mr Skripal through his daughter Yulia after the conviction and in 2012 spoke to his old friend on the telephone for half an hour. According to Mr Timoshkov, Mr Skripal did not see himself as a ""traitor"" because the ""oath he had sworn was to his socialist Motherland, the Soviet Union, not Russia"". He regretted being ""a double agent"" because his life had become ""all messed up"", his friend claimed. He also asked to be allowed to return to Russia because he wanted to see his mother, brother and other relatives. The Kremlin denies receiving a letter from Mr Skripal. The UK's military research base, Porton Down, said a group of nerve agents known as Novichok were used in the poisoning of Mr Skripal and his daughter. The site's chief executive told the BBC there is ""no way"" any nerve agent held at Porton Down could be linked to the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter. Gary Aitkenhead said suggestions by Russia that the proximity of the labs to the incident in Salisbury might be somehow suspicious were ""frustrating"". He said the laboratory had the ""highest levels"" of controls and security. Inside Porton Down Russian spy: What we know so far EU recalls Russia ambassador in spy row Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Inupdated advice,external, Public Health England (PHE) said people who had been in the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury visited by the Skripals wearing clothing that can only be dry cleaned should arrange to have their items collected by the council. It said anyone in either venue between 13:30 GMT on Sunday 4 March and closure on Monday should arrange to have their clothes collected and they will be compensated. PHE's earlier advice had been to wash possessions as a precaution and double bag in plastic clothes that needed dry cleaning until further notice. Meanwhile,the 23 British diplomats ordered out of Russiain a tit-for-tat response to the UK's expulsion of 23 of its diplomats have arrived at RAF Brize Norton, the Foreign Office said. It comes as EU leaders promised further, coordinated action against Russia in response to the attack, endorsing a warning from Prime Minister Theresa May that the poisoning represented a challenge to shared European values. A charter flight from Moscow lands at RAF Brize Norton carrying the British diplomats and their families expelled from Moscow over the Salisbury nerve agent attack. The EU has recalled itsambassador to Russia, German Markus Ederer, ""for consultations"" after saying on Thursday it was ""highly likely"" Russia was behind the attack. Has the Russian row given UK diplomacy new focus? Moscow, which denies responsibility for the attack, has accused the European Union of following an ""anti-Russian campaign launched by London"".

France lauds policeman 'who fell a hero'A French police officer who swapped places with a hostage in a shop siege dies of his injuries.6m7 minutes agoEurope,"Lt Col Beltrame suffered fatal injuries after volunteering to trade places with a female hostage Tributes are pouring in for a French police officer who died saving the lives of hostages in a supermarket siege by an Islamist gunman on Friday. Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was shot and stabbed after he traded places with one of the captives following a shooting spree in southern France. Flags are being flown at half-mast at gendarmerie bases across France. His brother Cedric said Col Beltrame ""didn't have a chance"", adding that his actions were ""beyond the call of duty"". ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would,"" Col Beltrame's brother Cedric told a French radio station on Saturday. Speaking to the BBC, Col Beltrame's cousin Florence Nicolic described the officeras a person who was ""so good at his job"". ""Even though we were surprised and shocked when we heard what happened we were not surprised in the sense that that's the thing he would do without hesitation,"" Ms Nicolic said. The supermarket was sealed off by police as the siege unfolded French President Emmanuel Macron also paid tribute to the officer, saying that Col Beltrame ""fell as a hero"" after showing ""exceptional courage and selflessness"", adding that he deserved ""the respect and admiration of the whole nation"". UK PM Theresa May said the ""sacrifice and courage"" of the police officer would not be forgotten. His actions helped bring an end to the siege that left three people dead. The radical Islamist gunman, 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, was eventually shot and killed by police. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what Mr Macron called an act of ""Islamist terrorism"". Lakdim was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. Prosecutors are reportedly questioning two people in connection with the attacks, one of whom is thought to be the gunman's partner while the other is believed to be a friend. Col Beltrame was a highly-regarded member of the Gendarmerie Nationale and was described by France's president on Saturday as someone who ""fought until the end and never gave up"". He graduated in 1999 from France's leading military academy in Saint Cyr and in 2003 became one of just a handful of candidates chosen to join the gendarmerie's elite security response group GSIGN. He was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and was later awarded the Cross for Military Valour for his peacekeeping work. On his return to France, Col Beltrame joined the country's Republican Guard and was tasked with protecting the presidential palace. In 2017, he was named deputy chief of the Gendarmerie Nationale in the French region of Aude, home to the medieval town of Carcassonne, where Lakdim began his deadly shooting spree on Friday. As recently as December, Col Beltrame took part in a simulated terror attack on a local supermarket in the region. Col Beltrame becomes the seventh member of France's security forces to be killed in such attacks since 2012. The violence began on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where Lakdim hijacked a car. He killed a passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injured the driver. He then shot at a group of policemen who were out jogging, wounding one of them. This video can not be played Eye-witness says French hostage-taker ran after him Lakdim is then believed to have driven a short distance to the small town of TrÃ¨bes, where he stormed into the Super-U supermarket, shouting, ""I am a soldier of Daesh [Islamic State]!"" He killed two people - a customer and a store worker - before seizing others as hostages. Mr Collomb told reporters on Friday that police officers had managed to get some people out of the supermarket but the gunman had held one woman back as a human shield. It was at this point, he said, that Col Beltrame had volunteered to swap himself for her. As he did so, he left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so that police outside could monitor the situation. When police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed and Col Beltrame was mortally wounded. After the announcement of his death early on Saturday,France's Gendarmerie Nationale - a police force part of the military - honoured its fallen ""comrade"",external, saying Col Beltrame ""gave his life for the freedom of the hostages"". Lakdim, was born in April 1992 in Morocco and had French nationality. He was known to French intelligence services. Prosecutor Francois Molins said Lakdim had been on an extremist watch-list due to ""his radicalisation and his links with the Salafist movement"", a hardline offshoot of Sunni Islam. However, subsequent investigations by intelligence services had not turned up any signs he would act, he said. In 2011, Lakdim was found guilty of carrying a prohibited weapon and in 2015 he was convicted for drug use and refusing a court order, Mr Molins said. Earlier, Mr Collomb said that though Lakdim had been known to authorities as a petty criminal, they ""did not think he had been radicalised"". Lakdim lived in an apartment in Carcassonne with his parents and several sisters. A neighbour saw him taking one of his sisters to school on Friday morning. The family's apartment was raided by police on Friday afternoon.

Review: America's Cool Modernism âââââ,"A quick glance at the form-book of blockbuster exhibitions will tell you we like paintings with people in them. Rembrandt's portraits for example, or Da Vinci's Mona Lisa, or - currently - Picasso's depictions of his young lover at Tate Modern. They all get us going. True, we don't mind the odd landscape, but usually only when it reminds us of Nature's great power and beauty and our place in it. And yes, we'll happily tip up to a show of abstract art as long as it's packed with Matisse or Rothko-like emotion. Mostly, though, we like to look at ourselves. Which makes the Ashmolean Museum's decision to mount a major exhibition of inter-war American paintings - on the basis that they are aggressively unpopulated and as emotionally charged as a paving slab - appear quite bold. It's called America's Cool Modernism, but that's a misnomer. People-free zone: Illinois Central by George Josimovich The paintings you'll see by artists, many of whom you've probably not heard of - Ralston Crawford, Louis Lozowick, Samuel Margolies - are not cool. They're chillier than the Beast from the East. We see isolated grain silos and deserted cityscapes, uninhabited interiors and bleak factories. People? There are none. Humanity's imprint is there but we are missing. A surreal, macabre atmosphere hangs over this exhibition like the Great Depression. Think Giorgio de Chirico without the warmth and the wit. Fun, it is not. Which is not to say it isn't good. It is, on the whole. Edward Steichen's The Sunflower - nice cop? The first room is thoroughly enjoyable. It plays a sort of nice cop before you meet the miserable cop in the subsequent rooms. The first painting you see is of a joyful, colourful, Leger-inspired still-life by Edward Steichen called Le Tournesol (The Sunflower - 1920). Tonally, it is a world away from most of the other works in the show, but it does represent some of the main themes. The first was the breakaway the American painters wanted to make from the largely Paris-based European avant-garde after the First World War. They were trying to create a distinct visual language to reflect America's coming of age as a super-power, in the same way the Constructivists had done for the newly communist Russia. It wasn't easy. We see painting after painting owing everything to those all-pervasive early 20th Century European â¦isms: Cubism, Futurism, Fauvism and Orphism. Sound by EE Cummings (the poet) There's one by EE Cummings (yes, that one), which is his attempt to take on Delaunay and Kupka at their own game. Suffice it to say, becoming a poet was the right career choice for him. But there are others where you start to see an independent voice break out. A small abstract painting from 1919 by Georgia O'Keeffe, called Black Abstraction, combines European concerns for perspective with a uniquely American sensitivity to a high-rise urban life. Abstraction by Georgia O'Keeffe: An independent voice Next to it is a still-life by Helen Torr, called Purple and Green Leaves (1927). It's not the best painting in the world but she was clearly a painter who knew how to make an impactful image. I liked its allusion to a stained-glass window. She was one of several artists in the show whose work I didn't know at all - I was delighted to see it for the first time. Particularly Houses on a Barge (1929), a predominately dark brown painting made in an abstracted naive style. It is terrific: dark but wry, a Noah's Ark of homes, which foreshadows Louise Bourgeois's surrealist 1940-50s Manhattan images. The main gallery is packed with pictures of urban emptiness, many of which have been lent by the Metropolitan Museum in New York, the most famous being the colourful, Picasso-inspired I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold (1928) by Charles Demuth. I Saw the Figure 5 in Gold by Charles Demuth appears to be inspired by Picasso What a fine artist he was, as you will see from this well-known work that makes visibleWilliam Carlos Williams' poem The Great Figure,external. There are two other paintings by him nearby, both of which are worth spending some time looking at. The same does not apply to all the work in the show. An odd piece called Painting No 50 (1914-15) by Marsden Hartley in which he references a tepee, is one I wouldn't have included. But for every miss there are plenty of hits. Two small, simple pictures by Jacob Lawrence from his early 1940s Migration Series gives an all-too-brief African American perspective on this extraordinary period of American History. Their titles tell you all you need to know: The Migration Series, panel No 25 (""They left their homes. Soon some communities were left almost empty"") and The Migration Series, panel No 31 (""The migrants found improved housing when they arrived north""). Migration 31 is a simple picture by Jacob Lawrence There are pictures in this show you will remember forever. One of which is Charles Sheeler's vertiginous Americana (1931) in which you see a deserted sitting room with everything left just-so. It's eerie and disorientating, with its extreme perspective and clashing rug patterns combining to make a visual assault on your senses. By the time you arrive at the three paintings by Edward Hopper, with which the show ends, your mind has been re-set, making these works by one of the most famous American artists of the period jar a little. They feel overly fussy, more moody and emotional than what has gone before - added to which two of them contain human beings! And that, if anything, gives you a sense of this impressive, intelligent show. After all, it really takes something to make an Edward Hopper painting feel overly populated.

"30,000 lone parent families made homeless","This video can not be played Ed Thomas met parents in Oldham who struggle to buy food and basic necessities for their children Almost 30,000 single parent families were made homeless last year, up 8% on five years ago, according to new official figures. Housing charity Shelter saidgovernment figures,externalalso reveal that nearly three-quarters of homeless households in England are lone parent families. Shelter said lone parents were bearing the brunt of the housing crisis, by juggling part-time work and childcare. The government said it was investing Â£1.2bn in tackling homelessness. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""Of the thousands of families battling with the grim reality of homelessness, the vast majority are single parents."" Their limited incomes make it hard for them to contend with high private rents and welfare cuts, she added. Dalia Ben-Galim, policy director at charity Gingerbread, said more and more single parents were reaching out to the charity for advice and support when facing eviction and homelessness. ""The vast majority of single parents are working. ""But with a perfect storm of rising living costs, stagnating wages and changes to the benefit system eroding an essential safety net for families, single parents are hard hit and struggling to keep a roof above their children's heads."" She added that Universal Credit and the benefit cap must be reformed to reduce the disproportionate negative impact changes are having on single parents. The vast majority of families with children will be housed in temporary accommodation rather than being left to sleep rough. The statistics, published on Thursday, also show the number of households in temporary accommodation has risen by nearly two-thirds since 2010. On 31 December last year, 78,930 households were in temporary accommodation, up 64% since the start of the decade. The figure was also 4% higher than last year, when there were 75,740. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""Temporary accommodation is often cramped, unsuitable and sometimes even dangerous. ""It can have a devastating impact on people's lives and mental health, and it's no place for anyone to call home."" Homelessness minister Heather Wheeler said: ""Government is serious about reducing homelessness and rough sleeping - we're investing Â£1.2bn to 2020 to address the issue and next month sees the most ambitious legislation in decades to prevent homelessness come into force. ""These latest statistics show encouraging signs that our investment and targeted support for local authorities is having a positive impact.""

Clashes after Catalan leaders detained,"This video can not be played Police clashed with protesters in Barcelona Crowds of protesters in Spain's Catalonia region have clashed with police after the Supreme Court stepped up legal action against separatists. Spain's Supreme Court ruled 25 Catalan leaders should be tried for rebellion, embezzlement or disobeying the state. Convictions could result in up to 30 years in prison. More than 20 people were injured as police used riot batons to keep protesters away from federal buildings in Barcelona on Friday night. Demonstrations also took place in other parts of Catalonia. In Madrid, a Supreme Court judge ordered five more Catalan leaders to be detained without bail, pending trial over their involvement in October's banned independence referendum. One of those taken into custody was Jordi Turull who was to be the subject of a vote in the Catalan parliament on Saturday for regional president. Other separatist figures were already in custody or had gone into exile abroad. Friday night's rallies had been organised by a separatist group before the court decisions were announced. But the rulings appeared to inflame the protesters and angry crowds confronted lines of riot police protecting Spanish government buildings in Barcelona. They waved flags and chanted independence slogans while some burned pictures of the Supreme Court judge and of Spain's King Felipe. Tensions spilled over into violence as some protesters tried to break through police lines. Some protesters in Barcelona burned pictured of King Felipe A calmer rally took place in Catalonia Square, in the city centre. One protester there, Carme Sala, said: ""There are two million people who want to leave Spain and they can't put us all in prison."" Catalan TV showed rallies in support of the jailed leaders elsewhere in the region including in the cities of Vic and Tarragona. Friday's rulings at the Supreme Court in Madrid were considered the most serious challenge to date for the Catalan independence movement. Almost the entire leadership now faces a major legal fight.

Altogether 25 separatists have been charged variously with sedition, rebellion, embezzlement and other crimes. They deny the allegations. The five Catalan politicians remanded in custody on Friday were: Jordi Turull - former Catalan government spokesman and the latest candidate for regional president Josep Rull - former Catalan development minister Carme Forcadell - former Catalan parliament speaker Raul Romeva - former Catalan foreign affairs chief Dolors Bassa - former Catalan labour minister All five spent some time in detention following the banned referendum but were released on bail late last year pending investigations into their individual roles in the banned referendum. In his 70-page ruling, Supreme Court Judge Pablo Llarena said that they should be returned to jail as they represented a flight risk. He did not set a date for their trial. Politician Josep Rull said goodbye to family and friends before entering court on Friday The five join four other Catalan leaders already detained in prison. They include Oriol Junqueras, the former Catalan vice-president, andJordi SÃ¡nchez, who was nominated to lead the Catalan government but dropped the bidafter the Spanish authorities refused to release him to attend an investiture ceremony. Judge Llarena also issued an arrest warrant for Marta Rovira, the deputy head of the separatist Esquerra Republicana party, who failed to appear in court on Friday. It later emerged that she had fled into exile and Spanish media reported that she was in Switzerland. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Exile will be a difficult road, but it is the only way I have to recover my political voice. Long live a Catalan Republic for all!,"" she said in a letter published in the Spanish media. Judge Llarena also reactivated European arrests warrants for six others who are in self-imposed exile, including former Catalan President Carles Puigdemont who is in Belgium. The five Catalan leaders were driven from the court to prison The nationalist Catalan European Democratic Party (PDeCAT) condemned the court ruling and demanded the release of all those held in prison. Although the leadership vote for Mr Turull can no longer take place on Saturday, Catalan parliament speaker Roger Torrent said he would use the parliamentary session to read a statement in support of those in prison. Following the referendum, the central government in Madrid sacked the Catalan regional government, imposed direct rule and called new elections but pro-independence parties returned with a slim majority. In a setback for the pro-independence cause, a survey published by the respected Catalan Centre for Opinion Studies recently suggested support for independence had dropped sharply, with a majority of Catalans now against the idea.

Officers end Cambridge Analytica search,"ICO officials were seen searching the London headquarters of Cambridge Analytica The London offices of Cambridge Analytica have been searched by enforcement officers from the UK's information commissioner. The High Court granted the data watchdog a warrant amid claims the firm amassed information about millions of people without their consent, based on a 2014 quiz on Facebook. The seven-hour search finished in the early hours of Saturday. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. A group of people, some wearing ICO enforcement jackets, entered the building housing Cambridge Analytica's London headquarters at 20:00 GMT on Friday - less than an hour after a High Court judge granted the warrant. Several hours later members of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) were seen leaving the offices and a van - thought to be carrying gathered evidence - was driven away from the rear of the building. The ICO applied for the warrant to access the databases and servers of Cambridge Analytica. The search of the London building continued into the early hours of Saturday The search is part of a wider investigation into political campaigning. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham has said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in ""an unauthorised way"", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when it found out about the loss of the data. Cambridge Analytica's acting chief executive, Alexander Tayler, said the company has been in touch with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) since February 2017 and it remained committed to helping the investigation. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Elon Musk pulls brands from Facebook In astatement,external, he said checks in 2015 showed all the Facebook data had been deleted but the company was now undertaking an independent third-party audit to verify none remained. Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended on Tuesday after footage broadcast on Channel 4 appeared to show him suggesting tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online. This video can not be played Cambridge Analytica: What we know so far Claims over whether Cambridge Analytica used the personal data of millions of Facebook users to sway the outcome of the US 2016 presidential election and the UK Brexit referendum have also been raised. The company denies any of the data harvested in the 2014 Facebook quiz created by an academic was used in its work for Donald Trump's campaign. Meanwhile, thedirector of Vote Leave has denied allegations of linksbetween his campaign and Cambridge Analytica. Dominic Cummings said claims by the Observer newspaper are ""factually wrong, hopelessly confused, or nonsensical"". In a separate development, Brittany Kaiser, Cambridge Analytica's former business development director, hastold the Guardian the firm carried out data analysis for Leave.EU,external, the rival Brexit campaign to Vote Leave that was fronted by Nigel Farage.

"Modern headlights 'blinding drivers'Advancing technology may light up the road ahead but it dazzles other drivers, an RAC survey suggests.2h2 hours agoUK","The RAC has said new technology has made headlights brighter Drivers are being temporarily blinded by modern vehicle headlights, according to an RAC survey. Two-thirds of drivers say they are ""regularly dazzled"" by oncoming headlights even though they are dipped,the survey of 2,061 motorists suggests.,external And 67% of those said it can take up to five seconds for their sight to clear with a further 10% claiming the effect on their eyes lasts up to 10 seconds. The RAC said advances in headlight technology were causing the problem. About 15% of those drivers polled said they had nearly suffered a collision as a result of being dazzled by other drivers using full-beam headlights. RAC road safety spokesman Pete Williams said: ""The intensity and brightness of some new car headlights is clearly causing difficulty for other road users.

The captain,named by The Sun as Michel Castellucci,external, uploaded clips of his colleague interacting with animated characters generated by the messaging app. Footage appears to show the pair inside a cockpit next to a computer-generated woman and a dancing owl. Passenger safety was not compromised at any point, the airline said. The BBC has not been able to reach Mr Castellucci for comment, who appears to have deleted his social media accounts since reports about the Snapchat posts emerged. According to the paper, he filmed the videos ""at 30,000ft"" during a flight from Paris to Madrid. It said it had been contacted by passengers who had branded the stunt ""dangerous"" and ""irresponsible"". A spokeswoman for Luton-based EasyJet said it happened when the aircraft was not carrying out any manoeuvre and the flight operated safely. She said: ""Whilst at no point was the safety of the passengers compromised, this falls well short of the high standards EasyJet expects of its pilots.

Being an agent 'messed up' ex-spy's life,"This video can not be played Skripal 'regretted being double agent' Sergei Skripal wrote to President Putin asking to be allowed to return home, a friend of the former spy told the BBC. Vladimir Timoshkov said Mr Skripal denied he was ""a traitor"" and asked for ""complete forgiveness"". The Kremlin denies receiving such a letter. Mr Skripal was jailed in Russia in 2006, but was pardoned and freed four years later as part of a spy-swap - which saw him come to Britain. He and his daughter Yulia remain in a critical condition in hospital. Sergei Skripal, 66, and his daughter Yulia, 33 were poisoned by a nerve agent called Novichok Mr Skripal was ""shunned"" after being convicted of treason and his old classmates felt he had betrayed his country, said Mr Timoshkov - a school friend of Mr Skripal's. He told the BBC he had reconnected with Mr Skripal through his daughter Yulia after the conviction and in 2012 spoke to his old friend on the telephone for half an hour. According to Mr Timoshkov, Mr Skripal did not see himself as a ""traitor"" because the ""oath he had sworn was to his socialist Motherland, the Soviet Union, not Russia"". He regretted being ""a double agent"" because his life had become ""all messed up"", his friend claimed. He also asked to be allowed to return to Russia because he wanted to see his mother, brother and other relatives. The Kremlin denies receiving a letter from Mr Skripal. The UK's military research base, Porton Down, said a group of nerve agents known as Novichok were used in the poisoning of Mr Skripal and his daughter. The site's chief executive told the BBC there is ""no way"" any nerve agent held at Porton Down could be linked to the poisoning of a Russian ex-spy and his daughter. Gary Aitkenhead said suggestions by Russia that the proximity of the labs to the incident in Salisbury might be somehow suspicious were ""frustrating"". He said the laboratory had the ""highest levels"" of controls and security. Inside Porton Down Russian spy: What we know so far EU recalls Russia ambassador in spy row Who controls the world's most toxic chemicals? Inupdated advice,external, Public Health England (PHE) said people who had been in the Mill pub and Zizzi restaurant in Salisbury visited by the Skripals wearing clothing that can only be dry cleaned should arrange to have their items collected by the council. It said anyone in either venue between 13:30 GMT on Sunday 4 March and closure on Monday should arrange to have their clothes collected and they will be compensated. PHE's earlier advice had been to wash possessions as a precaution and double bag in plastic clothes that needed dry cleaning until further notice. Meanwhile,the 23 British diplomats ordered out of Russiain a tit-for-tat response to the UK's expulsion of 23 of its diplomats have arrived at RAF Brize Norton, the Foreign Office said.

French police 'hero' dies of wounds,"Lt Col Beltrame suffered fatal injuries after volunteering to trade places with a female hostage Tributes are pouring in for a French police officer who died saving the lives of hostages in a supermarket siege by an Islamist gunman on Friday. Lt Col Arnaud Beltrame, 44, was shot and stabbed after he traded places with one of the captives following a shooting spree in southern France. Flags are being flown at half-mast at gendarmerie bases across France. His brother Cedric said Col Beltrame ""didn't have a chance"", adding that his actions were ""beyond the call of duty"". ""He gave his life for strangers. He must have known that he didn't really have a chance. If that doesn't make him a hero, I don't know what would,"" Col Beltrame's brother Cedric told a French radio station on Saturday. Speaking to the BBC, Col Beltrame's cousin Florence Nicolic described the officeras a person who was ""so good at his job"". ""Even though we were surprised and shocked when we heard what happened we were not surprised in the sense that that's the thing he would do without hesitation,"" Ms Nicolic said. The supermarket was sealed off by police as the siege unfolded French President Emmanuel Macron also paid tribute to the officer, saying that Col Beltrame ""fell as a hero"" after showing ""exceptional courage and selflessness"", adding that he deserved ""the respect and admiration of the whole nation"". UK PM Theresa May said the ""sacrifice and courage"" of the police officer would not be forgotten. His actions helped bring an end to the siege that left three people dead. The radical Islamist gunman, 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim, was eventually shot and killed by police. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what Mr Macron called an act of ""Islamist terrorism"". Lakdim was said to have demanded the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. Prosecutors are reportedly questioning two people in connection with the attacks, one of whom is thought to be the gunman's partner while the other is believed to be a friend. Col Beltrame was a highly-regarded member of the Gendarmerie Nationale and was described by France's president on Saturday as someone who ""fought until the end and never gave up"". He graduated in 1999 from France's leading military academy in Saint Cyr and in 2003 became one of just a handful of candidates chosen to join the gendarmerie's elite security response group GSIGN. He was deployed to Iraq in 2005 and was later awarded the Cross for Military Valour for his peacekeeping work. On his return to France, Col Beltrame joined the country's Republican Guard and was tasked with protecting the presidential palace. In 2017, he was named deputy chief of the Gendarmerie Nationale in the French region of Aude, home to the medieval town of Carcassonne, where Lakdim began his deadly shooting spree on Friday. As recently as December, Col Beltrame took part in a simulated terror attack on a local supermarket in the region. Col Beltrame becomes the seventh member of France's security forces to be killed in such attacks since 2012. The violence began on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where Lakdim hijacked a car. He killed a passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injured the driver. He then shot at a group of policemen who were out jogging, wounding one of them. This video can not be played Eye-witness says French hostage-taker ran after him Lakdim is then believed to have driven a short distance to the small town of TrÃ¨bes, where he stormed into the Super-U supermarket, shouting, ""I am a soldier of Daesh [Islamic State]!"" He killed two people - a customer and a store worker - before seizing others as hostages. Mr Collomb told reporters on Friday that police officers had managed to get some people out of the supermarket but the gunman had held one woman back as a human shield. It was at this point, he said, that Col Beltrame had volunteered to swap himself for her. As he did so, he left his mobile phone on a table with an open line so that police outside could monitor the situation. When police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed and Col Beltrame was mortally wounded. After the announcement of his death early on Saturday,France's Gendarmerie Nationale - a police force part of the military - honoured its fallen ""comrade"",external, saying Col Beltrame ""gave his life for the freedom of the hostages"". Lakdim, was born in April 1992 in Morocco and had French nationality. He was known to French intelligence services. Prosecutor Francois Molins said Lakdim had been on an extremist watch-list due to ""his radicalisation and his links with the Salafist movement"", a hardline offshoot of Sunni Islam. However, subsequent investigations by intelligence services had not turned up any signs he would act, he said. In 2011, Lakdim was found guilty of carrying a prohibited weapon and in 2015 he was convicted for drug use and refusing a court order, Mr Molins said. Earlier, Mr Collomb said that though Lakdim had been known to authorities as a petty criminal, they ""did not think he had been radicalised"". Lakdim lived in an apartment in Carcassonne with his parents and several sisters. A neighbour saw him taking one of his sisters to school on Friday morning. The family's apartment was raided by police on Friday afternoon.

France approves tough new anti-terror laws,"The state of emergency has been in place since November 2015 France's lower house of parliament has approved a new anti-terrorism law intended to bring an end to a nearly two-year-long state of emergency. The law will incorporate several measures first authorised under the emergency arrangement. They include easier searches of homes and confining individuals to their home towns, without judicial approval. Most people in France approve of the move, but it has been criticised by rights groups. A state of emergency was first introduced after the attacks of 13 November 2015, when militants from so-called Islamic State (IS) killed 130 people in gun and bomb attacks in Paris. It has since been extended six times, but there was a consensus that to continue with the state of emergency indefinitely would be undemocratic, the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports from Paris. How France is wrestling with jihadist terror Does military intervention increase the terror threat? The bill was approved by by 415 votes to 127, with 19 abstentions, and is expected to become law before the latest state of emergency extension expires on 1 November. Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb told parliament on Tuesday that the threat level was still ""very serious"", saying: ""We're still in a state of war."" The new law will allow members of the government - rather than judges - to approve the confinement of individuals to their home towns, requiring them to report to police once a day. The authorities will be allowed to mount security perimeters around places deemed at risk - such as railway stations and airports - within which people and vehicles can be searched. Mosques or other places of worship can be shut down if preachers there are found to be promoting radical ideology. A recent poll by the conservative Le Figaro newspaper found that 57% of French people were in favour of enshrining the measures in law. But BÃ©nÃ©dicte Jeannerod, France's director for Human Rights Watch, said France had been progressively ""weakening"" judicial oversight in its counter-terrorism efforts, and ""the normalisation of emergency powers crosses a new line"".

Jeremy Corbyn sacks Labour frontbencher,"Shadow NI secretary Owen Smith said Labour needed to do more than just back a ""soft Brexit"" Jeremy Corbyn has sacked a shadow cabinet minister who broke ranks with official Labour Party policy to call for another EU referendum. Owen Smith was asked to stand down as shadow Northern Ireland secretary by the Labour leader, afterdemanding a second voteafter EU talks have ended. He has been replaced by Rochdale MP and shadow housing minister Tony Lloyd. Mr Smith said he would continue to ""speak up"" for what he called his ""long-held views"" on Brexit. He said in a tweet that his concerns about Brexit, which he outlined in aGuardian,externalarticle, were shared by other supporters and members of the Labour party. Allow Twitter content?

Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said Mr Smith could not sit on Labour's frontbench while advancing a position against party policy. Ms Abbott, who in November told constituents she would push for a referendum on the final Brexit deal - before clarifying shewanted a Parliamentary vote- said Mr Smith would be able to ""make a contribution to the debate"" outside the shadow cabinet. Jeremy Corbyn and Owen Smith went head to head in the 2016 Labour leadership contest By Jonathan Blake, BBC political correspondent In a phone call from Jeremy Corbyn and what a source described as a ""civil conversation"", Owen Smith was told he was being sacked. Mr Smith's comments on Brexit policy were seemingly a step too far for the party leadership, who'd welcomed him back into the fold after his leadership challenge in 2016. The angry response from some MPs has again laid bare their opposition to Jeremy Corbyn as leader. But Mr Corbyn's grip on power in the party has never been stronger. The fact that he can make this move without fear of open rebellion, is a demonstration of that. Labour peer Lord Hain, a former Northern Ireland secretary, called the sacking a ""Stalinist purge"" - and said Mr Smith was widely respected for his work on Northern Ireland. Labour MP Chuka Umunna said it was ""extraordinary"" that Mr Smith had been sacked for advocating a Brexit policy which he said had wide support in the party.

Labour figures criticise Smith sacking,"This video can not be played Owen Smith says Labour ""needs to speak out strongly"" against the risks of Brexit Owen Smith says he ""stood by his principles"" in calling for another EU referendum - a move which resulted in his sacking from Labour's shadow cabinet. The former shadow Northern Ireland secretary said Jeremy Corbyn had made a ""mistake"" in firing him. He also said the party should ""shift its position"" on Brexit. Mr Smith was asked to stand down on Friday after he wrote an article for the Guardian calling for a second vote. Speaking about his sacking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""I think it is a mistake, for Jeremy Corbyn in particular, who has always understood the value of people standing by their principles. ""It is the position that he has often adopted, and it is certainly a value in him that others have extolled."" ""In truth I think that is all I have done. I have stood by my principles."" Labour frontbencher backs second EU vote EU adopts guidelines for next Brexit phase Corbyn 'regret' over anti-Semitic mural row Mr Smith said leaving the EU was ""the biggest economic crisis that our country will have faced for many, many generations"" and he believed Labour should stand against it. Referring to Mr Corbyn's views on Brexit as ""a more Eurosceptic position"", he added: ""It's the first instance that I can think of in living memory of a government pursuing a policy that they know is going to make our economy smaller and reduce people's livelihoods and life chances and I cannot understand why we in Labour would support that.""

French hostage swap officer fights for life,"Lt-Col Beltrame took the place of a woman being used as a human shield by gunman Redouane Lakdim A police officer who swapped himself for a hostage in a supermarket siege is fighting for his life in hospital, French President Emmanuel Macron says. The gendarme, whom media named as Lt-Col Arnaud Beltrame, helped bring an end to a gunman's shooting spree that killed three in southern France. The gunman - 25-year-old Redouane Lakdim - said he had been acting on behalf of the Islamic State group. He was shot dead by French police after mounting three separate attacks. Sixteen people were injured, two seriously, in what Mr Macron called an act of ""Islamist terrorism"". Lakdim is said to have been demanding the release of Salah Abdeslam, the most important surviving suspect in the 13 November 2015 attacks in Paris, which killed 130 people. One person - believed to be Lakdim's partner - has been arrested in connection with the shootings. Five things about Paris attacks suspect Salah Abdeslam The violence began on Friday morning in Carcassonne, where Lakdim hijacked a car, killing one passenger - whose body was later found hidden in a bush - and injuring the driver.

He killed two people - a customer and store employee - before seizing others as hostages. Carole, who was shopping at the supermarket, said people hid in a cold room. ""A man shouted and fired several times,"" she told France info radio. ""I saw a cold room door, I asked people to come and take shelter."" ""There were 10 of us, and we stayed an hour. There were more gunshots and we went out the emergency back door."" Interior Minister GÃ©rard Collomb told reporters that police officers had managed to get some people out but the gunman had held one woman back as a human shield. It was at this point, he said, that the 45-year-old gendarme officer had volunteered to swap himself for her, leaving his mobile phone on a table with an open line so police could monitor the situation. When police heard gunshots, a tactical team stormed the supermarket. The gunman was killed but Arnaud Beltrame was seriously injured. Mr Collomb hailed the ""heroism and courage"" of Lt-Col Beltrame.

But subsequent investigations by intelligence services had not turned up any signs he would act, he said.

Cambridge Analytica faces lengthy search,"ICO officials were seen searching the London headquarters of Cambridge Analytica The London offices of Cambridge Analytica have been searched by enforcement officers from the UK's information commissioner. The High Court granted the data watchdog a warrant amid claims the firm amassed information about millions of people without their consent, based on a 2014 quiz on Facebook. The seven-hour search finished in the early hours of Saturday. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. A group of people, some wearing ICO enforcement jackets, entered the building housing Cambridge Analytica's London headquarters at 20:00 GMT on Friday - less than an hour after a High Court judge granted the warrant. Several hours later members of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) were seen leaving the offices and a van - thought to be carrying gathered evidence - was driven away from the rear of the building. The ICO applied for the warrant to access the databases and servers of Cambridge Analytica. The search of the London building continued into the early hours of Saturday The search is part of a wider investigation into political campaigning. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham has said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in ""an unauthorised way"", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when it found out about the loss of the data.

"Lone parents: 30,000 families made homelessCharity Shelter said single parents were bearing the brunt of the housing crisis.3h3 hours agoFamily & Education","This video can not be played Ed Thomas met parents in Oldham who struggle to buy food and basic necessities for their children Almost 30,000 single parent families were made homeless last year, up 8% on five years ago, according to new official figures. Housing charity Shelter saidgovernment figures,externalalso reveal that nearly three-quarters of homeless households in England are lone parent families. Shelter said lone parents were bearing the brunt of the housing crisis, by juggling part-time work and childcare. The government said it was investing Â£1.2bn in tackling homelessness. Polly Neate, chief executive of Shelter, said: ""Of the thousands of families battling with the grim reality of homelessness, the vast majority are single parents."" Their limited incomes make it hard for them to contend with high private rents and welfare cuts, she added. Dalia Ben-Galim, policy director at charity Gingerbread, said more and more single parents were reaching out to the charity for advice and support when facing eviction and homelessness. ""The vast majority of single parents are working. ""But with a perfect storm of rising living costs, stagnating wages and changes to the benefit system eroding an essential safety net for families, single parents are hard hit and struggling to keep a roof above their children's heads."" She added that Universal Credit and the benefit cap must be reformed to reduce the disproportionate negative impact changes are having on single parents. The vast majority of families with children will be housed in temporary accommodation rather than being left to sleep rough. The statistics, published on Thursday, also show the number of households in temporary accommodation has risen by nearly two-thirds since 2010. On 31 December last year, 78,930 households were in temporary accommodation, up 64% since the start of the decade. The figure was also 4% higher than last year, when there were 75,740. Jon Sparkes, chief executive of homeless charity Crisis, said: ""Temporary accommodation is often cramped, unsuitable and sometimes even dangerous. ""It can have a devastating impact on people's lives and mental health, and it's no place for anyone to call home."" Homelessness minister Heather Wheeler said: ""Government is serious about reducing homelessness and rough sleeping - we're investing Â£1.2bn to 2020 to address the issue and next month sees the most ambitious legislation in decades to prevent homelessness come into force. ""These latest statistics show encouraging signs that our investment and targeted support for local authorities is having a positive impact.""

England TB rates fall by third since 2012But England still has one of the highest rates of the disease in Western Europe.3h3 hours agoHealth,"New figures show rates of tuberculosis (TB) in England have declined by a third in six years, and are currently at their lowest level in 35 years. The data from Public Health England shows a 38% fall since 2012, with a 9.3% decline in cases in 2017 alone. Improved diagnosis, treatment and awareness are being credited for the fall. But England still has one of the highest rates of TB in Western Europe with just under 5,200 affected in 2017. And TB is still one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The data has been released to coincide with World TB Day on 24 March. The World Health Organization's campaign Light up the World for TB will see buildings and landmarks across the world lit up in red across the weekend 23-25 March. It's hoped it will highlight the continued focus that is required to meet the ultimate ambition of making England TB-free. The BCG vaccine offers protection against TB Dr Sarah Anderson, head of the National TB Office at Public Health England, said: ""People often think that TB is a Victorian disease that is no longer a problem in England, but in fact it still affects over 5,000 people a year and there is still a lot to do until the target to eliminate TB is met. ""We urge everyone to join the fight to confine TB to history. World TB Day is an opportunity for people everywhere to be informed about TB, educate others and urge governments to take action. This global movement will make a powerful statement and show solidarity for people who have been affected by TB."" TB is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person It mainly affects the lungs, but it can affect any part of the body, including the tummy (abdomen) glands, bones and nervous system The most common symptoms of TB are a persistent cough for more than three weeks, unexplained weight loss, fever and night sweats. TB is difficult to catch and you need to spend many hours in close contact with a person with infectious TB to be at risk of infection TB can be fatal if left untreated - but can be cured if it's treated with the right antibiotics over a course of six months The BCG vaccine offers protection against TB, and is recommended for babies, children and adults under the age of 35 who are at risk of catching TB At-risk groups include: children living in areas with high rates of TB and people with close family members from countries with high TB rates The most recent data on infection rates show parts of London still have higher rates of TB than some developing countries, such as Iraq, Libya and even Yemen. London is known as the TB capital of Western Europe and has seen initiatives such as a mobile clinic taking to the capital's streets to test vulnerable people, such as the homeless. Free testing and treatment of latent TB is available in England for people from areas where TB is common. Last yearresearchers in Oxford and Birmingham reportedthey had made a world-first breakthrough in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. They managed to isolate different strains of the disease using a process called genome sequencing. It means patients who may have waited months to get the right drugs can now be diagnosed in only a few days - so they have a greater chance of recovery. While figures have gone down over the last six years in England, another issue in the battle to eradicate TB is drug resistance. A recent study found one in five global cases of the disease is now resistant to at least one major treatment drug.

"Mount Etna is 'sliding towards the sea'Measurements show the entire bulk of Europe's most active volcano is edging eastwards, Scientists say.8m8 minutes agoScience & Environment","Etna is a big draw for scientists and tourists because of its constant fiery rumblings Europe's most active volcano, Mount Etna, is sliding towards the sea. Scientists have established that the whole structure on the Italian island of Sicily is edging in the direction of the Mediterranean at a rate of 14mm per year. The UK-led team says the situation will need careful monitoring because it may lead to increased hazards at Etna in the future. The group has published its findings in the Bulletin of Volcanology,external. ""I would say there is currently no cause for alarm, but it is something we need to keep an eye on, especially to see if there is an acceleration in this motion,"" lead author Dr John Murray told BBC News. Space project to monitor all volcanoes The Open University geologist has spent almost half a century studying Europe's premier volcano. In that time, he has placed a network of high-precision GPS stations around the mountain to monitor its behaviour. This instrumentation is sensitive to millimetric changes in the shape of the volcanic cone; and with 11 years of data it is now obvious, he says, that the mountain is moving in an east-south-east direction, on a general track towards the coastal town of Giarre, which is about 15km away. Essentially, Etna is sliding down a very gentle slope of 1-3 degrees. This is possible because it is sitting on an underlying platform of weak, pliable sediments. Dr Murray's team has conducted lab experiments to illustrate how this works. The group believes it is the first time that basement sliding of an entire active volcano has been directly observed. Mount Etna is close to the east coast of Sicily On the human scale, a movement of 14mm/yr - that is 1.4m over a hundred years - will seem very small, and it is. But geological investigations elsewhere in the world have shown that extinct volcanoes that display this kind of trend can suffer catastrophic failures on their leading flank as they drift downslope. Stresses can build up that lead eventually to devastating landslides. Dr Murray and colleagues stress such behaviour is very rare and can take many centuries, even thousands of years, to develop to a critical stage. Certainly, there is absolutely no evidence that this is about to happen at Etna. Local residents should not be alarmed, the Open University scientist said. ""The 14mm/yr is an average; it varies from year to year,"" he explained. ""The thing to watch I guess is if in 10 years' time the rate of movement has doubled - that would be a warning. If it's halved, I'd say there really is nothing to worry about."" Of more immediate concern is the confounding effect this sliding could have for the day-to-day assessment of the volcano. Scientists get hints that eruptive activity is about to occur when magma bulges upwards and deforms the shape of the mountain. To gain an unambiguous view of this inflation, researchers will need to subtract the general E-S-E motion.

"Trump signs budget vowing: 'Never again'The president is accused of making a ""loser's bluff"" after dropping a threat to veto the bill.7h7 hours agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played Trump signs package to fund US government US President Donald Trump has signed a $1.3tn (Â£921bn) package to fund the government for six months, while vowing never to approve such a bill again. Hours earlier, the president threatened to veto the bill over its lack of full funding for his border wall. Congress passed the measure to avert what would have been the third shutdown of the US government this year. But many of the president's fellow Republicans railed against the measure, one calling it ""monstrous"". The spending bill needed Mr Trump's signature by a Friday midnight deadline to keep federal agencies operating until 30 September. The president suggested in a Friday morning tweet that he might reject the 2,000-page package. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But in an afternoon news conference he said that despite the ""ridiculous"" process of passing the measure he would sign it because of its large increase in military spending. ""There's a lot of things that I'm unhappy about in this bill,"" he said, even though it was cleared by a Congress controlled by his own party. He added: ""I will never sign another bill like this again... nobody read it."" Mr Trump also told reporters: ""I looked very seriously at the veto, but because of the incredible gains we've been able to make for the military, that over-rode any of our thinking.""

The bill does not address the fate of roughly 700,000 young immigrants known as ""Dreamers"" who illegally entered the US as children. They were enrolled in the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, but President Trump ended it in September. Republicans and Democrats were unable to agree over the issue. The White House and Republicans had reportedly offered Democrats a Daca extension of up to three years in return for full funding of Mr Trump's wall. This video can not be played Daca recipients: 'Life in the US is like a rollercoaster' Democrats were said to have countered they would accept that only if a path to citizenship was guaranteed for all 1.8 million people eligible for Daca. In Friday's news conference, Mr Trump said: ""I do want the Hispanic community to know that Republicans are much more on your side than the Democrats who are using you for this purpose. ""The Democrats did not want Daca in this bill."" President Trump said he was ""not happy"" with the amount allocated to construct his planned wall on the US-Mexico border. ""But it does start the wall and we will make that $1.6bn go very far,"" he said on Friday. It was far short of the $25bn the White House had sought - and there are strings attached to the funding Congress has approved. Six things that could topple Trump's border wall Most of it can only be used to repair stretches of the 1,900 mile (3,100km) border where there already is a wall, according to the Washington Post. Under the bill, just 33 miles of new barriers can be built and only using ""bollard"" fencing or levees, not the concrete prototypes Mr Trump has viewed in photo ops, reports the newspaper. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi appeared to taunt Republicans over funding for a wall, which her party firmly opposes. ""If you want to think you're getting a wall, just think it and sign the bill,"" she said to Mr Trump's congressional supporters. What is Dreamer debate all about? This video can not be played Trump: 'These are, like, professional mountain climbers' Analysis:Anthony Zurcher- BBCWashington Donald Trump stepped up to the podium on Friday and had to walk a fine line. He had threatened to veto the omnibus spending bill, but now he was going to sign it. He thought it was an awful bill, but it had some good parts. He said it spent way too much money, but then went through all the billions of taxpayer dollars it allocated to things he liked. Ships! Planes! Nuclear missiles! Opioid treatment! Border security! It at times sounded like he was checking his way through an extremely high-priced shopping list. The president warned that he would never sign a bill like this again - and that could be unintentionally true. If Democrats do well in November's midterm election, the next spending bill Congress turns out could look very different than the one produced by this Republican-controlled House and Senate. The bottom line is Trump took the stage and essentially admitted he had been outmaneuvered - by Democrats and some members of his own party. He was elected to change the system, but he had to acknowledge that ""that's the way right now the system works."" That had to be a tough thing to say. Several people panned Mr Trump's empty veto threat. Democratic congressman Mark Pocan accused the president of a ""loser's bluff"". ""Go ahead and veto the omnibus over Daca. We dare you,"" Mr Pocan said on Twitter. ""Everyone knows you're the reason Daca recipients are abandoned."" But despite cross-party support, at least 90 conservative Republicans voted against the bill, calling it government spending run amok. Allow Twitter content?

"Why was I left on a hillside to die?The woman behind a post-genocide rock revivalVideoVideoWhat it's like to hear voicesThe community of 2,000 people with 151 cases of sex crime","In the summer of 1937 a nine-month-old girl was hidden, with her hands tied, in a blackberry bush in southern England. She was found by sheer chance by a family of holidaymakers. Now 80, Anthea Ring has spent most of her life wondering why she was left to die and who her parents were. Thanks to a leap forward in genetic genealogy she finally has some answers. Jane Dodd was tired. The 11-year-old was walking over the South Downs with her family on a bright August day. Ahead were her parents Arthur and Margaret and her older sister Elizabeth. Every year they travelled from south London for a fortnight's holiday in Worthing. Her father would insist on an invigorating walk in the afternoons. It was still hot, even at 6pm. There was no shade up here, just grassland, gorse and blackberry bushes. Suddenly her mother stopped. ""There's a baby up here,"" she said. Her father turned around. ""Of course there isn't, there's no-one up here,"" he said. ""I haven't had five children and not know what a baby sounds like,"" her mother replied. The family started searching through the scrubland. Minutes later they found a blonde child hidden deep in a blackberry bush. She was wearing a pink dress and looked about one year old. She had scratches and insect bites. Her hands were tied tightly in front of her. The Dodd family on a trip to Worthing, around the time they found the baby girl Nine years later, Anthea Ring was playing with her friend, Peter, on the road outside her Surrey home.  But an argument began and she threatened to go and complain to her mother. ""She's not your mother, you're adopted,"" he replied. Shocked, Anthea ran home and that evening her parents sat her down for a talk. ""They told me I was left on the doorstep of Worthing Hospital when I was a newborn baby,"" Anthea says. ""They had lost a daughter, Veronica, three years before, and decided to adopt me."" Anthea was very excited by the news. Adopted children were usually the heroines in books she devoured about Swiss chalet schools. ""I remember thinking I could tell my friends at school the next day,"" she says. ""It didn't cross my mind to think about who my birth parents were. I was obviously so secure."" She was doted on by her parents, sleeping in a warm back bedroom in winter and a cool front bedroom in summer. Her adoptive father, Douglas Shannan, worked for the Ministry of Food and Anthea remembers going on trips with him to inspect egg-grading stations. ""He was a very kind man, I loved going out with him,"" she says. Anthea found out she was adopted from a friend on her street She describes her mother Margaret as warm and friendly but quite nervous due to the loss of her first daughter. Margaret was intelligent but hadn't been able to follow her sister to Girton College, Cambridge, as the family couldn't afford it. Margaret wanted Anthea to train as a teacher but she wanted to get a job at the first opportunity. At 15 she went to work for the Bourne and Hollingsworth department store in Oxford Street. A few years later she trained to be a nurse in Bath, where she met her future husband Francis. Two children, Jonathan and Christine, followed. One day in 1961, Anthea took baby pictures of Christine over to her parents' house. They said she was the spitting image of Anthea as a baby. ""Then my father said to my mother, 'You'll have to show her now Peggy,' and she went upstairs,"" Anthea recalls. Margaret returned with a newspaper clipping, with a picture of a baby. Anthea asked who it was. ""It's you,"" her mother replied. The police logbook shows Mac (Adamson) assigned to Anthea's case Anthea learned she had been discovered by Arthur Dodd on a hillside near Worthing on 26 August 1937. Scotland Yard had launched an attempted murder investigation and made a nationwide appeal for information, but never discovered how she came to be there or who her parents were. Margaret wrote to the hospital offering her a home, after reading about her case in the newspaper. Several other people offered to take Anthea, including a Belgian diplomat, but the Shannans were chosen because they had experience raising a child - Veronica, who had been knocked over by a car when she was seven. ""My mother said that when they walked in to the ward I came to the end of the cot and put my arms out,"" Anthea says. ""They paid the juvenile court 11 shillings and sixpence and took me home to Surrey."" After receiving this shocking news, Anthea went home and cried. She told her husband but they decided not to tell their children and she put it to the back of her mind. Anthea with her two eldest children, Jonathan and Christine Decades passed, and Anthea's children had children of their own. Her grandson, Aaron, was also a spitting image of Anthea as a baby and it made her wonder once again who she was. In 1994 she joined a group called Norcap, which helped adopted adults find out more about their past. A member of the group suggested she write to the police in Worthing to see if they had any records. And even though 57 years had passed, the Police Superintendent for West Sussex was able to put her in touch with a retired policeman who had worked the case. He was known as Mac. ""He told me he'd been on crowd control in Worthing that day as they'd had a famous film star at the cinema. He got called back after I was found and was put on door-to-door enquiries,"" Anthea says. ""He said he'd carried my photo in his wallet for years and would produce it if he thought someone might know me, but no-one ever did."" Mac was convinced Anthea was not a local child, as it would have been impossible to keep such a secret in a small community. He thought she could have been brought on the train from London. Their meeting was reported in the local paper, after Mac told the local retired policeman's association about it. The wider press got wind of the story and Anthea was once again the focus of national news. Weeks later she received a letter simply addressed to Anthea, with the name of a local TV show she had featured on. It was from Elizabeth Dodd - the eldest daughter of the family who had found her on the Downs. Jane and Elizabeth around the time they found baby Anthea ""She said I'd ruined her holiday all those years ago because she had wanted her parents to adopt me and they wouldn't,"" Anthea says. Elizabeth told her the family had been returning from a walk when her mother had heard her cries. They had taken her to the nearest house but it didn't have a phone so they carried her on to the big farmhouse in the village of Sompting. ""They were having a tennis party and passed me around the dining room,"" Anthea says. ""One of the farmer's daughters called the police and I was taken to hospital."" Elizabeth has since died, but her younger sister Jane, now 92, still remembers that day. She says the family was walking along the side of Cissbury Ring when her mother heard Anthea's cries. ""My mother and sister did everything while I held my father's hand,"" she says. ""That night I was very frightened as I thought we'd taken someone's baby and they would be cross with us."" Jane, 92, with Anthea, 80. They first met on the South Downs when Jane was 11 and Anthea was a baby She remembers that her parents called the hospital the next day and were told the baby had been called Ann. Anthea also received a letter from Betty, a nurse who had looked after her at Worthing Hospital. ""Apparently I was put in a cot in the sister's office. Betty realised I needed a name when she handed over at the end of her shift. She called me Ann, as it was her favourite name,"" Anthea says. Anthea stayed at Worthing Hospital for six months while the police investigated. Her only injuries were to the skin of her wrists, where she had been bound. ""Apparently the ward sister used to take me out in a pram and walk up and down the front. I've always loved the sound of seagulls,"" Anthea says. Anthea with two doctors from Worthing Hospital Although Anthea now knew far more about how she was found and cared for, she was no closer to finding her parents. Her only clue was Mac's hunch that she had come from London. There were no further breakthroughs until 2012, when Anthea, then 75, decided to take a DNA test. This revealed her ethnicity was 92% Irish and matched her with some distant cousins in America and Ireland. One cousin called Joan, living in North Carolina, asked relatives in her extended family tree to take tests. This revealed Joan was linked to Anthea through her father's maternal side. They came from County Mayo in Ireland. ""I met Joan in 2013. She was the first blood relative I had ever met so it was quite something,"" Anthea says. Two years later she matched with a woman who worked at Dublin University, called Ann. Ann didn't match with Joan, which suggested she was from the other side of Anthea's family. Ann's family came from County Galway. By this time Anthea had joined online communities for adoptees and foundlings and in April 2016 she was contacted by genetic genealogist Julia Bell, who offered to help. Julia and Anthea sift through the records Bell had managed to track down her own American GI grandfather using DNA and genealogical research. She had then started helping other people look for their relatives in her spare time. ""Knowing who her family was changed my mother's life,"" Bell says. ""I believe everyone deserves to know who they really are."" Anthea and Bell met at Paddington Station, where Anthea told her everything she had found out up to that point. Bell encouraged Anthea to take some further DNA tests with different companies, knowing that millions more people had joined DNA databases since Anthea tested in 2012. This provided further distant cousin matches. ""We then used genealogy to build trees to find possible common ancestors and then brought the lines down,"" Bell says. ""It was a lot of work because families could have 12 children and there was a lot of intermarriage. This could make people seem like closer matches than they actually were."" After months of work with the help of genealogist Angie Bush, Bell had narrowed down the search. She was confident one parent was a Coyne from County Galway and the other was an O'Donnell from County Mayo. She was considering the seven daughters of a John O'Donnell when things began to fall into place. ""I was looking at the youngest daughter, Ellen O'Donnell, who was born in 1911,"" she says. Irish amateur historian Catherine Corless had told Bell that Ellen's official name would be a Saint's name - and baptismal records revealed this was Helena. Then came the eureka moment. ""Earlier on I had ordered records of illegitimate births in England and Ireland in 1936. I had come across an unmarried mother called Lena O'Donnell but dismissed it. ""Suddenly I thought: 'Of course, Lena could be Helena!'"" Corless found out Lena O'Donnell had got married in Ireland in 1945, seven years after Anthea had been found, and had given birth to four more children. She tracked down one of the sons who agreed to have a DNA test. In April 2017 the test confirmed Bell's hunch. He was Anthea's half-brother. ""I was sitting in the garden in the sun when Julia rang,"" Anthea says. ""She told me my birth mother was Lena O'Donnell. I was delighted."" Anthea's birth certificate revealed she was born on 20 November 1936, just five days after the date her parents picked for her birthday. Her birth name was Mary Veronica. Lena had been moving between digs in Cricklewood when Anthea was born at St Mary Abbots Hospital in Kensington. She gave her occupation as a machine operator at a telephone factory. She was taken in by a charity for unmarried mothers called the Home for Guardian Angels after leaving hospital on 7 December. However, she didn't stay long. A baptismal record from 18 December reveals Lena moved with her baby to another home called Devon Nook in Chiswick. This Roman Catholic home was unusual for the time as it encouraged the mothers to look after their babies and to keep them if they could. It's the last known record of Lena O'Donnell until she appears on an electoral roll in 1939 back in Cricklewood. Mary Veronica O'Donnell disappears altogether. ""What happened after Lena left Devon Nook?"" Bell asks, rhetorically. ""I don't think she was the one who abandoned Anthea. I think she did a brave thing and decided to try and keep the baby."" Lena O'Donnell was staying at Devon Nook when Anthea was baptised at four weeks old Had Lena wanted to abandon her baby there were easier ways to do it in a big city. An article in the Daily Herald from 28 August 1937 reported 12 abandoned babies were lying in London hospitals. ""They have all been found in the last 10 weeks in railway carriages, churches, station waiting rooms, public parks and on the doorsteps of private houses."" A search for the mothers of 15 recently abandoned children had only succeeded in two cases, it added. So how did Anthea end up on the South Downs? One theory is that Lena left Anthea with a foster mother while she went out to work. Newspaper reports from the time reveal some foster mothers offered to get children in their care adopted for a fee. They would then sell the child to a couple or another broker. An article from 1932 in the Gloucester Citizen, said the traffic in babies was ""becoming one of the greater evils of London"". A director of the National Children Adoption Association is quoted as saying: ""Americans are often willing to pay a high price for fair-headed babies, especially with curls. They call them the pure Anglo-Saxon typeâ¦ At present they are bought and sold more easily than motor cars."" It's possible an exchange of the fair-haired Anthea had been planned near Worthing, and that it somehow went wrong on the day. ""I may never know what happened to me but I've come to terms with it,"" Anthea says. A bridleway leading down from Cissbury Ring, near where Anthea was left At that point her father had still not been identified, but Bell had narrowed down the search to six brothers. Four of them - Michael, Martin, Patrick and Phillip Coyne - had been working as labourers in London in 1936. Martin's daughter agreed to be tested and the results revealed she was a first cousin. This confirmed one of the other three would be Anthea's father. Michael's granddaughter Anne Marie was tested and the result also ruled Michael out. This left just Patrick and Phillip, but as neither had direct descendants the only thing that could prove paternity would be a sample of their DNA - hard to find years after their death. However, Anthea was also in touch with a first cousin called Dot, who was the daughter of one of Patrick and Phillip's sisters. ""I was telling Dot about the problem when she said: 'Well I've still got letters that Patrick sent me,'"" Anthea says. The letters, still in their original stamped envelopes, had been sent from England to the US about 30 years earlier. Bell approached David Nicholson of Living DNA. He said his company could use a recently developed forensic test to capture Patrick's DNA from the saliva left when he licked the stamps and envelope. Last year they took a sample of Anthea's saliva and compared it to small sections cut from the letters. David Nicholson reveals the results of the DNA test to Anthea and Julia Bell The DNA in the first three samples was too degraded to use. However on the fourth, Nicholson said ""we hit on more than enough DNA"". The test, which Nicholson says has ""a degree of accuracy acceptable in UK courts"", proved Patrick Coyne was Anthea's biological father. ""I was so happy as I'd been looking for my father for 29 years,"" Anthea says. Anthea isn't currently in contact with her mother's relatives, although she says her half-brother who took the DNA test ""wishes me well"". However, she has enjoyed getting to know her father's side of the family. ""They told me Patrick was a very lively man, the life and soul of the party,"" Anthea says. ""We don't know if Patrick ever knew about me. He never married and once told Dot it was because he liked his independence and didn't want to be tied down."" Now 80 and living near Bath, Anthea says she is grateful to both Lena and Patrick for the DNA she inherited from them, as she is pretty healthy for someone of her age. But her long journey to learn about her origins hasn't changed how she remembers her adoptive parents. Last summer she had a family party with her children, grandchildren and cousins.

"The woman behind a post-genocide rock revivalVideoVideoWhat it's like to hear voicesThe community of 2,000 people with 151 cases of sex crime","Kak Channthy - a model of strength and independence Cambodian singer Kak Channthy rose from poverty to perform in front of audiences worldwide. Dubbed Cambodia's Amy Winehouse, she was the voice and face of a revival of the legendary 1960s rock scene that swept the country pre-genocide. Her band, the Cambodian Space Project, became one of the few Cambodian rock bands to make it overseas. Her death on Tuesday, in a car crash at the age of 38, has moved her fans around the globe. ""She was a Cambodian hero and now, so sadly, a legend of her people and her time,"" the band's co-founder and ex-husband Julien Poulson told the BBC. ""Her music, her voice, her life and her story have touched so many people from many different walks of life and from all around the word."" Kak Channthy came from a poor family in rural Cambodia and much of her story is that of the typical journey of a poor girl moving from the countryside to the city. In Phnom Penh, she worked in a long line of tough jobs, earning in some cases less than a dollar a day. Cambodian Space Project was founded by Channthy and Julien Poulson (right) ""I was singing in a karaoke bar but in 2006 I wanted to have a go at singing professionally,"" she told the BBC in a 2017 interview. ""So I asked the boss of one beer garden to let me sing in front of him. But I was so nervous I dropped the microphone! Fortunately that day the boss accepted me and decided to hire me and I got paid $2 a day."" That's where she was spotted by Australian musician Julien Poulson and the two went on to form Cambodian Space Project. ""Channthy was inspired by the great Cambodian singers of the 1960s,"" Scott Bywater who played with her in the band as well as on side projects, told the BBC. ""In turn, she has been an inspiration to a new generation of Cambodian singers, excited by her revival of the music of their grandparents."" The vibrant rock scene of the 1960s and early 70s is seen as Cambodia's golden age, before the terror of the Khmer Rouge eradicated all modern culture and music. Most of the famous singers from those days like Ros Serey Sothea, Pan Ron and Sinn Sisamouth died during the brutal genocide between 1975 and 1979 and their music and legacy seemed lost forever. Only a gradual revival and rediscovery of the music from dusty attics, archives abroad and memory helped to bring that music back from the silence. Performing a mix of covers and original songs,Cambodian Space Project were at the forefront of a resurgence of pride in that era.. ""Cambodian Space Project is certainly a big part of Cambodia's music and cultural revival,"" Mr Poulson said. ""But Channthy epitomised and embodied all the heartbreak and sorry of Cambodia but also the very nature of survival itself and she overcame great odds to become an underdog champion of the world."" In recent years she also started her own side project Channthy Cha Cha, playing local shows back in Cambodia. ""She had an extraordinary charm and sincerity both on stage and off - you didn't need to know the language to be moved and excited by her singing and her songwriting - and made friends and fans everywhere she went,"" Mr Bywater recalls. ""I will remember her laughing and dancing, and her delight at what a difference her singing made to those around her. She is a model of female strength and independence to Cambodian and foreigner alike. Our hearts are at half mast."" Her struggle to overcome poverty and hardship to make it to the stages of the world was also the subject of a 2015 documentary Not Easy Rock'n'Roll which premiered at the Sydney Film Festival that year. ""Sometimes I still don't believe that a person from the countryside and with no education can receive a lot of support from all walks of life,"" she told the BBC last year looking back at her extraordinary story.

"The community of 2,000 people with 151 cases of sex crime","Norwegian police have documented 151 cases of sexual abuse, including child rape, in one small community of 2,000 people, north of the Arctic circle. The offences occurred over decades - between the 1950s and 2017 - but were only recently uncovered. How could such serious sex crimes go unchecked for so long? Nina Iversen says she has always been someone who talks - and has often talked about what happened to her when she was growing up in Tysfjord. ""I always spoke about it. From when I was 14 years old, I thought: 'I'll write a book about this abuse - I'm going to stop it.' But of course, I wasn't able to."" When she was a teenager, young people confided in each other about the sexual abuse they had experienced, but adults would not listen. ""We were called whores and liars.  There were many of us who were treated like that.  And we were spat on if we tried to talk about it,"" she remembers. Iversen's abusers were her relatives, so as a child she lived family life in a perpetual state of terror. Now 49, she no longer lives in Tysfjord, but says she still doesn't feel safe. A remote community dominated by a 900m-deep fjord, Tysfjord is split in two - one part, Drag, lies on the western shore, and the other, Kjopsvik, on the eastern. A car ferry ploughs its way back and forth between the two. About half of those living here are from the indigenous Sami community - some of Scandinavia's earliest inhabitants, who live in Norway, Sweden, Finland and Russia. But Sami people accounted for about two-thirds of the 83 victims and 92 perpetrators identified in the police report on sexual abuse, and discrimination and racism had an impact on how the story played out. By 2005, Nina Iversen was a mother. Worried about her children, and the threat to them of sexual abuse, she was in touch with child welfare services. Again she spoke about her own experiences. She told her doctor. ""I told everyone,"" she says. ""But to be listened to, you had to have the right background. Someone like me, who comes from a poor family, just got ignored."" Signposts are bilingual, with place names in Sami and Norwegian Iversen was not the only one trying to get the authorities' attention. In 2007, desperate Sami parents of a child who had been sexually abused wrote a letter to the prime minister asking for help. The letter gained traction in the media - people expected action. At that time, Anna Kuoljok, a deacon in the Norwegian Church, and her husband Ingar, a lawyer - both of them Sami - were in touch with 20 families whose children had been sexually exploited. The couple spoke up at public meetings attended by local politicians, health workers, the police and other authorities. Anna and Ingar Kuoljok, outside the Sami hut used as a church ""They thought it couldn't be true there were so many cases - that's what they said to us,"" remembers Anna. ""They thought we were lying."" ""They were just not comfortable with these kinds of stories,"" says Ingar. ""They didn't know how to handle it."" The Mayor of Tysfjord, Tor Asgeir Johansen, remembers those meetings too but has a different explanation for what went wrong. ""They didn't get a grip on things because people wouldn't tell,"" he says, referring to the victims of sexual abuse. ""The community isn't the police - we can't go around looking in people's homes. People must come and ask for help."" Reporting sexual abuse is difficult for many victims, regardless of their cultural heritage. But in Tysfjord there was a further reluctance to speak out - in many cases the Sami people did not trust the police or authorities. At the same time, Nina Iversen - and she was not alone - was trying to tell her story, but was not listened to. Ethnic divisions were compounded by geography and politics - the more Sami-identifying village of Drag in the west, separated from the more Norwegian village of Kjopsvik in the east, where most authorities were based. Nearly another decade would pass before the abuse story broke in the press. Those years were difficult and lonely for Nina Iversen. She was depressed, and posted a poem about sexual abuse on Facebook, writing 'TYSFJORD' in angry block capitals. Another local woman with experiences similar to Iversen's saw it and got in touch. She said she was already talking to two freelance journalists. And then the ball started rolling. Nina contacted other victims she knew, including women in her extended family. On 11 June 2016 a national newspaper, Verdens Gang, published the story of sexual abuse in Tysfjord based on the testimony of 11 survivors - women and men. Listen toA Community in Recoveryon Assignment, on the BBC World Service Click herefor transmission times, or to catch up online The reaction was immediate. Tone Vangen, Nordland Police District's chief, was relaxing at home that Saturday. She abandoned her weekend from the moment she read the press report. ""This was really serious. We had to put it at the top of our priority list - the main aim was to prevent further cases of sexual abuse in Tysfjord. The following Monday we started to build the organisation that could start the investigation."" Vangen asked everyone who had experienced sexual abuse, however long ago, to come forward. ""We said - even if the Statute of Limitations on offences means we can't take the case to court, we want to take you seriously and we want to understand this problem. But we just didn't realise how big it was."" Police officer Aslak Finvik was tasked with making contact with Sami people and creating trust so they would talk. Aslak Finvik outside the Sami cultural centre in Drag ""It was complicated,"" he says. ""There were many things the police didn't know about before - family ties, religion. And in Sami culture there are elements from pre-Christian times. People believe in healing, and that a shaman can get power over someone by reading their pain. They felt ashamed to talk about it because from a Norwegian point of view, we can't understand it. But it was very important for Sami people that we did."" That understanding would result in the first prosecution in the Tysfjord case - a man who gained access to women by claiming the power to heal and to drive away evil spirits, who sexually assaulted his victims during ""treatment"" sessions. He was sentenced to five-and-a-half years in prison. About 60,000 Sami people live in Norway Many of Tysfjord's Sami residents arrived in the 1960s and 70s, from remote areas in the interior At the time the government was making attempts to ""Norwegianise"" the Sami - children in Sami families were often brought up to speak only Norwegian Only people with Norwegian names were allowed to buy property, and only those who could speak Norwegian could buy land By 2016, Nina Iversen's abusers were dead, so she would never see justice done in court. But she was very happy to collaborate with the police. Meanwhile, in the weeks after VG published its story, about 40 victims sought help from the local doctor, Fred Andersen. The youngest was 10, the oldest 80. ""We had to give them huge medical and psychiatric support,"" he says. ""It's been a very heavy burden. The young people will survive and come out of this with new strengths and self-respect. But the elderly, and those of 50 or 60 who are unemployed with psychiatric problems, they suffer."" Inevitably, questions have been asked about why it is Sami people who feature so largely in this story of abuse. But Lars Magne Andreassen, director of Arran - the Sami community centre in Drag - resists a cultural explanation. ""We have to be self-critical, of course we do. But that doesn't mean that we as a people are to blame. We can compare what happened here in Tysfjord to the #MeToo movement. Why did the most powerful women in the world shut up? Should we blame them? Of course not. There were good reasons for not speaking out - they feared something,"" he says. ""It's exactly the same thing going on here. When people experienced that they were listened to, they started talking, and then six decades of stories came out at one time."" More than 1,000 people - victims, witnesses and perpetrators - were interviewed by the police in the course of their investigation. But of the 151 documented cases in Tysfjord, only a handful will go to court because in most cases the time-limit for prosecution has elapsed. This means many alleged sex abusers still live in this small, close-knit community. Not long ago, Nina Iversen was thinking about moving back to Tysfjord. One afternoon she went and had a look around Kjopsvik. But while she was there she saw three people who had been accused of abuse close to the primary school gates. ""There were children walking home from school while these people were roaming around. It was just awful,"" she says. It is police officer Aslak Finvik's job to monitor these men - and a few women. ""Every one of them we have talked to - Sami and Norwegian - and told them what we know about them.  We've told them not to make contact with the victims. If they do, we may prosecute them,"" he says. In Tysfjord, it seems everyone knows someone affected by this story - a survivor, a perpetrator. Sometimes perpetrators are themselves survivors. This video can not be played In Norway, one tiny community is recovering following revelations about sexual abuse In her role as deacon in the Norwegian Church, Anna Kuoljok organises meetings in a small church built in the style of a traditional Sami hut in Drag. ""We talk about feelings and how to handle them. There is so much grief and anger,"" she says. But rejecting the perpetrators is not an option. Sami culture is inclusive, and belief based on a circle of life that embraces God, people, animals and nature. ""So we must find a way to live together, because everybody is in this circle of life,"" she says. When the police report was published in November 2017, police chief Tone Vangen apologised to the people of Tysfjord. ""The job the police did until June 2016 was not good enough,"" she says. ""This crime affected a lot of people for a long time."" Slowly, trust is being nurtured in Tysfjord. Child protection training is in place, and Norway's national government is funding projects to promote cohesion and build resilience. Community events are better attended now by both Sami people and Norwegians - a concert celebrating Sami music and culture was attended by 700 people earlier this month. The mayor detects another change too. ""Generally, people are much nicer to each other - they take care of each other more than before,"" he says. The revelations have taken a huge toll on a vulnerable community. They have left in their wake fractured families, broken lives and at least two suicides. Nina Iversen's experience has been entangled with that bleak history for decades, but as one of the first 11 survivors who told their story, she feels as though life is finally moving in the right direction. ""Today I can say I'm proud of what we did. Now they're listening. We're getting somewhere - people believe us."" Rather than being offered protection, teenagers groomed and coerced into having sex faced criminal charges of prostitution. A major factor was the public - and professional - perception of the abused girls, who were often dismissed as troublemakers.

Cambridge Analytica offices searched,"ICO officials were seen searching the London headquarters of Cambridge Analytica The London offices of Cambridge Analytica have been searched by enforcement officers from the UK's information commissioner. The High Court granted the data watchdog a warrant amid claims the firm amassed information about millions of people without their consent, based on a 2014 quiz on Facebook. The seven-hour search finished in the early hours of Saturday. Both Cambridge Analytica and Facebook deny any wrongdoing. A group of people, some wearing ICO enforcement jackets, entered the building housing Cambridge Analytica's London headquarters at 20:00 GMT on Friday - less than an hour after a High Court judge granted the warrant. Several hours later members of the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) were seen leaving the offices and a van - thought to be carrying gathered evidence - was driven away from the rear of the building. The ICO applied for the warrant to access the databases and servers of Cambridge Analytica. The search of the London building continued into the early hours of Saturday The search is part of a wider investigation into political campaigning. Information Commissioner Elizabeth Denham has said she was looking at whether personal data was acquired in ""an unauthorised way"", whether there was sufficient consent to share the data, what was done to safeguard it and whether Facebook acted robustly when it found out about the loss of the data. Cambridge Analytica's acting chief executive, Alexander Tayler, said the company has been in touch with the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) since February 2017 and it remained committed to helping the investigation. Cambridge Analytica: The story so far The global reach of Cambridge Analytica Elon Musk pulls brands from Facebook In astatement,external, he said checks in 2015 showed all the Facebook data had been deleted but the company was now undertaking an independent third-party audit to verify none remained. Cambridge Analytica chief executive Alexander Nix was suspended on Tuesday after footage broadcast on Channel 4 appeared to show him suggesting tactics his company could use to discredit politicians online.

The company denies any of the data harvested in the 2014 Facebook quiz created by an academic was used in its work for Donald Trump's campaign. Meanwhile, thedirector of Vote Leave has denied allegations of linksbetween his campaign and Cambridge Analytica. Dominic Cummings said claims by the Observer newspaper are ""factually wrong, hopelessly confused, or nonsensical"".

England TB rates fall by third since 2012,"New figures show rates of tuberculosis (TB) in England have declined by a third in six years, and are currently at their lowest level in 35 years. The data from Public Health England shows a 38% fall since 2012, with a 9.3% decline in cases in 2017 alone. Improved diagnosis, treatment and awareness are being credited for the fall. But England still has one of the highest rates of TB in Western Europe with just under 5,200 affected in 2017. And TB is still one of the leading causes of death worldwide. The data has been released to coincide with World TB Day on 24 March. The World Health Organization's campaign Light up the World for TB will see buildings and landmarks across the world lit up in red across the weekend 23-25 March. It's hoped it will highlight the continued focus that is required to meet the ultimate ambition of making England TB-free. The BCG vaccine offers protection against TB Dr Sarah Anderson, head of the National TB Office at Public Health England, said: ""People often think that TB is a Victorian disease that is no longer a problem in England, but in fact it still affects over 5,000 people a year and there is still a lot to do until the target to eliminate TB is met. ""We urge everyone to join the fight to confine TB to history. World TB Day is an opportunity for people everywhere to be informed about TB, educate others and urge governments to take action. This global movement will make a powerful statement and show solidarity for people who have been affected by TB."" TB is a bacterial infection spread through inhaling tiny droplets from the coughs or sneezes of an infected person It mainly affects the lungs, but it can affect any part of the body, including the tummy (abdomen) glands, bones and nervous system The most common symptoms of TB are a persistent cough for more than three weeks, unexplained weight loss, fever and night sweats. TB is difficult to catch and you need to spend many hours in close contact with a person with infectious TB to be at risk of infection TB can be fatal if left untreated - but can be cured if it's treated with the right antibiotics over a course of six months The BCG vaccine offers protection against TB, and is recommended for babies, children and adults under the age of 35 who are at risk of catching TB At-risk groups include: children living in areas with high rates of TB and people with close family members from countries with high TB rates The most recent data on infection rates show parts of London still have higher rates of TB than some developing countries, such as Iraq, Libya and even Yemen. London is known as the TB capital of Western Europe and has seen initiatives such as a mobile clinic taking to the capital's streets to test vulnerable people, such as the homeless. Free testing and treatment of latent TB is available in England for people from areas where TB is common. Last yearresearchers in Oxford and Birmingham reportedthey had made a world-first breakthrough in the diagnosis of tuberculosis. They managed to isolate different strains of the disease using a process called genome sequencing. It means patients who may have waited months to get the right drugs can now be diagnosed in only a few days - so they have a greater chance of recovery. While figures have gone down over the last six years in England, another issue in the battle to eradicate TB is drug resistance. A recent study found one in five global cases of the disease is now resistant to at least one major treatment drug.

"Lorry drivers jailed over fatal M1 crashEight people died when the minibus they were travelling in was involved in a crash with two lorries.7h7 hours agoBeds, Herts & Bucks","Two lorries and a minibus were involved in the crash on the M1 near Newport Pagnell in August Two lorry drivers have been jailed over a crash on the M1 in Buckinghamshire that killed eight people last year. Ryszard Masierak, 31, was jailed for 14 years after being found guilty of causing death by dangerous driving. David Wagstaff, 54, was sentenced to 40 months in prison after pleading guilty to causing death by careless driving. Eight people died when the minibus they were travelling in was hit by Wagstaff and shunted into Masierak's lorry, which had stopped on the inside lane. Judge Francis Sheridan said the crash was the most serious in the UK for more than 26 years. Sentencing the pair at Aylesbury Crown Court, Judge Sheridan described Masierak as a ""persistent, unmitigated, if not very accomplished liar"" who had shown ""no remorse"". ""What you have tried to do is blame everyone and everybody except yourself,"" he told him. Thetrial heard Masierak, of Barnards Close, Evesham, Worcestershire, was twice the drink-drive limitand had stopped on the inside lane near Newport Pagnell for 12 minutes before the crash on 26 August. The AIM Logistics driver admitted he had consumed alcohol but said he stopped because he was sweating, felt weak and had a headache. Ryszard Masierak and David Wagstaff were sentenced at Aylesbury Crown Court After the verdicts, it was revealed Masierak's professional driving licence had been revoked prior to the crash. At today's sentencing, the Polish national was told he could face deportation on his release from prison. Minibus driver Cyriac Joseph was waiting with his hazard lights on to go around Masierak's lorry when Fed Ex driver Wagstaff ploughed into the back of the van forcing it into and under Masierak's vehicle. Wagstaff, of Derwent Street, Stoke-on-Trent, had been on a hands-free call for an hour at the time of impact and the trial heard he did not brake before crashing into the minibus at 56mph. 'There is no life for me now' - minibus driver's wife M1 death crash trucker cleared of charge Lorry driver guilty over fatal M1 crash Judge Sheridan said Wagstaff had between nine and 11 seconds to see the vehicles ahead had he ""not been so distracted by using the phone"". ""You took no action whatsoever because you weren't concentrating on what was in front of you - they were there to be seen and you didn't see them."" A jury had cleared Wagstaff of causing death by dangerous driving. Despite Judge Sheridan acknowledging that Wagstaff had not broken the law by using a bluetooth headset, he said: ""It would be wrong of me not to take the opportunity to urge the public to download the app that deactivates your phone when you are on the move."" The minibus was owned and being driven by Cyriac Joseph The eight people killed were all travelling in the minibus, which was carrying 11 Indian tourists from Nottingham to London ahead of a trip to Disneyland Paris. The six men and two women who died were driver Cyriac Joseph, Panneerselvam Annamalai, Rishi Ranjeev Kumar, Vivek Baskaran, Lavanyalakshmi Seetharaman, Karthikeyan Pugalur Ramasubramanian, Subramaniyan Arachelvan and Tamilmani Arachelvan. Four other passengers - including a four-year-old girl orphaned by the crash - were seriously injured and spent weeks in hospital afterwards. Masierak was also disqualified from driving for 17 years after he was convicted of eight counts of causing death by dangerous driving and four counts of causing serious injury by dangerous driving. Wagstaff admitted eight counts of causing death by careless driving and four counts of causing serious injury by careless driving. He was banned from driving for three years. At the sentencing, Judge Sheridan took the opportunity to thank the victims' families who he said had ""conducted themselves with utmost dignity which was utterly humbling"".

Parsons Green Tube bomber jailed for lifeJudge says teenager who planted device and injured 51 people planned with almost military efficiency.5h5 hours agoUK,"A teenager has been described as ""dangerous and devious"" by a judge as he was jailed for life for planting a bomb on a Tube train at Parsons Green. Ahmed Hassan's device partially exploded in September, injuring 51. The 18-year-old, found guilty of attempted murder, was ordered to serve a minimum of 34 years. Police said Hassan, from Surrey, appeared to be co-operating with government deradicalisation programme Prevent at the time of the attack. But the BBC has been told the Iraqi asylum seeker had not agreed to take part in the Prevent scheme, which operates on the basis that people regarded ""at risk"" give their consent. The Iraqi fantasist who wanted attention Why is it so easy to buy bomb-making ingredients? In victim impact statements read out in court, commuters said they believed they were going to die and described how they had been troubled by disturbing recollections and fears. Passing sentence, the judge, Mr Justice Haddon-Cave, said he would be treating the incident as a terrorist offence. In a January 2016 immigration interview, Hassan told officials he had been in contact with the Islamic State group and had been ""trained to kill"". The trial also heard he blamed the UK for the death of his father in Iraq. The judge told Hassan: ""There is no doubt that you are a very dangerous and devious individual. ""You quietly went about planning and executing this terrorist bomb attack with ruthless determination and almost military efficiency, whilst pretending to be a model asylum-seeker."" He added: ""I am satisfied you were determined to create as much death and carnage that day as possible."" This video can not be played CCTV of Parson's Green Tube bomb fireball Police have said Hassan appeared to be co-operating with its Channel programme, part of the Prevent deradicalisation scheme, at the time of the attack. But the BBC understands Hassan had not agreed to take part - despite consent being a fundamental principle of the programme. In a statement, Surrey County Council said that staff from the local Channel panel met Hassan on many occasions between February 2016 and September 2017. The council said Hassan had received ""extensive support"" including from mental health and educational experts, which the Channel panel monitored and reviewed. Surrey acknowledged Hassan did not have a specialist mentor from the programme working with him. It refused to respond when asked if Hassan had consented to be on the Channel programme. Hassan's bomb partially exploded at 08:20 GMT after the train arrived at Parsons Green station, leaving 23 people with burn injuries and 28 suffering crush injuries as they fled from the train and station. Prosecutors at the sentencing hearing said there would have been ""serious harm, if not fatality"" if the bomb - packed with 2kg of screwdrivers, knives, nuts and bolts - had fully detonated. Hassan left his bomb in the carriage and left the train Hassan had built the bomb in the home of his foster parents in Sunbury-on-Thames while they were away. On the morning of 15 September, he took a westbound District Line train from Wimbledon, getting off one stop before Parsons Green. His device, which had a timer and was placed in a supermarket plastic bag, was left on the floor of the carriage. He was arrested the following morning at Dover. Hassan arrived in the UK in a lorry after having spent time in the migrant camp in Calais known as the Jungle and he was referred to Surrey County Council's social services - a standard procedure for unaccompanied child asylum seekers. Hassan's foster parents were not aware of the concerns that he harboured extremist views. Following the verdict, Surrey County Council apologised, saying its work ""wasn't as good as it should have been"" in helping to stop individuals from being drawn to terrorism. In a victim impact statement read by prosecutor Alison Morgan, Stephen Nash said he had to give up his job as a social worker because he feared getting on the Tube since the incident and does not like being amongst crowds. Ann Stuart said she became ""tearful for no discernible reason"" and had frightening dreams, adding: ""Since this happened I wake most mornings shaking and anxious"". Another victim, identified only as Miss S who suffering 16% burns to her body after the fire from the device melted her tights, had to see a psychologist.
