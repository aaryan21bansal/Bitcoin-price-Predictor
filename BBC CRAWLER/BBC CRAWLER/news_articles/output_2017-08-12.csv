One killed in US far-right rally violence,"This video can not be played Footage captured the moment a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville One person has died and 19 others were injured when a car rammed a crowd of people opposing a far-right rally in the US state of Virginia, police say. Earlier, street brawls erupted between white nationalists planning to attend the march and counter-protesters. The mayor of Charlottesville, where the now-cancelled rally was taking place, said he was ""heartbroken"" at the death. President Donald Trump has condemned the violence, and local officials have declared a state of emergency. The car involved in the ramming incident was later located a few streets away and the driver is in custody, the city's police chief said. In addition to those injured there,the Charlottesville Police Department said,externalanother 15 people were injured in other violence related to the far-right march. Late in the afternoon, a Virginia State Police helicopter, crashed in woodland south-west of the city, killing two people; however, there has been no indication that this was related to the violence. The ""Unite the Right"" march was called to protest against plans to remove a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. Video posted on social media showed a car ploughing at speed into several slow-moving vehicles, which were surrounded by a densely packed crowd. A witness said one girl got ""tore up"" after the car ""backed up and hit again"". Officials said the driver had been taken into custody. A number of people received first-aid after a vehicle drove into a crowd Witnesses said the car backed up and hit the crowd more than once Police earlier fired tear gas against demonstrators and said that arrests had been made after a declaration of unlawful assembly at Emancipation Park. Why do people still fly the Confederate flag? The far-right protesters, some waving Confederate flags, carrying shields and wearing helmets, are angry about the planned removal of a statue of General Robert E Lee from Charlottesville. This video can not be played The US president ignored questions over whether his response went far enough Gen Lee commanded the pro-slavery Confederate forces in the US Civil War of 1861-65. The New York Times reports that some of them were chanting ""You will not replace us,"" and ""Jew will not replace us."" Anti-racism organisations such as Black Lives Matter also held marches. President Donald Trump condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides"". ""The hate and the division must stop right now,"" he told reporters, speaking in New Jersey, where he is on a working holiday. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation."" Democrats and Republicans alike have taken issue with his choice of words, noting that he failed to refer to the role of white nationalists. Republican Senator Cory Gardner tweeted: ""Mr. President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism."" Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, also a Republican, felt similarly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Right-wing blogger Jason Kessler had called for a ""pro-white"" rally in Charlottesville, and white nationalists promoted the gathering widely.

The governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, said his only message for the white supremacists who had rallied in the city was - ""go home."" Speaking to reporters in Charlottesville, he said there was no place for white supremacist groups there, or in America. By Joel Gunter, BBC News, Charlottesville There were very violent scenes at Emancipation Park and it took some time for the police to intervene. Both sides were throwing bottles and rocks and using pepper spray. The far-right protesters were a mix of different groups with shields and batons and the declaration of a state of emergency seemed to have had a significant impact on them, as they started to dissipate. Shiquan Rah, a 21-year-old demonstrator who had joined the counter-protest, said about the far-right groups: ""These people don't have a message, their message is hate and violence.

Members of a white nationalist group were armed and wearing militia uniforms Charlottesville is considered a liberal college town - and 86% of the county voted for Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential elections. However, the town has become a focal point for white nationalists after the city council voted to remove the statue of Gen Lee.

'Impressive' meteor shower seen over UK,"Meteors captured above the Jill Windmill in West Sussex early on Sunday The Perseid meteor shower has been seen over parts of the UK, giving stargazers the opportunity to spot scores of shooting stars in the sky. The shower was due to peak in the UK on Saturday night, in a display also visible in other parts of the world. Stargazers took to social media to say they had seen the display, in which 100 meteors had been expected an hour. The Perseid meteor shower occurs every July and August as the Earth passes debris from the Swift-Tuttle comet. BBC News website reader Keith Trueman captured the meteor shower against the background of the Milky Way on Exmoor Bob Girling witnessed this impressive sight above Chilton, Oxfordshire, at around 23:20 BST Michiko Smith took a series of photos, including this one, from her back garden in Normanton, West Yorkshire Relatively clear skies above Ide, near Exeter, gave Alan Saunders a chance to photograph the meteor shower from his house Darren Felgate said this was taken from his back garden near the cricket ground in Scarborough A Perseid meteor passing through the constellation of Ursa Major was photographed by Brian Gibson from his back garden in Milngavie, Glasgow at 23:03 BST Former England cricketer Paul Collingwood was among those who attempted to spot the meteors.

Experts had warned that the Perseids may have been harder to see this year as the Moon was three-quarters full. But Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said the weather had given stargazers a good opportunity to see the meteor shower. He said: ""There were some good cloud breaks, so many areas would have had a good chance to see them during the early hours. It would have been pretty good viewing."" Robin Scagell, vice president of the Society For Popular Astronomy, added that although the intensity of the display had peaked on Saturday (12 August), the meteor shower would still be visible until 20 August. He said: ""For the next few days you could expect to see some - but decreasing numbers. So tonight will be probably the best chance of seeing them if you missed them last night."" The best place to see the meteors was under a clear sky, away from built-up areas, he said.

Trump's comments on Venezuela condemned,"This video can not be played NicolÃ¡s Maduro on the BBC: ""What would the Queen, my friend, say?"" The South American trading bloc Mercosur has condemned President Trump for saying he was considering military action in the Venezuela crisis. Argentina said dialogue and diplomacy were the only ways to promote democracy in Venezuela. Venezuela's foreign minister said Mr Trump's words had been hostile and disrespectful and risked destablising Latin America. Violent demonstrations since April have left more than 120 people dead. President Nicolas Maduro's new constituent assembly - which can rewrite the constitution and could override the opposition-controlled parliament - has been widely criticised as anti-democratic. Venezuela crisis explained What lies ahead for divided Venezuela? Is Maduro on a power grab? Mercosur - which includes the region's largest economies Argentina and Brazil as well as Paraguay and Uruguay - indefinitely suspended Venezuela's membership last week. Other Latin American countries also condemned Mr Trump's comments, including Mexico, Colombia and Peru, which said Mr Trump's threat was against UN principles. Peru has been a fierce critic of Mr Maduro's government. On Friday Peru expelled Venezuela's ambassador after Caracas sent an ""unacceptable"" response to regional condemnation of its new constituent assembly. Peruvian President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski has urged Mr Maduro to resign and called him a dictator. This video can not be played Your video guide to the crisis gripping Venezuela On Friday evening Mr Trump told reporters the US had ""many options for Venezuela, including a possible military option if necessary"". ""The people are suffering and they're dying,"" he added. The US recently imposed sanctions on President Maduro, branding him a dictator. The White House later said that Mr Maduro had requested a phone call with the American president. In response, the White House said Mr Trump would gladly speak to his Venezuelan counterpart, when democracy had been restored in the country. The Venezuelan opposition accuses Mr Maduro of trying to cling on to power, but he says the new assembly will bring peace to the country. Maduro on Trump... and BBC.

'Theresa's mea culpa' and no 'back door' Brexit,"According tothe Mail on Sunday,external, Theresa May will make a grovelling apology at the Conservative Party conference for the loss of the government's majority, to try to head off a threat to sack her as prime minister. The paper calls it her ""mea culpa"". In an editorial, the paper says it is right that Mrs May will show contrition - but adds that the time for apologies is over. It says decisiveness and clarity are the best way of uniting the cabinet, her party, and ultimately, the country. The Sun on Sunday,external, meanwhile, says Mrs May is being urged to clear out what it calls the ""Brexit-bashers"" in a mini reshuffle in order to reassert her authority. ""Moggmentum"" for Tory backbencher Jacob? The Mail,externalbelieves Chancellor Philip Hammond and the Scottish Tory leader Ruth Davidson are poised to back a leadership bid by ""soft-Brexit"" supporter, Home Secretary Amber Rudd - if Mrs May is forced to step down. Boththe Mail,externalandthe Sunday Times,externalsay backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg is considering whether he should enter the race to succeed Mrs May. Although when asked directly about his ambitions, he told the Sunday Times: ""I think if I threw my hat into the ring, my hat would be thrown back at me pretty quickly."" In an editorial,external, the paper says what it calls ""Moggmentum"" is gaining strength. ""Could he become Tory leader? Stranger things have happened"", it concludes. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external The Observer,externalhas an article by the former Labour Foreign Secretary David Miliband calling for politicians on all sides to fight back against what he calls the ""worst consequences"" of Brexit. He says the country should have the chance to vote on any Brexit deal in a second referendum with a straight choice between remaining in the EU and the negotiated alternative. The former Business Minister, Anna Soubry, who campaigned for remain in the referendum, says a hard Brexit would destroy the lives and livelihoods of her constituents. In theMail on Sunday,external, she says ""it's not impossible"" that she could join with like-minded people who wanted to save the country from that fate. In theSunday Telegraph,  Chancellor Philip Hammond, and the International Trade Secretary Liam Fox,externalhave written a joint article insisting the UK will leave the customs union and single market when it withdraws from the EU.

Learners can drive on motorway from 2018,"The first taste of motorway driving can be an anxious experience for some Learner drivers in England, Wales and Scotland will be allowed to have lessons on the motorway by next year, the government has announced. The Department for Transport (DfT) said lessons would be in a dual-control car with an approved driving instructor. Currently only those who have passed their test can drive on a motorway, but in 2015 the DfT said it wouldconsider a law change. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said the lessons would make UK roads safer. He said: ""Allowing learners to drive on motorways in a supportive environment will help them develop a practical understanding of how to use motorways safely before driving independently."" Mr Grayling said young drivers were more likely to be killed or seriously injured on Britain's roads - and a lack of experience was an ""important factor"". ""The UK has some of safest roads in the world and we want to make them even safer,"" he said. New driver Leonnie Wharton, from Wigan, told the BBC: ""I passed my test a week ago and have been on the motorway twice on my own. ""It was quite a scary experience, I'd read up on the theory but actually doing it is completely different. ""I'm apprehensive about doing it again on my own, but I don't want to get to the point where I actively avoid going on the motorway."" The 25-year-old said motorway lessons would have definitely helped with her nerves and she agrees that motorway instruction should be part of learning to drive. ""It's ridiculous that it isn't already when it is a big part of driving. Learners should feel confident on the motorway; it would make the roads safer,"" she said. Top tips for learners Instructor Sharon Starr, whose driving school is based in Stoke Newington, north London, is in favour of the plans - but cautioned many instructors do not offer motorway lessons as they perceive them to be more dangerous. She has this advice for first-time motorway drivers: Keep calm.The most important thing is to keep calm, and remember your instructor is there to help if you have a problem. Motorways are similar to dual carriageways - which learners have already driven on - so it's the same but a bit faster. Plan ahead.Sometimes you need to ease off the accelerator to create the gap ahead. You need to build up speed quite quickly when you are joining the motorway. Don't hesitate.If you hesitate while joining the motorway or changing lanes you can put yourself or other drivers in danger. Once you've begun to move, they are expecting you to go. Watch speed limits.Lots of people don't realise the speed limit isn't only 70mph. There are average speed cameras where the speed limit is 50mph so you need to be careful. There were 1,810 deaths on UK roads in the year to September 2016, in line with the previous year, according toprovisional estimates,externalpublished by the DfT. In 2015, a DfTpolicy document,externalsuggested motorway lessons alongside a number of proposals, including increasing penalty points for using a mobile phone while driving and a Â£2m research programme to improve safety for inexperienced drivers. The RAC's safety spokesman Pete Williams backed the changes, which ministers have been consulting on this year. He said: ""While motorways are statistically our safest roads, it can be daunting using them for the first time after passing the driving test."" Mr Williams said drivers the RAC had surveyed were ""overwhelmingly supportive"" of motorway lessons. AA president Edmund King said a lack of motorway experience was the ""Achilles heel"" of learner drivers. ""Almost half of motorists know friends or family who avoid driving on motorways."" Under changes to the practical driving test effective from 4 December,learner drivers will be tested on their ability to use a sat nav. Drivers will also be expected to answer vehicle safety questions while on the move and complete 20 minutes of independent driving rather than 10. Motorway rules When joining the motorway give priority to traffic already on the road. Match your speed to fit safely into the traffic flow and remain in the left-hand lane long enough to adjust to the speed of traffic before considering overtaking When you can see well ahead and the road conditions are good, drive at a steady cruising speed within the speed limit Always drive in the left-hand lane when the road ahead is clear. If you are overtaking slower-moving vehicles, return to the left-hand lane as soon as you are safely past Only overtake on the right-hand side, when it safe and legal to do so. In congested conditions, however, you may keep up with the traffic in your lane even if this means passing traffic in the lane to your right. Do not weave in and out of lanes to overtake Do not stop on the hard shoulder except in an emergency Do not reverse, cross the central reservation, or drive against the traffic flow.

Salon saves teen's hair and her smile,"Beauty rituals may not be the first thing you think about in relation to mental health, but when an American hairdresser told her story about a teenage client with depression, thousands responded. Kayley Olsson, a 20-year-old student hairdresser in Waterloo, Iowa,posted on Facebook on Tuesday,externalabout a girl who came into her salon with densely matted and tangled hair. ""Today I had one of the hardest experiences - I had a 16-year-girl come in who has been dealing with severe depression for a few years now,"" Kayley wrote in the post, which has been shared over 55,000 times. The teen had explained to Kayley she ""felt so down and so worthless she couldn't even brush her hair, she only got up to use the restroom."" The teenager had a school photograph scheduled and she asked the salon to cut off all her hair because she couldn't face the pain of combing out the matted knots and tangles. But Kayley and her colleague Mariah Wenger, who are both beauty therapy students, refused to shear the teen's waist-length hair. ""Cutting her hair was absolutely not a option for me. ""I knew right then and there that we had to keep as much hair as possible,"" Kayley told the BBC. ""Shaving was a last resort and something none of us going in wanted to do,"" Mariah added.

""We all deserve to feel beautiful,"" says hairdresser Kayley Olsson ""It took a lot of encouraging words, reassurance, and just plain conversation to take her mind off of the pain involved in removing the matting and to boost her self esteem and confidence. ""I was able to very closely relate to her mental health problems and the daily struggle that comes with them, due to my struggles with postpartum depression and anxiety,"" explained Mariah, who has two children. ""I understood how it felt to feel worthless - a child should never feel like that. ""I knew I had to help her, just like people helped me. We all deserve to feel beautiful,"" Kayley said. After detangling it as far as shoulder height, Kayley and Mariah cut and shaped the teenager's hair. ""Let's just say we both let out tears of joy! ""Her last words to me were, 'I will actually smile for my schools pictures today, you made me feel like me again,'"" Kayley explained. Hairdresser Mariah Wenger says her experiences helped her empathise with the teenager The post has received nearly 60,000 comments (at time of writing), including women relating their own experiences of mental health problems. ""It's happened to me - I suffer with bipolar and had an episode and didn't brush my hair or take care of myself - just remember beautiful girl you're not on your own,"" wrote Sarah-Lee on Facebook. ""I work with mental health and good for you. I see this daily it's sad but so true,"" said Renay St Amand. ""I've been in this position and I can't tell you how comforting and important it is for a hairdresser to be kind and understanding. I wasn't judged either and got my hair back to being beautiful,"" wrote Claire McDonald. ""I have been struggling with my depression and suicidal thoughts. It's hard to even get out of bed but I try to fight everything negative. Plus you are beautiful and you are worth something I promise,"" another woman posted. ""I'm so glad there are people out there who understand mental illness... So a big thank you to you for putting your whole heart into this lil lady,"" wrote Angelbear Read. Others described how beauty and grooming can be important to people experiencing depression. ""You are awesome to recognize this as a mental issue and also for giving her back her dignity by fixing her hair issues,"" wrote Patricia Barron-Gondeiro.

Is there knotweed in my neighbourhood?,"Knotweed can grow at a rate of 10cm per day in the summer Back in the nineteenth century, when Victorian engineers were designing the latest in transport technology, Japanese knotweed sounded like a very clever idea. A plant that typically colonised volcanoes in Japan was imported to Britain to help hide, or possibly even stabilise, railway embankments. Since then its spread has caused much unhappiness amongst home-owners and prospective house purchasers. It can crack tarmac, block drains, undermine foundations and invade homes. Its presence can be enough to cut a property's value by up to 20%, or prevent a mortgage lender approving a loan. But just as new technology created the problem originally, new technology may help to solve it. Five years ago, the Environment Agency commissioned a new app to track Japanese knotweed, using the crowd-sourcing principle. More than 20,000 people have now downloaded it, and their data has pinpointed over 6,000 knotweed locations. Click here to view full UK map,external, and then zoom in to your area ""If we can get more people taking an interest and submitting records, so much the better,"" says Dave Kilbey, director of Natural Apptitude, which designed and launched the app. ""Hopefully it will mean people will become a bit more aware of the problems, and what to look for."" So far the results show a particular concentration of knotweed in South Wales, the Midlands, London, Scotland's central belt and Cornwall - where the plant was also introduced by Victorians into ornamental gardens. Those looking for a property can use the app to find out if knotweed has been found nearby - but the fact it is not on the map does not mean it is not present; it is simply that no one has reported it. Get PlantTracker app:  IoS phoneshere,external; Android phoneshere,external The plant was first imported to the UK in the 19th century Dense thickets of green, purple-speckled, bamboo-like stems up to three metres tall Heart or shield-shaped leaves Alternate leafing pattern along stems Completely hollow stems that can be snapped easily Tiny creamy white flowers August to October The data provided by the PlantTracker app is also added to the National Biodiversity Network (NBN) atlas, which aims to track the whereabouts of all the UK's plants and animals, from bee orchids to goshawks. Even though it has only been available to the public since April, and is not yet fully functional, the atlas has further information about Japanese knotweed locations. The map shows more than 43,000 historical records for the plant, going back to 1900. But Purba Choudhury, communications officer for the NBN, says that if there are no records in your area, that doesn't guarantee its absence. ""Conversely, the record you are seeing might be an old record, and the Japanese knotweed might have been removed since the record was uploaded,"" she says. Certain areas of the UK are worst affected, such as South Wales Click here to view full NBN map of the UK,external, then zoom in to your area The South Wales section of the NBN map (above) shows how knotweed spreads along the course of rivers and canals. In such locations tiny fragments of knotweed float downstream, and quickly establish themselves elsewhere. Trying to destroy Japanese knotweed by yourself is virtually impossible. That is because the roots, or rhizomes, spread rapidly underground, and can regenerate from tiny amounts of material. In fact it can grow at the rate of 10cm a day during the summer. ""Digging it out of the ground can just spread it terribly,"" warns Stephen Hodgson, the chief executive of the Property Care Association (PCA). ""If you've got it in your garden, either leave it alone, or treat it properly."" Injection with glyphosate is the most effective treatment The advice is as follows: Do not try to dig it up: Tiny root fragments can regenerate into another plant If you cut down the branches, dispose of them on-site. Compost separately, preferably on plastic sheets Do not take it to your local council dump. It needs specialist waste management Do not dispose of it in the countryside. This is against the law Do not spread the soil. Earth within seven horizontal metres of a plant can be contaminated Take advice from the Invasive Non-Native Specialists Association (INNSA) or the Property Care Association (PCA)  on local removal contractors. Many treatments don't work The plant can dominate roadsides In an experimentbeing conducted in South Wales, thousands of plant lice were released last summer, in the hopes that they would help destroy some of the knotweed along river banks. But otherwise the accepted best-practice treatment is for professionals to inject the plant with industrial-strength weed killer glyphosate. David Layland, the joint managing director of Japanese Knotweed Control, based in Stockport, says it is the only thing that works. ""Once we inject into it, it transfers into the root system pretty quickly, and then it binds with the roots. Over time, it rots away into the subsoil."" But professional treatment is costly, starting at about Â£2,500, and going upwards to Â£30,000 for a major infestation. Just as big a worry for many home-owners is the discovery that your neighbour has Japanese knotweed on his or her property, and refuses to do anything about it. Knotweed flowers between August and October But under the 2014Anti-Social Behaviour, Crime and Policing Act,external, local councils or police forces can now issue a Community Protection Notice (CPN), forcing neighbours to take action, and fining them if they don't. ""I think when they are enforced - and they are starting to be enforced - CPNs are very effective,"" says Stephen Hodgson. ""But they are, and should be, a measure of last resort."" In the meantime judges at the Court of Appeal are gearing up to provide an important precedent on who should pay if a landowner allows knotweed to encroach on somebody else's property. Next year they will rule on the case ofWilliams v Network Rail- after two homeowners in South Wales were awarded Â£15,000 to compensate them for knotweed which had spread into their gardens.

Sub owner held over missing reporter,"Peter Madsen was pictured next to the journalist, Kim Wall, just before they set off A Danish submarine owner has appeared in court over the disappearance of a Swedish female journalist who had been on board his vessel before it sank. Peter Madsen, 46, denies wrongdoing, saying he had dropped off the reporter - 30-year-old Kim Wall - in Copenhagen before the sinking. Her partner raised the alarm in the early hours of Friday when she failed to return from the Nautilus vessel. It was later spotted but sank on Friday morning and Mr Madsen was rescued. Police have launched a search for Ms Wall, a freelance journalist based in New York and China who has written for the New York Times, the Guardian and Vice Magazine. This video can not be played Mr Madsen was filmed by a Danish TV crew escorted by police after his rescue Danish media said Mr Madsen had been charged with negligent manslaughter and would be detained for 24 days, following his court appearance on Saturday. Police would not comment on why charges had been brought before a body had been found. Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? In a statement to Swedish paper Aftonbladet, Ms Wall's family said: ""It is with great dismay we received the message that Kim is missing. We believe and sincerely hope she will be found safe and well."" Her friends and family have been posting widely on social media asking for her whereabouts. Kim Wall has worked for the Guardian and the New York Times Salvage teams started raising the Nautilus from the seabed in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen, on Saturday. Police are hunting for witnesses and camera footage to determine whether the missing woman had disembarked after setting off. Footage aired by Denmark's TV2 shows Mr Madsen getting out of what appeared to be a private boat, giving reporters a thumbs-up sign, saying: ""I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down."" The Nautilus is almost 18 metres long A search was launched after the woman was reported missing He later told a reporter: ""I was out on a rehearsal trip, tinkering with different things in the submarine. Then a defect happened with a ballast tank which wasn't that serious - until I tried to repair it - then it suddenly became very serious. ""After that it took 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink. I couldn't close the hatch or anything. But that might be OK, as I would still be down there then."" Ms Wall had been writing about Mr Madsen and his submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. Mr Madsen made headlines in 2008 when he built the home-made submarine, that is almost 18 metres long, by using online crowd-funding. Danish sub owner emerges after rescue.

Scotland's model teenager takes on the world,"Connor Newall has appeared on the front of magazines around the world Connor Newall has had a meteoric rise from Glasgow schoolboy to international model whose ""unique beauty"" stares out from the front covers of style magazines around the world. The 18-year-old from the Govan area has been catapulted into the upper echelons of the fashion world. Almost since the moment he was discovered he has been in constant demand from fashion magazines such as GQ and Vogue and clothing brands such as Dsquared and Stone Island. Connor has been in the studio with a roll call of the top photographers working in the industry today, constantly shuttling between Paris, Milan, New York and London. According to those in the know, his ""ugly-beautiful"" face can look hard or angelic and its angular features are endlessly fascinating for photographers looking to create something special. ""I just see myself as a normal guy,"" Connor tells thedocumentary Scotland's Model Teenager, part of BBC One's Our Lives series. ""People see things I have never seen in my face."" The story of how an unassuming lad from Govan became a top model began when he was spotted by casting agent Claire Catterson. She was looking for new young talent for a Scottish government-funded public service film on the dangers of knife crime. Claire had been visiting Connor's school but hadn't found what she was looking for. Connor posted this picture on Instagram of seeing himself on the side of a wall in Milan She says: ""I was on my way out of the door, saying goodbye to the head teacher, when the school bell rang. ""My boy came down the stairs just as I was about to leave and I quickly asked the head teacher 'can you stop that boy?'"" Ms Catterson cast Connor in theNo Knives, Better Lives,externalfilm but she also sent his picture to Michael O'Brien at Model Team Glasgow. She says: ""Within seconds of pressing send on the email my phone rang and Michael said 'Where is he? I want him in the office'."" Connor (second left) was cast in a No Knives, Better Lives video in 2015 O'Brien says as soon as he opened the email the hairs on his arm stood up. ""He just looked completely different to everybody,"" he says. Connor was feeling worse for wear on a Saturday morning when he got his first call from O'Brien. ""I thought he was joking,"" says the teen model. ""I was going to hang up the phone."" Connor with Paris Hilton at a fashion show after-party O'Brien wasted no time in signing him up and sent a taxi to collect straight away. He says: ""Before I'd even met him I sent the images down to some friends in London."" ""Then the phone started ringing and, to be honest, it has never stopped."" Within days, O'Brien had to phone up Connor while he was doing a Maths test at school and tell him to make his excuses to his teacher because he had a GQ magazine photo-shoot in London. Within weeks, he was shooting ""editorial"" for magazines in Paris, Milan, and Barcelona. In the fashion word, editorials are a photo-shoot that often includes magazine front covers and several pages of differing fashion looks inside. Connor was thrust into the big time immediately and admits it was a strange world to find himself in. Connor in one of his many from cover appearances Before his big break, Connor was considering joining the Army like his older brother Andrew. Their mother is a home-help and their father works in the Govan shipyards. Connor's dad is concerned that modelling is not a career that will last. He says: ""It does not take much talent to become a model. ""If you've got the look and know how to stand for the camera then fair enough. I don't look upon it as a career. ""Maybe I should but I wouldn't like it to last five years and then he's dumped and suddenly he's packing shelves in Asda."" Connor (right) with his older brother Andrew Connor's older sister Denise is amazed that someone from Govan can be a top model. She says: ""It does not really happen to people from round here."" Connor can hardly believe it himself. He says he first realised the scale of it when he was walking around the Duomo Square in Milan and started to browse the magazine racks. It is a strange feeling, he says, to look at stars such as Ben Stiller, Leonardo DiCaprio, Rihanna and Justin Bieber and then see your own face alongside them. However, for some reason this young Scottish lad suddenly had model agents around the world vying for him. International fashion designers Dean and Dan Caten, from the global brand Dsquared, chose Connor for their ""classic collection"". Dan says: ""It was because the collection is quite tailored and proper. By using a face like his, it is a contrast. "" According to Dean: ""He's not the bad boy he looks like. He's the sweetest boy with a bad boy face."" The BBC documentary follows Connor to Madrid where he works with photographer Eugenio Recuenco. The photographer says: ""Because he has such an angular face, any small gesture he makes in front of the camera can give such completely different sensations. ""He can be someone sweet but equally he can be someone strong."" ""With a simple small movement of his face and then add lighting into the mix. With him the sky is the limit."" Recuenco adds: ""He plays a kind of character. He's more of an actor. You can make him play whoever you want him to play."" Acting is something Connor wants to get into and he has been taking lessons but for now he is continuing to ride the wave of modelling fame. Michael O'Brien says: ""He became a phenomenon. He's probably one of the most successful boys Scotland has ever produced."" But despite his phenomenal success Connor says he could never be ""arrogant or stuck-up"". ""Even if I wanted to be my mum would kick my arse,"" he says. Scotland's model teenager is on BBC One on Monday 14 August at 19:30.

Do Indians still care about the British?,"Seventy years since India gained its independence from the British Empire, the UK is seeking a closer trading relationship. But what do modern Indians think about the British? I have an intimate family connection to the independence movement in India. It is not something I normally talk about because it is nothing to be proud of - quite the opposite. But as India celebrates 70 years of independence, this personal link has got me thinking about India's complex and often contradictory attitudes to Britain. What India thinks of us is arguably more important now than ever before, given how much the British government is pinning on our future relationship with this vast and increasingly mighty nation. Theresa May chose India as her first major overseas visit as prime minister very deliberately. As Britain looks towards its post-Brexit future, it is reaching out to India for support. The prime minister hopes that refreshing the UK's trading ties with our former colony can form a major part of the country's new global economic strategy. But India's response to her overtures has been distinctly tepid, and perhaps with good reason. British-era buildings still dominate some parts of New Delhi It has just rained when I drop in on the diplomat and MP Shashi Tharoor at his large, whitewashed colonial bungalow in South Delhi. Insects throb in the humid evening and Delhi's incessant traffic roars in the distance. I'm led through the dripping garden to the former under-secretary general of the United Nations' book-lined study, where he greets me with a warm smile. He happily acknowledges that the legacy of British rule here in India has helped shape the attitudes and tastes of the tens of millions of English-speaking Indians. ""So much of what we take for granted in our daily life - the books we read, the way we eat, sometimes the way we dress, our habits and cultural allusions - have come from colonialism, British institutions and the English language,"" he tells me. Justin Rowlatt holds a picture of his great-grandfather Sidney Rowlatt ""Most Indian nationalists used to enjoy reading PG Wodehouse - loved playing and following the game [of] cricket, for example. ""In fact, cricket - and beating the British at cricket - became a great trope of Indian nationalism,"" he laughs mischievously. He even praises Britain for introducing India to the delights of tea - ""now our national drink, to all intents and purposes"". Yet Shashi Tharoor is perhaps the most vocal and potent critic of Britain's imperial legacy around today. A speech he made at the Oxford Union in 2015 demanding Britain atone for its wrongs in India became a social media sensation. It has been viewed more than four million times online, prompted a wide debate in the British and Indian media and even earned him the praise of a political enemy - the Indian Prime Minister, Narendra Modi. The impact of his address persuaded him to write a book, published earlier this year, and - in Britain - called Inglorious Empire. He felt compelled to write it, he says, because of the ""moral urgency of explaining to today's Indians why colonialism was the horror it turned out to be"". The Victoria Memorial in Kolkata is another relic of the the colonial days There's no doubt that there is anger and resentment in India at the indignities and brutality of empire. But the truth is few Indians appear to bear grudges against the British today. I should know, because a draconian law written by, and named after, my great-grandfather was the cause of one of the most notorious atrocities in British colonial history. The law was known as the Rowlatt Act and led directly to the appalling massacre at Amritsar on 13 April 1919. Gandhi, then a rather marginal figure among India's nationalist leaders, launched his first ""satyagraha"" - campaign of non-violence - in protest at the Rowlatt Act. Sidney Rowlatt's law was immensely unpopular in India The law suspended basic civil liberties for those suspected of plotting against the Empire and meant you could be imprisoned without trial for up to two years simply for having a seditious newspaper. That is why thousands of Indians were in the walled garden of Jallianwala Bagh that day. Urged by Gandhi, they were there to express their disgust and fury at the legislation my great-grandfather, Sidney Rowlatt, had authored. Almost a century on, it is worth remembering just how shameful the events at Amritsar were. I went to the scene of the massacre for the first time last week. It was one of the most moving experiences of my life. Sukumar ""SK"" Mukherji, the chairman of the Jallianwala Bagh board, led me through a narrow passageway and into the garden. The Amritsar massacre was a turning point in Indian history This is the route the commander of British forces, Brigadier General Reginald Dyer, took with his 90 troops. Mr Mukherji tells me how his grandfather, who was there on the day of the massacre, remembered how they formed into two semi-circles, aiming out into the crowd and blocking the only exit. Without warning they opened fire. Sashti Charan Mukherji ducked behind a stage that sheltered him from the hail of bullets, but he later recounted how the soldiers had aimed directly at the protesters. They maintained the fusillade for 10 minutes, firing 1,650 rounds and killing at least 379 people (unofficial Indian sources put the numbers higher). There were 1,137 injured. The massacre was portrayed in the 1982 film Gandhi His grandson shows me the well where many people dived for cover. They recovered 120 bodies from there. As we turn back to the garden, Mr Mukherji says his grandfather recalled how, their ammunition now almost exhausted, the general ordered his troops to pack up and leave. They offered no aid to the injured. Dyer then ordered a curfew, threatening to shoot any Indian seen out on the streets. The wounded were left writhing in agony on the ground, says Mr Mukherji. I'm astonished he appears to feel no animosity towards me. ""You feel shame, so I feel no anger towards you,"" he says. So what does this tell us about Indian attitudes to Britain? Well, the Amritsar massacre was a key turning point in Indian history. The historian AJP Taylor called it ""the decisive moment when Indians were alienated from British rule"". As a result, the Rowlatt Act and its role in the independence movement is part of the history syllabus for all Indian children. According to the course book used by tens of millions of Indian students, ""it was the Rowlatt Satyagraha that made Gandhiji into a trulynationalleader."" I was worried, when I came out to India two-and-a-half years ago with my wife and children, that our family name would be a burden. Wouldn't being a scion of an emblem of imperial evil be a handicap in my new role as the BBC's South Asia correspondent? The answer is it hasn't been. Not at all. I've never experienced anger, even disapproval. Former UK Prime Minister David Cameron visits Amritsar, 2013 A powerful explanation was given to me by none other than Mahatma Gandhi's great-grandson, Tushar Gandhi, when I met him outside the house in Delhi his famous ancestor used to live in. He offered gratitude, not hostility. ""I appreciate your great-grandfather's role to provide the first nail in the coffin of the Empire,"" Tushar says with a laugh as we shake hands. It's a backhanded compliment. He explains why the law my great-grandfather wrote was so important to the Mahatma. ""The beauty of the Rowlatt Act was that he didn't have to be a spin doctor to make people understand that it was unjust,"" he says. ""It was so transparently malicious in intent that he could use it to create anger, to create resentment but then channel it towards the kind of protest he wanted it to be - a peaceful protest."" And, Tushar believes, it is the fact that the Indian opposition to the British was non-violent that is the key to understanding why there is not more resentment and anger between the two nations. ""It allowed us to believe we had won independence,"" he says. ""And it let the British console themselves by saying 'we were benevolent by giving them independence'."" But does that really explain the lack of rancour? When I ask Mr Tharoor what he thinks, he says the answer that flatters Indians is the one reportedly given by the first Prime Minister of India, Jawaharlal Nehru, when Winston Churchill asked him why he didn't feel more bitterness about all the years of imprisonment he'd suffered at the hands of the British. ""I was taught by a great man, Mahatma Gandhi, never to fear and never to hate,"" Nehru is said to have replied. ""I wish that were the full explanation,"" says Mr Tharoor. ""But I think there is a less flattering explanation, which is that forgive and forget is possible because we forget far too soon. ""I do believe we should forgive because hatred is a terrible emotion... but forgetting is unforgivable. I would say face up to the past, know it, but keep it in the past."" Special report: Partition 70 years on And, in that context, it is instructive to compare how the 70th anniversary of independence and the partition of India is being reported in India and in Britain. In India it is not a big story. Yes, the day will be marked by a speech from Prime Minister Narendra Modi at the magnificent Red Fort in the middle of Delhi. There have been articles and television discussions reflecting on the state of the nation 70 years on, but nothing like the torrent of coverage the event is receiving in the UK. In Britain newspapers and television programmes will mark the anniversary with big features and special items, while the BBC and other broadcasters have commissioned a raft of documentaries and dramas - even a film. It isn't that India has forgotten its past - up to 50,000 people visit Jallianwala Bagh every day - it is just that the end of empire appears to be a far more compelling story in Britain than in India. And I am not sure the British desire to ""celebrate"" India's independence is entirely healthy. One senses that part of the fascination is a kind of self-flagellation. We wallow in our shame at the horrors of our legacy in part because it reminds of what we once were - a superpower. Enoch Powell spoke of the shared infatuation between Britain and India It is sobering to learn what young Indians think of Britain today. When I ask a group of 16 and 17-year-olds at Amity International School in Delhi which of the two countries is most powerful, all but one says India. This isn't just blind nationalism, they have solid reasons for their views. ""It is our economy that is growing a much faster rate,"" says Sarthak Sehgal. Doha Khan draws on history to justify her view, saying: ""Before Britain came to India it gave 22% of GDP to the world and when the British left we were no more than 4%. ""So I would say that India was much more important to Britain than Britain to India, even then."" Another girl says it is a question of demographics. ""India is the second largest population, so even by numbers India is much greater. ""We are young and we have great ideas,"" she says to giggles from her classmates. Across Delhi, Swapan Dasgupta echoes the teenagers' views. He is a member of the upper house of India's parliament, a senior journalist and an intimate of many senior figures in the ruling party, but he chooses a surprising figure as he seeks to explain Indian attitudes to the UK - Enoch Powell. The former minister was infamous for warning of the ""rivers of blood"" that would flow on British streets if immigration from Britain's former colonies was not restricted. According to Mr Dasgupta, Mr Powell loved India and once dreamt of becoming viceroy. He quotes a private conversation where the politician described the relationship between India and Britain as a ""shared infatuation"". ""There is certainly a love-hate relationship which binds the two,"" Mr Dasgupta reflects. ""Initially I think the hate factor was greatest. There is a lot of love, but increasingly what worries me is that there is a lot of indifference that has also crept into that relationship."" He fears the once passionate relationship is beginning to cool. ""Middle-class Indians today have a greater affinity with the United States than they have with the UK,"" he believes. More Indians study there, he says, and the impact of American popular culture is greater in India now. His analysis is damning. ""Post-The Beatles and the Rolling Stones,"" he says, ""the impact of British culture is probably limited to Downton Abbey and Upstairs Downstairs and things like that."" In part, of course, the decline in influence of Britain in India reflects the decline of British influence in the world more generally. Like Mr Tharoor, he cites cricket as the perfect example of India's changing relationship with the UK. Within five years of independence India had won its first Test, thrashing England by an innings and eight runs at Madras in 1952. The Indian takeover is now virtually complete, he believes. ""Cricket is an Indian game that was accidently invented in the British Isles,"" he says. ""The economy of cricket is undeniably Indian now. The money is all here in India."" And what is true of cricket is true of the Indian economy more generally. India is still a poor country in terms of per capita income, but the terms of trade with Britain have decisively changed. With its vast market of more than 1.25 billion people and steady economic growth of about 7% a year - India is in a powerful position in trade talks. In 2016 India had a $4.7bn trade surplus in its dealings with the UK. Tata became a major industrial employer in the UK The roots of the changing economic relationship run deep. When the visionary entrepreneur Jamshedji Tata was planning the iron and steel works he believed could be the backbone of Indian industrialisation way back in the late 19th Century, he touted the idea around the finance houses of London. None wanted to invest. ""As a desperate venture,"" the Times reported in 1921. ""The iron and steel project was offered to the Indian public and to everyone's amazement the sum needed was subscribed in a few days."" Tata's evolution has come full circle over the past century. As the owner of Jaguar Land Rover and Corus Steel, it is now the largest industrial employer in the UK. And, as well as Britain's most iconic car brands, it also has a firm grip on the national drink - Tata owns Tetley, the UK's largest tea business. Mr Tharoor chuckles when the subject of trade comes up. He argues that Indians who are angry about the wrongs committed by the British need not seek revenge. ""As the wheels of history turn, the cycles move on, you will find that history is its own revenge,"" he says with a smile. ""WatchingTheresa May come cap-in-hand to Indian businesses looking for Indian moneyto revive her post-Brexit economy is to my mind the best kind of revenge you could possibly want."" Which is not to say that Mrs May is wasting her time. Mr Dasgupta agrees that India's colonial history can still generate a sense of outrage and indignation. But Indians are, he says, practical people. ""There is a transactional attitude among Indians which is that, yes, there are uncomfortable facets of history but the question is how do we deal with it now? ""What's in it for us? As long as that extreme pragmatism rules the roost we can do business together."" Tech centres like Bangalore have grown massively India may be a very different nation now from the one the British left 70 years ago. It may be more interested in trade with behemoths like China and America than with the UK. But there is a special place in Indian hearts for Britain and the British. The abuses of empire, while not forgotten, have been - largely, anyway - forgiven. Mr Dasgupta summarises the changes succinctly. Cricket might now be, to all intents and purposes, an Indian game, ""but there is still an iconic status to beating England at Lord's"".

Invasion of the jellyfish: Is it time to get frying?,"The edible mauve stinger, Pelagia noctiluca, is found in all the world's warm and temperate oceans Jellyfish numbers have been increasing rapidly in the Mediterranean and one species that has long been a hazard for bathers there - the mauve stinger - is increasingly being seen around the British Isles. Now one marine biologist says if we can't beat them we should eat them. I'm hovering in a makeshift kitchen, watching one of Italy's most eminent marine biologists gleefully playing chef. Prof Silvio Greco is focused on the bubbling contents of a large pot. Dressed up for the part in chef's whites, traditional hat and red apron, the sustainable conservation expert is perfect for the role. ""In this water I have put lemon juice and vinegar. After boiling for a few minutes I will plunge it into this ice,"" he gestures, explaining how the hot water both sterilises, getting rid of bacteria, and destroys the stinging poison. What for some might be food hell has got my tastebuds jumping with curious excitement: we're about to eat jellyfish. For Greco, it's not the first time. ""I love seafood,"" he beams. ""Jellyfish remind me of oysters. When you eat them you experience an explosion of the sea on your tongue. They are, after all, 90% seawater."" Professor Greco swaps his laboratory for the kitchen as he cooks jellyfish Today he's enlisted the professional help of restaurant chef Marco Visciola, who confesses he's never cooked jellyfish before. He's going to fry it in a tempura batter made of potato, wheat and rice flours, mixed with sparkling water. ""No salt?"" I ask. ""Zero,"" he tells me. ""The jellyfish already has the salty flavour of the sea, so to bring out its flavour I've left the batter neutral."" This isn't some perverse chef's challenge, but part of a campaign that Greco is promoting at the Slow Fish festival. Held every two years at Genoa'sporto anticothe event encourages sustainable fishing and responsible consumption. There are at least four times as many jellyfish in the Mediterranean now as there were in 2004, with global climate change, pollution, and overfishing mostly to blame. And the message this cooking demo is sending out is: if you can't defeat them, eat them. ""The sea is full of them and it's a big problem for biodiversity,"" says Silvio Greco, describing jellyfish as rampant, opportunistic species that immediately take over any empty space in the water. He explains how their spread is devastating marine food chains and ecosystems, and how illegal fishing of natural jellyfish predators like tuna and turtles has left the coast clear for them to multiply. ""Now man,"" he concludes, ""must be the new predator of jellyfish."" It's an idea the UN's Food and Agriculture Organization is encouraging too. For years, fishermen have been finding their nets increasingly burdened with unwanted jellyfish that they simply throw back into the sea. Silvio Greco hopes this will change and says that sustainability aside, jellyfish is actually good for you: rich in protein and collagen, low in calories, and fat-free. Jellyfish is rich in protein and collagen At Slow Fish I discover the ""eat it to beat it"" approach isn't limited to the Mediterranean. There's a Caribbean delegation of fishers, researchers and marine biologists here to pool ideas on how to fight their worst invasive species: the lionfish. They are trying to get it on to menus from Mexico to Honduras, Costa Rica to Barbados. Its tender meat, which apparently tastes like snapper, certainly sounds more appetising than jellyfish. But the jellyfish cooking demo is, without a doubt, the biggest crowd-puller of the entire festival. As the tray of freshmedusa frittais passed around, eager fingers grab the piping hot morsels. I select my piece. The tempura is exquisite, cracking seductively between my teeth. I'd expected the jellyfish to be chewy like calamari, but it's squidgier. It might just be because I'm hungry but I really like it. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service or on Radio 4 on Saturdays at 11:30 BST A young woman exclaims it's ""surprisingly nice"" while a Taiwanese lady tells me jellyfish is a commonantipastoback home and she was curious to see what the Italians would do with it. The man beside me is unimpressed. ""The batter's nice but the jellyfish tastes of nothing and it's slippery,"" he grumbles. I ask a three-year-old what she thinks. ""Yummy or yucky?"" ""Yummy!"" she grins at me, chewing happily. She was probably hungry too. A curious crowd tries the jellyfish tempura (medusa fritta, in Italian) Marco Visciola has also made a boiled jellyfish salad with rice vinegar, sesame oil, carrot and cucumber - a traditional recipe a Japanese colleague gave him. Again I'm impressed, although I think jellyfish's neutral taste - or lack of taste - could lend itself to any decisive flavours. But Marco's sold. ""For me, it was a new experience and there were a lot of curious people,"" he enthuses, adding that he now plans to put locally caught jellyfish on his restaurant's summer menu. ""It's a novelty a chef can offers diners. I think it will become popular."" I'm not entirely convinced. But if you never want another seaside holiday to be ruined by a coastal jellyfish invasion, perhaps it really is time to stop fretting and start frying.

"'Raise your voices' about birth trauma, women urged","""I had an awful birth experience. But I didn't die. My baby didn't die... So why does that tale even need to be told?"" A blog about the trauma of childbirth,externalis being widely shared on social media - and it is prompting others to share their experiences. The Every Mum Should Know post has been viewed over 90,000 times. It's written by Sarah, a mum from Yorkshire, who began blogging to help cope with her feelings after the birth of her daughter, who is now almost two years old. In the blog, she says: ""Birth is not always a positive experience. And being honest about that should not be something that women are made to feel shame or guilt over. ""Expressing natural feelings of sadness or anger about a difficult birth doesn't mean that a new mother is ungrateful for a healthy baby, the opportunity for motherhood, or anything else."" Speaking at the beginning ofBirth Trauma Awareness Week,external, Sarah told BBC News: ""It isn't always about life or death - nearly losing a baby or your own life. It's also about the way you are treated during birth. ""I think one of the reasons new mums suffer in silence is that they think they have no right to feel traumatised if they leave hospital with a healthy baby."" Her own experience was a birth that began in a birthing pool but developed into an assisted delivery. She says they ""nearly lost"" her daughter a number of times. ""There was a general feeling of panic in the birthing room. I went from feeling really empowered to feeling completely out of control."" Things didn't improve when Sarah went home. ""I knew something wasn't right. I couldn't sleep. I was constantly in fear that my new baby would die if I stopped watching her sleep or listening for her breathing. ""I struggled on quietly, thinking this must just be what being a new mother feels like. ""It wasn't. It was hypervigilance: a common symptom seen with post-traumatic stress, where the body feels like it is constantly in danger and under attack."" Websites offering information and support about birth trauma: Birth Trauma Association,external Pandas Foundation,external Mind -  PTSD and birth trauma,external And you can join the discussion on ourFacebook page,external. It was only when her daughter was six months old, and Sarah felt she was struggling to wean her, that a health visitor spotted that things weren't right. She told Sarah: ""Your daughter's fine - but you're not."" Sarah says: ""Telling her that was the unravelling of me. I had a total breakdown. It took me months to even have the coping strategies to do the most basic things."" Sarah is still having counselling - and says she wishes she had known more about birth trauma before her delivery. ""No-one wants to scare 'the pregnant woman'. People assume that if you talk about anything negative, they'll be scared. ""It was my first child. It was hard -but everyone says motherhood it's hard - so I thought it must be me. ""I was asking myself: 'If others are coping really well, why am I not?'"" Women commenting on the blog agree the issue needs to be discussed more. One says: ""We need to break the taboo over talking about birth trauma and challenge the (persistent...) myth 'all that matters is a healthy baby'."" Someone else posted: ""I felt so much pressure to put on a 'happy face'""; while another added: ""I often suppress the full expression of my birth trauma story to keep others comfortable"". The Birth Trauma Association estimates a third of mothers experience some kind of traumatic response to childbirth. It says women can be affected by births where they or their baby were in danger - but that it can also happen if they feel out of control, or like they aren't being listened to. A spokeswoman said: ""The first port of call for a woman in this position is to go to their GP. We have lots of leaflets which can be printed off which explain symptoms - not all GPs know about post natal PTSD [post-traumatic stress disorder]."" But she said she wasn't surprised the blog was being widely shared. ""We constantly hear from women who have been traumatised by their birth experience. These women need help, but it's not always there."" Sarah says the reaction has been amazing. ""At the start it was just to get things out when I couldn't sleep; it was cathartic. This seemed like the only way I could process things. ""I felt silenced, like there wasn't anyone I could really share with. But people connecting with it makes me feel less alone. ""It made me feel I had my voice back. And I want it to encourage other women to raise their own voices again.""

Trump turns on Republican leadership,"Attorney General Jeff Sessions can take a deep breath. Donald Trump has found a new punching bag among Republican ranks - Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. In a series of tweets and comments over the past week the president has lashed out against the top-ranking Republican in the Senate, whose attempts to shepherd legislation to repeal and replace Obama-era healthcare reforms through his chamber spectacularly failed two weeks ago. The proximate cause of Mr Trump's ire was Mr McConnell's comment in a speech on Monday that the president may have ""excessive expectations about how quickly things happen in the democratic process"". ""Senator Mitch McConnell said I had 'excessive expectations', but I don't think so,"" the presidenttweeted,externalin reply. ""After 7 years of hearing Repeal & Replace, why not done?"" He followed that up with tweets saying Mr McConnell ""couldn't get it done,external"" and that he should ""get back to work,external"". ""You can do it!"" he added, in a bit of chummy enthusiasm. Then, on Thursday during a series of press events at his golf resort in Bedminster, New Jersey, the president told reporters he was ""very disappointed in Mitch"". He lambasted the senator for failing to get a healthcare bill to him on his ""first day"" in office. (What was that about ""excessive expectations"", again?) When pressed, he refused to say whether he thought Mr McConnell - who has been leader of Senate Republicans since 2007 - should step down. ""If he doesn't get repeal and replace done and if he doesn't get taxes done, meaning cuts and reform, and if he doesn't get a very easy one to get done, infrastructure - if he doesn't get them done, then you can ask me that question,"" the president said. This video can not be played Trump: Republicans haven't done their job Accomplishing just one of those legislative objectives, let alone all three, anytime soon will be a tall order for Mr McConnell, given the political realities in the Senate. Congress is out of session until September, at which point it will have to authorise new US debt - a political football in recent years -  and pass appropriations bills that will fund government operations after 1 October. Healthcare reform appears dead in the water - in part because, as Mr Trump has accurately pointed out, Republicans touted ""repeal and replace"" for seven years but were woefully unprepared to put that talk into action. Formulations for tax and infrastructure legislation are even less advanced. While Congress could tackle the issues in 2018, traditionally little gets accomplished in midterm election years, when politicians are focused on campaigning, not legislating. The president's recent snipes at Mr McConnell do appear to be having at least one tangible effect, however, as fellow Republican senators have rallied to the Kentuckian's side. Texas Senator John Cornyn, a high-ranking member of the Senate Republican team,tweeted,externalthat it takes a ""team effort"" to enact Mr Trump's legislative priorities. ""No one is more qualified than Mitch McConnell to lead Senate in that effort,"" he writes. Orrin Hatch of Utah, the longest-serving member of the upper chamber,said,externalMr McConnell has been ""the best leader we've had in my time in the Senate"". Thom Tillis of North Carolinapointed to,externalMr McConnell's unprecedented efforts to seat conservative Neil Gorsuch on the US Supreme Court. Dean Heller of Nevada, the most at-risk Republican senator facing re-election next year, said he looked forward to Mr McConnell's ""leadership"" on tax reform. Outside of the halls of Washington, however, all is not as rosy for the Republican leader. Sean Hannity of Fox News - who clearly has the president's ear - presaged Mr Trump's comments with his own Twitter blast on Wednesday night. ""YOU are a WEAK, SPINELESS leader who does not keep his word and you need to Retire!"" the news hosttweeted,external. Allen West, the congressman turned conservative gadfly, also chimed in that day, saying Mr McConnell was an ""abject failure"". Sean Hannity of Fox News has called for McConnell's resignation ""We were under a delusion that the Republican Party would actually do what's right,""he wrote,externalon his website. ""We know the progressive socialists of the Democrat Party will not. We're left with no other recourse: remove those who lie, deceive and betray the will of the people."" Roy Moore, a former state judge challenging incumbent Alabama Senator Luther Strange - Mr McConnell's handpicked candidate - in a special election primary this month, has railed against the ""McConnell slime machine"" andtouted,externalhis campaign as a means to ""send a message"" to the majority leader. McConnell-bashing isn't unique to this particular moment in history, of course. During the 2015-16 Republican presidential primary season, swipes at the majority leader were a regularapplause linefor candidates like Ted Cruz, who once called him a ""very effective Democratic leader"". Mr McConnell,like the turtle,externalhis critics often compare him to, has a tough shell, however, and continues on his slow, steady course long after firebrands like Mr Cruz have lost their heat. Now it's Donald Trump's turn to go after the veteran senator. The strategy could come at a cost, however. While the president may be trying to show his independence from members of a Washington establishment he's frequently disparaged - many of whom were late to embrace his presidential campaign - his fate is largely tied to the success of his Republican counterparts in Congress. Donald Trump still needs Mitch McConnell if he wants to get any legislative wins They are the ones who can deliver the lasting policy achievements - the big-ticket ""wins"" the president so obviously craves. They are the ones whose re-election next year could serve as an affirmation of the president's popularity with American voters. And they are the ones who someday could pass judgement on Mr Trump, should special counsel Robert Mueller present evidence of presidential misdeeds. While there's little indication that Mr McConnell and his fellow Republican insiders have any interest in turning on the president despite the tweets and taunts, there are ways Congress could rebuke Mr Trump if they saw fit. They could pass legislation - already being crafted in the Senate - making it harder for him to fire Mr Mueller. They could back-burner some of the president's more controversial priorities, like funding for a grand border wall, protectionist trade policies or immigration reform. They could slow-walk the confirmation of political nominees with personal ties to the president. Although Mr Trump has the Twitter megaphone and the cameras poised to catch his every utterance, there is risk in angering elder members of the Senate. Just ask Julius Caesar.

The DIY submariner caught up in a Danish mystery,"This video can not be played Madsen was filmed by a Danish TV crew escorted by police after his rescue Peter Madsen was once a kind of celebrity in Denmark and many seemed fascinated by the self-taught engineer who talked with enthusiasm about ocean exploration and space travel. The ""inventrepreneur"", as he described himself, was no stranger to being the focus of attention, with his life frequently featured in television and magazine reports. This media coverage helped build the image of a man who said his work was to ""challenge the ordinary"". His own crowd-funded submarine, the UC3 Nautilus - claimed by him to be the world's biggest privately-built submarine - catapulted Madsen to fame, and its 2008 launch in Copenhagen was the subject of much fanfare. That submarine is now a crime scene, and the once-feted Madsen is now in disgrace, convicted of murder and facing life in jail. He was arrested last August, in connection with the gruesome killing of Kim Wall, a respected 30-year-old freelance journalist whose body was found dismembered after she boarded the Nautilus to interview him. Born in 1971, Peter Madsen was six years old when his parents divorced. He went to live with his father - a man more than 30 years older than his mother who he described as authoritarian and violent. It was his father, however, that shared with him a fascination for wars and rockets. Madsen would devote his next decades to these interests. Kim Wall, seen on the Nautilus before her death He started studying engineering but reportedly abandoned the subject after he thought he had learned enough to build submarines and rockets. Friends described him to journalists as an eccentric person, who did not enjoy being contradicted and was uncompromising. His brother said he was ""his own greatest enemy"",externalwhile his wife, who reportedly divorced him earlier this year, has not talked to the media. Journalist Thomas Djursing, who in 2014 wrote a biography about Mr Madsen,told the Jyllands-Posten newspaper:,external""He is angry with God and everyone... He has a hard time getting along with other people - he has lofty ambitions and wants to do everything his way."" While building a submarine might seem challenging enough, after completing the 17m-long (56ft) Nautilus he moved on to a more lofty ambition: space exploration. An 'exceptional' journalist remembered What we know about macabre case He partnered with the architect Kristian von Bengtson, a former Nasa contractor, to form Copenhagen Suborbitals, a collective of amateur rocket-makers funded by donations and working with the aim of launching a manned rocket into space. But their co-operation fell apart in 2014 due to disagreements, blamed largely on Peter Madsen's behaviour. He went on to create Rocket Madsens Space Laboratory, competing with his former partners. ""My passion is finding ways to travel to worlds beyond the well-known,"" he wrote on the organisation's website. In 2015, after another dispute, this time with the group of volunteers maintaining the Nautilus, Peter Madsen said: ""You may think that a curse is lying on the Nautilus. That curse is me,""according to a statement on the website (in Danish).,external He added: ""There will not be peace on Nautilus for as long as I exist."" After months spent chasing Peter Madsen, Kim Wall took up his invitation for a trip on the Nautilus on 10 August 2017. She was never seen again, and her mutilated torso was discovered on a beach by a passing cyclist on 21 August. Her head, legs and clothing were found by police divers on 6 Octoberin bags weighed down with pieces of metal. This video can not be played Kim Wall's death - what we know so far Peter Madsen was rescued the morning after the trip as his vessel was sinking, and has, since then, given three versions of what happened. He initially told police that he had dropped off the reporter before the vessel began to go down. Then he said the submarine's 70kg (150lb) hatch fell on Ms Wall's head after a ""terrible accident"" on board, and that he dumped her body somewhere in Koge Bay, about 50km (30 miles) south of Copenhagen. Finally, he told police that the journalist had been killed by carbon monoxide poisoning inside the submarine while he was up on deck. He had initially denied cutting up her body but then admitted dismembering it and dumping the body parts in the sea. But he denied killing her. Court drawing shows Peter Madsen (L) on the first day of the trial in Copenhagen Madsen now faces a life sentence in jail, seen as unusual under the Danish criminal justice system. During the opening session of his trial last month, prosecutors said there was a suspicion that he had ""psychopathic tendencies"". Films found on his computer showed women being tortured and mutilated, they added, trying to make the case that the murder was premeditated. His defence, however, argued that there is no physical evidence against him.

What does North Korea really want?,"Kim Jong-un celebrated the successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile in July Long-standing tensions over North Korea's weapons programme have worsened after it tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. That prompted a new round of UN sanctions and an escalation of the war of words with the United States. As the provocations continue, what does Kim Jong-un really want to achieve? Given the escalating war of words between the US and North Korea, and Donald Trump's warning of ""fire and fury"" if Kim Jong-un overtly threatens the United States or launches missiles against the US territory of Guam, it is unclear how useful diplomacy is as tool for moderating regional tensions. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and other senior Trump administration officials have stressed the importance of diplomacy, and even Mr Trump has in the past offered to talk to Mr Kim, but there are no signs that the North Koreans are open to dialogue. This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' Recent informal track two level talks with North Korean officials in Europe suggest that Pyongyang is single-mindedly focused on continuing with its missile and nuclear-weapons testing programmes. Strikingly at the Asean Regional Forum meeting in Manila recently, there was no meeting between Mr Tillerson and Ri Yong-ho, the North Korean foreign minister, and a proposal for talks between Seoul and Pyongyang offered by Kang Kyung-wha, the South Korean foreign minister, was summarily rebuffed by the North Koreans. In principle, there are incentives that the US could offer the North, including talks on a peace treaty ending the Korean War, preliminary steps towards diplomatic recognition (such as the establishment of a US liaison mission in Pyongyang), or an agreement on conventional arms reductions on the peninsula, but these are at best long-term objectives. The North's repeated violations of past diplomatic agreements with the US has eroded any appetite for concessions in Washington where there is deep-seated distrust of the North on both sides of the political aisle and an assumption that pressure, via the latest round of tougher UN sanctions targeting the North's mineral and food exports, and restrictions on North Korean overseas labour, is the best way of bringing Pyongyang to heel. How worried should you be? Reality Check: Are Trump's assumptions right? Since coming to power in late 2011, Kim Jong-un's priorities have been focused consistently on two simple objectives of military modernization and delivering economic prosperity for the North Korean public. The North's nuclear aspirations date from the 1960s and are consistent with the regime's desire for political and military autonomy in the face of opposition not only from its traditional enemies such as the United States, Japan and South Korea, but also over the objections of its historical partners such as China and Russia. What damage could North Korea do? Kim Jong-un, North Korea's supreme commander Part of the North's motivation is a rational assessment of the country's strategic interests. The experience of Libya and Iraq is a reminder to Pyongyang that the only guarantee of national survival is the possession of a credible weapons of mass destruction capability. While Washington has expressed no ""hostile intent"" to the North, Pyongyang maintains that the United States, as a conventionally superior and nuclear armed power, with 28,000 troops in South Korea, and a policy of maintaining a first-use nuclear option, represents a clear threat to the country. This video can not be played North Korea's recent missile tests have escalated tensions in the region Mr Kim's nuclear and missile testing ambitions are also an expression of identity politics. The legitimacy of the Kim dynasty's political leadership is rooted in a narrative of defence against an implacably hostile United States. The 1950-53 Korean War, framed in North Korean propaganda as the result of direct US aggression, is used to depict the United States to the North Korean people as an adversary intent on destroying the country. For the country's older generation that recall US actions during the war, when virtually every urban centre in the North was obliterated by American bombing, this narrative is a convincing one and is routinely reinforced for the wider population in the state's daily political messages. Mr Trump's recent bellicose public statements are a propaganda gift to Kim Jong-un, allowing him to bolster his standing as the nation's commander in chief and protector of the country. Can the US defend itself? Can North Korea nuclear threat focus minds? The North's accelerated missile testing campaign and last year's two successful nuclear tests have materially enhanced the country's deterrent capabilities. Recent intelligence reports from the US have suggested that the country may have as many as 60 nuclear bombs (a figure disputed by some analysts) and its long-range missile tests of 4 and 28 July indicate that the North may have the capacity to hit parts of the United States. This video can not be played Former diplomat Victor Gao tells Radio 4's Today ""mankind will suffer"" if Trump attacks North Korea A recent report in the Bulletin of Atomic Scientists has questioned the extent to which this improved missile capability genuinely allows the North to deploy a nuclear warhead against the US, but there is little doubt that Pyongyang has made dramatic progress in the last year in securing full de-facto membership of the nuclear club. Washington, however, has made it clear that it will not recognize or tolerate such a development. To do so would offer a propaganda victory to the North, critically undermine America's relations with its key regional allies - Japan and South Korea - prompt a destabilizing arms race in the region, and destabilize the global nuclear non-proliferation regime. Trump's team mixed messages Who said what: Trump or Kim? Pyongyang's priority is to push ahead aggressively with testing, both of its missiles and its nuclear weapons, in an effort to solidify its deterrent capabilities. For Mr Kim, this makes sense as means of boosting his political authority and legitimacy at home. He can take comfort from China's apparent reluctance to impose crippling economic restrictions on the North, despite its recent support for tougher UN sanctions. This video can not be played North Koreans rally to denounce 'gangster' US He can also calculate rationally that ultimately the United States, as many experienced observers are arguing, will accept the need to negotiate some form of intermediate freeze in the North's military capabilities in the hope that this will stabilize the strategic situation while keeping the door open to future disarmament. By then, Mr Kim may hope he will be able to secure a range of concessions from the US and South Korea, whether in the form of economic assistance, conventional arms reductions, or more importantly the political respect and status as an independent, sovereign state that the North has long craved. The wild card in the current situation is how far President Trump's rhetorical brinkmanship will deter the North from pushing ahead with its missile testing programme. The North Korean military has threatened to test fire four intermediate range missiles in the vicinity of the US military facilities  on Guam later this month. No US President could tolerate a direct attack, but a test launch in the international waters close to the island would arguably represent a ""grey zone"" contingency that would require a more nuanced response, stopping short of full-blown military conflict. Discussions of the current stand-off have focused on the parallels with the Cuban Missile Crisis of 1962 and the strategic judgment of the US president at the time, John F Kennedy. His caution in seeking to avoid nuclear war was shaped by his reading of Barbara Tuchman's book The Guns of August and its insights into the lessons of World War One. It is ironic and telling that once again August is a time of acute strategic risk and uncertainty, when the rhetoric, assessments and actions of national leaders are likely to carry profound significance for regional and global security.

Perseid meteor shower to be seen over UK,"Meteors captured above the Jill Windmill in West Sussex early on Sunday The Perseid meteor shower has been seen over parts of the UK, giving stargazers the opportunity to spot scores of shooting stars in the sky. The shower was due to peak in the UK on Saturday night, in a display also visible in other parts of the world. Stargazers took to social media to say they had seen the display, in which 100 meteors had been expected an hour. The Perseid meteor shower occurs every July and August as the Earth passes debris from the Swift-Tuttle comet. BBC News website reader Keith Trueman captured the meteor shower against the background of the Milky Way on Exmoor Bob Girling witnessed this impressive sight above Chilton, Oxfordshire, at around 23:20 BST Michiko Smith took a series of photos, including this one, from her back garden in Normanton, West Yorkshire Relatively clear skies above Ide, near Exeter, gave Alan Saunders a chance to photograph the meteor shower from his house Darren Felgate said this was taken from his back garden near the cricket ground in Scarborough A Perseid meteor passing through the constellation of Ursa Major was photographed by Brian Gibson from his back garden in Milngavie, Glasgow at 23:03 BST Former England cricketer Paul Collingwood was among those who attempted to spot the meteors. He tweeted that the shower had been ""impressive"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Experts had warned that the Perseids may have been harder to see this year as the Moon was three-quarters full. But Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said the weather had given stargazers a good opportunity to see the meteor shower. He said: ""There were some good cloud breaks, so many areas would have had a good chance to see them during the early hours. It would have been pretty good viewing."" Robin Scagell, vice president of the Society For Popular Astronomy, added that although the intensity of the display had peaked on Saturday (12 August), the meteor shower would still be visible until 20 August. He said: ""For the next few days you could expect to see some - but decreasing numbers. So tonight will be probably the best chance of seeing them if you missed them last night."" The best place to see the meteors was under a clear sky, away from built-up areas, he said.

The family who brought an Indian sweet to Pakistan,"Ahmar Mehmood now runs the family business selling sweets in Mardan The Indian city of Badaun and the city of Mardan in Pakistan are separated by 1,200km of territory, a vicious communal divide and a heavily militarised border. But Mardan's chief sweet delicacy - the Badauni pedha - still holds the aroma and the taste of a shared past. And this has been made possible by a migrant family of semi-literate farmers who say they went into the pedha business because they ""didn't know anything better to do"". Pedhas are grainy balls of condensed milk, or khoa, mixed with sugar and spices. They are believed to have originated in Varanasi and Mathura and have been used as religious offerings, or prasad, in Hindu temples. While the delicacy spread to various parts of India early on, its advent in northwestern Pakistan dates to 1950 when a couple of villagers from India's Bareilly district set up a shop in Mardan. The ambience of the shop is not dissimilar to most traditional sweet outlets across India and Pakistan; it is small and untidy, housed on the ground floor of a narrow, ramshackle three-storey building. The factory is located on the first floor. But trading is brisk for a small city like Mardan; a salesman says they sell an average of 200kg of pedhas a day, besides other sweets. Asked to set out his special recipe, Mehmood Ali Khan just smiled. But here's one way to make it: Condense milk with a special mixture of spices over a slow flame into a thick lump, called khoa Shape the mixture into a ball and dip in sugar Spice ingredients could include green cardamom, almonds and pistachios A hand-painted signboard hangs from the second storey, covering the entire front of the building. Besides the name of the shop - Badauni Pedha House - it carries a portrait of Mehmood Ali Khan, the owner, who is introduced as ""Baba-e-Zaiqa"", or the ""father of flavour"". But Mr Khan, 78 and now retired, says he is not the original founder of the business. He was just eight years old when India was divided. ""When partition happened, two of my seven brothers - the eldest and the one at number four - decided to migrate to Pakistan,"" he says. ""They said they would assess the situation and make arrangements for the rest of the family to relocate. But they faced problems - they couldn't find anything they could do for a living. So my elder brother, Ibn-e-Ali Khan, decided to introduce Badauni pedhas in Mardan."" Mehmood Ali Khan, seen here with his grandson, ran the pedha shop for years Mehmood Ali Khan came to Pakistan in 1959, when he was 20 Back then, local consumers were strangers to the taste of a north Indian pedha. Also, Ibn-e-Ali's pedha was still some years from mimicking the addictive, mildly sweet milky tinge of the Badauni variety. After a year their mother, a widow, started to fret. ""She said that the family ought to stay together; that either my two brothers came back to Sirauli (the family's native village in Bareilly district), or everyone went to Pakistan."" Under the rules of partition his brothers, having migrated, could not return to India as Indian nationals, and they still did not have Pakistani passports to travel as visitors. So the family decided that two more brothers, third-eldest Mehfuz Ali Khan and fifth-eldest Mohammad Ali Khan, should join them in Pakistan to expedite a final plan. Perhaps the biggest movement of people in history, outside war and famine. Two newly-independent states were created - India and Pakistan. About 12 million people became refugees. Between half a million and a million people were killed in religious violence. Tens of thousands of women were abducted. This article is part of a BBC series looking at Partition 70 years on. Read more: Partition 70 years on: The turmoil, trauma - and legacy Special report: Partition - 70 years on But the family was not destined to reunite under one roof until the mid-1960s. In the meantime, the four brothers who had moved to Pakistan filed claims for land compensation in lieu of what they said they had left behind in India. The claims were filed under a refugee resettlement plan devised by both India and Pakistan - believed to be one of the largest in modern history. And some time in the early 1950s, the pedha business started to pick up. ""The only expertise Ibn-e-Ali had brought to pedha making was a farmer's knowledge of how to make khoa,"" says Mr Khan. ""We had grown up having buffaloes in our cattle pen and had watched the womenfolk condense leftover milk over a low flame. What he didn't know was the exact recipe, the spices."" This knowledge came in the early 1950s when, having received their Pakistani passports, Mehfuz Ali Khan and Mohammad Ali Khan went back to Sirauli. There they practiced sweet-making at some local outlets, and then went to train at Badaun's signature pedha shop, set up by the famous Mamman Khan. ""They arranged an apprenticeship at Mamman's shop through our relatives in Bareilly. The shop owner was loath to train potential competitors, but agreed to share the secret recipe after Mehfuz Ali Khan gave him his word that he would do business in Pakistan, not India. They trained at Mamman's shop for a couple of months before returning to Mardan."" Family members served an apprenticeship at Mamman Khan's shop in Badaun As the land claims of the brothers started to mature, it was time for the mother and two youngest brothers - the youngest of all, Mohammad Wali Khan, and Mr Khan, the second-youngest - to migrate to Mardan. ""That was 1959. I was just 20 then. Our second-eldest brother, Mehboob Ali Khan, stayed back in Sirauli to sell off our holdings and clear debts. He migrated in 1964."" By this time, most of the brothers had moved to the land allotted to them in Dera Ismail Khan area, leaving the pedha business to young Mehmood Ali Khan. The friendship that survived the division of a nation A Country Divided Cyril Radcliffe: The man who drew the partition line Mr Khan's son, Ahmar Mehmood, who now runs the business, says that for most members of the family the pedha business was just a means to survive until they went back to farming. ""They considered it a lowly profession (given a general feudal mindset), but lived with it perhaps because they thought it was easy,"" he says. ""But my father made a conscious decision to stick to this business. He came to Pakistan after the deadline for property claims had lapsed, and the business was doing well by then."" The shop in Mardan has stood for decades, serving a little taste of India Lots of pedha shops have sprung up in Mardan, often run by Mr Khan's former staff But why would a landowning family abandon its place of birth and move to a country of strangers, especially when there were no serious communal riots in their region, and the family did not owe any ideological commitment to the ranks of All India Muslim League which had campaigned for a separate Muslim state in India? Mr Khan is not very clear. ""I don't know what went into their heads. They screwed us too,"" he gives out a hearty laugh. One reason may be that he was very young at the time and did not know what was going on. Also, the family had suffered reverses in its fortunes and may not have remained as affluent as it once was. ""My grandfather had six sons. He was a big landowner in Saidpur (a village in Badaun district). My father died when my grandfather was still alive, which meant that (in accordance with Islamic inheritance law) we were left without a right to our father's share in our grandfather's property. So we moved with our mother to Sirauli (which was her ancestral village)."" This would explain the restlessness of the brothers to move out, and the anxiety of the mother to keep the family together even if it meant migrating to a strange land. But nostalgia for the past survives in the family. Ahmar, who was born in Mardan, calls himself Ahmar Badayuni on his Facebook page. He has been to India a number of times to meet his relatives, mostly with his mother, who died recently. ""When I'm in Bareilly, I'm always bewildered when I imagine how the family got split right through the middle. The love we get there feels like a different kind of love. Sometimes I do ask my father why they decided to leave that place. It would have been good if we stayed."" But the family hasn't done badly in Pakistan either. Most of them acquired land and went back to farming. One brother went to college and retired as a professor. And Mr Khan owns a cosy house in the affluent Sham Ganj area of Mardan. And while they may have suffered trials and tribulations, they did manage to bring with them one of the most enduring legacies of the region they left behind - the grainy balls of condensed milk and spices mixed to a secret recipe of Badaun's Mamman Khan.

The weird and wonderful world of pub games,"""As long as there were pubs and inns there were always games,"" says historian and 'doctor of darts' Patrick Chaplin. While his PhD is in the social history of that pursuit, the world of pub pastimes is far from restricted to the dartboard or the pool table. Anyone for a spot of dwile flonking or a game of devil among the tailors? Although the similarities are not immediately evident, bat and trap is said to be a forerunner of cricket This game, which is played in the pub gardens of Kent, involves batsmen or women hitting a rubber ball that is fired upwards from a mechanical device - the trap. Players attempt to strike the ball between posts at the other side of a pitch where the opposing team's fielders are positioned. Smart attire and moustaches were de rigueur when the Canterbury & District Bat & Trap League was formed in 1921 Andy Mitchell, vice chairman of Canterbury & District Bat & Trap League, says the game is a forerunner of cricket. ""The pitch is 22 yards long, which is the same length as a cricket wicket,"" he explains. ""It's the only sport that I know of - and I use the term sport loosely - whereby you score runs without moving, so for a rather rotund fellow like myself it's great."" This video can not be played Countryfile presenter Ellie Harrison learning how to play bat and trap The league claims the game was once played by monks, and records show contests have been staged at Ye Old Beverlie in Canterbury - where the BBC's Countryfile team played a match in 2011 - since the 16th Century. ""Visitors from overseas find it absolutely fascinating,"" Mr Mitchell says. A youthful-looking David Cameron prepares to disturb a dolly at the 2011 Charlbury Beer Festival This team game involves players throwing sticks at a small wooden block called a dolly, as they try to knock it off a short pole. Arthur Taylor, author of Played at the Pub, suggests Aunt Sally - which is played in Oxfordshire and parts of Buckinghamshire - has rather grisly origins. ""It can be traced back to a barbarous business called 'throwing at cocks', when you threw sticks at a cock tethered to a post that if you killed you took home,"" he says. ""What was barbarous turned into something that wasn't, and the cock became a coconut shy... and eventually it became the game we know."" Nick Millea, organiser of the Charlbury Beer Festival, which hosts the grandiosely-titled Aunt Sally World Championships, describes it as a ""really sociable game"". ""It's a chance for a load of people to get together and do a harmless thing like throw sticks at a little round white thing in the distance - dead simple,"" he says. Then prime minister David Cameron gave Aunt Sally a go at the festival in 2011, and Mr Millea believes the game is here to stay. ""It's so embedded in the Oxfordshire psyche; it's got to live on."" Devil among the tailors: A swinging good time for all Alongside another traditional game, shove ha'penny, this venerable pub pastime features in a memorable scene in The Beatles film A Hard Day's Night as an absent-minded Ringo Starr's beer glass is smashed by a swinging ball. Devil among the tailors is one of many variations of table skittles, which is claimed to be a forerunner to tenpin bowling. Another variant is Northamptonshire skittles, in which players throw ""cheeses"" at the skittles and bounce them off the table's cushions. Karen Murden, landlady of the Stag Inn in Kimberley, Nottinghamshire, is the proud owner of a devil among the tailors table. ""It's a very old, traditional pub,"" she says. ""We put older, traditional games in it rather than flashing lights and music. ""I inherited the table. It belonged to a previous landlord who had it as a boy, so it's probably 90 to 100 years old."" She describes devil among the tailors as a ""very light-hearted"" game, although she says the atmosphere can be ""exciting and loud"" when someone pulls off a flashy trick shot. ""It's nice that the younger generation hasn't seen anything like it. To them it's new and novel, and they want to get stuck in and have a go."" Dwile flonkers are happy to wield a ""driveller"", but the last thing they want is a ""swadger"" While a tongue-in-cheek 1967 Pathe clip describes dwile flonking as an ""age-old custom"", pub game historians are agreed its origins are relatively recent. ""This is a new development,"" Dr Chaplin says. ""Like how most pub games originated, it was an automatic response to boredom."" He says the game - also called dwyle flunking - was ""probably invented by students"", while Mr Taylor believes ""printers' apprentices back in the 1960s"" came up with the pastime. It involves a dish cloth, or ""dwile"", dipped in a bucket of beer which is then ""flonked"" at a member of the opposing team from a stick, or ""driveller"", as he or she  dances in a circle. This video can not be played This Pathe clip from 1967 shows revellers enjoying the pub garden game of dwile flonking The points scored depend on where on the body a person is hit, with a head shot naturally worth top marks. A miss is termed a ""swadger"". For a forfeit, the ""flonker"" sometimes has to drink a pot of beer before the dwile is passed around the circle. It is a messy traditionat the Lewes Arms pub,external, in East Sussex, which states that the ""rules are impenetrable and the result is always contested"". The game is also played in parts of Suffolk and Norfolk, where the Waveney Valley championships were held in May at The Locks Inn in Geldeston. You can't beat a bit of bully This game, whose origins are shrouded in the mists of time, is still played at Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem, in Nottingham, which claims to be the oldest inn in England. It involves competitors trying to attach a ring suspended on a string from the ceiling on to a hook, traditionally a bull's horn. ""Nobody knows its origins,"" Mr Taylor says. ""It's been around for centuries. It's so simple it can appear anywhere. ""Twenty years ago I walked into a pub near Oldham and this massive game was on at Christmas time. It'd been brought by a lorry driver who'd seen it in a pub in Newark-on-Trent. ""I've seen it literally all over. It pops up like a mushroom."" This video can not be played Ringing the bull is still played at Ye Olde Trip To Jerusalem in Nottingham The game, which hasalso surfaced in the United States,external, is described by Dr Chaplin as ""very difficult"". ""You don't know where the ring's going to go unless you're an expert,"" he says. ""It's potentially dangerous."" Top tossing is the order of the day to triumph at toad in the hole As well as being the name of a much-loved English sausage-in-batter dish, toad in the hole is also a coin-tossing game played in East Sussex. Players of the game - which shares similarities with another tossing game, pitch penny - launch coins on to a lead-topped table with a hole in the centre. ""I'm fascinated by the game,"" Mr Taylor says. ""It was dying out, then 15 years ago a bunch of enthusiasts revived it and suddenly it became all the rage again."" Unlike pitch penny - where the tossers' target is a wooden bench with a hole carved into it - a game of toad in the hole is reasonably easy to organise. ""Pitch penny has almost completely gone because it relied on very old-fashioned pubs with very old-fashioned seating,"" Mr Taylor says. Garry Kaye, who plays for The Blacksmiths Arms in Offham as part of the Lewes & District Toad in the Hole League, says the game took off again because ""quite a few pubs had tables in them and a few teams put them in their cars and visited other pubs.

"Watch your words, China urges Trump","This video can not be played President Trump says North Korea will be in ""big, big trouble"" if it acts against Guam China's President Xi Jinping has urged Donald Trump and North Korea to avoid ""words and actions"" that worsen tensions, state media say. Mr Trump and North Korea have been exchanging hostile rhetoric, with the US president threatening to rain ""fire and fury"" on the North. But China, North Korea's only major ally, has been urging restraint. A White House statement said the US and China agreed North Korea must stop ""provocative and escalatory behaviour"". A statement by North Korea's official KCNA news agency issued on Saturday said the Trump administration ""had better talk and act properly,"" if it did not want ""the American empire to meet its tragic doom"". Long-standing tensions over North Korea's nuclear programme worsened when it tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The regime was also angered by last week's UN decision to increase economic sanctions against it. Trump's long nuclear obsession North Korea's neighbours consider risk of war The North Korea crisis in 300 words According to Chinese state media, Mr Xi told Mr Trump in a phone call that ""all relevant parties"" should stop ""words and deeds"" that would exacerbate the situation. Mr Xi also stressed China and the US shared ""common interests"" over denuclearisation and maintaining peace on the Korean peninsula. This video can not be played Video of a phone call from Donald Trump was posted by the governor of Guam, Eddie Calvo. A White House statement on the phone call did not mention the apparent plea to the US president. It stressed the two men enjoyed a close relationship, which would ""hopefully lead to a peaceful resolution of the North Korea problem"". President Trump has previously chided China for not reining in North Korea, saying it could do ""a lot more"". Tuesday:""North Korea, best not make any more threats to the United States,"" Mr Trump tells reporters. ""They will be met with fire and fury like the world has never seen"" Wednesday:Mr Trump boasts that the US nuclear arsenal is ""more powerful than ever"" Thursday:He says that his ""fire and fury"" warning maybe ""wasn't tough enough"". Asked what would be tougher than fire and fury, he replies, ""you'll see"" Friday:The US president warns that military solutions are ""locked and loaded"" should North Korea ""act unwisely"". Trump administration's mixed messages Who said it: Trump or Kim? North Korea has announced plans to fire missiles near the Pacific territory of Guam, but there is no indication an attack is imminent. On Friday, Mr Trump issued a fresh threat against North Korea, saying it should expect ""big, big trouble"" if anything happened to Guam. But he added: ""Hopefully, it will all work out. Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump, that I can tell you."" This video can not be played It's not the first time North Korea has made threats against Guam Mr Trump also called the governor of Guam on Friday to reassure him that his island was safe. ""We are with you 1,000%,"" Mr Trump said in the phone call, recorded and posted on YouTube by Governor Eddie Calvo. Pyongyang has accused Mr Trump of ""driving"" the Korean peninsula to the ""brink of a nuclear war"".

Norfolk Police has arrested a local man, in his 20s, on suspicion of murder and he remains in custody while inquiries continue.

The grandfather's body was found near to Fiveways Junction by a member of the public at about 10:45 BST. His dogs, Dylan and Gemma, were found close by. On Saturday, officers stopped cars to speak to people who may have been passing the murder scene around the time of the attack. There were also horse patrols in the village to reassure residents. A force spokeswoman said despite the arrest police were ""still appealing for anyone in the area at the time to contact them"". Horseback patrols have been taking place in East Harling to put villagers at ease In particular, detectives want anyone who may have spotted a black Ford Fiesta to get in touch. On Friday, police said they had traced one of three ""vital"" potential witnesses - a man in his 50s seen changing into a T-shirt - but they said they still wanted to speak to two other men. One is aged 25 to 30, with tanned skin, was was wearing a grey or blue t-shirt, grey gym shorts and heavy-duty flip flops. The other, aged 30 to 50, was wearing dark clothing and seen walking without a dog to the north of the heathland where Mr Wrighton had been walking. Det Supt Andy Smith, who is overseeing the inquiry, said on Friday that more than 220 people had been in touch. Search teams have used metal detectors and dogs, with more than 100 people working on the investigation.

Jogger push suspect eliminated from inquiry,"This video can not be played Putney Bridge: CCTV of jogger 'pushing' woman in front of bus A man arrested on suspicion of pushing a woman into the path of a bus while jogging has been eliminated from the investigation. Eric Bellquist, 41, was arrested on Thursday on suspicion of causing grievous bodily harm following the incident on London's Putney Bridge. His lawyer said Mr Bellquist ""categorically denied"" being the man seen in the video. The Met said he will face no further action. Mr Bellquist's lawyer added he had ""irrefutable proof"" he was in the US at the time. On Monday, CCTV footage was released showing the woman, 33, narrowly avoiding serious injury when she was pushed into the path of an oncoming bus by a jogger on 5 May. The footage shows a bus swerving to narrowly miss the woman. About 15 minutes later the jogger came back the other way across the bridge. The woman, who received minor injuries, tried to speak to him but he did not acknowledge her and carried on jogging.

UKIP MEP quits over anti-Islam candidate,"Mike Hookem said he 'strongly disagrees' with the views of Anne Marie Waters A senior UKIP MEP has resigned as deputy whip in the European Parliament over support within the party for an anti-Islam campaigner. Anne Marie Waters, who founded the Sharia Watch pressure group and has called Islam ""evil"", has been allowed tostandin UKIP's leadership election. Mike Hookem said he was not prepared to ""turn a blind eye"" to extremism. He resigned after UKIP chief whip Stuart Agnew declared his support for Ms Waters. In a letter to interim UKIP leader Steve Crowther - sent before Ms Waters was passed by the party's national executive as a leadership candidate - Mr Hookem said he was ""disturbed"" by Mr Agnew's support. In a later statement, he elaborated: ""I strongly disagree with the views Ms Waters and Mr Agnew promote and I would like to put as much distance between me and them as possible."" He said he was not a racist and would not support someone ""who seeks to single out a section of our society simply due to their religious beliefs"". Mr Hookem subsequently told the BBC News Channel: ""I believe she should not be in the party and she should not be standing as a candidate. ""She could not stand for a Westminster seat because she was not a member of good standing. ""She could not stand as a Police and Crime Commissioner as she was not a member of good standing - and now suddenly she's standing for the top job."" Mr Hookem continued: ""It doesn't make sense. God forbid she does become leader."" He said he would not quit the party if Ms Waters was elected, but he would not support her. Ms Waters believes her anti-Islam message, including a proposed ban on the burka, the closure of all Sharia councils and a temporary freeze on all immigration, will strike a chord with many voters. Anne Marie Waters has said Sharia courts ""treat women like absolute dirt"" But fellow MEP Nathan Gill has said he would leave the party if she became leader. ""She shouldn't be a member of this party, but we are where we are,"" he said. ""If she was elected, I would have to leave."" Former leader Nigel Farage has warned that UKIP will be ""finished"" if it becomes an anti-Islam party. But the party's deputy leader, Peter Whittle, said it was right that Ms Waters be allowed to stand. Mr Whittle - who is also competing to be leader - said she had passed the vetting process. Former Tory aide renews call for anti-Brexit part Anti-Islam candidate to stand for UKIP leadership Call to deselect UKIP AM Michelle Brown rejected ""If you get through that then you should be allowed to stand,"" he said. Mr Whittle told the Today programme he was concerned by the number of Sharia courts in the UK. ""There is one law in this country and that is British law,"" he said, denying it was an anti-Islamic viewpoint. He added that he was for a ""cohesive multi-ethnic society ... united under British values and British laws"", adding that multiculturalism had led to ""a more fragmented society"". Peter Whittle is one of 11 candidates standing in UKIP's leadership contest Voting papers will be sent to party members over the next few weeks and the new leader will be announced at the party's annual conference in Torquay, held on 29 and 30 September. Mr Whittle and Ms Waters are among 11 candidates vying to be leader after Paul Nuttall - who has previously said Ms Waters' views made him ""uncomfortable"" -stood down after UKIP's poor performance in June's general election. The 11 candidates are (in alphabetical order): David Allen Henry Bolton David Coburn Jane Collins David Kurten Marion Mason Aidan Powlesland John Rees-Evans Ben Walker Anne Marie Waters Peter Whittle Anti-Islam campaigner launches UKIP bid Ex-Davis aide: Brexit is 'a calamity' UKIP leadership hopeful 'too extreme' Paul Nuttall quits as UKIP leader At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Watch: Ferocious and explosive fire burns behind CBS reporter 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Perseid meteor shower set to peak,"Meteors captured above the Jill Windmill in West Sussex early on Sunday The Perseid meteor shower has been seen over parts of the UK, giving stargazers the opportunity to spot scores of shooting stars in the sky. The shower was due to peak in the UK on Saturday night, in a display also visible in other parts of the world. Stargazers took to social media to say they had seen the display, in which 100 meteors had been expected an hour. The Perseid meteor shower occurs every July and August as the Earth passes debris from the Swift-Tuttle comet. BBC News website reader Keith Trueman captured the meteor shower against the background of the Milky Way on Exmoor Bob Girling witnessed this impressive sight above Chilton, Oxfordshire, at around 23:20 BST Michiko Smith took a series of photos, including this one, from her back garden in Normanton, West Yorkshire Relatively clear skies above Ide, near Exeter, gave Alan Saunders a chance to photograph the meteor shower from his house Darren Felgate said this was taken from his back garden near the cricket ground in Scarborough A Perseid meteor passing through the constellation of Ursa Major was photographed by Brian Gibson from his back garden in Milngavie, Glasgow at 23:03 BST Former England cricketer Paul Collingwood was among those who attempted to spot the meteors. He tweeted that the shower had been ""impressive"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Experts had warned that the Perseids may have been harder to see this year as the Moon was three-quarters full. But Met Office forecaster Marco Petagna said the weather had given stargazers a good opportunity to see the meteor shower. He said: ""There were some good cloud breaks, so many areas would have had a good chance to see them during the early hours. It would have been pretty good viewing."" Robin Scagell, vice president of the Society For Popular Astronomy, added that although the intensity of the display had peaked on Saturday (12 August), the meteor shower would still be visible until 20 August. He said: ""For the next few days you could expect to see some - but decreasing numbers. So tonight will be probably the best chance of seeing them if you missed them last night."" The best place to see the meteors was under a clear sky, away from built-up areas, he said.

US far-right rally sparks violent clashes,"This video can not be played Footage captured the moment a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville One person has died and 19 others were injured when a car rammed a crowd of people opposing a far-right rally in the US state of Virginia, police say. Earlier, street brawls erupted between white nationalists planning to attend the march and counter-protesters. The mayor of Charlottesville, where the now-cancelled rally was taking place, said he was ""heartbroken"" at the death. President Donald Trump has condemned the violence, and local officials have declared a state of emergency. The car involved in the ramming incident was later located a few streets away and the driver is in custody, the city's police chief said. In addition to those injured there,the Charlottesville Police Department said,externalanother 15 people were injured in other violence related to the far-right march. Late in the afternoon, a Virginia State Police helicopter, crashed in woodland south-west of the city, killing two people; however, there has been no indication that this was related to the violence. The ""Unite the Right"" march was called to protest against plans to remove a statue of a general who had fought for the pro-slavery Confederacy during the US Civil War. Video posted on social media showed a car ploughing at speed into several slow-moving vehicles, which were surrounded by a densely packed crowd. A witness said one girl got ""tore up"" after the car ""backed up and hit again"". Officials said the driver had been taken into custody. A number of people received first-aid after a vehicle drove into a crowd Witnesses said the car backed up and hit the crowd more than once Police earlier fired tear gas against demonstrators and said that arrests had been made after a declaration of unlawful assembly at Emancipation Park. Why do people still fly the Confederate flag? The far-right protesters, some waving Confederate flags, carrying shields and wearing helmets, are angry about the planned removal of a statue of General Robert E Lee from Charlottesville. This video can not be played The US president ignored questions over whether his response went far enough Gen Lee commanded the pro-slavery Confederate forces in the US Civil War of 1861-65. The New York Times reports that some of them were chanting ""You will not replace us,"" and ""Jew will not replace us."" Anti-racism organisations such as Black Lives Matter also held marches. President Donald Trump condemned ""in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry, and violence on many sides"". ""The hate and the division must stop right now,"" he told reporters, speaking in New Jersey, where he is on a working holiday. ""We have to come together as Americans with love for our nation."" Democrats and Republicans alike have taken issue with his choice of words, noting that he failed to refer to the role of white nationalists. Republican Senator Cory Gardner tweeted: ""Mr. President - we must call evil by its name. These were white supremacists and this was domestic terrorism."" Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah, also a Republican, felt similarly. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

One picturetweeted by author J K Rowling,externalshowed a man on the street carrying a swastika flag. The governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, said his only message for the white supremacists who had rallied in the city was - ""go home."" Speaking to reporters in Charlottesville, he said there was no place for white supremacist groups there, or in America. By Joel Gunter, BBC News, Charlottesville There were very violent scenes at Emancipation Park and it took some time for the police to intervene. Both sides were throwing bottles and rocks and using pepper spray. The far-right protesters were a mix of different groups with shields and batons and the declaration of a state of emergency seemed to have had a significant impact on them, as they started to dissipate. Shiquan Rah, a 21-year-old demonstrator who had joined the counter-protest, said about the far-right groups: ""These people don't have a message, their message is hate and violence. This is a spiritual war we're in.

Members of a white nationalist group were armed and wearing militia uniforms Charlottesville is considered a liberal college town - and 86% of the county voted for Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential elections. However, the town has become a focal point for white nationalists after the city council voted to remove the statue of Gen Lee.

Emergency state over US far-right rally,"This video can not be played Footage captured the moment a car rammed into a crowd of counter-protesters in Charlottesville One person has died and 19 others were injured when a car rammed a crowd of people opposing a far-right rally in the US state of Virginia, police say.

The mayor of Charlottesville, where the now-cancelled rally was taking place, said he was ""heartbroken"" at the death. President Donald Trump has condemned the violence, and local officials have declared a state of emergency.

Susan Shepherd was pulled from the rubble of her home in Rosslyn Avenue, Sunderland, following the explosion on Friday morning. The semi-detached was flattened by the blast and a neighbouring property was heavily damaged. Tracy Tia Judson said her sister, who is in her 50s, suffered minor burns and was able to talk to ambulance staff. Writing on Facebook, Ms Judson said,external: ""The fridge fell on top of her and saved her life, she's absolutely fine under the circumstances, she's got minor burns to her back, face and arms and her hip might need stitching."" Police, gas engineers, fire crews, paramedics and the air ambulance were all called to the scene just after 08:50 BST. Search specialists with dogs were also there to make sure there were no trapped casualties. Residents who had been evacuated have now been allowed home, Northumbria Police said. One house was destroyed and a neighbouring property severely damaged The fire service sent five engines and a search dog Neighbour Tracey Pounder, 51, said: ""I heard an almighty bang. I went upstairs and you could see dust rising. ""Half of the semi has gone and next door is wrecked. I came down to see what was happening and it is a complete shock."" Sean Hughes, 40, heard the explosion more than a mile away.  He said: ""I saw the window move and the house shook."" Ms Shepherd's sister said she was protected from debris after a fridge fell on her Fire crews arriving at the scene took risks to enter the flattened property and did a ""cracking job"" assisted by ambulance crews, a senior officer said. Bill Forster, of Tyne and Wear Fire and Rescue Service, said: ""The walls of the building have collapsed and the upper sections of the building have come down and the lady was trapped beneath that rubble.""

White nationalist rally at US university,"This video can not be played The protesters held torches and chanted 'you will not replace us' Hundreds of US white nationalists have rallied at the University of Virginia, protesting against plans to remove a statue of a confederate general. The group waved torches and chanted ""White lives matter"" as they marched through the Charlottesville university. There were clashes with counter-protesters, while the local mayor condemned the march as racist and a ""parade of hatred"". A larger ""Unite the Right"" rally is planned in the city on Saturday. The protesters are angered at the planned removal of a statue of General Robert E Lee from Charlottesville. Lee commanded forces of the pro-slavery Confederacy in the US Civil War. Protest organiser Jason Kessler, who has previously accused the town of ""anti-white hatred"", described the event as an ""incredible moment for white people who've had it up to here and aren't going to take it anymore"". The New York Times and Washington Post reported that the crowd chanted ""You will not replace us"" and ""Jew will not replace us"" during the event. Demonstrators held lit torches - which some observers described as a reference to the Ku Klux Klan - and chanted ""blood and soil"" and ""one people, one nation, end immigration"". The rally was met by a smaller group of counter protesters who had surrounded the university's statue of Thomas Jefferson, holding a banner that read ""VA Students Act Against White Supremacy"". The marchers were tightly organised. They gathered after dark at Nameless Field, where they lit their torches and formed into a line, which snaked out of the park and into the University of Virginia campus. Almost entirely white and male, and in their twenties and thirties, they chanted ""You will not replace us"", ""Blood and soil"", and ""Our streets"". They marched through the campus to the university's statue of Thomas Jefferson, where they were met by a small group of counter-protesters. One of the counter-protesters apparently sprayed pepper spray at the marchers and the two groups clashed violently. Police moved in and the marchers extinguished their torches, filling the hot air with acrid smoke. ""The heat here is nothing compared to what you're going to get in the ovens,"" shouted Robert Ray, a writer for white supremacist site Daily Stormer. ""I never thought I'd have to see this in America in my lifetime,"" said one of the counter-protesters, a student who did not want to be named. The marchers slowly dissipated. Across the street, more than 500 people were packed into St Paul's Memorial Church, where they had heard readings from the Bible and the Quran and prayers for peace and unity in Charlottesville. At the end, the congregation filed slowly out of a side door to avoid the white nationalists walking back down Main Street. The protest was criticised by many local residents and politicians. Charlottesville mayor Mike Signer called the march ""a cowardly parade of hatred, bigotry, racism and intolerance"". Hewrote on Facebook,external: ""Everyone has a right under the First Amendment to express their opinion peaceably, so here's mine: not only as the Mayor of Charlottesville, but as a UVA [University of Virginia] faculty member and alumnus, I am beyond disgusted by this unsanctioned and despicable display of visual intimidation on a college campus."" The march surrounded a smaller group of counter protesters Charlottesville is considered a liberal college town - and 86% of the county voted for Hillary Clinton in last year's presidential elections. However, the town has become a focal point for white nationalists after the city council voted to remove a statue of General Lee. Some observers also argue that US President Donald Trump's election to the White House re-energised the far right across the US.

Trump administration's mixed messages on North Korea,"This video can not be played President Trump threatened a response 'like the world has never seen' At a time when nuclear war with North Korea seems a possible - if distant - threat, you'd think everyone would want the US administration to be on the same page. But in recent weeks, statements from President Trump and his top officials appear to directly contradict each other. President Trump's outburst on Friday - that the US military was""locked and loaded""ready to deal with North Korea - came just hours after his Defence Secretary James Mattis attempted to cool tensions by saying that diplomatic efforts were succeeding. Here are some of the other mixed messages we've heard since North Korea's second intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) test on 28 July. What Trump said: President Trump was pleased when the UN agreed new sanctions against Pyongyang. But he has also stressed the military option was open. On Tuesday, he boasted about America's military might and warned of ""fire and fury""if North Korea threatened the US. Then, after North Korea said it was preparing missile strikes on the US island territory of Guam, he took it up a notch again - saying the regime of Kim Jong-un should be""very, very nervous"". He said the regime would be in trouble ""like few nations have ever been"" if they did not ""get their act together"". What other officials said: Despite Mr Trump's tweets, many in his team have played down the prospect of war. Shortly after Mr Trump's comments on Guam, Gen Mattis cautioned that armed conflict would be ""catastrophic"" and insisted diplomacy was bearing fruit. ""The American effort is diplomatically led, it has diplomatic traction, it isgaining diplomatic results,"" Gen Mattis said. This video can not be played Mattis: ""The tragedy of war is known... it would be catastrophic"" US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also told reporters: ""I think the president's made it clear he prefers a diplomatic solution."" He argued that Mr Trump's words were designed to encourage dialogue with Pyongyang ""by ensuring North Korea understands what the stakes are"". Mr Tillerson has previously stressed the importance of sanctions - warning that any nation that provided economic or military benefits to the North was ""aiding and abetting a dangerous regime"". What Trump said: President Trump has praised China in the past, saying it is ""trying hard"" to rein in North Korea. However, in recent months, he has repeatedly criticised Beijing for continuing to trade with Pyongyang. ""So much for China working with us,"" the US president tweeted the day after North Korea claimed to have tested its long-range missile. At the end of July, he again said he was ""very disappointed"" with China for not doing enough to stop North Korea's weapons programme. ""They do NOTHING for us with North Korea, just talk,"" he wrote on Twitter. What others said: Back in June, Gen Mattis had praised Beijing's efforts to restrain North Korea's missile and nuclear activity. And on 2 August, Mr Tillerson said: ""We certainly don't blame the Chinese for the situation in North Korea."" What Trump said: The president has ratcheted up his rhetoric, warning that if North Korea attacks Guam it should expect ""big, big trouble"". ""If he [Kim Jong-un] utters one threat in the form of an overt threat... with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American territory or an American ally he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast."" However, he has also struck an optimistic tone, saying: ""Hopefully, it will all work out... nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump."" What others said: Secretary Tillerson has sought to assure Americans there is no imminent threat, despite some of the strong words from his boss. On Wednesday, he said the situation had not changed dramatically in recent days and that Americans ""should sleep well at night"". This video can not be played Don't listen to Tillerson - White House However, top Trump aideSebastian Gorka told BBC Newsthat Mr Tillerson was not actually speaking for the White House. ""You should listen to the president,"" Mr Gorka said. ""The idea that Secretary Tillerson is going to discuss military matters is simply nonsensical. ""It is the job of Secretary Mattis to talk about military options."" Sometimes Mr Trump's officials appear to disagree with each other too. Mr Tillerson struck a conciliatory tone after Pyongyang tested a second ICBM in July and claimed it could hit the US west coast. ""We do not seek a regime change, we do not seek the collapse of the regime,"" he said. ""We're not your enemy."" This video can not be played Rex Tillerson: We don't seek regime change in North Korea However, just days later Gen Mattis warned North Korea that its actions could usher in the ""end of its regime and the destruction of its people"". The Pentagon chief also said Pyongyang would be ""grossly overmatched"" in a war against the US and its allies. Trump to N Korea: US 'locked and loaded' Who's in Trump's good books?

Submarine owner held over missing Swede,"Peter Madsen was pictured next to the journalist, Kim Wall, just before they set off A Danish submarine owner has appeared in court over the disappearance of a Swedish female journalist who had been on board his vessel before it sank. Peter Madsen, 46, denies wrongdoing, saying he had dropped off the reporter - 30-year-old Kim Wall - in Copenhagen before the sinking. Her partner raised the alarm in the early hours of Friday when she failed to return from the Nautilus vessel. It was later spotted but sank on Friday morning and Mr Madsen was rescued. Police have launched a search for Ms Wall, a freelance journalist based in New York and China who has written for the New York Times, the Guardian and Vice Magazine. This video can not be played Mr Madsen was filmed by a Danish TV crew escorted by police after his rescue Danish media said Mr Madsen had been charged with negligent manslaughter and would be detained for 24 days, following his court appearance on Saturday. Police would not comment on why charges had been brought before a body had been found. Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? In a statement to Swedish paper Aftonbladet, Ms Wall's family said: ""It is with great dismay we received the message that Kim is missing. We believe and sincerely hope she will be found safe and well."" Her friends and family have been posting widely on social media asking for her whereabouts. Kim Wall has worked for the Guardian and the New York Times Salvage teams started raising the Nautilus from the seabed in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen, on Saturday. Police are hunting for witnesses and camera footage to determine whether the missing woman had disembarked after setting off. Footage aired by Denmark's TV2 shows Mr Madsen getting out of what appeared to be a private boat, giving reporters a thumbs-up sign, saying: ""I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down."" The Nautilus is almost 18 metres long A search was launched after the woman was reported missing He later told a reporter: ""I was out on a rehearsal trip, tinkering with different things in the submarine. Then a defect happened with a ballast tank which wasn't that serious - until I tried to repair it - then it suddenly became very serious. ""After that it took 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink. I couldn't close the hatch or anything. But that might be OK, as I would still be down there then."" Ms Wall had been writing about Mr Madsen and his submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. Mr Madsen made headlines in 2008 when he built the home-made submarine, that is almost 18 metres long, by using online crowd-funding. Danish sub owner emerges after rescue.

UKIP MEP quits over Anti-Islam candidate,"Mike Hookem said he 'strongly disagrees' with the views of Anne Marie Waters A senior UKIP MEP has resigned as deputy whip in the European Parliament over support within the party for an anti-Islam campaigner. Anne Marie Waters, who founded the Sharia Watch pressure group and has called Islam ""evil"", has been allowed tostandin UKIP's leadership election. Mike Hookem said he was not prepared to ""turn a blind eye"" to extremism. He resigned after UKIP chief whip Stuart Agnew declared his support for Ms Waters. In a letter to interim UKIP leader Steve Crowther - sent before Ms Waters was passed by the party's national executive as a leadership candidate - Mr Hookem said he was ""disturbed"" by Mr Agnew's support. In a later statement, he elaborated: ""I strongly disagree with the views Ms Waters and Mr Agnew promote and I would like to put as much distance between me and them as possible."" He said he was not a racist and would not support someone ""who seeks to single out a section of our society simply due to their religious beliefs"". Mr Hookem subsequently told the BBC News Channel: ""I believe she should not be in the party and she should not be standing as a candidate. ""She could not stand for a Westminster seat because she was not a member of good standing. ""She could not stand as a Police and Crime Commissioner as she was not a member of good standing - and now suddenly she's standing for the top job."" Mr Hookem continued: ""It doesn't make sense. God forbid she does become leader."" He said he would not quit the party if Ms Waters was elected, but he would not support her. Ms Waters believes her anti-Islam message, including a proposed ban on the burka, the closure of all Sharia councils and a temporary freeze on all immigration, will strike a chord with many voters. Anne Marie Waters has said Sharia courts ""treat women like absolute dirt"" But fellow MEP Nathan Gill has said he would leave the party if she became leader. ""She shouldn't be a member of this party, but we are where we are,"" he said. ""If she was elected, I would have to leave."" Former leader Nigel Farage has warned that UKIP will be ""finished"" if it becomes an anti-Islam party. But the party's deputy leader, Peter Whittle, said it was right that Ms Waters be allowed to stand. Mr Whittle - who is also competing to be leader - said she had passed the vetting process. Former Tory aide renews call for anti-Brexit part Anti-Islam candidate to stand for UKIP leadership Call to deselect UKIP AM Michelle Brown rejected ""If you get through that then you should be allowed to stand,"" he said. Mr Whittle told the Today programme he was concerned by the number of Sharia courts in the UK. ""There is one law in this country and that is British law,"" he said, denying it was an anti-Islamic viewpoint. He added that he was for a ""cohesive multi-ethnic society ... united under British values and British laws"", adding that multiculturalism had led to ""a more fragmented society"". Peter Whittle is one of 11 candidates standing in UKIP's leadership contest Voting papers will be sent to party members over the next few weeks and the new leader will be announced at the party's annual conference in Torquay, held on 29 and 30 September. Mr Whittle and Ms Waters are among 11 candidates vying to be leader after Paul Nuttall - who has previously said Ms Waters' views made him ""uncomfortable"" -stood down after UKIP's poor performance in June's general election.

Judge rejects DJ's Taylor Swift claim,"Pop star Taylor Swift has won a key victory in her court battle with ex-radio DJ David Mueller, who she claims groped her at a 2013 concert. Mr Mueller, 55, originally sued the pop star for $3m (Â£2.3m), saying she cost him his job. His claim was dismissed on Friday in a Denver court. US District Judge William Martinez ruled that Ms Swift was not liable, as Mr Mueller had not proved she set out to get him fired. The DJ made the same claims against the singer's mother Andrea Swift, and her radio liaison, Frank Bell. A jury will now decide if they are accountable for Mr Mueller's sacking. Ms Swift, 27, has countersued the DJ for allegedly groping her after she agreed to pose for a photo with him and his girlfriend. She is seeking a symbolic $1 in damages, which she has pledged to donate to charity. The ruling against Mr Mueller came on the fifth day of the trial. The singer's ex bodyguard has testified at the trial, backing her assault claims Ms Swift's ex-bodyguard gave evidence on Friday, backing her sex assault claims by testifying that he saw the DJ reach under her skirt. Greg Dent told the Colorado court he ""did not see his hand touch her physically"", but ""saw his hand under her skirt"". The alleged assault is said to have occurred in 2013 during a Denver stopover on the singer's Red tour. Mr Mueller, then a host on the radio station KYGO, had been invited to meet her before the show. Ms Swift complained to KYGO and the station fired Mr Mueller two days later. Taylor Swift wasn't backing down in court Taylor Swift: He grabbed under my skirt Taylor Swift's mum confronts DJ in court Mr Dent, who no longer works for Ms Swift, told the court he was steps away when Mr Mueller posed with his girlfriend and the pop star. ""She reacted, pushed her skirt down and moved over closer to [Mr Mueller's girlfriend]. So in my opinion, I knew he touched her,"" he said. Taylor Swift (left) has been present throughout the trial, often accompanied by her mother Andrea (second right) Mr Dent explained he did not act because ""he didn't sense danger after he touched her"", and Ms Swift did not signal that he should intervene. The Shake It Off and I Knew You Were Trouble singer, however, later complained and Mr Dent confronted Mr Mueller at the event. Swift 'certain' she was groped by DJ Taylor Swift trial: What you need to know His testimony came a day after Ms Swift took the stand to describe the incident, calling it a ""definite grab. A very long grab."" When Mr Mueller's lawyer, Gabriel McFarland, asked why her bodyguard did not interfere when the alleged incident happened, the pop star said: ""No-one could have expected this to happen. ""It had never happened before. It was horrifying and shocking."" A message with Taylor Swift's lyrics has appeared across the street from the courthouse Mr Mueller's ex-girlfriend who was also in the photo, Shannon Melcher, also testified on Friday. She said she noticed nothing amiss during the brief meeting and that she and Mr Mueller were rudely escorted out of the arena later that evening. Ms Melcher added that Mr Mueller was devastated by the allegations. Mr Mueller's former radio show co-host, Ryan Kliesch, testified that he did not know his former colleague to be disrespectful toward women. He added when he heard the allegations, he ""thought it was a joke"".

A rare glimpse inside Trump's golf club,"A velvet rope separates reporters from the man with the US nuclear codes US President Donald Trump usually keeps reporters at a distance. This week, however, members of the press pool were offered a glimpse at his private world. Trump National Golf Club smells like freshly mown grass. It has 18-hole courses, wooden bridges and silky-looking sandpits (one had a rake lying next to it). It's easy to see why he likes the place. It's lovely - and was designed as a monument to him. On Thursday afternoon he spoke with reporters in front of a clubhouse filled with Trump memorabilia. In that spot and later in a nearby building, he discussed North Korea, leak investigations and Afghanistan. It was an unusually candid exchange, providing reporters with a behind-the-scenes look at his club as well as insight into how he sees the world. Since the election, only a small number of reporters have been allowed into the club, which reportedly charges initiation fees of up to $350,000 (Â£270,000). He has been spending time here in August while the White House is being renovated. Secret Service scan the horizon outside a room where Trump holds a meeting I am among members of a press pool, a group of about a dozen photographers, writers and soundmen who travel with the president and send reports to colleagues. The material we document is distributed to the public through radio and TV stations, websites and newspapers across the US. Trump's 17-day holiday causes a stir Secret Service test Pool duty, said Anita Kumar, one of my colleagues from McClatchy Newspapers, is ""the best and worst job"". You spend hours sitting in a van, waiting for the president. Sometimes you see history unfold or hear surprising things. On this day, Mr Trump greets reporters in front of the clubhouse - apparently he thinksthe entrance looks like 10 Downing Street,external. Pool reporters file their copy and watch CNN as the information is relayed to the American public Later that afternoon he sits in the centre of a table with HR McMaster, the national security adviser, on his right, and Mike Pence, the vice-president, on his left. The stakes are enormous: the possibility of nuclear war hangs in the balance, with threats from the North Koreans and Mr Trump himself. Yet he seems at ease in his surroundings and happy to spend the afternoon with the reporters. Others in the room seem less relaxed. As Mr Trump speaks, Mr McMaster glances at his watch. The issue of leaks and other matters - at least in Mr Trump's interpretation - centres on him. In this way the subject is like his foreign policy - and his domestic policy, too: he casts himself in a starring role. Trump listens to a pool reporter's question while seated beside (from left) McMaster, Pence and Pompeo Describing Afghanistan, he says: ""I took over a mess."" He promises the reporters he'd make it ""less messy"", though he doesn't explain how. He speaks about his call to ban transgender soldiers: ""I've had great support from that community,"" he says. ""I got a lot of votes."" Discussing North Korea, Mr Trump also makes things personal. He says if Kim Jong-un ""does something in Guam"", then the North Korean leader would face consequences, ""the likes of which nobody has seen before"". Regarding the leaks, Mr Trump is gentle. ""They're all fighting for love,"" he says about the White House officials who tell reporters things they shouldn't - sometimes to raise their own status or to put down colleagues. Trump adds: ""I'm somewhat honoured."" He describes the leaks in a way that contributes to palace intrigue, a fitting subject in his setting. The golf club is certainly palatial. The White House is being renovated while Trump is away He acquired the property, a piece of New Jersey land with rolling hills and trees, about 45 miles (72km) from Manhattan, in 2002 and at one point said he would like to be buried there. The club features a pool with turquoise-blue water and a food truck in the car park for workers (pulled-pork sandwiches are on the menu ). Inside the clubhouse, walls are decoratedwith magazines that feature Mr Trump,external: Bloomberg Businessweek (the 2011 caption said: ""Seriously?""); New York Times Magazine and Golf Inc. A hardback edition of Katherine Anne Porter's Ship of Fools sits on a bookshelf, and the bar is filled with photos of Mr Trump and friends with '80s-style haircuts. A soundtrack from that era plays, featuring Tears for Fears' Everybody Wants to Rule the World. The main room has eight chandeliers, floor-to-ceiling windows, a dance floor and a Blue Bunny freezer (the ice-cream sandwiches are rock solid). Some of the golfers ignore the presidential drama: a man walks across a carpeted floor in golf shoes, while the commander-in-chief discusses North Korea. Meanwhile, locals say they like his style. A Secret Service agent patrols the golf course Kim Duffy, a petrol pump attendant who works near the club, said: ""He needs to be strong."" Her garage has a military-style poster: ""ISIS Beware. We Don't Work for Your Brother Anymore,"" showing disdain for former President Barack Obama and admiration for Mr Trump. Yet others seem ambivalent. One golfer, a woman in a dark-pink miniskirt, said she's seen the president and his entourage pass by when she was sitting on a patio, adding: ""It was surreal."" The mixture of foreign policy, golf and veiled threats about nuclear war is unprecedented and jarring. Yet this is Trump's world. For the moment at least, it is also the world that reporters - and all Americans - inhabit.

Submarine owner held over reporter death,"Peter Madsen was pictured next to the journalist, Kim Wall, just before they set off A Danish submarine owner has appeared in court over the disappearance of a Swedish female journalist who had been on board his vessel before it sank. Peter Madsen, 46, denies wrongdoing, saying he had dropped off the reporter - 30-year-old Kim Wall - in Copenhagen before the sinking. Her partner raised the alarm in the early hours of Friday when she failed to return from the Nautilus vessel. It was later spotted but sank on Friday morning and Mr Madsen was rescued. Police have launched a search for Ms Wall, a freelance journalist based in New York and China who has written for the New York Times, the Guardian and Vice Magazine. This video can not be played Mr Madsen was filmed by a Danish TV crew escorted by police after his rescue Danish media said Mr Madsen had been charged with negligent manslaughter and would be detained for 24 days, following his court appearance on Saturday. Police would not comment on why charges had been brought before a body had been found. Who is DIY submariner Peter Madsen? In a statement to Swedish paper Aftonbladet, Ms Wall's family said: ""It is with great dismay we received the message that Kim is missing. We believe and sincerely hope she will be found safe and well."" Her friends and family have been posting widely on social media asking for her whereabouts. Kim Wall has worked for the Guardian and the New York Times Salvage teams started raising the Nautilus from the seabed in Koge Bay, south of Copenhagen, on Saturday. Police are hunting for witnesses and camera footage to determine whether the missing woman had disembarked after setting off. Footage aired by Denmark's TV2 shows Mr Madsen getting out of what appeared to be a private boat, giving reporters a thumbs-up sign, saying: ""I am fine, but sad because Nautilus went down."" The Nautilus is almost 18 metres long A search was launched after the woman was reported missing He later told a reporter: ""I was out on a rehearsal trip, tinkering with different things in the submarine. Then a defect happened with a ballast tank which wasn't that serious - until I tried to repair it - then it suddenly became very serious. ""After that it took 30 seconds for Nautilus to sink. I couldn't close the hatch or anything. But that might be OK, as I would still be down there then."" Ms Wall had been writing about Mr Madsen and his submarine, which at one stage was the largest privately-made vessel of its kind. Mr Madsen made headlines in 2008 when he built the home-made submarine, that is almost 18 metres long, by using online crowd-funding. Danish sub owner emerges after rescue.

Laser pen licence mooted as attacks rise,"Buying powerful laser pens could require a licence in future, the government has said, amid concerns over the number of attacks on aircraft. Ministers say they could also bring in new measures to license retailers and restrict advertising after warnings about the risks to pilots and planes. The government said it wanted to find ""the best way to protect the public"". Last year, 1,258 incidents of lasers being shone at aircraft were recorded by the UK's Civil Aviation Authority. This week,Spanish police said a British man and his sonhad pointed a laser at a plane over the Costa del Sol. How dangerous are lasers to planes? Earlier this year, the government said it would introduce a new law meaning people who deliberately shone lasers at aircraft could face larger fines or even a jail sentence. However, the proposal was dropped from the government's legislative programme after June's general election. This video can not be played Jonny Marshall: ""There was this huge blur in my eye"" The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy has now launched an eight-week consultation on the issue. Business Minister Margot James said: ""Public safety is of the utmost importance and we must look carefully to make sure regulations are keeping up with the increased use of these devices."" She added: ""Used irresponsibly or maliciously, these products can and do wreak havoc and harm others, with potentially catastrophic consequences. ""That's why we want to hear from business groups, retailers and consumers about the best way to protect the public from this kind of dangerous behaviour and improve safety."" Licensing schemes already exist in countries such as Australia, Canada and the US. In the UK, shining lasers at aircraft can incur a fine of up to Â£2,500. Former pilot Chris Hammond, now a spokesman for the British Airline Pilots Association (BALPA), had a laser shone at him while he was flying. He told BBC News: ""It's very disconcerting. Most of the [incidents] are at night - and it's distracting. ""We (pilots) look outside all the time. If we see another light, we're attracted to looking at it straight away because it might be a plane. And it's not, it's a laser. ""But by the time you've seen it, it's too late. It's got your eye and you are possibly blinded for minutes, if not hours, afterwards. ""They are very strong, some of these lasers, and that's a big problem at the moment. The effects of that can last for a long time."" Brian Strutton, general secretary of BALPA, said shining lasers into the eyes of a pilot at a critical stage of a flight ""has the potential to cause a crash and loss of life"". ""There is also a growing concern that, as the power of available lasers increases, the possibility of permanent damage being caused to pilots' and passengers' eyes increases,"" he added. Three pilots reported being dazzled during the incident in Spain. If found guilty, the two British holidaymakers could face a fine ranging from â¬30,001 (Â£27,280; $35,425) to â¬600,000 for endangering flight safety. Simon Kelly, of the Royal College of Ophthalmologists, said he has seen people with permanent eye damage as a result of laser pens. He said: ""In the most severe cases a centre part of the retina, known as the macular, can be burned and a hole can be there which may well be permanent. ""Obviously there can be minor issues where the eye recovers very well and the eyesight is not damaged, but in the most severe case it is possible to blind one's self with a laser pointer and I have seen this happen in a youngster.""

Century-old fruitcake found in Antarctica,"Antarctica's freezing conditions helped to preserve this cake, which researchers say is in ""excellent condition"" Ice-covered Antarctica is one of Earth's most hostile natural environments. But a new find by the Antarctic Heritage Trust suggests it's no match for a 106-year-old British fruitcake. Conservators found the elderly cake on Cape Adare, and believe it belonged toBritish explorer Robert Falcon Scott- known as Scott of the Antarctic. Although the tin was rusted, the team said the cake was in ""excellent condition"" and smelled edible. The New Zealand-based trust found it in Antarctica's oldest building, a hut built by Norwegian explorer Carsten Borchgrevink's team in 1899, and used by Capt Scott in 1911 during his Terra Nova expedition. The polar pioneer was said to be fond of this particular cake, made by the British biscuit company Huntley & Palmers. ""Excuse writing - it is -40"": Scott's last letter in full Scott's Antarctic diet: Stewed penguin and champagne Rare Antarctic trek images revealed Scott Antarctic slides fail to sell ""Fruitcake was a popular item in English society at the time, and it remains popular today,"" Lizzie Meek, conservation manager for artefacts at the trust,told National Geographic,external. ""Living and working in Antarctica tends to lead to a craving for high-fat, high-sugar food, and fruitcake fits the bill nicely, not to mention going very well with a cup of tea."" Capt (seated centre, back) and members of his ill-fated expedition to Antarctica Conservators have been excavating artefacts in the hut since May 2016, and have unearthed some 1,500 items. They include tools and clothing, and - according to Ms Meeks - some ""badly deteriorated"" meat and fish, and ""rather nice-looking"" jams. Everything they find - fruitcake included - is restored and returned to its original resting place. The cake's survival is bittersweet, as Capt Scott and his companions were not so lucky. They successfully reached the South Pole, only to find a Norwegian team had beaten them to it by 33 days. Scott and four of his team died on their way back to base.

"Trump: N Korea faces 'big, big trouble'","This video can not be played President Trump says North Korea will be in ""big, big trouble"" if it acts against Guam President Donald Trump has warned North Korea to expect ""big, big trouble"" if anything happens to the US territory of Guam. Speaking at his Bedminister, New Jersey golf resort, he promised the territory would be ""very safe, believe me"". Mr Trump said the US could impose further sanctions, ""as strong as they get"", on North Korea. He later spoke to Chinese President Xi Jinping, who stressed the need for a peaceful resolution, Chinese TV said. President Xi called on ""relevant parties"" to exercise restraint and avoid words and actions that would exacerbate tension, state TV reported, adding that it was in the interests of both China and the US to pursue the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. The White House said both sides agreed North Korea must stop its ""provocative and escalatory behaviour"". ""Hopefully, it will all work out,"" Mr Trump said earlier, striking an upbeat tone after a day of rhetorical brinkmanship. ""Nobody loves a peaceful solution better than President Trump, that I can tell you."" Trump administration's mixed messages Trump's long nuclear obsession North Korea's neighbours consider risk of war Earlier on Friday, the president said the US military was ""locked and loaded"" to deal with North Korea, should the need arise. ""Military solutions are now fully in place, locked and loaded, should North Korea act unwisely. Hopefully Kim Jong-un will find another path!"" he tweeted. He spoke as Pyongyang accused him of ""driving"" the Korean peninsula to the ""brink of a nuclear war"". President Trump was flanked by Secretary of State Rex Tillerson (L) and US Ambassador to the United Nations Nikki Haley at his golf estate in Bedminster, New Jersey North Korea has announced plans to fire missiles near the US territory of Guam. Moscow said the exchange of threats between Washington and Pyongyang ""worry us very much"". Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov rated the risk of military conflict as ""very high"" as he put forward a joint Russian-Chinese plan to defuse the crisis. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said there was no military solution, and ""an escalation of the rhetoric is the wrong answer."" This video can not be played It's not the first time North Korea has made threats against Guam Asked about his ""locked and loaded"" tweet on Friday, Mr Trump told reporters: ""I hope that they [North Korea] are going to fully understand the gravity of what I said, and what I said is what I meanâ¦ those words are very, very easy to understand."" He added: ""If he [Kim Jong-un] utters one threat in the form of an overt threat... with respect to Guam or anyplace else that's an American territory or an American ally he will truly regret it and he will regret it fast."" Who said it: Trump or Kim? N Korea: The possible solutions The K-pop concert seeking to broker peace Earlier in the week, Mr Trump threatened to rain ""fire and fury"" on Pyongyang. This video can not be played Mattis: ""The tragedy of war is known... it would be catastrophic"" On Friday, North Korea's official KCNA news agency accused Washington of a ""criminal attempt to impose nuclear disaster upon the Korean nation"". Pyongyang's media outlet said America was making ""desperate efforts"" to test weapons in the Korean peninsula. The US is ""the mastermind of nuclear threat, the heinous nuclear war fanatic"", the report said. This video can not be played Who's in Trump's good and bad books? Tensions have risen since North Korea tested two intercontinental ballistic missiles in July. The North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the US defend itself? The regime was further angered by last week's UN decision to increase economic sanctions against it. North Korea said it was finalising a plan to fire medium-to-long-range rockets towards Guam, where US strategic bombers are based, along with more than 160,000 US citizens. There has been no indication that any actual attack on the Pacific island is imminent. On Thursday Mr Trump suggested that his own statements on North Korea had not been tough enough, warning the regime to be ""very, very nervous"". This video can not be played The BBC's Robin Brant asks those in the South Korean capital, Seoul: ""Are you scared?"" However, he added that the US would always consider negotiations. He also chided the North's closest ally, China, saying it could do ""a lot more"". China's state-run Global Times newspaper wrote that Beijing should stay neutral if North Korea launches an attack that threatens the US. But it also said that if the US and South Korea attacked North Korea to force regime change, then China must intervene to prevent it.

Soundcloud survives money scare,"Soundcloud has passionate users - but is failing to make ends meet Music streaming service Soundcloud will live on after securing a reported $170m (Â£135m) in investment. The platform, popular with emerging artists, faced closure if the new funding was not approved by Friday. ""Soundcloud is here to stay,â wrote Alexander Ljung, the companyâs chairman, who as part of the deal is stepping down as the firm's chief executive. Concerned users had been backing up their Soundcloud uploads, worried the site would go offline. Its highest profile user, Chance the Rapper, has been vocal in supporting the site. In July, the Berlin-based company laid off 40% of its workforce, a total of 173 people. In a note circulated to shareholders earlier this week (obtained by Axios,external) Mr Ljung said without the money Soundcloud would not be able âto continue as a going concernâ. By Friday, things were looking up. ""This financing means Soundcloud remains strong and independent,â Mr Ljung wrotein a blog post,external. ""Over the last few weeks, Iâve been moved by the outpouring of commentary around Soundcloudâs unique and crucial role in driving what global culture is today (and what it will become tomorrow). ""Youâve told me how, without Soundcloud, there would be a giant gaping void in todayâs world of music. We canât have that, and Iâm happy to once again say that wonât be happening.â The company will see considerable changes in leadership. Mr Ljung will be replaced as chief executive by Kerry Trainor, the former boss of video-sharing site Vimeo. Mike Weissman, also formerly at Vimeo, will become Soundcloudâs chief operating officer. Soundcloud will now need to look at reducing costs and doing more to monetise the service which, according to the firms latest publicly available figures, has more than 40 million users. The firmâs money problems have been well-documented - with its valuation dropping considerable from a high of $700m in 2014.
