Why England's World Cup optimism has soared,"Residents of Kirby Estate in Bermondsey have gone all out in a show of support for England at the FIFA World Cup There is a definite buzz around England as the country gets ready to roar on the Three Lions when they face Belgium later. But after a measured build-up to the tournament, and a widespread sense of realism over the team's chances, why have England fans' hopes suddenly raised as high as a John Stones headed goal? All across the country, St George's flags are raised against a bright blue sky. Despite it being more than half a century since we took the trophy - and many ""years of hurt"" when hopes were at fever pitch only to be dashed again - the English are brimming with sunny optimism. The Three Lions-inspired ""It's coming home"" has beentrending on twitterand even non-football fans are getting into the spirit with office sweepstakes and match-watching parties. The World Cup has captured the nation because - for the first time in a while - we like the players, said Michael Caulfield, who was England manager Gareth Southgate's club psychologist when Southgate was Middlesbrough boss.

""A hallmark of his leadership is that instead of hiding them away from the media, he has encouraged the players to be very open about who they are and what they do,"" said Mr Caulfield. ""We knowDanny Rose has suffered depression, we know Raheem Sterling's father wasshot dead when he was twoand we know Nick Pope was apart-time milkman. ""For the first time we have a real understanding of who they are as people and we want them to do well. ""They are not pretending to be perfect, they are normal people on a fantastic adventure and we are joining them on that journey."" Normal people on a fantastic adventure, celebrating goals like a bunch of mates down the park That journey kicked off to a storming start with a last-minute win over Tunisia followed by a 6-1 thumping of Panama. ""A win like that changes the whole mood,"" said Mr Caulfield. ""When you win it's a bit easier to get people to take notice and support you."" The nation is taking notice - England v Tunisia was themost-watched television programme of 2018 so far,attracting a peak audience of 18.3 million on BBC One. And even on a scorching Sunday, 14.1 million watched England thrash Panama. That's over a million more people than watched Prince Harry marry Meghan Markle. Allow Twitter content?

Chris Weston, 33, from Wellington in Shropshire, watched the England v Panama game in the Prince of Wales pub in Shrewsbury. ""It was absolutely buzzing,"" he said. ""It takes a good result to get everybody excited. ""In the last couple of days I've seen more people wearing England shirts, with flags on their cars or on their houses than I've ever seen. ""Everybody is really looking forward to the knockouts and people are really starting to think this could be our time. ""It's great for everyone, there's a buzz around the workplace, in the street, everyone is talking about it. ""You wear the shirt and feel proud, it's not very often you get to do that."" England fan Chris Weston has bought baby Alexander his first kit in time for the World Cup Since England's drubbing of Panama, Poundland has reported a 20% increase in sales of England flags, a spokesman for the shop said. ""We're flogging them faster than Harry Kane can hit the net,"" he said. ""We've shifted 56,000 balcony flags, 43,000 bunting flags and 35,000 car flags this week alone."" After the 6-1 win, searches for ""England flags"" peaked at one per minute on eBay. More than 9,000 St George's flags have been sold in the past 30 days - that's 12 per hour, the auction site said. Residents have re-named Wales Street in Oldham England Street Meanwhile over in Russia, the English are equally as excited, according to Paul Dubberley, who has travelled the globe to watch the national team trying and failing to win World Cups for more than 30 years. ""After winning 6-1, everyone has got a good feeling that maybe we can go a little bit further than we have in the last few years,"" said Mr Dubberley, 58, from Aldridge, in the West Midlands. ""Before we left I don't think anyone was that optimistic but after the last two games I know there's a lot more people coming out to jump on the bandwagon."" He could be right - since Sunday's win, travel comparison site Skyscanner.net has reported a 168% increase in flight searches from the UK to Russia for the game against Belgium. England, with new team & confidence, give nation joy & optimism John Stones bank holiday? 'I'd push for that for the people' Who needs what to qualify in the final round of group games? Paul Dubberley and Alex Waters celebrate the stunning victory over Panama at the Nizhny Novgorod Stadium in Russia Psychologist Mr Caulfield thinks the nation's warm response tells the players we are enjoying the ride and it is about entertainment as much as trying to win. ""The players are not wrapped up in fear carrying the weight of the nation of their shoulders. ""In the past there's been booing and hissing but now we know this team better we want them to do well. ""If they are eliminated, this isn't a group of players that will be seen as stark failures."" Football fans from England watch on screens the World Cup game between Tunisia and England at the official FIFA Fan Fest at Moscow State University But even if we won't see scenes of backlash to rival the timeseffigies of David Beckham were burned,externalorGraham Taylor's head was superimposed on to a turnip, are England fans still setting themselves up to repeat some mistakes of the past? Are we falling into the trap of yet again convincing ourselves England are the best team in the world? The BBC's chief football writer Phil McNulty thinks not - and that the current positive mood is a natural reaction. ""England's expectations were actually measured before the World Cup but it is in the nature of football supporters for them to increase after a couple of good victories,"" he said from Russia, where he will watch the clash with Belgium in Kaliningrad. ""I am still not too sure many England fans believe they will win the World Cup but perhaps they also have raised expectations after seeing the likes of Brazil, Germany and Argentina struggle on occasions in the earlier stages of the competition. ""I think most England supporters are actually reserving judgement until they play one of the bigger countries, so I still think most people have realistic expectations."" The crowd at Croydon Box Park in London roared with joy during the England v Panama match Mr Weston, one of those supporters, agrees - but only to a certain extent. ""The sensible thought is we've made a good start but the next games are going to be more difficult,"" he said. ""But we are playing so well that we've got a real chance this time."" And his wife Kerry Weston, 33, revealed: ""After Sunday's game Chris kept jumping around saying we are going to be world champions. I kept telling him to calm down. ""We haven't had a great track record in the past but it's been great so far. I wouldn't normally have taken much interest but we've had beautiful weather so it's been lovely to watch the games outside."" A huge crowd of revellers at the Isle of Wight Festival watched Sunday's win over Panama on a big screen Gareth Southgate glowed with pride as he watched back fans' celebrations following Panama's thrashing in aninterview with the FA.,external ""This is the honour of being England manager - to have the opportunity to send people to work happy and bring happiness to our country,"" said Southgate, who also went to two World Cups as an England player. Mr Caulfield believes the English are revelling in the chance to come together in a show of patriotism. ""The country is quite divided at the moment and the England football team is transcending it all and giving a bit of unity, hope and pride in being English,"" he said. ""We are sharing the joy and if it happens we will share the pain."" Could this be England's biggest fan?

Moorlands firefighters ask for military help,"This video can not be played Timelapse footage shows the spread of the fire near Saddleworth Moor The military has been called in to help battle a huge moorlands fire which has been raging for three days. The blaze covers 3.7miles (6km) of moorland above Stalybridge and prompted the evacuation of up to 100 homes. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) confirmed it had asked for military assistance. One resident described seeing ""ash falling like rain"" and another said it ""looked like the apocalypse"". Moorland fire in pictures How do you tackle a moorland blaze? 'Apocalyptic' moors fire continues to rage Four schools have closed and a GP said he had seen patients with nosebleeds, coughs and eye problems caused by the smoke. Firefighters are having to haul pumps and hoses for up to two miles in blistering heat to reach parts of the fire which has devastated swathes of land near Saddleworth Moor. Prime Minister Theresa May said the government is keeping the situation ""under constant review"". Smoke from the fire could be seen from space, as captured by the University of Dundee from a NASA satellite Greater Manchester's assistant chief fire officer Dave Keelan said a ""request"" had gone in for military assistance. ""That's for help to move high-volume pumps and to transport personnel to remote locations,"" he said. Pressed on the arrangements, he said the military was likely to use Chinook helicopters to move two water pumps. A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman confirmed the fire service had approached them ""as a priority"" and the MoD was ""looking into what might be done."" Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham started a question time event in Stretford saying that if the Home Office agreed, military resources should be available by Thursday morning.

Experts warned high levels of pollutants generated from the blaze could have a significant effect on people's health. Emergency services have been giving out face masks to their own staff, residents and members of the media. GP Richard Bircher said patients had been attending his surgery with smoke-related problems Stalybridge GP Richard Bircher said he had seen patients with nosebleeds, coughs and sore eyes caused by the smoke. Hugh Coe, professor of atmospheric composition at the University of Manchester, said plume peak concentrations were ""very high"" and air quality close to the fire was ""very poor"". He said pollution plumes had been detected in the centre of Manchester. Mr Keelan said 100 firefighters from Greater Manchester were tackling seven ongoing blazes on the moorland, with support from Cheshire and Derbyshire. The fire began on Sunday night, reignited on Monday during the hot weather and then spread throughout Tuesday, fanned by evening winds. About 150 people were forced to leave their homes on Tuesday, with many staying with family and friends. The majority had returned by Wednesday afternoon. This video can not be played Drones capture the vast moorland blaze Jonathan Reynolds, MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, said specialist equipment was being brought by Public Health England to monitor the air quality. ""Residents feel reassured by the actions of the fire service but there is a concern around the air quality and that's something we will monitor,"" he said. Mr Reynolds said firefighters were being particularly challenged by ""the distance they have to walk and the equipment they are wearing"". ""The country needs to give them every bit of support we can,"" he added. The fire on Tuesday night was accompanied by a dramatic full moon Mr Keelan said firefighters had carried pumps and hoses up to two miles to tackle remote pockets of fire. ""Firefighters have to physically carry all of that equipment in this heat, and the heat of the fire gear... and that's before they've even started tackling any sort of fire,"" he said. ""So it's been extremely difficult and they've just got on with it and done a fantastic job, I'm very proud of them."" GMFRS said it was receiving a high volume of calls about smoke across the region and asked for people to only phone in an emergency. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Keelan added: ""There's still a lot of smoke from the fire but air quality levels are being monitored regularly. Air quality is currently at a safe level and therefore residents have been let back into their homes. ""We don't know the cause at this stage and it would be very difficult to ascertain due to the extent of the damage, but we will be looking into that once we have tackled the fire."" Firefighters continued to battle the fire at daybreak on Wednesday Ian Saxon, director of operations and neighbourhoods at Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council, said a maximum of 100 homes had been evacuated at the height of the fire. ""As we're standing here there are people returning and there are people who are deciding they want to go elsewhere,"" he said. ""We will support them wherever they choose to go."" Kelly McFie said it was a ""massive relief"" to come home Personal trainer Kelly McFie, 35, was told to evacuate at 20:00 BST on Tuesday with her seven-year-old son Oscar. ""It looked like a towering inferno when I looked out of the back garden,"" she said. ""There were huge flames which would occasionally shoot up and you could hear the tree bark crackle."" She said she was ""glad to get out"" of her home. ""I grabbed our passports and Oscar's birthday certificate and just went,"" she said. ""We've got two cats, Buzz and Sally, and a dog called Bobby. ""Thankfully I managed to grab them although they weren't too happy to be moved."" Grandmother Pauline Lomas, 66, who was evacuated but came home on Wednesday morning to Carrbrook, welcomed the military intervention. She said: ""I'm shocked that they've been deployed as the smoke had subsided now. ""But we can't see how bad it is up on the moors now. ""It's fantastic how much everyone is rallying round to look after us and it shows how seriously they are taking if the Army is getting involved."" Drones capture extent of vast moors fire.

Military sent in to tackle moorlands fire,"This video can not be played Firefighters working on the moorland face ""really difficult"" conditions, an officer says Soldiers helping fight a moorland fire in Greater Manchester that could rage ""for weeks"" will remain in the area for a further 48 hours to aid fire crews. About 100 troops from the 4th Battalion, Royal Regiment of Scotland, were sent from their barracks in Catterick, North Yorkshire, overnight. The blaze is currently under control but could flare up at any time, the fire service said. Stalybridge MP Jonathan Reynolds praised the community's ""Blitz spirit"". Military assistance was requested to help battle the blaze near Saddleworth Moor which has spread across seven square miles, in six different areas. The soldiers arrived to help tackle the wildfire near Saddleworth Moor Soldiers from 4th Battalion Royal Regiment Scotland arrived overnight Soldiers joined more than 100 firefighters to support the effort by managing water lines and assisting in fire beating on moorland above Stalybridge. While shops and local residents have teamed up to help keep emergency service staff fed and watered. A fish and chip shop owner has been offering free meals to firefighters and the military and donations of drinks and food parcels are being collected at Stalybridge Fire Station. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) has faced many hurdles in trying to quell the blaze that has raged for days including frequent changes in wind direction, the heavy concentration of flammable peat in the ground and the tinder-dry foliage which has baked in searing temperatures. It said the soldiers' help would allow the service to deal with other emergency calls, including supporting Lancashire colleagues at anothermoorland blaze at Winter Hillnear Rivington.

Firefighters are tackling the fire from three locations using specialist wildfire fighting equipment plus hose reels & beaters."" This video can not be played Timelapse footage shows the spread of the fire near Saddleworth Moor Major Phil Morgan, commanding officer, said: ""We're beating the fire with paddles and moving equipment, putting water on the fire. ""It looks like we'll be here for another 48 hours then we'll wait for another request."" A Chinook helicopter was due to fly out of RAF Odiham, Hampshire, to move water-pumping equipment but Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) notified the Ministry of Defence it was ""no longer required"". The helicopter is on standby and is still ""available as a resource if we need it"", GMFRS said. Owen Jones has been co-ordinating the relief effort from Stalybridge Fire Station At the scene, Tom Mullen, BBC News Dozens of people, shops, supermarkets and local businesses have been contributing supplies to help feed the firefighters and military tackling the fire near Saddleworth Moor. GMFRS station manger Owen Jones has been tasked with co-ordinating the relief effort from Stalybridge Fire Station, where a huge pile of drinks, cakes and other snacks and supplies have been left - ready to be ferried up the hills. Mr Jones said about 50 people had called at the station today alone, including supermarkets Tesco and Morrisons, local schoolchildren and residents. Tameside Council has also contributed several 4x4 drivers to help take the supplies to the firefighters battling the flames, alongside volunteers from the fire service and the Prince's Trust. Mr Jones said: ""Working in these conditions is tough. The heat is encouraging the fire to burn, but it's also making the task of our firefighters more arduous. ""There's very little cover or shade or respite. We've got gazebos and shaded areas but it's still been an essential task to get supplies up there to them. ""The response from people wanting to help has been incredibly heart warming. From 7:30 this morning it hasn't stopped. It got to the point where I've had to ask people to go round the back to make room. ""The response from the schoolchildren has been especially nice to see as the schools are closed. They've made handmade cards for the firefighters, cakes, gifts, all sorts. ""I've been running round like a madman. It's been extremely disruptive and scary for the local residents but the community cohesion has been great to see."" Tony Hunter, assistant chief fire officer for the service, said there have been ""significant improvements"" but added an ""air of caution as we thought we had a similar situation yesterday"". He said if it does change direction it could add fuel to the fire. ""The fire is contained at the moment, but we only need a change of wind direction to see the fire increase. We are working hard to keep on top of the blaze."" He added: ""Our main action is to protect to the left-hand side to stop it spreading towards the residents, and to the right-hand side to make sure it doesn't go... into unburnt material."" Assistant chief fire officer for GMFRS says the fire was ""contained at the moment"" Resident Peter Fenton said he had been impressed with the way the community of Carrbrook, which had been evacuated on Tuesday, had come together in the wake of the fire. ""Schools are closed but the schoolchildren have been keeping busy handing out supplies to the police and firefighters,"" he said. Moorland fire in pictures How do you tackle a moorland blaze? ""Shops have been handing out water too, and I heard a supermarket sent up a whole stack of stuff."" Janine East, owner of Mill Brook fish and chip shop in Stalybridge, said she ""wanted to do her bit"" as she knows what a ""huge task"" they have. ""I know what it's like up on the moors and what the terrain's like. It's incredibly steep."" A panoramic view showed the extent of the smoke on Wednesday evening Evidence the fire was still burning could be seen as dawn broke on Thursday in Carrbrook Fire engines park up on the moor as firefighters continue tackling the blaze An investigation is set to be launched into the fire but Mr Hunter said: ""We can see this being prolonged for days if not weeks, particularly with the fact that the wind has drawn the fires towards the residential but actually away from the centre of the moor."" He said what was needed most was ""a significant downpour of rain"" - but none has been forecast. Mr Hunter said: ""Over the course of the fire it goes further and further down into the peat and once its down there, it gets very difficult without liquid to put the fire out unless you have a digger. ""We can't dig a square mile of moorland up."" This video can not be played Helicopters are being used in the effort to fight a moorland fire in Greater Manchester The blaze was initially brought under control but reignited on Monday Firefighters continued to battle the fire at daybreak On Wednesday, firefighters had faced the arduous task of hauling pumps and hoses for up to two miles in blistering heat to reach parts of the fire. Greater Manchester Police deployed a helicopter to assess the scene and United Utilities provided a helicopter to drop water on to remote areas. Having started on Sunday the blaze was initially brought under control but reignited on Monday and has continued throughout the hot and dry weather this week. About 150 people were forced to leave their homes in the village of Carrbrook on Tuesday evening as the fire encroached. The majority had returned by Wednesday afternoon. Community support officers patrolled the village of Carrbrook Dr Richard Bircher said fellow GPs had opened late to meet the extra demand An investigation is set to be launched into the cause of the fire. Dr Richard Bircher, of Lockside Medical Centre in Stalybridge, said he had treated nine ""normally fit and healthy"" people for chest complaints and breathing difficulties. ""Chest complaints can develop for a number of reasons but I think it's safe to assume the smoke is the main factor behind the increase,"" he said. Dr Bircher said he expected the number of people seeking treatment would continue to rise as smoke lingered, particularly among older people, but added there had been no increase in hospital admissions. He praised the response of Tameside's social care services and fellow GPs who had opened late to meet the extra demand for appointments and advised anybody exposed to smoke to continue to wear dust masks and seek advice if they developed breathing problems.

Brazil cruise into last 16 by beating Serbia,"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Serbia 0-2 Brazil highlights Brazil avoided a shock result that had earlier seenGermany knocked out of the World Cupby defeating Serbia to finish top of Group E and book a last-16 tie against Mexico. They did so with the sort of occasionally dazzling performance that suggests they are growing into a tournament that they are one of the favourites to win, as they put behind them their slow start in Russia. Paulinho had deservedly put Brazil in front with a deft finish after a brilliant run from deep saw him convert Philippe Coutinho's through ball in the first half. Tite's team had to protect a slender lead for a shaky 15-minute period at the start of the second half as Serbia went all out for the win they then needed. But Aleksandar Mitrovic found an opposition defender when he should have scored and saw another header saved by the unconvincing Alisson. And once Thiago Silva extended Brazil's advantage with an unmarked header from a corner, Tite's side regained a measure of composure and went close to a third on numerous occasions. Serbia may feel aggrieved the second was not ruled out by VAR for a push on Mitrovic by Miranda as the corner came in but they were outplayed overall. The result ended their hopes of qualifying from the group stage for the first time, while Brazil now head to Samara, where their last-16 tie will take place on Monday, as group winners having topped Group E over Switzerland on goal difference. World Cup Daily podcast: Low's 'shocking tactics' and what was Neuer playing at? Neymar was as influential as ever; taking 119 touches against Serbia - 21 more than any other player Tite's side were heavily criticised after their laboured display against Switzerland and their unconvincing performance against Costa Rica, which required two injury-time goals to claim a much-needed win for the five-times champions. In Moscow on Wednesday they were sluggish in parts and had lost control of midfield after the restart to such an extent that Tite brought on Manchester City's Fernandinho for goalscorer Paulinho. But Brazil have been solid defensively under Tite, conceding just five goals in 21 games going into the tournament, and despite riding their luck a little at 1-0 they undoubtedly deserved their three points. Neymar and Coutinho both sent team-mates clean through with sumptuous throughballs and the Brazilians created numerous good chances. Gabriel Jesus and Neymar were both denied by Stojkovic after being played clean through - the Serb keeper making a series of fine saves against the Paris St-Germain forward, with a one-handed stop late on the pick of the bunch. Jesus, Neymar and Coutinho were a constant menace as Brazil broke with dizzying speed and there were undoubted signs Brazil are starting to move through the gears as the tournament now moves into the knockout phase. It was a far from a perfect evening for one of the pre-tournament favourites as influential left-back Marcelo limped off early in the opening half. But Neymar's demeanour after the final whistle - smiling happily and waving to all sections of the crowd - reflected the change of mood within the Brazil camp. Aleksandar Mitrovic scored just one goal from 14 shots at the World Cup for Serbia Serbia were in bullish mood before the game with coach Mladen Krstajic saying ""nothing is impossible"" and striker Mitrovic asking ""why wouldn't we beat Brazil?"" And after a first half when they never really laid a glove on their illustrious opponents, they went all out after the restart. Mitrovic scored the goals that helped Fulham win promotion to the Premier League last season, but he was found wanting when Serbia - roared on by their passionate support - crafted a series of openings. Heading the ball straight at Brazil defender Miranda after Alisson had flapped horribly at a cross was probably the moment of the match for Serbia, with the chance coming during a period of sustained second-half pressure. Mitrovic also saw a header saved by Alisson, but after Brazil scored their second, and with Switzerland leading against Costa Rica in the other Group E tie, it was game over. Serbia exit the competition as they did in 2010 - at the group stage. But their failure to qualify is probably less about their result against Brazil than what happened in their previous game against Switzerland when they let a 1-0 lead slip to a damaging 2-1 defeat. Serbia coach Mladen Krstajic:""You have to be alive for 90 minutes or else you'll be punished. It's difficult to play such an open game against a powerhouse of football like Brazil. ""We need to up our game, elevate the quality to a higher level, improve what is good and eliminate the weaknesses. ""Not just now, but before the World Cup, Brazil were among the favourites to win. Football is like that, Germany are out and Brazil are certainly one of the favourites to win the tournament."" A superb pass for Paulinho's goal - clever, creative and always busy, the Barcelona forward is a joy to watch Brazil have qualified from the group stage of the World Cup for the 13th consecutive tournament, a run stretching back to 1970. Serbia have been eliminated at the group stage of the World Cup in all three of their tournaments as an independent nation (2006, 2010 and 2018). Brazil have now won back-to-back World Cup matches for the first time since 2010, when they won their opening two group matches. Philippe Coutinho has been involved in six goals in seven matches for Brazil in 2018 (four goals, two assists). Neymar has now scored five times and assisted twice in eight World Cup appearances for Brazil. Only Neymar and Gabriel Jesus (10 goals) have scored more goals for Brazil under current manager Tite than Paulinho (eight goals).

Trump gets chance to reshape top court,"Justice Kennedy's retirement hands Mr Trump a second pick on the US Supreme Court US Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy is to retire, giving President Donald Trump the chance to cement a conservative majority on the top court. The conservative has sided with liberals on many decisions, including the 5-4 rulings that decided same-sex marriage and upheld abortion rights. In his letter to Mr Trump, Justice Kennedy expressed ""profound gratitude"" for having served in the highest court. The 81-year-old judge will retire on 31 July, he said in his letter. He is the second-oldest justice on the nine-member US Supreme Court. Analysis: Why a fight over US abortion law looms Why is the US Supreme Court so important? The court plays a key role in American life and is often the final word on highly contentious laws, disputes between states and the federal government, and final appeals to stay executions. In recent years, it has expanded gay marriage to all 50 states, halted President Barack Obama's immigration orders and delayed a US plan to cut carbon emissions while appeals went forward. Earlier this week it upheld Mr Trump's travel banwhich covers people from several Muslim-majority countries, in a 5-4 conservative majority ruling. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, said on Wednesday that a vote on Mr Trump's nominee to replace Justice Kennedy - who earned a reputation as the court's ""swing"" vote - would take place by the autumn. Justice Kennedy has frequently sided with abortion rights advocates in the court and news of his retirement has raised fears among pro-choice groups that access to legal abortions in several states could be under threat. Justice Kennedy said he was retiring because he wanted to spend more time with his family. Justice Kennedy, who was raised in California, was nominated by President Ronald Reagan and began his term in 1988. He voted conservative on issues of campaign finance, voting rights and gun rights but was considered a swing vote on key rulings. Justice Kennedy penned the Supreme Court's first major gay-rights decision,externalin 1996, protecting LGBT Americans from discrimination. In 2015, he authored the landmark opinion which gave LGBT citizens the right to marry, writing: ""They ask for equal dignity in the eyes of the law and the Constitution grants them that right."" Meet the Supremes - the nine judges on US top court Not best of times in US, says top justice As a justice, he routinely favoured personal liberty and the limiting of federal power. Mr Trump said Justice Kennedy had ""displayed great vision"" and ""tremendous heart"". Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Without Anthony Kennedy, the political centre on the Supreme Court will be firmly on the right. Whoever Donald Trump nominates - and he's promised to draw from the same list of candidates from which he picked Neil Gorsuch - will be a person with solid conservative bona fides. Democrats and liberal activists will howl, rage and do all they can to slow the process, but the timing of Mr Kennedy's retirement makes what happens next all but inevitable. The president will surely offer his choice quickly, and if Republican senators stick together they have the votes to confirm before November's mid-terms congressional elections, let alone when new senators are sworn in next January. And even if the court vacancy becomes a campaign issue, the open seat in 2016 proved that court vacancies are a much stronger motivating consideration for Republicans - particularly evangelical voters - than they are for Democrats. File this as yet another entry in the ""elections have consequences"" scrapbook. If Hillary Clinton had prevailed in 2016, Democrats would be contemplating a 6-3 liberal Supreme Court majority and an opportunity to reshape the legal landscape for a generation. Instead, on subjects like abortion law and gay rights, the pendulum is swinging the other direction. During a meeting with Portuguese President Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa at the White House, President Trump said he would select a nominee to replace Justice Kennedy from a list of 25 potential court candidates that his campaign had compiled during the election. Mr Trump said the process to replace him would begin immediately. ""Hopefully we will pick someone who is just as outstanding"", he said. Mr Trump added that he had learned of the judge's retirement about a half hour before, when Justice Kennedy came to the White House to meet him. This video can not be played ""We have a very excellent list... of tremendous people"" The White House also released a statement thanking Justice Kennedy for his 30 years of service as a ""tireless voice for individual rights"". ""His words have left an indelible mark not only on this generation, but on the fabric of American history."" Top Democrat Chuck Schumer said in a televised speech on the floor of the Senate that Justice Kennedy's replacement would be a decision affecting ""generations"". ""Our Republican colleagues in the senate should follow the rule they set in 2016, not to consider a Supreme Court Justice in an election year,"" Senator Schumer said. ""Anything but that would be the absolute height of hypocrisy."" This video can not be played Judge Gorsuch spoke of his ""most solemn assignment"" Fellow Democrat Tammy Duckworth cited that same rule, pushed in 2016 by Republican leader Mitch McConnell, in a tweet.

Missing boy's body pulled from lake,"Ryan Evans's school said earlier it was ""deeply shocked"" he was missing The body of a 13-year-old boy who went missing while swimming in a lake with friends has been found. Rescue crews had been searching for Ryan Evans since he and two other boys were spotted ""in distress"" at Westport Lake in Stoke-on-Trent, on Monday. The other boys, aged 12 and 13, made it safely out of the lake, Staffordshire Police said. In atweet,external, the force confirmed they had found Ryan's body following an extensive search for him.

Chatbot claims to beat GPs at medical exam,"The artificial intelligence software provides what it determines to be the most likely diagnoses Claims that a chatbot can diagnose medical conditions as accurately as a GP have sparked a row between the software's creators and UK doctors. Babylon, the company behind the NHS GP at Hand app, says its follow-up software achieves medical exam scores that are on-par with human doctors. It revealed the artificial intelligence bot at an event held at the Royal College of Physicians. But another medical professional body said it doubted the AI's abilities. ""No app or algorithm will be able to do what a GP does,"" said the Royal College of General Practitioners. ""An app might be able to pass an automated clinical knowledge test - but the answer to a clinical scenario isn't always cut and dried. ""There are many factors to take into account, a great deal of risk to manage, and the emotional impact a diagnosis might have on a patient to consider."" The chatbot was unveiled at an event in London But NHS England chairman Sir Malcolm Grant - who attended the unveil - appeared to be more receptive. ""It is difficult to imagine the historical model of a general practitioner, which is after all the foundation stone of the NHS and medicine, not evolving,"" he said. ""We are at a tipping point of how we provide care. ""This is why we are paying very close attention to what you've been doing and what other companies are doing."" The chatbot AI has been tested on what Babylon said was a representative set of questions from the Membership of the Royal College of General Practitioners exam. The MRCGP is the final test set for trainee GPs to be accredited by the organisation. Babylon said that the first time its AI sat the exam, it achieved a score of 81%. It added that the average mark for human doctors was 72%, based on results logged between 2012 and 2017. Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors' Online GP consultation: Opportunity or threat? NHS offers smartphone GP appointments But the RCGP said it had not provided Babylon with the test's questions and had no way to verify the claim. ""The college examination questions that we actually use aren't available in the public domain,"" added Prof Martin Marshall, one of the RCGP's vice-chairs. Babylon said it had used example questions published directly by the college and that some had indeed been made publicly available. ""We would be delighted if they could formally share with us their examination papers so I could replicate the exam exactly. That would be great,"" Babylon chief executive Ali Parsa told the BBC. To further test the AI, Babylon partnered with doctors at two US organisations - Stanford Primary Care and Yale New Haven Health - as well as doctors from the Royal College of Physicians. It said they had developed 100 real-life scenarios to test the AI. The company added that it expected its chatbot's diagnostic skills would further improve as a consequence. Babylon has demonstrated its chatbot being used as a voice-controlled ""skill"" on Amazon's Alexa platform. While Babylon's existing GP at Hand service refers users to a human doctor if the app suspects a medical problem, the new chatbot makes a diagnosis itself - offering several possible scenarios along with a percentage-based estimate of each one being correct. The GP at Hand app launched in late-2017 ""The suggestion that this can replace doctors is the key issue for us,' said Prof Marshall. But Mr Parsa disputed the idea that doctors would be left out in the cold, explaining that the intention was still for a medic to follow up the AI's diagnoses. ""We are fully aware that an artificial intelligence on its own cannot look after a patient. And that is why we complement it with physicians,"" he said. ""It is never going to replace a doctor, but just to help."" Babylon envisages that a human doctor would make use of its chatbot's diagnosis within a follow-up video chat Babylon's stated ambition is to deliver affordable health care to people all over the world. Since 2016, it has been working in partnership with the government of Rwanda. The country's health care service was decimated after the genocide in 1994, in which more than 800,000 people were killed. Babylon has two million registered users in Rwanda and has conducted tens of thousands of consultations. Nurses in Rwanda have helped train Babylon's software by using it to diagnose people in the country Since smartphone use is not widespread in the country, people currently call nurses who follow symptom-checking prompts that appear to them via computer screens. Information gathered as a result has been used to improve the chatbot. BBC Click will have more on Babylon's work in Rwanda on this weekend's television show.

Civil partnership win for mixed-sex couple,"This video can not be played Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan said they were elated at the court's ruling A heterosexual couple have won their legal bid for the right to have a civil partnership instead of a marriage. The Supreme Court unanimously ruled in favour of Rebecca Steinfeld, 37, and Charles Keidan, 41, from London. The court said theCivil Partnership Act 2004,external- which only applies to same-sex couples - is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Ms Steinfeld said she hoped the government does the ""right thing"" and extends civil partnerships to all. ""We are feeling elated,"" she told the BBC outside court. ""But at the same time we are feeling frustrated the government has wasted taxpayers' money in fighting what the judges' have called a blatant inequality."" The judgement does not oblige government to change the law, although it does make it more likely that the government will now act, the BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman explained. In a civil partnership, a couple is entitled to the same legal treatment in terms of inheritance, tax, pensions and next-of-kin arrangements as marriage. The couple, who met in 2010 and have two children, said the ""legacy of marriage"" which ""treated women as property for centuries"" was not an option for them. ""We want to raise our children as equal partners and feel that a civil partnership - a modern, symmetrical institution - sets the best example for them,"" they explained. Where are heterosexual civil partnerships legal? Why we want a civil partnership Why choose civil partnership over marriage? Since March 2014, same sex-couples can choose whether to enter a civil partnership or to marry. This has not been possible for mixed-sex couples, which led Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan to argue that the law was discriminatory. This ruling overturns a previous judgement made by the Court of Appeal, whichrejected the couple's claim, in February of last year. Legal and financial protection for both parties in the event of the relationship ending, like in marriage It is free of the religious connotations of marriage Some object to marriage as an institution and its associations with property and patriarchy The judges ruled that current UK law was  ""incompatible"" with human rights laws on discrimination and the right to a private and family life. Announcing the court's decision, Lord Kerr said the government did not seek to justify the difference in treatment between same-sex and different sex couples. ""To the contrary, it accepts that the difference cannot be justified,"" he said. LGBT and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell called the ruling a ""victory for love and equality"". ""It was never fair that same-sex couples had two options, civil partnerships and civil marriages, whereas opposite-sex partners had only one option, marriage,"" he said. By BBC legal correspondent, Clive Coleman Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan appealed to the Supreme Court after the Court of Appeal rejected their claim in February 2017 It is an irony that the way in which relationship equality for same sex couples came about in the 21st century had the effect of creating inequality between them and different sex couples. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 created civil partnerships but defined them as a 'relationship between two people of the same sex'. When the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 legalised same sex marriage, gay couples had two options as to how to formalise their relationship in law - marriage or civil partnership - whereas heterosexual couples could only marry. The Supreme Court has found that inequality to amount to discrimination and a breach of the right to a family life. The government accepted the inequality between same sex and different sex couples, but argued that it needed to have time to assemble sufficient information to allow a confident decision to be made about the future of civil partnerships. Lord Kerr gave that argument short shrift, saying: ""What it (the government) seeks is tolerance of the discrimination while it sorts out how to deal with it.  That cannot be characterised as a legitimate aim."" The couple will later go to Whitehall to deliver a letter to Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt. Martin Loat, chairman of the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign, said: ""There is only one possible way forward - giving everyone the right to a civil partnership - and we urge the government to seize this opportunity to announce it will end this injustice now."" More than 130,000 people have signed an online petition in support of civil partnerships for everyone. The couple's barrister Karon Monaghan QC told the court her clients had ""deep-rooted and genuine ideological objections to marriage"" and are ""not alone"" in their views. There are around 63,000 couples in civil partnerships in the UK and some 3.3 million co-habiting couples.

Childminder numbers in England plummet,"There has been a significant fall in the number of registered childminders in England, figures from Ofsted show. New data shows there are now nearly 16,000 fewer registered childminders than around six years ago. Overall, there were 41,700 registered with the watchdog, Ofsted, at the end of March - down by 27% (15,700) since the end of August 2012. Campaigners say the situation is ""simply unacceptable"" and are calling for the government to take action. Childcare: Do UK parents pay the most in the world? The figures also show that there has been a drop of 600 since the end of last year alone. Ofsted statisticians said that between December 2017 and March, 1,300 childminders left the sector, while 800 joined. The childminders who left during this period had been registered for around nine years on average. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Pre-School Learning Alliance, said: ""It is incredibly concerning to see that the number of childminders has continued to decline. ""To lose 27% of a workforce over less than six years is simply unacceptable, and it beggars belief that the government has still not seen fit to do anything to tackle this ongoing trend. ""Childminders offer parents a vital source of quality, flexible care and education and the services they provide are absolutely crucial to the sector as a whole, especially at a time when the government is trying to expand the childcare offer in this country. ""As such, we urge the government to finally take some action on this issue - and addressing concerns over excessive paperwork, substantially increasing hourly funding rates and, crucially, removing unfair rules preventing childminders from claiming funding for related children would be a good start. ""As these statistics have made clear, simply ignoring the problem is not going to make it go away."" However, it was good news that 94% of all early years providers - including childminders and nurseries - were rated as good or outstanding, he added. Minister for Children and Families Nadhim Zahawi said: ""We want every child to have the best start in life. And it's clear from these figures that parents can be confident with the care and support on offer for their children. ""The quality of the childcare providers remains high, with more than nine out of 10 rated good or outstanding by Ofsted. ""We want to improve early years education and childcare for every child, regardless of their background. ""That's why we are spending more on childcare than any other government - around Â£6bn a year by 2020, including an additional Â£1bn a year to deliver our free childcare offers.""

Beer shortage hits biggest pub chains,"Britain's biggest pub group says some outlets are running out of certain beer brands as CO2 gas shortages continue to hit the food and drink sectors. Ei Group, which has 4,500 properties, said it was working with publicans to source alternative beers where needed. Some Wetherspoon pubs are temporarily without draught John Smith's and Strongbow cider. Many pub landlords are unable to pick and choose which brands they can sell because of restrictions. It comes ahead of England's World Cup group match with Belgium on Thursday, and predictions that the current UK heatwave could continue into the weekend. Carbon dioxide has multiple uses in the food and drink industries, from putting the gas in beer and cider, stunning farm animals before slaughter, and as a preservative to increase the shelf-life of packaged products. But the temporary closure of some UK and mainland European factories involved in producing the gas has created a shortage. Why the CO2 shortage really matters Beer sales rationed amid CO2 shortage Pig welfare at risk as CO2 shortage bites Ei Group, the former Enterprise Inns, would not disclose which brands are out of stock or running low. However, it is thought to include some Heineken products. An Ei spokesman said: ""We are aware of the issue relating to a shortage in the supply of CO2 and are working with our suppliers to minimise any disruption to our customers and our publicans."" A Wetherspoon spokesman said some of its pubs would be without John Smith's and Strongbow cider, which are both are made by Heineken. He added: ""Wetherspoon has the advantage that it sources its wide range of drinks from a number of suppliers, so has not been too badly affected. ""Heineken has been the company with the biggest issues and they have told us that all is getting back to normal."" Heineken said last week that the CO2 scarcity had caused production problems. A spokeswoman said on Wednesday: ""We'd like to reassure beer drinkers that all our breweries are operating at full capacity, and we're working 24/7 to get beers to our customers as quickly as possible."" Meanwhile, meat processors say changes to ""sell by"" dates may be needed because of delivery problems. Many producers are having to use lower levels of CO2 in their packaged meat and need to shorten their sell by deadline. Carbon dioxide has a range of uses including packaging fresh food Nick Allen, spokesman for the British Meat Processors' Association, said that if the practice became widespread it could cause big logistical headaches. ""If you shorten the sell-by date everyone has to move stuff more quickly. The supply chain is very complicated,"" he said. On Tuesday, Scotland's biggest abattoir shut until further notice because it ran out of C02 used to stun pigs before they are processed. The facility, at Brechin, which processed 6,000 animals a week, is sending pigs to England for slaughter. But these abattoirs are also running low on carbon dioxide. Also on Tuesday, the wholesale retailer Booker, which sells to bars and restaurants, started rationing beer, cider and soft drinks sales to customers. Coca-Cola temporarily paused some production lines, and retailers Morrisons and Ocado has shortages of some frozen product lines. CO2 makes dry ice, used to keep products cool in transit. The carbon dioxide shortage has also had a knock-on outside the food and drink sectors. The Glasgow Science Centre (GSC) visitor attraction has cancelled a summer programme due to the shortage because it was unable to get the dry ice it needed for its new show. Resident scientist Sam Langford said: ""Here at GSC we use carbon dioxide in its solid form in our science shows to demonstrate a number of scientific phenomena, including sublimation, ocean acidification and the three states of matter. ""Our plans for our brand new summer show have been put on hold,"" he said. ""Whilst this is a small problem for GSC, dry ice and other forms of CO2 being in short supply is a major problem for a number of industries for whom it is an essential product."" There are lots of uses for CO2 in the process of getting beer to your glass, but not all beers need it. As a general rule, lagers are more likely to use CO2 than ales. Wondering whether your ale uses CO2? If you're in the pub and your pint is being poured just by flicking a switch on a tap then it will be coming from a pressurised keg and will be propelled to your glass either by CO2 or by a mix of CO2 and nitrogen. If there's a pump that the bar staff need to pull, then the beer will be coming from a cask and will be mostly propelled by the pump. A keg will use CO2 to keep it under pressure, while a cask will not. Similarly, brewers use CO2 to move beer around their plants and to keep oxygen out of the tanks and pipes being used. CO2 is produced by yeast in the brewing process and may be either recovered or lost, so some brewers will buy in the gas to pump into the beer and make it fizzy.

Chatbot claims to beat GPs at medical examThe Royal College of General Practitioners disputes the abilities of Babylon's software.Technology,"The artificial intelligence software provides what it determines to be the most likely diagnoses Claims that a chatbot can diagnose medical conditions as accurately as a GP have sparked a row between the software's creators and UK doctors. Babylon, the company behind the NHS GP at Hand app, says its follow-up software achieves medical exam scores that are on-par with human doctors. It revealed the artificial intelligence bot at an event held at the Royal College of Physicians. But another medical professional body said it doubted the AI's abilities. ""No app or algorithm will be able to do what a GP does,"" said the Royal College of General Practitioners. ""An app might be able to pass an automated clinical knowledge test - but the answer to a clinical scenario isn't always cut and dried. ""There are many factors to take into account, a great deal of risk to manage, and the emotional impact a diagnosis might have on a patient to consider."" The chatbot was unveiled at an event in London But NHS England chairman Sir Malcolm Grant - who attended the unveil - appeared to be more receptive. ""It is difficult to imagine the historical model of a general practitioner, which is after all the foundation stone of the NHS and medicine, not evolving,"" he said. ""We are at a tipping point of how we provide care. ""This is why we are paying very close attention to what you've been doing and what other companies are doing."" The chatbot AI has been tested on what Babylon said was a representative set of questions from the Membership of the Royal College of General Practitioners exam. The MRCGP is the final test set for trainee GPs to be accredited by the organisation. Babylon said that the first time its AI sat the exam, it achieved a score of 81%. It added that the average mark for human doctors was 72%, based on results logged between 2012 and 2017. Artificial intelligence 'as good as cancer doctors' Online GP consultation: Opportunity or threat? NHS offers smartphone GP appointments But the RCGP said it had not provided Babylon with the test's questions and had no way to verify the claim. ""The college examination questions that we actually use aren't available in the public domain,"" added Prof Martin Marshall, one of the RCGP's vice-chairs. Babylon said it had used example questions published directly by the college and that some had indeed been made publicly available. ""We would be delighted if they could formally share with us their examination papers so I could replicate the exam exactly. That would be great,"" Babylon chief executive Ali Parsa told the BBC. To further test the AI, Babylon partnered with doctors at two US organisations - Stanford Primary Care and Yale New Haven Health - as well as doctors from the Royal College of Physicians. It said they had developed 100 real-life scenarios to test the AI. The company added that it expected its chatbot's diagnostic skills would further improve as a consequence. Babylon has demonstrated its chatbot being used as a voice-controlled ""skill"" on Amazon's Alexa platform. While Babylon's existing GP at Hand service refers users to a human doctor if the app suspects a medical problem, the new chatbot makes a diagnosis itself - offering several possible scenarios along with a percentage-based estimate of each one being correct. The GP at Hand app launched in late-2017 ""The suggestion that this can replace doctors is the key issue for us,' said Prof Marshall. But Mr Parsa disputed the idea that doctors would be left out in the cold, explaining that the intention was still for a medic to follow up the AI's diagnoses. ""We are fully aware that an artificial intelligence on its own cannot look after a patient. And that is why we complement it with physicians,"" he said. ""It is never going to replace a doctor, but just to help."" Babylon envisages that a human doctor would make use of its chatbot's diagnosis within a follow-up video chat Babylon's stated ambition is to deliver affordable health care to people all over the world. Since 2016, it has been working in partnership with the government of Rwanda. The country's health care service was decimated after the genocide in 1994, in which more than 800,000 people were killed. Babylon has two million registered users in Rwanda and has conducted tens of thousands of consultations. Nurses in Rwanda have helped train Babylon's software by using it to diagnose people in the country Since smartphone use is not widespread in the country, people currently call nurses who follow symptom-checking prompts that appear to them via computer screens. Information gathered as a result has been used to improve the chatbot. BBC Click will have more on Babylon's work in Rwanda on this weekend's television show.

Grenfell firefighter questions 'absurd',"This video can not be played Michael Dowden pausing before answering a question on Monday The Grenfell inquiry has come under criticism for asking ""absurd"" questions of the firefighter who led the initial response to last year's fire. The Fire Brigades Union (FBU) said the questions that Michael Dowden, a watch manager, faced over three days should have been directed at his superiors. It said Mr Dowden had done what all firefighters did that night - ""tried his utmost to save lives"". The inquiry chairman praised Mr Dowden's courage in the witness box. However, Matt Wrack, general secretary of the FBU, said there were ""important and difficult"" questions to ask but they should not be directed at ""those who do not have the power or authority to have altered policies, operational procedures or training"". ""The line of questioning toward Mike Dowden has been, at times, absurd,"" he said. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal What happened at Grenfell Tower Visual guide to the fire He stressed Mr Dowden was not a fire chief, nor a middle manager, but a junior officer. ""On the night of the fire, he was originally in charge of two fire engines at one fire station. ""Mike Dowden did not apply flammable cladding to Grenfell Tower. Nor did he make the other alterations which destroyed the fire safety within the building. Nor did he start the fire. ""He was simply on duty when the worst fire since World War Two broke out. ""Like all firefighters that night, he was placed in an impossible situation. He did what they all did; he tried his utmost to save lives."" The FBU also accused the inquiry of approaching the issues ""back to front"", saying it should have called those who made the decisions around the refurbishment to give evidence first. ""The alterations to Grenfell Tower happened before the fire and before any fire fighting took place,"" said Mr Wrack. ""The order of the inquiry is chronologically and causally wrong."" At the end of his evidence, senior counsel Richard Millett said to Mr Dowden: ""We, as a team, salute you."" Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the chairman, said Mr Dowden's evidence was ""really valuable"" and set a good example to those who would follow. However, after a short break, Sir Martin said there had been concern about his comments praising Mr Dowden. ""My remarks were entirely borne out of courtesy for the witness and a degree of compassion for someone who clearly found giving evidence over three days a difficult matter and sometimes, as we all saw, more than he could really cope with. ""I hope that it went without saying that my remarks did not in any sense prejudice my view of the issues. There's a long way to go in this inquiry."" The inquiry has the power to compel witnesses to give evidence but said it did not intend to use those powers in the case of firefighter witnesses. The chairman also has the power to change the method used to obtain evidence in the case of vulnerable witnesses. As in the case of Mr Dowden, he can order more frequent breaks. He can also restrict the duration of questioning or take evidence through an intermediary, a recorded statement or a video link. At one stage during his evidence, the hearing was briefly suspended afterMr Dowden broke down in tearswhen footage of the disaster was shown. On Wednesday, he appeared under considerable strain again as he was repeatedly asked why he did notalter the guidance from ""stay put"" to a mass evacuation. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? BBC home affairs correspondent Tom Symonds said there was no cross-examination of witnesses but the questions asked by Mr Millett were being influenced by pressure behind the scenes from other barristers. They are not allowed to directly question witnesses and so he asks questions on their behalf. A source told our correspondent that Mr Millett has been asked to put a series of questions to establish Mr Dowden's relatively junior position within the fire service. Earlier, the inquiry heard it was rare for a watch manager to be in command of a fire involving more than four fire engines.

France brings back national service,"The mandatory part of national service will last a month, while the second, longer phase will be more closely focused on defence and security The French government has introduced a plan to bring back national service for all 16-year-olds. It was an idea put forward by Emmanuel Macron in his presidential campaign, to promote a sense of civic duty and national unity among French youth. But some remain unconvinced of the benefits. The new national service will cover all 16-year-olds, girls as well as boys, and will be divided into two distinct phases. The first phase is a mandatory one-month placement with a focus on civic culture, which the government says will ""enable young people to create new relationships and develop their role in society"". Voluntary teaching and working with charities are among the options being looked at, alongside traditional military preparation with the police, fire service or army. The second phase is a voluntary placement of at least three months and up to a year, in which young people will be encouraged to serve ""in an area linked to defence and security"" - but again, they could opt to carry out volunteer work linked to heritage, the environment or social care. More on Macron: French MPs back Macron's rail reforms Macron splashing out on presidential pool How tech took the bite out of France's rail strikes It's not quite the programme Mr Macron initially had in mind. When he first floated the idea, during the 2017 race for the presidency, it was a sort of military service in miniature, with all French citizens forced to have a ""direct experience of military life"" for a minimum of one month between the ages of 18 and 21. Students' groups, already unimpressed with education reforms, have so far been lukewarm about national service That's now been softened and broadened into what's being called a Universal National Service - partly because of concerns that it would cost too much and overburden the country's armed forces. Even now, the programme is estimated to cost â¬1.6bn (Â£1.4bn; $1.8bn) a year to run, with â¬1.75bn of investment up front. The goal of this new-style national service, the government says, is to encourage young French citizens to take part in the life of the nation, and promote social cohesion. Consultations will now begin, with a view to rolling out the programme from early next year. But there is still a lot of detail to be hammered out, not least the legal basis. A working group, set up to look into the scheme, has warned that the French constitution bans the state from forcing an entire section of the population to spend time away from home, except in the case of national defence. Even before it was announced, 14 youth organisations objected to the ""inconsistencies"" in the plan, unhappy with the idea of being forced to take part in a project. ""Choosing a commitment is just as important as the commitment itself, if not more so,"" they argued, calling for young people to be able to exercise freedom of choice. This video can not be played When Emmanuel Macron told a French teen to call him ""Mr President"" More broadly, about 60% of the population are in favour, according to a YouGov poll carried out in March, although the number dips to just below half when younger people are asked for their views. Mr Macron is the first French president not to have done military service; it was scrapped for the new intake in 1996, when Mr Macron was 18. Before that, all young French men were expected to serve for the best part of a year in the armed forces. When the old post-war draft ended, in 1997, there was a collective sigh of relief. Amid the nostalgia, many people here recognised that it had become a social exercise rather than a military one. Twenty years later, it's that social cohesion President Macron now wants to recapture. North Koreais the country with the longest compulsory military service, with 11 years for men and seven years for women Israel'scompulsory military service is three years for men and two years for women Scandinavian countries,Switzerland, Austria,andGreeceare among the European countries that still have compulsory military service Chinahas military conscription in theory only - it has never been enforced because volunteers already make its army the biggest in the world Indiahas never had mandatory military service, even during British rule. It has the world's second largest army, also made up of volunteers The last time men were called to duty through conscription in theUKwas in 1960 while in theUSit was in 1973 Iranhas two-year mandatory service for men, though there are exceptions for only sons, doctors and fire fighters, and gay and transgender people How tech took the bite out of France's rail strikes Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Ticketmaster admits hack attack,"Ticketmaster sold 292 million tickets in 2017 Ticketmaster has admitted that it has suffered a security breach, which the BBC understands has affected up to 40,000 UK customers. Malicious software on third-party customer support product Inbenta Technologies caused the hack, the firm said on Twitter. ""Some personal or payment information may have been accessed by an unknown third party"", it added. All affected customers have been contacted. In the email to those customers, Ticketmaster said it had set up awebsite,externalto answer any questions and advised them to reset their passwords. It also offered them a free 12-monthidentity monitoring service,external. It said the breach was likely to have only affected UK customers who purchased or attempted to purchase tickets between February and 23 June 2018. But, as a precaution, it said it had also informed international customers who had purchased or attempted to purchase tickets between September 2017 and 23 June 2018. The company added that North American customers were not affected. Information that may have been compromised includes names, addresses, email addresses, telephone numbers, payment details and Ticketmaster log-in details. It said that ""forensic teams and security experts are working around the clock"" to understand how data was compromised. Ticketmaster is confident it has complied with General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules - acting very quickly and informing all relevant authorities, including the Information Commissioner's office. The UK's National Cyber Security Centre - a division of GCHQ - said it was monitoring the situation. ""The NCSC is working with our partners to better understand the incident,"" added a spokesman. Ticketmaster's parent, Live Nation, declared it had 86 million customers in its most recent annual report. However, a spokeswoman was unable to break out a figure for Ticketmaster's total number of UK clients. One expert said members of the public should now be on the lookout for follow-up phishing scams. ""After an incident like this, criminals from around the world will jump at the chance to try and catch a few unsuspecting people out,"" said Brooks Wallace from the cyber-security specialist Trusted Knight.

China lifts ban on British beef exports,"China has ended a two-decades-long ban on imports of beef from the UK, first introduced after the outbreak of BSE - or ""mad cow disease"" - in the 1990s. The government said the development will be worth Â£250m to British producers over the next five years. It comes after years of site inspections and negotiations between UK and Chinese government officials. It now allows official market access negotiations to begin, a process which usually takes around three years. The announcement comes after Prime Minister Theresa May's trade mission to China earlier this year, during which President Xi Jinping signalled that a lifting of the beef ban would be happening soon. Chancellor Philip Hammond, who is visiting China this week, tweeted: ""This is great news for British farmers."" The UK currently sells more than Â£560m of food and drink from the farming sector a year to China, making it the eighth-biggest export market for such products. ""Today's milestone will help to unlock UK agriculture's full potential and is a major step to forging new trading relationships around the globe,"" said a Department for Environment statement. The announcement comes two days after China signed a deal to lift a ban on French beef imposed more than a decade ago.

Warmest June day in Scotland for two decades,"This video can not be played Warmest day in Scotland for five years Scotland is basking in its warmest June day in more than two decades - and its hottest single day for five years. Temperatures reached 31C in Aviemore at 14:00 on Wednesday afternoon. Forecasters said they could climb higher before the end of the day - far exceeding the previous record of 29C hit in June 1995. BBC Scotland weather presenter Gillian Smart said it could be a similar story on Thursday, with the mercury set to hit 31C in Glasgow. Three-year-old Harley Murray cools down at Portobello beach These groups show there is more than one way to enjoy a sunny day at the seaside The highest June temperature ever recorded was 32.2C at Ochertyre, Perth and Kinross, on 18 June 1893.

And in June 1986, temperatures hit 31.6C at Inverailort in the Highlands. Last year's highest June temperature was 27.3C which was recorded at Floors Castle in the Borders. Ashley Arthur and Norman the puggle saw some of the best sunshine at Portobello Earlier this week, The Met Office issued a heatwave warning for England, wheretemperatures peaked at 30.3C in Rostherne, Cheshire on Tuesday. BBC weather watcher Killiecloudspotter sent this pictures of cows soaking up some rays in Kilmarnock. The swans in Taynuilt look like they are also enjoying the heatwave in this picture sent by BBC Weather Watcher Birdman of Dalfern. Weather watcher KJ-Narnia has a glorious backdrop to their al fresco breakfast in Glenmoriston. Not everyone is enjoying clear blue skies and glorious sunshine, however. Early-morning patches of mist, fog and low cloud were expected to linger along the coasts of Aberdeenshire, Angus and Fife throughout the day. Together with an easterly breeze, it was expected to peg back temperatures to between 16C and 20C. How hot is it where you are? When is it too hot to work? Staying safe and cool in UK heatwave conditions The hot, dry weather may be good news for sun worshippers but it's bad news for midges. James Logan, from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said the dry weather causes the insects to dehydrate. ""So when the weather is very hot and the sun is out, they tend to disappear,"" he told BBC Radio Scotland. ""You might still get bitten in forested areas but they will stay out of the direct sunlight. ""When they lay their eggs, they lay them in damp, peaty, boggy soil and if that starts to dry up a bit there will be fewer midges around."" The prolonged period of dry weather has prompted Scottish Water to ask some customers to use their water ""wisely"". On Lewis, the conditions have causedlower than normal water levels in Loch Mor an Stairr, which supplies Stornoway Water Treatment Works. This great view of the north-east countryside was snapped near Huntly by BBC weather watcher Calios. Weather watcher Wildswimmer sent us this picture of Stornoway harbour on Wednesday morning. A similar appeal has been made to households and businesses served by the Badentinan Water Treatment Works in Moray. This includes people in the Elgin, Kinloss, Forres, Burghead, Lossiemouth, Rothes, Fochabers, Dufftown and Craigellachie areas. A Scottish Water spokesman said: ""There are no areas where normal water supplies to customers have been affected by the generally dry weather across Scotland in the past few weeks. ""Scottish Water has issued advice to customers to use water wisely in two localised areas, parts of Moray and the Stornoway area of Lewis. ""The advice was issued because of prolonged dry weather in these areas, despite some recent rainfall, and (in the case of Moray) increased demand. ""Scottish Water is managing water supplies across Scotland through this extended dry period and will continue to monitor the situation closely.""

Prince in first royal visit to West Bank,"The prince met residents of the Jalazone Refugee Camp near Ramallah Prince William has expressed hope for ""lasting peace"" between Israelis and Palestinians during a visit to the occupied West Bank. The Duke of Cambridge spoke before holding talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah. The prince is the first royal family member to make an official visit to the Palestinian Territories. In Israel on Tuesday, President Reuven Rivlin urged him to take a ""message of peace"" to Mr Abbas. Mr Abbas told the prince that ""the Palestinian side is committed to the peace process with the Israelis"". Prince William said: ""I'm very glad that our two countries work so closely together and have had success stories with education and relief work in the past. So, long may that continue. My sentiment's the same as yours in hoping there's a lasting peace for the region."" In pictures: Prince William's Middle East tour Prince William meets Eurovision winner The Duke of Cambridge, who started his Middle East tour in Jordan on Sunday, also visited a refugee camp and toured a market in Ramallah.

Home security cam sent video to wrong user,"This video can not be played WATCH: Video footage from a family's kitchen was leaked via Swann's app A leading security camera-maker has sent footage from inside a family's home to the wrong person's app. Swann Security has blamed a factory error for the data breach - which was brought to its attention by the BBC - and said it was a ""one-off"" incident. However, last month another customer reported a similar problem saying his version of the same app had received footage from a pub's CCTV system. Swann said it was attempting to recover the kit involved in this second case. In the meantime, it said it had notified the UK's data privacy watchdog of both cases. ""Swann Communications (Europe) have made us aware of this incident and we will be making inquiries,"" the Information Commissioner's Office said in a statement of its own. ""If anyone has concerns about how their data has been handled, they can report these concerns to us."" Swann is owned by the Infinova Group, a US-based security camera specialist with offices across the globe. The BBC first learned of the problem on Saturday, when a member of its staff began receiving motion-triggered video clips from an unknown family's kitchen. Until that point, Louisa Lewis had only received footage from her own Swann security camera, which she had been using since December. Ms Lewis installed the Swann camera after one of her neighbours was burgled The development coincided with Ms Lewis's camera running out of battery power and requiring a recharge. ""I was out and I had a couple of alerts,"" she recalled. ""Naturally, I looked at my phone only to see the video was not of my home. ""At first I ignored it - I thought it must be an error - then I had several other alerts, at which point I thought I had better get in touch with Swann."" The clips, which had automatically downloaded to her handset, featured a man and woman passing close to the camera. A child's voice could also be heard in the background. A Swann customer representative told Ms Lewis that nothing could be done until after the weekend. Ms Lewis received multiple video clips before Swann intervened to stop the alerts And it was only after the matter was flagged to the firm's PR agency on Monday that she stopped receiving video clips. Following an internal investigation, a Swann spokeswoman later provided an explanation. She said that ""human error"" had caused two cameras to be manufactured that shared the same ""bank-grade security key - which secures all communications with its owner"". ""This occurred after the [family] connected the duplicate camera to their network and ignored the warning prompt that notified: 'Camera is already paired to an account' and left the camera running,"" she added. ""We are regretful that this was not addressed immediately and adequately by our support team, when discovered. We have addressed this and made some internal changes."" The spokeswoman said that Swann had been unable to identify or contact the family involved. ""We can confirm that no further data was breached or accessed by additional third parties,"" she added. The BBC discovered there had been a report of a similar incident in May. Another Swann security kit owner had posted images to Twitter in an attempt to identify a pub sending video clips to an app used by him and his wife. Allow Twitter content?

""One day we were watching our own cameras, the next - when we opened the app up - it was someone else's,"" recalled Tim Lane, who lives in Leicestershire. ""One of the cameras looked over the desk of the maitre d' and we thought we recognised a stag logo on the pile of menus. ""Searching the internet for restaurants with a stag theme became a bit of an obsession for us for a week or more."" He added that he initially thought the pub might be overseas, but was surprised to eventually discover it was a short drive away. Mr Lane subsequently visited the pub - The Bradgate - to warn its staff. ""The manager initially appeared suspicious and perhaps a little hostile,"" Mr Lane said. ""I really can't blame him, we could have been hackers. In reality we were both victims of a breach of personal privacy somewhere in Swann's systems."" Allow Twitter content?

But when The Bradgate and Mr Lane agreed to divulge their usernames to the BBC, the logins did not match. One cyber-security expert has raised concern. ""I can kind of see how the duplicate security key happened, but the second scenario seemed very unlikely,"" Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey explained. ""I'm dubious that two users unrelated other than by geographic area would choose the same username and password combination enabling one to see the live video feed of the other. ""When both incidents are combined it does make you wonder if there are others who have had similar issues, and whether there is more at work here than has been so far explained.""

Grenfell evacuation 'not considered',"The firefighter who led the initial response to the Grenfell fire did not consider evacuating the tower even as residents came out coughing and sooty, a public inquiry has heard. Watch manager Michael Dowden said his mind was on the crews inside the burning building and he was ""consumed"" with what was happening externally. By the time he had called out 15 fire engines, he said he felt ""helpless"". A deputy assistant commander would usually oversee a fire of that scale. Giving evidence for a third day, Mr Dowden, who appeared under considerable strain, said: ""I've never operated at that level before. ""I was making decisions to the best of my ability with all good intentions to try to successfully resolve that incident."" Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal What happened at Grenfell Tower Visual guide to the fire Residents were told to ""stay put"" inside the building when the fire was first reported at 00:54 BST. It was just under two hours before that guidance was changed and everyone was told to try to leave. Expert Dr Barbara Lane earlier told the hearing that the ""stay put"" advicehad ""effectively failed""within around half an hour of the fire starting. Mr Dowden, who served as incident commander until 02:00 BST, sent a ""persons reported"" message to the control room after seeing a man and his son with signs of smoke inhalation coming out of the building, the inquiry heard. His handwritten note made after the fire was then shown to the hearing. It said: ""All my experience now gone out of the window, very daunting moment. I felt helpless."" He was then asked whether on seeing sooty-faced people exiting the building, he considered evacuating the high-rise. ""As an incident commander, the challenge we faced, an almost impossible situation trying to evacuate that building at that time with the resources in attendance,"" Mr Dowden told the hearing. ""It is something I still search for today."" Richard Millett QC, counsel to the inquiry, apologised before asking his next question as to whether Mr Dowden considered informing the control room about the people coming out of the building so they could change their survival advice to 999 callers inside the tower. ""I have no thought at that moment in time, being witness to what was happening and unfolding in front of me,"" Mr Dowden said. ""That was a decision I didn't take at this time."" He went on to say that by 01:29 BST, it was apparent the flames had almost reached roof level and he had requested 20 fire engines on the advice of a fellow watch manager. Asked if he thought it was still safe for 999 operators to tell residents to stay inside, he said: ""Everything that I had previously experienced and everything I had understood as an incident command, yes - if a building doesn't fail."" He told the hearing he did not think the internal building had failed, but said ""something was happening to the external of that building"". He said at that time he still believed the fire could be beaten, and sent a specialist rescue crew up to roof level to extinguish the blaze from above. He later found they had not managed to do so. This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? Mr Dowden was questioned on why he did not declare a major incident when the fire reached the top of the building. ""I was just totally consumed by everything that was going on around me,"" he said. The inquiry also heard that Mr Dowden did not receive crucial information from firefighters radioing down from the ""bridgehead"" - a safe air space two floors below the flat on fire. That night, officers using breathing apparatus were communicating on channel six, while Mr Dowden received messages on channel one, the inquiry heard. Radios built into breathing apparatus were known to be unreliable, the hearing was told. Their messages would have told Mr Dowden which floors the fire had spread to, the state of mind of the firefighters and their locations. The inquiry was also told that the fire chiefs who took over from Mr Dowden at 1:50 BST were led to believe ""only the exterior"" of the cladding was burning. Pressed on the details of his handover to deputy assistant commander Andrew O'Loughlin, Mr Dowden said: ""Trying to put it into some perspective - I had just been in charge of this incident for an hour. ""I had seen something that most junior officers probably in the UK fire service had never been involved with. ""To try and pinpoint every single bit of information that was handed over at that point is very, very difficult."" On Tuesday, the hearing was briefly suspended afterMr Dowden broke down in tearsafter footage of the disaster was shown. The inquiry into last June's fire in west London, which caused 72 deaths, is currently examining what happened on that night.

Drug deaths hospital doctor 'did her best',"This video can not be played Former Gosport hospital doctor Jane Barton did her ""best for her patients"", her husband says. The doctor who oversaw the practice of prescribing powerful painkillers at Gosport War Memorial Hospital was working in a ""very inadequately resourced part of the health service"". More than 450 patients died after being given the drugs inappropriately,a report concluded last week. A statement read out on behalf of Dr Jane Barton said she was a ""doctor doing the best for her patients"". Relatives described the statement as ""worthless"" and a ""waste of time"". Dr Barton appeared outside her Gosport home where the statement was read by her husband, Tim Barton. New force to take on hospital deaths probe Gran 'was treated brutally' at hospital Who is Dr Jane Barton? He said: ""Jane would like to thank her family, friends, colleagues, former patients and the many others for their continued support and loyalty through this protracted inquiry. ""She has always maintained she was a hardworking, dedicated doctor - doing the best for her patients in a very inadequately resourced part of the health service. ""We ask that our privacy is respected at this difficult time and she will be making no further comments."" Mr Barton told reporters to direct further inquiries tothe Medical Defence Union,external, which is representing Dr Barton. Inquests into the deaths of 10 patients, six of whom are pictured, were held in 2009 Bridget Devine-Reeves, whose grandmother Elsie Reeves died at the hospital, told the BBC: ""The panel found there was a disregard for human life and it is extraordinary that she should have the audacity to say she was doing the best for patients - the statement given is worthless."" Anne Farthing's stepfather-in-law, Arthur 'Brian' Cunningham, also died at the hospital. He had been admitted with bed sores but died after being given powerful opiates and sedatives. She said: ""They have to make some statement so obviously they're going to come up with something that's just a front, quite frankly. ""It's just a waste of space and a waste of time."" The independent panel's report found there was an ""institutionalised regime"" of prescribing and administering ""dangerous"" amounts of a medication not clinically justified at the hospital from 1989 to 2000. It said taking into account missing records, a further 200 patients may have also had their lives shortened. The findings have led to calls for an inquiry from families. Hampshire Constabulary, which was criticised in the report for the way it handled three previous investigations into the deaths of 92 patients which failed to lead to any prosecutions, is to hand over any new inquiry to another force. Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney apologised for the force's ""part in the distress caused to families for so many years"". So far, the only person to face disciplinary action has been Dr Barton, who was found guilty of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999. But no prosecutions were brought and she was not struck off the medical register, choosing to retire after the findings. This video can not be played Gosport hospital: Families 'grossly let down' by authorities The Gosport Independent Panel's report found whistleblowers and families were ignored as they attempted to raise concerns about the administration of medication on the wards, which was overseen by Dr Barton. The report said an ""awareness"" that the deaths ""might be due to 'another Shipman'"" had ""cast a shadow over how concerns at the hospital were viewed"". GP Harold Shipman was jailed for life in 2000 for murdering 15 patients between 1995 and 1998. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Following the release of the report, Prime Minister Theresa May described events at Gosport as ""deeply troubling"" and apologised to families over the time it took to get answers from the NHS.

John Lewis warns of zero first-half profit,"John Lewis Partnership, which owns John Lewis department stores and the Waitrose supermarket chain, has warned that profits in the first half of the year will be ""close to zero"". Last year the group made Â£26.6m in the first half, and blamed heavy investment for this year's expected fall. It also announced it would change the names of its stores to John Lewis & Partners and Waitrose & Partners. The retailer said its Waitrose chain would close five of its 353 shops. It also has 50 John Lewis department stores. The name change to Waitrose & Partners and John Lewis & Partners was intended to emphasis the importance of the chain's 85,000 members of staff, known as ""partners"" who are given an annual bonus based on the chain's profits. The aim of the rebranding was to differentiate the group from other retailers, the company said. The rebranding will begin in September with London's Oxford Street store. John Lewis staff bonus cut again Five things to do with empty retail space Six reasons behind the High Street crisis Two Little Waitrose stores will close in Manchester, one in Birmingham and one in central London. It will also shut its supermarket in Camden in London. In a statement John Lewis said it was widely acknowledged that the retail sector was going through a period of ""generational change"". Its response would be to focus on ""greater differentiation - not scale"" and invest more in developing ""unique"" products and services, as well as placing more emphasis on its own brand. It said it would continue to invest between Â£400m and Â£500m per year in the business. As well as warning it did not expect to make any profit in the first half of the year, it said there were a ""wide range of possible outcomes, for the full year, given the market uncertainty"". It said it was assuming that profits before exceptional items would be ""substantially lower"" than last year's Â£290m. While profits are expected to grow at Waitrose, the John Lewis department stores are expected to see profits decline this year. In March, John Lewis Partnership announced that bonuses had been cut for the fifth year in a row. Employees got a 5% bonus, down from 6% last year and the lowest since the 4% paid out in 1954. Richard Lim, chief executive of Retail Economics, said the group was facing a ""cocktail of pressures"" on its profitability. Many retailers have come under pressure in recent months thanks to the growth of online shopping and lower footfall on High Streets, combined with rising costs and a fall in consumer confidence. Retail experts have said one solution is to offer ""experiences"" that shoppers cannot get online. For John Lewis, one example of that is personal shopping. The new John Lewis store in Shepherd's Bush in west London has a team of six personal shoppers to help customers select fashion items and outfits. According to a spokeswoman, customers who used the service spent on average 30% more a year following their appointments, than people who had not used it. The six personal shoppers generated one fifth of the total womenswear sales in the store, she added. John Lewis also plans to build a presence in the home services market, offering plumbing and electrical work, as well as financial services. Sir Charlie Mayfield, chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, said: ""For us, the relentless pursuit of greater scale is not the right course. Our plans put differentiation, innovation and partner-led service at the heart of our offer."" However, the group added, the changes it was making relied on ""sustained investment"". It said it would raise Â£500m by over three years to invest in ""product and service innovation"". This video can not be played Sir Charlie Mayfield says in today's retail climate 'just being good isn't really good enough' It said it would raise the funds by ""rebuilding profitability at Waitrose"", getting more out of its property, by putting space it does not need to other uses, and ""conducting a review of the partnership's pension scheme"" which has an accounting deficit of Â£731m. Sir Charlie told the BBC the pension fund would ""only change if partners want it to change, but... it's a Â£6bn pension fund so there may be opportunities for us to make small changes there that could add up to significant amounts of money over long periods of time"". Mr Lim of Retail Economics said John Lewis ""used to be the retailer that everyone looked at as being a success story on the High Street"". But this latest announcement suggests in the current climate it is becoming ""increasingly difficult for businesses to ride out structural change in the industry"", he added. ""If John Lewis is finding it difficult I'm sure a number of other retailers are in a similar situation.""

Diet pills death accused man guilty,"Eloise Parry was ""enchanted by her weight loss"" despite becoming unhealthy, the court heard A man has been found guilty of the manslaughter of a bulimic student who bought a toxic slimming aid online. Eloise Parry, 21, from Shrewsbury, died after taking eight diet pills containing dinitrophenol (DNP). Bernard Rebelo, 30, of Gosport, was convicted of two counts of manslaughter at Inner London Crown Court. Before she died in April 2015, Miss Parry needed hospital treatment several times for side effects of the tablets. Midlands Live: Swimmers defy quarry ban despite deaths; TV appeal over pensioner beaten to death Rebelo, who denied manslaughter, admitted during the trial he sold the pills to her, but said there was a warning about the drug on his website. Manslaughter charges were dropped against Albert Huynh, 33, from Northolt, north-west London, and Mary Roberts, 32, from Gosport, after the judge rule there was insufficient evidence the pair were involved. Miss Parry, a student at Glyndwr University, Wrexham, had had mental health problems as a teenager and as well as the bulimia had borderline personality disorder. DNP: The pills used by slimmers and bodybuilders Diet drug not for consumption, jury told 'Overwhelmed' hospital missed DNP overdose Lethal' DNP diet pills still on sale despite crackdown DNP is a highly toxic substance when ingested, inhaled or absorbed through the skin. Declared unfit for human consumption in the US as far back as 1938, it causes weight loss by burning fat and carbohydrates, with energy being converted into heat. Bernard Rebelo has been told to expect a lengthy sentence Miss Parry had become ""focused"" on losing weight before her death, her sister Rebecca, 19, told the trial. She seemed ""too enchanted by her weight loss to acknowledge how unhealthy she was getting"". Miss Parry started taking the pills in February 2015, and quickly became addicted to them. In a statement read to the court, Rebecca said she was with her sister on 11 April, the evening before she died in hospital. She left her at about 21:00 BST after a conversation about her ordering a takeaway before noticing the next day Miss Parry had binged on food before taking the diet pills. DNP tablets bought online by the BBC Harrow Council searched the flat where Rebelo was based And in texts to her university lecturer hours before she died, Miss Parry said: ""I screwed up big time. Binged/purged all night and took four pills at 4am. ""I took another four when I woke and I started vomiting soon after. I think I am going to die. ""No one is known to survive if they vomit after taking DNP. I am so scared."" Rebelo was operating from a flat in Harrow, north west London, and made the capsules to be sold online for considerable profits, his trial was told. The chemicals were bought in drums from China, bypassing authorities such as the Food Standards Agency and Interpol which had tried to close the operation down. Graham Henson, leader of Harrow Council, which was involved in bringing the prosecution, said: ""This sets a precedent that we can now prosecute people for selling pesticides, like DNP, online as a slimming agent."" Rebelo is due to be sentenced on Friday.

Millennial's victory shakes up DemocratsAlexandria Ocasio-Cortez will stand for Congress after beating a New York party stalwart in a primary.,"This video can not be played Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez celebrates her win with supporters A millennial candidate has shaken up the US Democratic Party by defeating the incumbent congressman for his seat. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 28, defeated political veteran Joe Crowley, 56, on Tuesday night in their party's congressional primary in New York City. Mr Crowley, a 10-term Democrat, had been tipped as a future party leader or even Speaker of the House. Ms Ocasio-Cortez, a former Bernie Sanders volunteer from a Puerto Rican family, won with 57.5% of the vote. Mr Crowley had not faced a challenger from his own party in 14 years in the mostly ethnic minority district, which covers parts of the Bronx and Queens. Ms Ocasio-Cortez will now face Republican candidate Anthony Pappas in the November mid-terms. If she wins, she will become the youngest ever woman elected to Congress. Why US mid-term elections matter First black female nominee for US governor Can Democrats torpedo Trump in 2018? She led a progressive campaign, supporting universal healthcare, tuition-free college and criminal justice reform. Following Ms Ocasio-Cortez's win, Merriam-Webster tweeted that socialism emerged as their top search item. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In fact she found little support from established Democrats. Did 'socialism' save this US town? Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a top Democrat who has a political action committee designed to support women candidates, endorsed her opponent Mr Crowley. Ms Ocasio-Cortez posted on Twitter after Ms Gillibrand's endorsement that the New York senator ""didn't even bother to talk to nor consider me before endorsing"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News The progressive left just fired a warning shot across the bow of the Democratic Party establishment. Congressman Joe Crowley was seen as a potential future speaker of the House of Representatives. Now he is taking a forced exit from politics, paying tribute to the young activist who defeated him with a rendition of Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run after conceding defeat. Up until now, it seemed like Democratic incumbents had been insulated from the anger and energy that has coursed through the political left during the Trump presidency. New candidates - many younger, many women - were running for office, but they were mostly winning open primary contests or losing to better-funded, better-known Democratic incumbents. That may have just changed. The rage among the liberal base - stoked by heart-rending accounts of children separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border - has led to new bursts of activism, confrontation and, perhaps, an anti-establishment fervour that could endanger seemingly safe Democratic politicians. The party is moving to the left, with growing support for universal healthcare and free college education - issues that were at the heart of Senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. That will shape the coming mid-term congressional primaries, and prospective 2020 Democratic presidential candidates will certainly take note.

Mr Abbas told the prince that ""the Palestinian side is committed to the peace process with the Israelis"". Prince William said: ""I'm very glad that our two countries work so closely together and have had success stories with education and relief work in the past. So, long may that continue. My sentiment's the same as yours in hoping there's a lasting peace for the region.""

'Apocalyptic' moors fire continues to rage,"This video can not be played Drones capture vast Saddleworth Moor blaze A huge moorland fire is continuing to spread because the land is ""as dry as a tinder box"" and winds are fanning the flames. The blaze covers 3.7miles (6km) of Saddleworth Moor and has been raging since Sunday night. More than 50 homes were evacuated in Carrbrook, near Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, and 150 people affected. One resident described seeing ""ash falling like rain"" and another said it ""looked like the apocalypse"". Dave Keelan, director of emergency response at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said 70 of its firefighters were tackling the blaze. He confirmed talks were ongoing to see if the Army could offer extra teams, four-wheel drive vehicles and air support. Residents described hearing explosions as the fire continued to rage Brenda Warrington, leader of Tameside Council, said firefighters were hoping for a ""really good downpour"" and rain was ""the only thing"" that would quickly deal with the blaze. ""We do need mother nature to help us quite frankly,"" she said. ""It's as dry as a tinder box up there. A lot of winds are fanning the fire."" Saddleworth Moor fire in pictures Army called in to tackle moorlands fire How do you tackle a moorland blaze? Mr Keelan said there were four different areas of fire embedded within peat, which is ""extremely difficult"" for crews to extinguish. ""They are working extremely hard, as they have been for the past couple of days, in really arduous conditions in heat and smoke,"" he said. Members of the public are assisted with face masks being distributed by the council Matt Lomas, 76, who was evacuated with his wife, daughter and eight-month-old granddaughter Isla, said: ""We could see flames 50ft high like a raging ball of fire all on the hill side. ""It was really scary, we were really worried the smoke would hurt Isla so we had to get out."" Angela Brown, 59, said she saw ""ash falling like rain"" from the raging fire. ""It was terrifying. It was getting closer and closer. Every so often there was a crackle and flames would shoot in the air."" Firefighters are tackling the blaze and hoping rain will assist them Pete Woodward, 43, said: ""It looked like the apocalypse. There was a towering inferno of flames."" He said he ""just grabbed a toothbrush and underpants"" and got out with his partner and two young daughters. ""The flames were 500 metres long, it was a raging wildfire. You could hear the odd explosion but thankfully the house survived."" People living in Carrbrook moved animals amid the dense smoke The fire began on Sunday night, reignited on Monday during the hot weather and then spread throughout Tuesday, fanned by evening winds. Police said the homes in Carr Rise, Carr Lane and Calico Crescent were evacuated on Tuesday evening due to the proximity of the flames. The majority of people had returned by Wednesday afternoon. Satellite images give a sense of how far the smoke is spreading Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said a ""request to the military for extra support"" is being prepared ""so there is a back-up plan"" to support firefighters. ""I think everybody feels a great deal of gratitude towards them [firefighters] but it's hit the point where reinforcements are needed and that's what we're arranging,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.

Weather hampers Glenshane firefight Jonathan Reynolds, MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, added: ""We haven't had anything of this scale in living memory, never had to evacuate people or close schools."" This video can not be played Saddleworth Moor resident: ""You could hardly breathe and your eyes were burning"" At the scene: Stewart Whittingham, BBC News Online Thick smoke is swirling around the village of Carrbrook, making people cough and cover their mouths. Ash covers a welcome mat at one house, and evacuated neighbours hug each other in the street. Some have tears in their eyes while others shake their heads as the look at the charred hillside. One or two cuddle their precious pet cats and dogs. Thick smoke can still be seen on the hilltops from the fires burning on the moors beyond. Snuggled up to his mother, seven-year-old Oscar McFie sums up the mood: ""It was scary, but we're safe."" Firefighters recommenced ""offensive firefighting"" on Wednesday morning The fire service earlier confirmed the blaze was spreading and said crews had recommenced ""offensive firefighting"". Assistant Chief Fire Officer Leon Parkes said crews planned to ""put a heavy attack"" on the fire, which has been declared a ""major incident"". Heatwave set to last until the weekend In pictures: Heatwave hits the UK Staying safe and cool in UK heatwave conditions Smoke and flames can still be seen for miles but Mr Parkes said crews had ""quelled the risk"" to homes at risk from the flames. He said it had not been established what might have caused the fire. Greater Manchester Police's Saddleworth division said about 2,000 acres of moorland had been destroyed in the fire. Some 65,000 gallons of water were dropped on the blaze by a helicopter on Tuesday to fight the fire which was ""unprecedented in recent times"", it added. Firefighter Ricky Case, who has been out on the hills, said: ""It's just the sheer vastness of it. It's one of the biggest ones I've been on in a long time."" Matt Lomas was evacuated with his eight-month-old granddaughter Isla Farmer Chris Keytes, 58, and his wife Jane, 50, refused to leave despite the fire being just 30ft from his farm and police asking them to go. ""I was concerned [but] we're set up with masks and we put a towel under the door,"" Mr Keytes said. ""We've had fires before but this one was pretty close."" Firefighters continued to battle the fire near Stalybridge at daybreak on Wednesday Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised firefighters ahead of Prime Minster's Questions earlier. Mrs May told MPs the government is keeping the situation ""under constant review"". She offered her sympathy to the firefighters and residents and added that ""operational policy arrangements"" were in place ""to provide support if required"". Mr Corbyn said: ""I'm sure all our thoughts are with the firefighters and the communities and families and the member for Stalybridge and Hyde is there today to support them."" Huge amounts of smoke has drifted westwards, with large parts of Greater Manchester experiencing poor visibility. BBC Weather's Simon King said there was a ""brisk easterly wind"" forecast for Wednesday with ""little to no rain in the forecast for at least a week"". The fire service said it plans ""a heavy attack"" on the fire The fire service said smoke levels in the air were not ""toxic"" but could be an ""irritant"", and advised people to close windows. Public Health England also advised people to wash their faces with soap and water and keep hydrated. Four schools in the Tameside area have been closed, the council said. The Wildlife Trust said the fire would also have ""devastating consequences for some animals and birds"". Director of conservation Tim Mitcham said: ""Only the most mobile of animals escape and of course we are in peak breeding period for many. ""The habitat will recover but it will take time.""

Army called in to tackle moorlands fire,"This video can not be played Timelapse footage shows the spread of the fire near Saddleworth Moor The military has been called in to help battle a huge moorlands fire which has been raging for three days. The blaze covers 3.7miles (6km) of moorland above Stalybridge and prompted the evacuation of up to 100 homes. Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) confirmed it had asked for military assistance. One resident described seeing ""ash falling like rain"" and another said it ""looked like the apocalypse"". Moorland fire in pictures How do you tackle a moorland blaze? 'Apocalyptic' moors fire continues to rage Four schools have closed and a GP said he had seen patients with nosebleeds, coughs and eye problems caused by the smoke. Firefighters are having to haul pumps and hoses for up to two miles in blistering heat to reach parts of the fire which has devastated swathes of land near Saddleworth Moor. Prime Minister Theresa May said the government is keeping the situation ""under constant review"". Smoke from the fire could be seen from space, as captured by the University of Dundee from a NASA satellite Greater Manchester's assistant chief fire officer Dave Keelan said a ""request"" had gone in for military assistance. ""That's for help to move high-volume pumps and to transport personnel to remote locations,"" he said. Pressed on the arrangements, he said the military was likely to use Chinook helicopters to move two water pumps. A Ministry of Defence spokeswoman confirmed the fire service had approached them ""as a priority"" and the MoD was ""looking into what might be done."" Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham started a question time event in Stretford saying that if the Home Office agreed, military resources should be available by Thursday morning.

Experts warned high levels of pollutants generated from the blaze could have a significant effect on people's health. Emergency services have been giving out face masks to their own staff, residents and members of the media. GP Richard Bircher said patients had been attending his surgery with smoke-related problems Stalybridge GP Richard Bircher said he had seen patients with nosebleeds, coughs and sore eyes caused by the smoke. Hugh Coe, professor of atmospheric composition at the University of Manchester, said plume peak concentrations were ""very high"" and air quality close to the fire was ""very poor"". He said pollution plumes had been detected in the centre of Manchester. Mr Keelan said 100 firefighters from Greater Manchester were tackling seven ongoing blazes on the moorland, with support from Cheshire and Derbyshire. The fire began on Sunday night, reignited on Monday during the hot weather and then spread throughout Tuesday, fanned by evening winds. About 150 people were forced to leave their homes on Tuesday, with many staying with family and friends. The majority had returned by Wednesday afternoon. This video can not be played Drones capture the vast moorland blaze Jonathan Reynolds, MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, said specialist equipment was being brought by Public Health England to monitor the air quality. ""Residents feel reassured by the actions of the fire service but there is a concern around the air quality and that's something we will monitor,"" he said. Mr Reynolds said firefighters were being particularly challenged by ""the distance they have to walk and the equipment they are wearing"". ""The country needs to give them every bit of support we can,"" he added. The fire on Tuesday night was accompanied by a dramatic full moon Mr Keelan said firefighters had carried pumps and hoses up to two miles to tackle remote pockets of fire. ""Firefighters have to physically carry all of that equipment in this heat, and the heat of the fire gear... and that's before they've even started tackling any sort of fire,"" he said. ""So it's been extremely difficult and they've just got on with it and done a fantastic job, I'm very proud of them."" GMFRS said it was receiving a high volume of calls about smoke across the region and asked for people to only phone in an emergency. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Keelan added: ""There's still a lot of smoke from the fire but air quality levels are being monitored regularly. Air quality is currently at a safe level and therefore residents have been let back into their homes. ""We don't know the cause at this stage and it would be very difficult to ascertain due to the extent of the damage, but we will be looking into that once we have tackled the fire."" Firefighters continued to battle the fire at daybreak on Wednesday Ian Saxon, director of operations and neighbourhoods at Tameside Metropolitan Borough Council, said a maximum of 100 homes had been evacuated at the height of the fire. ""As we're standing here there are people returning and there are people who are deciding they want to go elsewhere,"" he said. ""We will support them wherever they choose to go."" Kelly McFie said it was a ""massive relief"" to come home Personal trainer Kelly McFie, 35, was told to evacuate at 20:00 BST on Tuesday with her seven-year-old son Oscar. ""It looked like a towering inferno when I looked out of the back garden,"" she said. ""There were huge flames which would occasionally shoot up and you could hear the tree bark crackle."" She said she was ""glad to get out"" of her home. ""I grabbed our passports and Oscar's birthday certificate and just went,"" she said. ""We've got two cats, Buzz and Sally, and a dog called Bobby. ""Thankfully I managed to grab them although they weren't too happy to be moved."" Grandmother Pauline Lomas, 66, who was evacuated but came home on Wednesday morning to Carrbrook, welcomed the military intervention. She said: ""I'm shocked that they've been deployed as the smoke had subsided now. ""But we can't see how bad it is up on the moors now. ""It's fantastic how much everyone is rallying round to look after us and it shows how seriously they are taking if the Army is getting involved."" Drones capture extent of vast moors fire.

Patients 'choked on hospital soft food'Two patients with swallowing problems reportedly died in England after being given the wrong food.,"Patients with swallowing difficulties were reportedly given hash browns to eat Two patients are reported to have died and five more came to ""significant harm"" after people with swallowing difficulties were given inappropriate food, according to NHS Improvement. The regulator received reports of hash browns, mince and sponge cake being fed to patients in England who were supposed to be on liquidised food. Hundreds of choking or coughing incidents also occurred from 2015-17. Experts are now calling for an end to the term ""soft diet"". NHS Improvement, the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and the British Dietetic Association say the term can cause confusion among staff, patients and carers. Dr Kathy McLean, executive medical director at NHS Improvement, said: ""Vulnerable patients have died or been harmed because there is confusion in the way people describe what type of food is suitable for those with swallowing or chewing difficulties. ""We are calling on everyone providing NHS-funded care to start using precise terminology to help avoid further harm. ""This will help save lives and make the NHS safer,"" she said. Patients who have swallowing difficulties, known as dysphagia, or difficulty chewing need food which is soft, minced, pureed or liquidised. Some people with the condition can't swallow at all and some have problems swallowing certain foods or liquids. It can affect people of all ages and is often caused by another health condition such as stroke, head injury, multiple sclerosis or dementia. NHS Improvement now wants all NHS staff to use clearly categorised food textures - as published by theInternational Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative,external- to make sure patients are fed safely and correctly according to their individual needs.

Prince William meets Palestinian leader Abbas,"The prince met residents of the Jalazone Refugee Camp near Ramallah Prince William has expressed hope for ""lasting peace"" between Israelis and Palestinians during a visit to the occupied West Bank. The Duke of Cambridge spoke before holding talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah. The prince is the first royal family member to make an official visit to the Palestinian Territories. In Israel on Tuesday, President Reuven Rivlin urged him to take a ""message of peace"" to Mr Abbas. Mr Abbas told the prince that ""the Palestinian side is committed to the peace process with the Israelis"". Prince William said: ""I'm very glad that our two countries work so closely together and have had success stories with education and relief work in the past. So, long may that continue. My sentiment's the same as yours in hoping there's a lasting peace for the region."" In pictures: Prince William's Middle East tour Prince William meets Eurovision winner The Duke of Cambridge, who started his Middle East tour in Jordan on Sunday, also visited a refugee camp and toured a market in Ramallah.

He met young footballers in Ramallah Prince William watched Palestinian dancers at a cultural event In his comments to Prince William, Mr Abbas also reiterated his commitment to a two-state solution and said his visit would ""deepen and strengthen"" the ties between the UK and the Palestinian people. Mr Rivlin had asked Prince William to tell Mr Abbas: ""It is about time that we have to find together the way to... build confidence as a first step to bring to understanding that we have to bring to an end the tragedy between us."" Prince William held talks with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas Responding to the request, Britain's ambassador to Israel David Quarrey said Prince William is ""very interested in hearing from each side what they think they can do, what they think can be done more generally to move us out of the current situation and move us towards peace. ""We've obviously got a very strong interest in seeing progress from where we are now but I don't think the duke will be taking a particular political message.""

Bank warning for EU over Brexit progress,"The Brexit findings come in the Bank's financial stability report The Bank of England says the UK has made positive ""progress"" on handling financial services risks around the UK's departure from the European Union. But it also says there has been a lack of similar action from the EU. It says that means ""material risks remain"" to trillions of pounds worth of financial contracts - which support the business activities that flow between the UK and rest of Europe. The findings come in the bank's bi-annual Financial Stability Report. The report said the passing of the EU Withdrawal Bill and Treasury plans for a ""temporary permissions"" system - for continuing cross-border financial trade - had eased the ""risk of disruption"". ""Progress has been made in the UK towards mitigating risks of disruption to the availability of financial services to UK-end users,"" the report said. ""The EU (Withdrawal) Bill has been passed by Parliament. ""The UK government has committed to legislate, if necessary, to put in place temporary permissions and recognition regimes - this will allow banks [and] insurers to continue their activities in the UK for a time-limited period after the UK has left the EU, even if there is no implementation period, thus mitigating a number of risks of disruption to UK customers."" But it added: ""As yet the EU has not indicated a solution analogous to a temporary permissions regime. European Economic Area customers remain reliant on UK-based financial companies being able to overcome any future barriers to cross service provision. ""The Financial Policy Committee judges that material risks remain."" The Bank said that the UK's banks were sufficiently robust to weather a ""disorderly Brexit"". But despite the progress, its Brexit risk register still has amber warnings on progress towards ensuring there is a legal and regulatory plan in place once Britain leaves the EU. For the UK, there is a single red warning on the continuing validity of contracts used to insure businesses making currency trades, for example, involving institutions in Britain and the EU. There are believed to be Â£29 trillion worth of such contracts which could become ""unserviceable"" after March next year if action is not taken. The Bank says the EU is facing three ""red light"" issues. Two are on contracts and one on is on clearing - the ability to finalise deals and trades across borders between banks, businesses and fund managers. Both sides also face amber warnings on the ability of banks and asset managers to continue providing other services across borders, as well as on the lack of agreement on the cross-border flow of personal data between Britain and the EU.

Williams 25th seed for Wimbledon,"Serena Williams pulled out of the French Open in June because of injury Wimbledon 2018 Venue:All England ClubDates:2-15 JulyStarts:11:30 BST Coverage:Live across BBC TV, BBC Radio and the BBC Sport website with further coverage on BBC iPlayer, Red Button, Connected TVs and mobile app. Seven-time Wimbledon champion Serena Williams is the 25th seed for this year's tournament, despite being outside the top 32 in the rankings. The 36-year-old American is continuing her return to action after giving birth to her first child in September. Williams, a 23-time Grand Slam singles winner, has played only three tournaments in the past 12 months and is ranked 183rd in the world. Slovakia's world number 32 Dominika Cibulkova has not been seeded. On Tuesday, Cibulkova said it would not be fair for Williams to be seeded ahead of her. ""I don't think it's the right thing to do,"" said the 29-year-old. ""I think it's just not fair. I have tried and I should be seeded. If they put her in front of me then I will lose my spot that I am supposed to have."" Williams seeding 'would not be fair' Andy Murray column: 'I'm surprised how well I've played' This video can not be played Serena Williams 'deserves to be seeded' Simona Halep is the top seed, with Roger Federer her counterpart in the men's draw. Federer is seeded a place higher than his world ranking, with world number one Rafael Nadal the second seed. With the exception of Williams, all of the women are seeded in line with their WTA ranking. Williams is seeded one place lower than Maria Sharapova, who she was due to meet in the fourth round of the French Open before pulling out because of injury. Her sister Venus is the ninth seed. British number ones Johanna Konta and Kyle Edmund - the latter of whom is the world number 18 - are seeded 22nd in their respective draws. Because of different rules in the two draws, Andy Murray cannot be seeded as he sits outside the top 32 in the rankings. Britain's three-time Grand Slam champion is returning from a hip injury. This video can not be played Murray beats Wawrinka to win for the first time in a year The Wimbledon seedings for the men are determined by the ATP ranking list of the top 32 players, but can be rearranged based on an individual's grass-court record. Ranking points are counted from competition in the two years running up to the tournament. For the women's game, the seeding order follows the WTA ranking list, but the All England Club reserves the right to make a change if it ""is necessary to produce a balanced draw"". In 2017, no changes were made. BBC tennis correspondent Russell Fuller Williams will not have to face another seeded player before the third round, but at that stage should expect to run into one of the top eight in the world. So the protection a seeding offers her will be limited. Cibulkova's view that the decision is unfair is shared - both privately and publicly - by very many WTA players, so the All England Club's decision will not be universally popular. But the committee clearly feel Williams is a unique case: an extraordinary champion who has only been able to play three events in the past year after giving birth to her first child in September. As well as Nadal and Federer switching places at the top of the rankings, Marin Cilic moves up to number three and Novak Djokovic is up five to 12.

Fridges for obese bodies on the rise,"This video can not be played Oversized fridges in London mortuaries in high demand The number of oversized mortuary fridge spaces being installed in London's hospitals to accommodate obese bodies has risen by nearly a third. Since 2013, the figure has jumped from 126 to 165. Of the 23 hospital trusts asked, 22 responded to the BBC's Freedom of Information request. Public Health England estimates that treating obesity in the capital costs the NHS up to Â£1.1bn a year. NHS London said measures like sugar taxes were needed to handle the crisis. Stephen Brooks fears it could take him a year to get down to a normal weight Retired carpenter Stephen Brooks has obesity and said he feared ending up in an oversized fridge like his mother and cousin. The 71-year-old said he often eats to compensate for loneliness and felt it could take a year for him to get down to a normal weight, even with help. ""It's partially because I live alone. There are some days where I speak to no-one. ""A cousin of mine was 44st (279kg). When he died, they had to take out the window frame, and there was a crane. ""My aunt had to buy a special coffin from the United States. And when it was being lowered, at his funeral it collapsed."" Paul Evans of the British Obesity Society said the UK was ""already the fat man of Europe"" St George's Trust in Wandsworth added the most extra-large spaces, increasing the number from five to 15. King's College Hospital Trust refused to comment on whether the additional nine spaces it had installed in its mortuary were added to prevent cases of overweight bodies getting stuck. In 2014, the body of a patient got stuck in one of its freezers. Barts Health Trust, which has added three new spaces, said bodies were getting bigger and more large fridges were set to be installed. Funeral director Ashley McDonald recently had to install an extra-wide fridge to make sure his firm could keep up with a heavier population. ""We've bought fridges with a larger than standard door to help us to be sustainable for the future as people are getting larger."" He said the unit cost Â£3,500. Funeral director Ashley McDonald said the obese fridge would let him look after the deceased with respect Paul Evans, vice chairman of the British Obesity Society, said: ""We are already the fat man of Europe. As a nation we are spending Â£6bn a year on obesity, and one in 11 deaths are linked to the disease."" He said the government needed to do more to persuade people to make healthier choices. NHS London said: ""Being overweight or obese is associated with greater risks of a number of serious illnesses. Wherever possible, prevention is preferable to cure. ""Our own sugar restrictions, the new sugar tax and the NHS Type 2 diabetes prevention programme are all part of what needs to be a concerted effort to address obesity.""

US millennial usurps top-ranking Democrat,"This video can not be played Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez celebrates her win with supporters A millennial candidate has shaken up the US Democratic Party by defeating the incumbent congressman for his seat. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 28, defeated political veteran Joe Crowley, 56, on Tuesday night in their party's congressional primary in New York City. Mr Crowley, a 10-term Democrat, had been tipped as a future party leader or even Speaker of the House. Ms Ocasio-Cortez, a former Bernie Sanders volunteer from a Puerto Rican family, won with 57.5% of the vote. Mr Crowley had not faced a challenger from his own party in 14 years in the mostly ethnic minority district, which covers parts of the Bronx and Queens. Ms Ocasio-Cortez will now face Republican candidate Anthony Pappas in the November mid-terms. If she wins, she will become the youngest ever woman elected to Congress. Why US mid-term elections matter First black female nominee for US governor Can Democrats torpedo Trump in 2018? She led a progressive campaign, supporting universal healthcare, tuition-free college and criminal justice reform. Following Ms Ocasio-Cortez's win, Merriam-Webster tweeted that socialism emerged as their top search item. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In fact she found little support from established Democrats. Did 'socialism' save this US town? Senator Kirsten Gillibrand, a top Democrat who has a political action committee designed to support women candidates, endorsed her opponent Mr Crowley. Ms Ocasio-Cortez posted on Twitter after Ms Gillibrand's endorsement that the New York senator ""didn't even bother to talk to nor consider me before endorsing"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News The progressive left just fired a warning shot across the bow of the Democratic Party establishment. Congressman Joe Crowley was seen as a potential future speaker of the House of Representatives. Now he is taking a forced exit from politics, paying tribute to the young activist who defeated him with a rendition of Bruce Springsteen's Born to Run after conceding defeat. Up until now, it seemed like Democratic incumbents had been insulated from the anger and energy that has coursed through the political left during the Trump presidency. New candidates - many younger, many women - were running for office, but they were mostly winning open primary contests or losing to better-funded, better-known Democratic incumbents. That may have just changed. The rage among the liberal base - stoked by heart-rending accounts of children separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border - has led to new bursts of activism, confrontation and, perhaps, an anti-establishment fervour that could endanger seemingly safe Democratic politicians. The party is moving to the left, with growing support for universal healthcare and free college education - issues that were at the heart of Senator Bernie Sanders' 2016 presidential campaign. That will shape the coming mid-term congressional primaries, and prospective 2020 Democratic presidential candidates will certainly take note.

Netta shot to fame after being selected to represent Israel at this year's Eurovision Song Contest. She hadn't expected to make it to the competition, telling one reporter: ""I was a struggling musician, hoping for a couple of gigs."" After being chosen, the singer resolved to make a difference. ""When I won my election, I realised I can do something really nice,"" she said. ""If I'd seen someone like me on primetime when I was a kid, I'd have had an easier childhood. ""So I said, 'OK, I'll do something different. I'm going to wear a short skirt and I'll do a really fun pop song with a really strong message.'"" Her positive message - paired with some quirky, chicken-based dance moves - charmed fans across the world. She ended up winning Eurovision with 529 points, beating Cyprus into second place. This video can not be played Toy has racked up millions of views on YouTube Since then she has been inundated with messages of thanks and support.

""There is even a lesson in the curriculum about me!"" The star is currently touring Europe to celebrate her song contest victory while working on a follow-up single. ""I'm working really, really hard on my new music,"" she said. ""I think I'm going to release something in the next couple of months."" Asked whether the new single would reinforce her message of empowerment, she said: ""I don't know. I don't like to limit myself. ""I don't need a strong message in a song in order to have a strong message in my performance. ""So my next song can be about apples and bananas and it would still be powerful and strong.""

Terminally-ill man loses court challenge,"Noel Conway was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014 A terminally-ill man who wants to be helped to die has lost his legal challenge at the Court of Appeal. Noel Conway, 68, who has motor neurone disease, has fought a legal battle for the right to a ""peaceful and dignified"" death. The retired lecturer challenged an earlier High Court rejection of his case at a hearing in May. Mr Conway, from Shrewsbury, said he now intends to take his fight to the Supreme Court. His case was rejected on Wednesday by three senior judges - Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton, Sir Brian Leveson and Lady Justice King. Midlands Live: Girl, seven, dies after brain tumour fight; Car crashes through wall of care home Mr Conway, who said he feels ""entombed"" by his illness, is dependent on a ventilator for up to 23 hours a day and only has movement in his right hand, head and neck. He wanted help to die when he has less than six months left to live, still has the mental capacity to decide, and has made a ""voluntary, clear, settled and informed"" decision. Mr Conway proposed he could only receive assistance to die if a High Court judge determined he met all three of those criteria. Speaking after the ruling he said: ""I will keep fighting for myself and all terminally-ill people who want the right to die peacefully, with dignity and on our own terms."" He said his current options are to ""effectively suffocate"" by removing his ventilator, or spend thousands travelling to Switzerland to end his life and have his family risk prosecution. Mr Conway said it was ""barbaric"" for him to be forced to choose between the ""unacceptable options"" left open to him for his death. Sir Terence said the court concluded it was not as well-placed as Parliament to determine the ""necessity and proportionality of a blanket ban"". He also said the High Court had seen evidence Mr Conway's proposed scheme was ""inadequate to protect the weak and vulnerable"". It also failed to give enough weight to the ""sanctity of life and to the scheme's potential to undermine trust and confidence as between doctors and patients"", he added. The appeal was opposed by the Secretary of State for Justice, David Gauke, with Care Not Killing and Not Dead Yet UK also making submissions. Dr Peter Saunders, campaign director of Care Not Killing, said the Court of Appeal's decision was ""sensible"". He added: ""The safest law is the one we already have - a complete ban on assisted suicide and euthanasia."" Mr Conway, who is supported by the campaign group Dignity in Dying, was too unwell to travel to London for the hearing.

New women's community prisons plan axed,"This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke defends cuts to five women's community prisons The government has abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation. Justice Secretary David Gauke said short custodial sentences had failed to halt the ""cycle of offending"". Campaigners and police bodies have warned the provision for women must be ""properly funded"". Meanwhile, a justice minister has said sentences under a year should be axed for all but the most serious crimes. Rory Stewart told the Commons Justice Select Committee that community penalties were more effective and he wanted to ""significantly reduce, if not eliminate"" terms of under 12 months. Fresh doubts over women's prisons plans Women criminals 'need help not prison' Why are community sentences falling out of favour? Mr Gauke cited figures that 70.7% of women and 62.9% of men released from custody between April and June 2016 after a sentence of less than a year went on to re-offend within 12 months. He said there was ""persuasive evidence"" that the new approach would help reduce re-offending rates. Mothers at the trial residential centres might be able to have their children with them, he added. Analysis: By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The female offender strategy represents a U-turn from the approach proposed by Liz Truss, when she was justice secretary, that there should be five new community prisons. Partly this is down to money; it costs millions more to build new jails than it does community centres, and at a time when the Ministry of Justice is having to find savings that will have been a key consideration. But the policy also reflects a determination at the department to promote alternatives to locking people up in order to relieve pressure on prisons and reduce reoffending. Ministers say research shows that offenders on community sentences are less likely to commit further crimes than those who've served short jail terms. But the research needs further, careful analysis - because it does not compare like with like: the reoffending figures cover the period an offender spends on a community sentence but do not include the time a prisoner spends in jail. The government has pledged to spend Â£5m over two years on ""community provision"" for women. The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners welcomed the change in strategy. But Dame Vera Baird QC, representing the the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, warned the scheme would only work if properly funded and questioned the MoJ's decision to hand Â£50m - originally earmarked for the prisons - back to the Treasury. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said ministers deserved ""real praise"" for the change in approach but - like the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners - warned it was ""essential"" that programme was ""properly funded"". Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said ""thousands"" of women would benefit from the change. He described the strategy as a ""welcome recognition of the futility of short prison sentences"" for women whose offending is often driven by ""unmet mental health needs"". Women serving sentences of less than a year are more likely to re-offend than men with comparable sentences - although they are slightly less likely to re-offend overall. But it's not a straightforward comparison. Women represent just 4.6% of the total prison population of 82,989. And due to the nature of the crimes they commit, which are often less violent, they are much more likely than men to serve short sentences. Last year, 80% of sentences handed to women were a year or less and 25% a month or less, compared with men for whom 66% were sentenced to less than a year and 14% to less than a month. AMinistry of Justice report last year,externalfound that these short-term sentences were ""consistently associated with higher rates of proven re-offending"" than other forms of sentencing - that applies to all prisoners, male and female. Part of this is because these very small sentences often do nothing to rehabilitate the problems which might have led to imprisonment in the first place. Studies have found that, in general, women prisoners are more vulnerable which can add to the cycle of re-offending. They are twice as likely to have mental health needs, more likely to have drug problems and to have experienced domestic abuse. And they are less likely to have a job or home to go back to on release. During Tuesday's appearance at the Commons Justice Select Committee, Mr Stewart said although he wanted to scrap short prison terms, there would be cases - such as violent or sexual crimes - where prison terms were justified. The Penrith and The Border MP said: ""My number one priority is to protect the public and I believe that the best way of protecting the public is to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, the under 12-month prison population because people on community sentences are less likely to reoffend than people who are put in prison. ""I am not going to be reducing the prison population just to save money. ""If somebody ought to be in prison, they ought to be in prison, and then my job is to go to the Treasury and get the money to pay for that prison place."" Government not 'cost-cutting' on prisons.

Patients 'choked on hospital soft food',"Patients with swallowing difficulties were reportedly given hash browns to eat Two patients are reported to have died and five more came to ""significant harm"" after people with swallowing difficulties were given inappropriate food, according to NHS Improvement. The regulator received reports of hash browns, mince and sponge cake being fed to patients in England who were supposed to be on liquidised food. Hundreds of choking or coughing incidents also occurred from 2015-17. Experts are now calling for an end to the term ""soft diet"". NHS Improvement, the Royal College of Speech and Language Therapists and the British Dietetic Association say the term can cause confusion among staff, patients and carers. Dr Kathy McLean, executive medical director at NHS Improvement, said: ""Vulnerable patients have died or been harmed because there is confusion in the way people describe what type of food is suitable for those with swallowing or chewing difficulties. ""We are calling on everyone providing NHS-funded care to start using precise terminology to help avoid further harm. ""This will help save lives and make the NHS safer,"" she said. Patients who have swallowing difficulties, known as dysphagia, or difficulty chewing need food which is soft, minced, pureed or liquidised. Some people with the condition can't swallow at all and some have problems swallowing certain foods or liquids. It can affect people of all ages and is often caused by another health condition such as stroke, head injury, multiple sclerosis or dementia. NHS Improvement now wants all NHS staff to use clearly categorised food textures - as published by theInternational Dysphagia Diet Standardisation Initiative,external- to make sure patients are fed safely and correctly according to their individual needs.

"Truss attacks 'macho' cabinet colleaguesLiz Truss warns ministers it is not ""macho"" to demand more cash - and takes a swipe at Michael Gove.","This video can not be played 'Wood burning Gove': Truss fumes at cabinet colleague A Treasury minister has attacked cabinet colleagues who have demanded extra money for their departments in an outspoken speech. Liz Truss said it was ""not macho"" to push for bigger budgets, singling out the boost for the NHS as a ""one-off"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid have reportedly been pushing for extra cash. Ms Truss also took a swipe at Michael Gove over the environment secretary's planned crackdown on wood burners. ""Too often we're hearing about not drinking too much, eating too many doughnuts, drinking from disposable cups through plastic straws, or enjoying the warm glow of our wood-burning Goves... I mean stoves,"" she said in a speech at the London School of Economics. ""I can see their point: there's enough hot air and smoke at the environment department already."" Johnson challenged over 'Brexit expletive' Javid tells police: 'I'm listening' Air pollution plans to tackle wood burners Former minister Ed Vaizey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ms Truss had achieved her goal of getting noticed with her ""full frontal assault"" on Mr Gove. Mr Vaizey also criticised Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson for undermining Prime Minister Theresa May, warning that ""having climbed up the ladder"" on Brexit, the government kept getting pushed ""back down the snake"". He said Mr Johnson's decision to pursue an ""entirely separate"" Brexit policy to the prime minister and to fly to Afghanistan to miss a vote on Heathrow expansion had encouraged other ministers to think ""if it's alright for Boris it's alright for me"". Quizzed about Ms Truss's comments in a Q&A with members of the Scottish Parliament, Mr Gove said: ""You should judge us as a government by our actions."" Over the past year the cabinet had ""worked together and we've sought to work collaboratively"", he added. Brexit has been driving rival Tory factions crazy for many, many months. It's extremely difficult to corral them in a minority government. Different ministers sounding off about the misperceptions of their opposing gangs don't even always lead hacks to raise a pencil. But that instability has fuelled an atmosphere where party discipline seems on the point of breaking down, even though with the whips in overdrive, government is achieving its most important objective of getting its business through Parliament. Yet the Cabinet seems sometimes to be creating the appearance of chaos where there need not be any. Read Laura's full blog The latest bout of infighting at the top of government started at the weekend, when Defence Secretary Gavin Williamsonreportedly said,externalthat he could ""break"" the prime minister if his demands for extra cash for his department were not met. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has also been demanding more money for police budgets, after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt unveiled a Â£20bn boost in funding for the NHS. Ms Truss, who his second in command to Chancellor Philip Hammond, hit backin article for The Daily Telegraph,external, telling her cabinet colleagues ""it's not macho to demand more money"". ""It's much tougher - and fairer to people - to demand better value for money."" The Chief Secretary to the Treasury went on to accuse them of ""not been clear with the public about the tax implications of their proposed higher spending"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson reportedly wants more money for the military but Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss has warned against a tax and spend policy Speaking at the London School of Economics, she said the Â£20bn a year budget boost for the NHS in England up to 2023 announced by the prime minister last week would not be replicated elsewhere. ""My point to my colleagues is that any additional spending will necessarily - most likely - lead to additional taxation and we should be honest when we have that discussion,"" she said. ""We need to keep tax as low as possible."" Ms Truss's comments echo those of former minister George Freeman, who said that the Conservatives risked losing the next election if they made a series of unfunded spending commitments. ""We cannot have this process done by cabinet ministers going to the press and briefing against the prime minister, and putting their bids in early,"" he said. The government has yet to spell out where the extra money for the NHS will come from although Mrs May has indicated that the public will have to make a contribution and the overall ""tax burden"" will rise. Mr Hammond will set out the total public spending framework for the years beyond 2020 in this autumn's budget, before deciding department-by-department allocations next year.

Mother suing Thomas Cook over 'abduction',"Lois and Rose were staying at the Royal Wings Hotel in Antalya A mother, who says her five-year-old child was abducted from a holiday kids club in Turkey, is suing travel firm Thomas Cook over the incident. Janet Alexander, 46, from Inverness, said her daughter Rose was taken by a stranger from the club at the Royal Wings Hotel in Antalya. Ms Alexander said Rose was later found with a woman, walking near a main road within the hotel's grounds. Thomas Cook said it was investigating the incident. Ms Alexander said she was on a family break at Easter with Rose and her sister Lois when the incident happened. She said that she left Rose at the resort's supervised play area so that she could take Lois, aged nine, to a scuba diving lesson. However, when they returned an hour later, they discovered that Rose was gone. She said: ""I was completely distraught, completely. In fact, there was chaos as everybody realised she was missing and started running around and people from around the pool started looking for her. ""I was really quite frozen with fear."" Lois was among those who joined the search. She said: ""We couldn't find her and eventually we found her though. She was so happy she started crying."" Janet said she was ""frozen"" when she discovered Rose was missing The girls were travelling to Turkey for a family holiday at Easter time Rose was found unharmed 20 minutes later in the company of the mystery woman. The pair were led back to the hotel by a guest, but the woman was never arrested and later left the scene. Janet Alexander said: ""Had Rose even followed her or whatever, you would take a child back, and in my heart I know that there was some sort of unpleasant motive behind this. ""It was hundreds and hundreds of metres away that she had taken her."" Ms Alexander accused Thomas Cook of failing to respond to repeated calls for help during and after the incident. She added: ""I think it's terrible that they would leave a family abandoned in a foreign country and not make sure, not only that we were ok, but that the current users of the facilities are ok as well, because obviously I felt the other children that were using the club were then at risk."" Thomas Cook said: ""We were very concerned to hear of this incident and we understand how distressing it must have been. ""We are investigating thoroughly with the hotel to understand what happened and we will work with the hotel to make any required changes so that this can't happen again."" The company said its customer welfare team had contacted Ms Alexander to offer support. The Royal Wings Hotel has denied that an abduction took place and maintained that the hotel's children's club was safe and secure.

"Tax over-40s for old age care, say MPs","A new tax for the over-40s in England should be introduced to help pay for elderly care for all, MPs say. Retired people should also be made to pay it if they have lucrative pensions or investments,two influential House of Commons' committees said.,external The contribution - dubbed a social care premium by MPs - could then be used to ensure everyone who needs support in their old age gets it. It comes as ministers are considering how to reform social care. Currently only the poorest get help towards the cost of care, whether it is provided in people's homes or in a care home. Other people have to pay for it themselves, with one in 10 facing lifetime costs of more than Â£100,000. However, increasingly people are relying on family and friends or go without care, which includes everything from help with washing and dressing to support in taking medications. Polling carried out by Ipsos Mori as part of the work done by the four leading health think-tanks for the BBC to mark the 70th birthday of the NHS showed only 15% of people thought the current system was fair. Although appetite for a new tax was mixed and only one in four people were in favour of using wealth tied up in people's houses. The MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government and Health and Social Care committees said changes were long overdue. A combination of the ageing population and a squeeze on council budgets has left the system at breaking point. The cross-party groups believe only a radical solution can tackle the problem. Their report said employers should also contribute to the social care premium and argues it could be topped up by an extra levy on inheritance tax on the wealthiest estates. The MPs believe it could lead to everyone getting care paid for - although those in care homes would still have to contribute towards their accommodation costs. Who gets social care and who pays for it? 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care How can social care be funded? The committees do not say how much should be levied, acknowledging there would need to be a full review on how much money the system needs. But they said a degree of ""intergenerational fairness"" was needed, given the under-40s as a whole were more likely to be struggling with housing, employment and the cost of living than older generations. They also suggested the money raised could be used to support the care system for younger adults with disabilities, which forms part of the wider social care system. Currently the care provided by councils costs Â£20bn a year - less than a fifth of the NHS budget. Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, said: ""We can no longer delay finding a fair and sustainable settlement for social care. ""Too many people are being left without the care and support they need and it is time for a decision to be made about how the costs are shared."" The government has said it will be publishing a green paper on social care soon - this is expected in the autumn. A funding rise has recently been agreed for the NHS,which will see its budget increase by Â£20bn a year by 2023. Ministers have said tax rises will be required to fund this, but the MPs said the levy they are proposing could also contribute towards that. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, gave the proposals her backing, saying a ""bold new vision"" was needed. She said while the idea of paying more was a ""bitter pill, it just might be one worth swallowing - but only for a system that we can all rely on.""

Terminally-ill man loses court challengeNoel Conway has motor neurone disease and has been trying to change the law on assisted dying.Shropshire,"Noel Conway was diagnosed with motor neurone disease in 2014 A terminally-ill man who wants to be helped to die has lost his legal challenge at the Court of Appeal. Noel Conway, 68, who has motor neurone disease, has fought a legal battle for the right to a ""peaceful and dignified"" death. The retired lecturer challenged an earlier High Court rejection of his case at a hearing in May. Mr Conway, from Shrewsbury, said he now intends to take his fight to the Supreme Court. His case was rejected on Wednesday by three senior judges - Master of the Rolls Sir Terence Etherton, Sir Brian Leveson and Lady Justice King. Midlands Live: Girl, seven, dies after brain tumour fight; Car crashes through wall of care home Mr Conway, who said he feels ""entombed"" by his illness, is dependent on a ventilator for up to 23 hours a day and only has movement in his right hand, head and neck. He wanted help to die when he has less than six months left to live, still has the mental capacity to decide, and has made a ""voluntary, clear, settled and informed"" decision. Mr Conway proposed he could only receive assistance to die if a High Court judge determined he met all three of those criteria. Speaking after the ruling he said: ""I will keep fighting for myself and all terminally-ill people who want the right to die peacefully, with dignity and on our own terms."" He said his current options are to ""effectively suffocate"" by removing his ventilator, or spend thousands travelling to Switzerland to end his life and have his family risk prosecution. Mr Conway said it was ""barbaric"" for him to be forced to choose between the ""unacceptable options"" left open to him for his death. Sir Terence said the court concluded it was not as well-placed as Parliament to determine the ""necessity and proportionality of a blanket ban"". He also said the High Court had seen evidence Mr Conway's proposed scheme was ""inadequate to protect the weak and vulnerable"". It also failed to give enough weight to the ""sanctity of life and to the scheme's potential to undermine trust and confidence as between doctors and patients"", he added. The appeal was opposed by the Secretary of State for Justice, David Gauke, with Care Not Killing and Not Dead Yet UK also making submissions. Dr Peter Saunders, campaign director of Care Not Killing, said the Court of Appeal's decision was ""sensible"". He added: ""The safest law is the one we already have - a complete ban on assisted suicide and euthanasia."" Mr Conway, who is supported by the campaign group Dignity in Dying, was too unwell to travel to London for the hearing. Group chief executive Sarah Wootton said other countries had found it was ""perfectly possible, and indeed necessary"" to introduce assisted dying legislation. Humanists UK chief executive Andrew Copson said he ""very much"" hoped there would be a further appeal to the Supreme Court.

"Mouldy, monster fatberg brings in crowdsThe exhibit could be preserved after attracting visitors to a London museum.Family & Education","The fatberg, which has begun to ""sweat"" and grow mould, could be preserved in the museum's collection A slice of fatberg put on show at the Museum of London could be preserved for future generations. The lump of congealed fat, oil and wet wipes has begun to ""sweat"" and change colour - and flies have hatched in it. But curator Vyki Sparkes says the fatberg caused a ""marked increase"" in visitors to the museum and they are now thinking of preserving it, when it finishes its public display this week. There has been an ""incredible reaction"" from visitors, she says. It has become one the museum's most popular exhibits, says the curator. The piece of fatberg was taken from a ""monster fatberg"", over 250m (820ft) long and weighing 130 tonnes, which had become something of asewer celebrity, when it was found under the streets of Whitechapel. Fatbergs are an accumulation of materials flushed into the sewers that form huge solid blocks - with the Whitechapel fatberg taking nine weeks to break up with drills. In the first such exhibition of its kind, the Museum of London put this slice of urban history on public view in February, as an example of the challenges of getting rid of waste in the capital. The fatberg when it went on show in February The display ends at the weekend, but Ms Sparkes says they have been taken aback by its appeal, with people making special trips to see the fatberg and boosting visitor numbers.

Truss attacks 'macho' cabinet colleagues,"This video can not be played 'Wood burning Gove': Truss fumes at cabinet colleague A Treasury minister has attacked cabinet colleagues who have demanded extra money for their departments in an outspoken speech. Liz Truss said it was ""not macho"" to push for bigger budgets, singling out the boost for the NHS as a ""one-off"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson and Home Secretary Sajid Javid have reportedly been pushing for extra cash. Ms Truss also took a swipe at Michael Gove over the environment secretary's planned crackdown on wood burners. ""Too often we're hearing about not drinking too much, eating too many doughnuts, drinking from disposable cups through plastic straws, or enjoying the warm glow of our wood-burning Goves... I mean stoves,"" she said in a speech at the London School of Economics. ""I can see their point: there's enough hot air and smoke at the environment department already."" Johnson challenged over 'Brexit expletive' Javid tells police: 'I'm listening' Air pollution plans to tackle wood burners Former minister Ed Vaizey told BBC Radio 4's Today programme Ms Truss had achieved her goal of getting noticed with her ""full frontal assault"" on Mr Gove. Mr Vaizey also criticised Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson for undermining Prime Minister Theresa May, warning that ""having climbed up the ladder"" on Brexit, the government kept getting pushed ""back down the snake"". He said Mr Johnson's decision to pursue an ""entirely separate"" Brexit policy to the prime minister and to fly to Afghanistan to miss a vote on Heathrow expansion had encouraged other ministers to think ""if it's alright for Boris it's alright for me"". Quizzed about Ms Truss's comments in a Q&A with members of the Scottish Parliament, Mr Gove said: ""You should judge us as a government by our actions."" Over the past year the cabinet had ""worked together and we've sought to work collaboratively"", he added. Brexit has been driving rival Tory factions crazy for many, many months. It's extremely difficult to corral them in a minority government. Different ministers sounding off about the misperceptions of their opposing gangs don't even always lead hacks to raise a pencil. But that instability has fuelled an atmosphere where party discipline seems on the point of breaking down, even though with the whips in overdrive, government is achieving its most important objective of getting its business through Parliament. Yet the Cabinet seems sometimes to be creating the appearance of chaos where there need not be any. Read Laura's full blog The latest bout of infighting at the top of government started at the weekend, when Defence Secretary Gavin Williamsonreportedly said,externalthat he could ""break"" the prime minister if his demands for extra cash for his department were not met. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has also been demanding more money for police budgets, after Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt unveiled a Â£20bn boost in funding for the NHS. Ms Truss, who his second in command to Chancellor Philip Hammond, hit backin article for The Daily Telegraph,external, telling her cabinet colleagues ""it's not macho to demand more money"". ""It's much tougher - and fairer to people - to demand better value for money."" The Chief Secretary to the Treasury went on to accuse them of ""not been clear with the public about the tax implications of their proposed higher spending"". Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson reportedly wants more money for the military but Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss has warned against a tax and spend policy Speaking at the London School of Economics, she said the Â£20bn a year budget boost for the NHS in England up to 2023 announced by the prime minister last week would not be replicated elsewhere. ""My point to my colleagues is that any additional spending will necessarily - most likely - lead to additional taxation and we should be honest when we have that discussion,"" she said. ""We need to keep tax as low as possible."" Ms Truss's comments echo those of former minister George Freeman, who said that the Conservatives risked losing the next election if they made a series of unfunded spending commitments. ""We cannot have this process done by cabinet ministers going to the press and briefing against the prime minister, and putting their bids in early,"" he said. The government has yet to spell out where the extra money for the NHS will come from although Mrs May has indicated that the public will have to make a contribution and the overall ""tax burden"" will rise. Mr Hammond will set out the total public spending framework for the years beyond 2020 in this autumn's budget, before deciding department-by-department allocations next year. Many Tory MPs want defence spending as a share of GDP to increase from its current level of just over 2% to at least 3% in the face of growing threats, including from Russia.

Gosport doctor 'did best for patients',"This video can not be played Former Gosport hospital doctor Jane Barton did her ""best for her patients"", her husband says. The doctor who oversaw the practice of prescribing powerful painkillers at Gosport War Memorial Hospital was working in a ""very inadequately resourced part of the health service"". More than 450 patients died after being given the drugs inappropriately,a report concluded last week. A statement read out on behalf of Dr Jane Barton said she was a ""doctor doing the best for her patients"". Relatives described the statement as ""worthless"" and a ""waste of time"". Dr Barton appeared outside her Gosport home where the statement was read by her husband, Tim Barton. New force to take on hospital deaths probe Gran 'was treated brutally' at hospital Who is Dr Jane Barton? He said: ""Jane would like to thank her family, friends, colleagues, former patients and the many others for their continued support and loyalty through this protracted inquiry. ""She has always maintained she was a hardworking, dedicated doctor - doing the best for her patients in a very inadequately resourced part of the health service. ""We ask that our privacy is respected at this difficult time and she will be making no further comments."" Mr Barton told reporters to direct further inquiries tothe Medical Defence Union,external, which is representing Dr Barton. Inquests into the deaths of 10 patients, six of whom are pictured, were held in 2009 Bridget Devine-Reeves, whose grandmother Elsie Reeves died at the hospital, told the BBC: ""The panel found there was a disregard for human life and it is extraordinary that she should have the audacity to say she was doing the best for patients - the statement given is worthless."" Anne Farthing's stepfather-in-law, Arthur 'Brian' Cunningham, also died at the hospital. He had been admitted with bed sores but died after being given powerful opiates and sedatives. She said: ""They have to make some statement so obviously they're going to come up with something that's just a front, quite frankly. ""It's just a waste of space and a waste of time."" The independent panel's report found there was an ""institutionalised regime"" of prescribing and administering ""dangerous"" amounts of a medication not clinically justified at the hospital from 1989 to 2000. It said taking into account missing records, a further 200 patients may have also had their lives shortened. The findings have led to calls for an inquiry from families. Hampshire Constabulary, which was criticised in the report for the way it handled three previous investigations into the deaths of 92 patients which failed to lead to any prosecutions, is to hand over any new inquiry to another force. Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney apologised for the force's ""part in the distress caused to families for so many years"". So far, the only person to face disciplinary action has been Dr Barton, who was found guilty of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999. But no prosecutions were brought and she was not struck off the medical register, choosing to retire after the findings. This video can not be played Gosport hospital: Families 'grossly let down' by authorities The Gosport Independent Panel's report found whistleblowers and families were ignored as they attempted to raise concerns about the administration of medication on the wards, which was overseen by Dr Barton. The report said an ""awareness"" that the deaths ""might be due to 'another Shipman'"" had ""cast a shadow over how concerns at the hospital were viewed"". GP Harold Shipman was jailed for life in 2000 for murdering 15 patients between 1995 and 1998. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Following the release of the report, Prime Minister Theresa May described events at Gosport as ""deeply troubling"" and apologised to families over the time it took to get answers from the NHS.

Grace Mugabe faction blamed for blast,"This video can not be played Mnangagwa: Criminal will be hounded down, but Zimbabwe is safe Zimbabwe's President Emmerson Mnangagwa has said he suspects a group linked to the former first lady was behind an attempt on his life. Two people died and more than 40 were hurt in an explosion near Mr Mnangagwa at a rally in Bulawayo on Saturday. Mr Mnangagwa told the BBC's Fergal Keane that he suspected the G40 group, which supported Grace Mugabe for the presidency, had carried out the attack. Mrs Mugabe's husband, Robert Mugabe, was forced from power last year. The army intervened to oppose Mrs Mugabe's attempt to succeed her husband as the country's leader, and the ruling Zanu-PF party then sacked Mr Mugabe, replacing him with Mr Mnangagwa. An exiled member of the G40 group, former government minister Jonathan Moyo,earlier tweeted that the blast ""smacks of an inside job"".,external Africa Live: All the latest news from the continent Snapping at the heels of Zimbabwe's 'crocodile' Will age be a factor in Zimbabwe's poll? Have Zimbabwe's generals turned into democrats? Mr Mnangagwa did not accuse Mrs Mugabe of being involved in the attempt on his life. He told the BBC he expects arrests to be made shortly. ""I don't know whether it was one individual - I would think it is broader than one person. I would think this is a political action by some aggrieved persons,"" he said. By BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane President Mnangagwa was emphatic. Whoever tried to kill him was part of a conspiracy rooted in the G40 faction. He did not blame Grace Mugabe for the attack but in accusing her supporters he has further isolated the former first lady. She is currently visiting Singapore, where her husband is receiving medical treatment. My impression is of a president who expects to win the 30 July election. He also struck me as being confident in the support of the international community and - critically - the Zimbabwean army as he faces his remaining internal enemies. Zimbabwe, in the wake of the apparent assassination attempt, is not an unstable country. But it is unsettled. The 'crocodile' who snapped back Mr Mnangagwa described Mrs Mugabe as someone who had frequently insulted him in the past. ""On what basis would I trust someone who was used by a cabal to say things that had no basis?"" he asked. Nicknamed ""the crocodile"", Mr Mnangagwa has a reputation for being ruthless, but he told our correspondent:  ""I am as soft as wool. I am a very soft person in life, my brother. I'm a family person. I am a Christian."" Despite the apparent attempt on his life, Mr Mnangagwa said there would be no countrywide security clampdown and elections scheduled for 30 July would go ahead in a free and fair manner. Zimbabwe was stable and that foreign investors should not worry, he said. This video can not be played Emmerson Mnangagwa: Who is the man known as the âcrocodileâ? Representatives of Zanu-PF, the main opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC) and other parties signed a peace pledge on Tuesday, promising to refrain from violence and hate speech during campaigning. The MDC's Nelson Chamisa is expected to be Mr Mnangagwa's main challenger in the election. He has also condemned the attack in Bulawayo.

"Mouldy, monster fatberg brings in crowds","The fatberg, which has begun to ""sweat"" and grow mould, could be preserved in the museum's collection A slice of fatberg put on show at the Museum of London could be preserved for future generations. The lump of congealed fat, oil and wet wipes has begun to ""sweat"" and change colour - and flies have hatched in it. But curator Vyki Sparkes says the fatberg caused a ""marked increase"" in visitors to the museum and they are now thinking of preserving it, when it finishes its public display this week. There has been an ""incredible reaction"" from visitors, she says. It has become one the museum's most popular exhibits, says the curator. The piece of fatberg was taken from a ""monster fatberg"", over 250m (820ft) long and weighing 130 tonnes, which had become something of asewer celebrity, when it was found under the streets of Whitechapel. Fatbergs are an accumulation of materials flushed into the sewers that form huge solid blocks - with the Whitechapel fatberg taking nine weeks to break up with drills. In the first such exhibition of its kind, the Museum of London put this slice of urban history on public view in February, as an example of the challenges of getting rid of waste in the capital. The fatberg when it went on show in February The display ends at the weekend, but Ms Sparkes says they have been taken aback by its appeal, with people making special trips to see the fatberg and boosting visitor numbers.

Costa sales fall on High Street weakness,"Costa has blamed a lack of shoppers on the High Street for a fall in like-for-like sales at the start of the year. The nation's biggest coffee chain reported a 2% fall in like-for-like sales in the first three months of the year. However, total UK sales growth were up by 5.2% thanks to new store openings, said Costa parent Whitbread. Whitbread said early steps had been taken to demerge Costa from the group, a move announced in April. In early morning trading in London, shares in Whitbread were up by 1.8% at Â£39.63. Whitbread to spin off Costa chain The UK's High Street crisis A simple change is cutting coffee cup waste ""Our stores remain highly profitable and deliver an excellent return on capital,"" said Whitbread boss Alison Brittain. The firm added: ""The UK like-for-like sales decline resulted principally from footfall weakness in traditional shopping locations, whereas travel locations continued to show good growth."" UK High Streets have been struggling in recent months with big names closing stores and restaurants and some retailers shutting down altogether. Marks & Spencer, House of Fraser, Mothercare, New Look, Byron, Jamie's Italian, and Prezzo are all closing outlets. Other Whitbread brands include Beefeater and Premier Inn Meanwhile, Maplin, Poundworld and Toys R Us have gone into administration. Costa said it was now actively refocusing its network towards ""high-footfall and convenient locations"". The coffee chain has more than 2,400 UK coffee shops, as well as some 1,400 outlets in 31 overseas markets. Costa Express has 8,237 vending machines worldwide. Whitbread acquired Costa in 1995 from founders Sergio and Bruno Costa. As well as being the largest UK coffee chain, Costa is also the world's second largest chain and it wants to expand even further - it is looking to triple its presence in China, where it is second to Starbucks. The spun-off Costa firm will be floated and listed as a separate business by 2020.  A further update on the demerger will be provided in October. Alison Brittain says Costa will thrive on its own Meanwhile, Whitbread - whose other brands include hotel chain Premier Inn and restaurants Beefeater and Brewers Fayre - saw overall like-for-like sales fall by 1.3% over the first quarter period. Boss Alison Brittain said the budget hotel market and the coffee market both presented long-term structural growth opportunities, ""Whilst we are cautious of shorter-term trading conditions in the UK, due to well publicised consumer trends, we are confident that we have the right strategies in place to enhance our UK and international market positions and ensure each business is well-positioned to thrive as a separate entity,"" added Ms Brittain. Commentating on the Costa sales fall, analyst Neil Wilson from Markets.com said: ""We have been seeing and warning about declining like-for-like at Costa for some time and this 2% drop is a concern about how the brand is performing on the High Street. ""Lower footfall is one thing, but we continue to see Costa facing tougher competition from artisan coffee retailers who are taking market share.""

Metal fillings 'leak mercury after scan',"Metal dental fillings leak mercury if they are exposed to a new powerful type of medical scan, scientists have found. They studied the effect of ultra-high-strength MRI - the latest in scanning technology being introduced toseveral research hospitals in the UK. The study, in the journalRadiology,external, shows 20 minutes' exposure is enough to release the toxin from extracted teeth filled with silver-coloured amalgam. The team say more studies are needed to tell what real-life risk it might pose. These cutting-edge scans are not yet widely used but are helping with medical research. Although metal fillings are now being superseded by white, ceramic, composite fillings, they arestill the most common type,externaloffered by NHS dentists. They are often used on the back teeth because they are hard-wearing, while visible front teeth are usually given white fillings. The British Dental Association says dental amalgam is safe. It's been in use and extensively studied for 150 years as a restorative material. Its safety and durability are well established. And it remains the most appropriate material for a range of clinical situations. It says there is no justification for removing these fillings as a precaution, except in those patients properly diagnosed as having allergic reactions to amalgam. This is a rare situation. But the BDA agrees that more studies are needed to better assess this new potential risk linked with powerful medical scans. Dr Selmi Yilmaz and colleagues at Akdeniz University, Turkey, measured the amount of mercury released by 60 amalgam-filled extracted teeth placed into 60 separate pots of artificial saliva. Forty of the potted teeth were scanned using either conventional MRI, which is relatively low strength, or the newer high-powered 7 Tesla MRI. A control group of 20 teeth were placed in artificial saliva only. The mercury content was four times higher in the pots that had been scanned with the high-powered MRI compared with the controls and the pots scanned with conventional MRI. Whether this high level of released mercury - 0.67 parts per million - might harm patients is not known. ""It is not clear how much of this released mercury is absorbed by the body,"" Dr Yilmaz said. Mercury is poisonous to humans and can cause toxic effects in high enough doses. The European Parliament has voted in favour of a gradual reduction in the use of dental amalgam to protect the environment, rather than for direct health reasons. When dental amalgam gets into the environment, the mercury it contains can be converted into methylmercury by aquatic microbes. This can then accumulate in the food chain, meaning people who eat contaminated fish and seafood will ingest it. British Dental Association's scientific adviser Prof Damien Walmsley said: ""The study indicates that people who have amalgam fillings should not be concerned if they need to have a conventional MRI scan. ""This will be a decreasing problem in time [as amalgam fillings are phased out] but the development of new ultra-high-strength MRI scanners, which were only approved by the US Food and Drug Administration last year, needs to be reviewed closely. ""The researchers acknowledge that further studies are needed on any potential risk presented by the new generation of MRI scanners."" The NHS advises that routine MRI scans are painless and safe procedures, although there aresome patients who they won't be suitable for,externalbecause the strong magnets used during the scan can affect metal implants or fragments in the body. Newer powerful MRI scans use stronger magnetic fields to get even more detailed images. They have been approved for use by medical regulators, who take safety into consideration.

The court said theCivil Partnership Act 2004,external- which only applies to same-sex couples - is incompatible with the European Convention on Human Rights. Ms Steinfeld said she hoped the government does the ""right thing"" and extends civil partnerships to all. ""We are feeling elated,"" she told the BBC outside court. ""But at the same time we are feeling frustrated the government has wasted taxpayers' money in fighting what the judges' have called a blatant inequality."" The judgement does not oblige government to change the law, although it does make it more likely that the government will now act, the BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman explained. In a civil partnership, a couple is entitled to the same legal treatment in terms of inheritance, tax, pensions and next-of-kin arrangements as marriage. The couple, who met in 2010 and have two children, said the ""legacy of marriage"" which ""treated women as property for centuries"" was not an option for them. ""We want to raise our children as equal partners and feel that a civil partnership - a modern, symmetrical institution - sets the best example for them,"" they explained. Where are heterosexual civil partnerships legal? Why we want a civil partnership Why choose civil partnership over marriage? Since March 2014, same sex-couples can choose whether to enter a civil partnership or to marry. This has not been possible for mixed-sex couples, which led Ms Steinfeld and Mr Keidan to argue that the law was discriminatory. This ruling overturns a previous judgement made by the Court of Appeal, whichrejected the couple's claim, in February of last year. Legal and financial protection for both parties in the event of the relationship ending, like in marriage It is free of the religious connotations of marriage Some object to marriage as an institution and its associations with property and patriarchy The judges ruled that current UK law was  ""incompatible"" with human rights laws on discrimination and the right to a private and family life. Announcing the court's decision, Lord Kerr said the government did not seek to justify the difference in treatment between same-sex and different sex couples. ""To the contrary, it accepts that the difference cannot be justified,"" he said. LGBT and human rights campaigner Peter Tatchell called the ruling a ""victory for love and equality"". ""It was never fair that same-sex couples had two options, civil partnerships and civil marriages, whereas opposite-sex partners had only one option, marriage,"" he said. By BBC legal correspondent, Clive Coleman Rebecca Steinfeld and Charles Keidan appealed to the Supreme Court after the Court of Appeal rejected their claim in February 2017 It is an irony that the way in which relationship equality for same sex couples came about in the 21st century had the effect of creating inequality between them and different sex couples. The Civil Partnership Act 2004 created civil partnerships but defined them as a 'relationship between two people of the same sex'. When the Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013 legalised same sex marriage, gay couples had two options as to how to formalise their relationship in law - marriage or civil partnership - whereas heterosexual couples could only marry. The Supreme Court has found that inequality to amount to discrimination and a breach of the right to a family life. The government accepted the inequality between same sex and different sex couples, but argued that it needed to have time to assemble sufficient information to allow a confident decision to be made about the future of civil partnerships. Lord Kerr gave that argument short shrift, saying: ""What it (the government) seeks is tolerance of the discrimination while it sorts out how to deal with it.  That cannot be characterised as a legitimate aim."" The couple will later go to Whitehall to deliver a letter to Equalities Minister Penny Mordaunt. Martin Loat, chairman of the Equal Civil Partnerships campaign, said: ""There is only one possible way forward - giving everyone the right to a civil partnership - and we urge the government to seize this opportunity to announce it will end this injustice now."" More than 130,000 people have signed an online petition in support of civil partnerships for everyone. The couple's barrister Karon Monaghan QC told the court her clients had ""deep-rooted and genuine ideological objections to marriage"" and are ""not alone"" in their views. There are around 63,000 couples in civil partnerships in the UK and some 3.3 million co-habiting couples.

US judge orders migrant family reunionsThe government is told to reunite children separated from their parents within 30 days.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Veronica is terrified she'll be separated from her daughter when she seeks asylum at the US border A US judge has ordered that migrant children and their parents who were separated when they crossed into the US should be reunited within 30 days. The judge issued the injunction in a case stemming from the administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. Meanwhile the policy of breaking up families at the Mexico border is being challenged by 17 US states. Democratic attorneys general from states including Washington, New York and California launched the lawsuit. More than 2,300 migrant children have been separated from their parents since early May under the Trump administration's controversial policy, which seeks to criminally prosecute anyone crossing the border illegally. This video can not be played Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre Tuesday's preliminary injunction, issued by a federal judge in San Diego, California, orders the government to reunite parents with their children aged under five within 14 days, and with older ones within 30 days. The nationwide injunction was issued as part of a case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of a mother who was split from her six-year-old daughter after arriving in the US last year. Watch: The cost of detention vs the alternatives The psychological impact on children Judge Dana Sabraw criticised ""responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the government's own making"". Court papers filed by the ACLU contained accounts from other parents unable to locate their children after they were separated at the border. Last week President Trump issued an executive order promising to ""keep families together"" in migrant detention centres. It urged officials to expedite cases involving families. ""We don't like to see families separated,"" Mr Trump said. The order was widely seen as the reversal of a policy that had drawn widespread domestic and international condemnation. On Monday US border security chief Kevin McAleenan said he had halted criminal prosecutions of migrants who illegally enter the country with children, following Mr Trump's announcement. However critics have said the order is vague, and does not specify when and how those already split up would be brought back together. Two US military bases to house migrants Migrant families face chaos to reunite This video can not be played Cisary Reynaud has not spoken to his daughter since they were separated Why are the stateschallenging the policy? The lawsuit by the 17 states argues that the order does not prevent the policy being used again in the future,external. Neither, they note, does it say anything about reuniting families that have been separated. They call the policy ""an affront"" to the states' interests in maintaining standards of care for children and preserving parent-child relationships. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal callled it ""cruel, plain and simple"" and accused the administration of ""issuing new, contradictory policies"" every day. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said the administration was causing ""causing unfathomable trauma"" and thatmigrant children held in New York City had to be treated for depression and suicidal behaviour,external. The lawsuit was filed with the US District Court in Seattle, Washington, on Tuesday. The states involved are Massachusetts, Washington, New York, California, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia plus the District of Columbia. The lawsuit is similar to the case against the Trump administration's travel ban, which was initially blocked by Hawaii untilthe Supreme Court reversed the ruling on Tuesday morning. Speaking in Brazil on Tuesday, US Vice-President Mike Pence warned undocumented immigrants not to ""risk the lives of your children"" by trying to enter the US illegally. He said he had a message ""straight from my heart"" for those planning a journey to America: ""If you can't come legally, don't come at all."" Also on Tuesday, the US health department's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) confirmed that 2,047 migrant children were currently in the care of the agency. The children have been sent to holding cells, converted warehouses, desert tents or foster care around the US. ORR director Scott Lloyd refused to say whether the agency was still receiving migrant children who had been separated from their families.

Japanese spacecraft reaches cosmic 'diamond',"Scientists will map Ryugu with a view to choosing the best location to sample A Japanese spacecraft has arrived at its target - an asteroid shaped like a diamond or, according to some, a spinning top. Hayabusa 2 has been travelling toward the space rock Ryugu since launching from the Tanegashima spaceport in 2014. It is on a quest to study the object close-up and deliver rocks and soil from Ryugu to Earth. It will use explosives to propel a projectile into Ryugu, digging out a fresh sample from beneath the surface. Dr Makoto Yoshikawa, Hayabusa 2's mission manager, talked about the plan now that the spacecraft had arrived at its destination. ""At first, we will study very carefully the surface features. Then we will select where to touch down. Touchdown means we get the surface material,"" he told me. A copper projectile, or ""impactor"" will separate from the spacecraft, floating down to the surface of the asteroid. Once Hayabusa 2 is safely out of the way, an explosive charge will detonate, driving the projectile into the surface. ""We have an impactor which will create a small crater on the surface of Ryugu. Maybe in spring next year, we will try to make a crater... then our spacecraft will try to reach into the crater to get the subsurface material."" ""But this is a very big challenge."" Hayabusa 2 will use a projectile to excavate fresh material from beneath Ryugu's surface Scientists study asteroids to gain insights into the origins and evolution of our cosmic neighbourhood, the Solar System. Asteroids are essentially leftover building materials from the formation of the Solar System 4.6 billion years ago. It's also thought they may contain chemical compounds that could have been important for kick-starting life on Earth. They contain water, organic (carbon-rich) compounds and precious metals. The last of those has tempted several companies to look into the feasibility of asteroid mining. 'Dumpling' space rock comes into view From far away, the asteroid seemed to resemble a Japanese dango dumpling... ...but now we have close-up images, scientists are comparing its shape to that of a spinning top Dr Yoshikawa, who is an associate professor at Japan'sInstitute of Space and Astronautical Science (ISAS),external, said Ryugu's shape was unexpected. He said asteroids with this general shape tended to be fast-rotating, completing one revolution every three or four hours. But Ryugu's spin period is relatively long - about 7.5 hours. ""Many scientists in our project think that in the past the spin period was very short - it rotated very quickly - and the spin period has slowed down. We don't know why it slowed down, but this is a very interesting topic,"" he told BBC News. Hayabusa 2 will spend about a year and a half surveying the 900m-wide space rock, which is about 290 million km (180 million miles) from Earth. During this time, it will aim to deploy several landing craft to the surface, including small rovers and a German-built instrument package called Mascot (Mobile Asteroid Surface Scout). Hayabusa 2 is carrying a German-built lander called MASCOT Ryugu is a so-called C-type asteroid, a kind that is thought to be relatively primitive. This means it may be rich in organic and hydrated minerals (those combined with water). Studying what Ryugu is made from could provide insights into the molecular mix that contributed to the origin of life on Earth. The surface of the asteroid is likely to have been weathered - altered by aeons of exposure to the harsh environment of space. That's why Hayabusa 2's scientists want to dig down for as fresh a sample as possible. The onboard Lidar (light detection and ranging) instrument is used partly as a navigation sensor for rendezvous, approach, and touchdown. It illuminates the target with pulsed laser light to measure variable distances between the two objects. On Tuesday, scientists successfullyused the Lidar to measure the distance from Hayabusa to the asteroid for the first time,external. The mission will depart from Ryugu in December 2019 with the intention of returning to Earth with the asteroid samples in 2020. The first Hayabusa spacecraft was launched in 2003 and reached the asteroid Itokawa in 2005. Despitebeing hit by a series of mishaps,external, it returned to Earth in 2010 witha small amount of material from the asteroid. An American asteroid sample return mission, Osiris-Rex, willrendezvous with the object 101955 Bennu in August.

Facebook abandons flying internet plan,"Facebook had been hoping to offering connectivity by sending data between a fleet of drones Facebook is giving up on its plan to create drones that beam down internet connectivity, the company has confirmed. Project Aquila, first announced in 2014, failed to achieve the long flight times managed by airborne connectivity efforts from rivals including Google. In one test, Facebookâs craft suffered a broken wing as it came in to land. On Tuesday the company said it would instead partner with firms such as Airbus to continue its efforts to connect more people to the internet. The decision means the closure of a facility in Bridgwater, UK, that had been used to build the technology. âIt's been exciting to see leading companies in the aerospace industry start investing in this technology too - including the design and construction of new high-altitude aircraft,â wrote Yael Maguire, Facebookâs Director of Engineering,in a blog post,external. ""Given these developments, we've decided not to design or build our own aircraft any longer.â The Project Aquila craft had the wingspan of a Boeing 737 and weighed the same as a typical family car. It was solar-powered during the day and battery-powered at night, and in testing managed 90 minutes in the air. This video can not be played Facebook's Aquila drone takes to the air However, Facebook's efforts paled in comparison to Project Loon, a similar idea using high-altitude balloons rather than drones. It is being worked on by X, the experimental arm of Google parent company Alphabet. Project Loon balloons have flown more than 15 million miles of tests, the company has said, with the longest continuous flight lasting almost 190 days. In 2017, the balloons wereused by residents of hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico. _______ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Business and unions seek Brexit urgency,"The joint statement asks for ""jobs, rights and livelihoods"" to be put first Business and union leaders from across the UK and Europe have joined together to plead for ""pace and urgency"" in Brexit negotiations. The CBI and the TUC along with their European counterparts are calling on the UK government and the European Union to make ""measureable progress"". UK and EU leaders will attend a European Council meeting this week. The groups say the UK and the EU must ""put economic interests and people's jobs, rights and livelihoods first"". The CBI, BusinessEurope, the TUC and the European Trade Union Confederation (ETUC) collectively represent 45 million workers and 20 million employers across the EU. In a joint statement, they said: ""We are calling on the UK government and the EU to inject pace and urgency in the negotiations, bringing about measurable progress, in particular a backstop arrangement to avoid a hard border in Ireland. Brexit: All you need to know Business Brexit 'threats' wrong says Hunt ""Decisions will be needed in June and October to finalise the withdrawal agreement and the transitional arrangement, and put economic interests and people's jobs, rights and livelihoods first."" CBI director-general Carolyn Fairbairn UK Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the European Council meeting on 28-29 June. However, she will be excluded from a gathering of the other 27 EU nations where chief negotiator Michel Barnier will provide on update on Brexit talks. Carolyn Fairbairn and Markus Beyrer, the director-generals of the CBI and BusinessEurope respectively, as well as Luca Visentini and Frances O'Grady, the general secretaries of the ETUC and the TUC, met earlier this month in London to discuss Brexit. Ahead of the European Council meeting they said: ""The UK government and the EU will need to agree on all aspects of regulatory alignment, which is of the utmost importance, without jeopardising the integrity of the single market."" A spokesman for the UK government said: ""We absolutely agree. That's why we have put forward workable proposals to the EU on a range of areas from the backstop to security, and the White Paper - which will be published after June Council - will continue to drive this process forward.

World Cup Daily: Messi turns up for Argentinaâ¦ finally Dramatic late Rojo volley sends Argentina through Highlights: Nigeria 1-2 Argentina The Argentine camp had been the subject of numerous stories and rumours ever since the disastrous 3-0 defeat by Croatia, with the team called""the worst ever""and Sampaoli beggingfans for forgiveness. A change to a back four brought about a much-improved first-half display, and they led at the break through Messi's expertly taken goal. Victor Moses' second-half penalty threatened to derail that improvement, but Rojo's late strike earned Argentina passage into the last 16. ""It was a difficult situation,"" said Messi, who was pictured giving a team talk in the tunnel before the players came back out for the second half. Lionel Messi won the Golden Ball award for the best player at the 2014 World Cup ""It was a huge release and relief for all of us. It is a huge joy for everyone for the difficult days we lived after the last defeat. Luckily we achieved our objective."" Sampaoli was embraced by Messi at full-time and said suggestions the Barcelona forward - who briefly retired from international football in 2016 - is not committed to the national side are not true. ""Every time Lionel Messi plays he shows that he is a fantastic player, above everybody else, but he needs support from his team-mates,"" said Sampaoli. ""His human side is amazing. He cries and suffers, he is happy when Argentina win. It's important he shares those feelings. Many people say Leo does not enjoy playing for Argentina, but I don't agree. ""My players play with their heart - they are true rebels.""

But the Barcelona number 10 found his magic on Tuesday with a brilliant opening goal. ""Messi has turned up for his country,"" former Nigeria international Peter Odemwingie said on BBC Radio 5 live. ""[He has gone] from covering his face ahead of the Croatia game to looking like he meant business before kick-off today. He rolled up his sleeves and contributed for his team."" Former England winger Chris Waddle told BBC Radio 5 live: ""Who else? We have talked about him not performing all tournament, but what a finish. Lionel Messi at his very best."" Ex-England defender Rio Ferdinand added that Messi ""had a spark and an energy"" in the first half and a different ""body language"" to what we had seen in the first two games. ""Messi is thinking 'this is my stage and my moment,"" said Match of the Day pundit Ferdinand. ""His goal was what we came to see. The run and two touches before the exquisite finish was what the World Cup needs to be blessed with."" ""The greatest players appear in the moments you need them. That's why Messi's the best,"" said former Argentina international Pablo Zabaleta. Argentina now face Group C winners France in Kazan on Saturday afternoon, with match-winner Rojo saying: ""Now the World Cup begins for us."" Didier Deschamps' side wrapped up the group with a 0-0 draw against Denmark on Tuesday and while they have not been at their best so far, BBC South American football expert Tim Vickery expects them to be too strong for Argentina. ""It is very hard to see how Argentina can stand up to the French on Saturday,"" he said. ""If they are going to mount any challenge, it will have to be like it was four years ago when they played on individual talent to reach the final. ""Messi showed glimpses of brilliance and Javier Mascherano was solid at the back. But Mascherano hasn't got the legs any more and France will not be too concerned about playing Argentina."" Croatia topped Group D with their late victory over Iceland, while Argentina secured the runners-up spot with their late win over Nigeria Messi becomes the first player to have scored a World Cup goal as a teenager, in his twenties and in his thirties Messi's strike was his sixth goal at the World Cup, with 50% of those coming against Nigeria (two in 2014, one today) He (2006, 2014 and 2018) is the third Argentina player to have scored in three different World Cup tournaments, alongside Diego Maradona (1982, 1986 and 1994) and Gabriel Batistuta (1994, 1998 and 2002). Messi's opener in the 14th minute was the 100th goal scored at the 2018 World Cup. He completed seven dribbles in this match - those seven dribbles took him to 107 completed at the World Cup, the most of any player since 1966, overtaking Maradona, who previously had the most with 105.

'Tax and regulate more to improve health',"The government should tax and regulate more to encourage people to be healthier, a group of experts says. The independent analysis, produced for the BBC, said the success of the smoking ban and sugary drinks tax should embolden ministers. The experts also said the fear of the ""nanny state"" tag was unfounded as polling suggested the public have an appetite for tough action. It comes after ministers in England unveiled new plans for child obesity. The proposals announced at the weekend includeda crackdown on sweets and fatty snacks sold at checkouts and tighter restrictions on junk food ads on TV and online. Is the NHS a champion or an also-ran? The history of the NHS in charts Nick Robinson: Let's be honest about the NHS Forget 70 - what will the NHS look like at 100? NHS 'poorâ on treating deadly illnesses The experts behind the analysis - one of five produced to mark the 70th birthday of the NHS on 5 July - urged ministers to do more to tackle unhealthy lifestyles to help relieve the pressure on the NHS. They pointed out that seven in 10 adults do not meet the recommended guidelines in relation to diet, physical activity, drinking and smoking. But despite this, polling carried out for the report by Ipsos MORI found that 85% of people believe they have a ""great deal of responsibility"" for keeping healthy. The survey of more than 2,000 people in the UK also showed a significant degree of support for taxes and regulation. This included 54% who backed a minimum price for alcohol - something which has already been implemented in Scotland and is soon to be introduced in Wales. And 70% supported limits on fast food outlets in areas near schools - a policy which some councils have introduced. The report has been produced by four leading think tanks - the King's Fund, Nuffield Trust, Health Foundation and Institute for Fiscal Studies. Report author Helen McKenna said the government should be ""bolder"". ""Although politicians may balk at the idea of the 'nanny state', our research suggests these types of intervention may enjoy stronger public support than they often assume."" A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said preventing ill-health was a ""priority"" for the government as shown by the record low smoking rates and the efforts on child obesity. ""There is a clear role for both the state and the individual to tackle lifestyle conditions,"" he added. What do you want to know about how the NHS currently operates?

US states sue over migrant separations,"This video can not be played Veronica is terrified she'll be separated from her daughter when she seeks asylum at the US border A US judge has ordered that migrant children and their parents who were separated when they crossed into the US should be reunited within 30 days. The judge issued the injunction in a case stemming from the administration's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. Meanwhile the policy of breaking up families at the Mexico border is being challenged by 17 US states. Democratic attorneys general from states including Washington, New York and California launched the lawsuit. More than 2,300 migrant children have been separated from their parents since early May under the Trump administration's controversial policy, which seeks to criminally prosecute anyone crossing the border illegally. This video can not be played Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre Tuesday's preliminary injunction, issued by a federal judge in San Diego, California, orders the government to reunite parents with their children aged under five within 14 days, and with older ones within 30 days. The nationwide injunction was issued as part of a case filed by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) on behalf of a mother who was split from her six-year-old daughter after arriving in the US last year. Watch: The cost of detention vs the alternatives The psychological impact on children Judge Dana Sabraw criticised ""responses to address a chaotic circumstance of the government's own making"". Court papers filed by the ACLU contained accounts from other parents unable to locate their children after they were separated at the border. Last week President Trump issued an executive order promising to ""keep families together"" in migrant detention centres. It urged officials to expedite cases involving families. ""We don't like to see families separated,"" Mr Trump said. The order was widely seen as the reversal of a policy that had drawn widespread domestic and international condemnation. On Monday US border security chief Kevin McAleenan said he had halted criminal prosecutions of migrants who illegally enter the country with children, following Mr Trump's announcement. However critics have said the order is vague, and does not specify when and how those already split up would be brought back together. Two US military bases to house migrants Migrant families face chaos to reunite This video can not be played Cisary Reynaud has not spoken to his daughter since they were separated Why are the stateschallenging the policy? The lawsuit by the 17 states argues that the order does not prevent the policy being used again in the future,external. Neither, they note, does it say anything about reuniting families that have been separated. They call the policy ""an affront"" to the states' interests in maintaining standards of care for children and preserving parent-child relationships. New Jersey Attorney General Gurbir Grewal callled it ""cruel, plain and simple"" and accused the administration of ""issuing new, contradictory policies"" every day. New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood said the administration was causing ""causing unfathomable trauma"" and thatmigrant children held in New York City had to be treated for depression and suicidal behaviour,external. The lawsuit was filed with the US District Court in Seattle, Washington, on Tuesday. The states involved are Massachusetts, Washington, New York, California, Delaware, Iowa, Illinois, Maryland, Minnesota, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Oregon, Pennsylvania, Rhode Island, Vermont and Virginia plus the District of Columbia. The lawsuit is similar to the case against the Trump administration's travel ban, which was initially blocked by Hawaii untilthe Supreme Court reversed the ruling on Tuesday morning. Speaking in Brazil on Tuesday, US Vice-President Mike Pence warned undocumented immigrants not to ""risk the lives of your children"" by trying to enter the US illegally. He said he had a message ""straight from my heart"" for those planning a journey to America: ""If you can't come legally, don't come at all."" Also on Tuesday, the US health department's Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR) confirmed that 2,047 migrant children were currently in the care of the agency. The children have been sent to holding cells, converted warehouses, desert tents or foster care around the US. ORR director Scott Lloyd refused to say whether the agency was still receiving migrant children who had been separated from their families.

MPs seek report into HBOS Reading probeThe Treasury Select Committee is demanding maximum transparency into Lloyds' investigation of a fraud at HBOS.Business,"Investigators looking into allegations of a cover-up of a Â£1bn pound fraud at HBOS have been told by MPs they must hand over their findings to parliament. Treasury Select Committee chair Nicky Morgan says she found the details disclosed in a leaked report into the alleged cover-up ""deeply troubling"". The report claims HBOS failed to disclose the fraud before being rescued by Lloyds during the financial crisis. Ms Morgan said the committee will seek ""maximum transparency"". The Lloyds Banking Group internal report - known as Project Lord Turnbull - claimed that since 2007, HBOS had a strategy to conceal a fraud at its Reading office where corrupt bankers forced business customers to take on a firm of so-called turnaround consultants. But instead of being helped, customers ended up ruined. Many lost their livelihoods, their marriages and their health. The report surfaced on the internet last week and was later published by Kevin Hollinrake MP, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking. Read the Project Lord Turnbull report here:Part one,externalandPart two,external In April, Lloyds Banking Group appointed Dame Linda Dobbs to investigate. However, the bank hasn't committed to making Dame Linda's findings public. MPs are insisting they must be turned over to parliament. Ms Morgan said: ""The fraud at HBOS Reading was a shocking crime that destroyed lives and livelihoods. There are numerous investigations into the events, including the Dame Linda Dobbs Review and an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)."" She said: ""There are deeply troubling allegations raised in the ""Project Lord Turnbull"" report, which are at the heart of Dame Linda's and the FCA's investigations. The committee will consider the findings of this work when it's completed. Treasury Select Committee chair Nicky Morgan ""In the meantime, we will continue to press for maximum transparency. It is overwhelmingly in the public interest to understand how such a huge criminal fraud was allowed to happen, and why it took so long for it to come to light."" Ex-HBOS banker 'sold his soul for swag' HBOS: A highly unusual fraud case Lloyds said it ""remains determined to get to the bottom of what happened in HBOS Reading and we share the Treasury Committee's desire for transparency"". ""We welcome the statement by Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury Select Committee. We continue to support the FCA investigation and the separate, independent Dame Linda Dobbs review. ""We will, of course, assist the Treasury Select Committee in its consideration of these matters and will fulfil any requests made to us, including provision of Dame Linda's review findings."" The Project Lord Turnbull report was written in 2013 by a senior manager at Lloyds called Sally Masterton who was helping Thames Valley Police with inquiries into the fraud at HBOS's office in Reading. Mrs Masterton came across new information raising concerns about a cover-up of the fraud. After relaying her concerns to a senior executive, who asked her to write-up her findings, Mrs Masterton produced the report. Its executive summary said: ""Concealment set in motion a course of events that has had and continues to have far-reaching and very serious consequences, extending to the Lloyds TSB takeover. LBG is significantly exposed."" After writing a draft report and submitting its front section on 5 September 2013, Mrs Masterton was put on enforced leave on 23 September 2013. In May 2008, the government knew HBOS was running low on cash but wanted to avoid another nationalisation. HBOS executives proposed to raise money from the bank's shareholders to beef up its finances. However, in the prospectus for that fund-raising, which is meant to disclose all material financial information, there was no mention of a fraud. Mrs Masterton found emails showing HBOS executives didn't want to disclose their exposure to ""the Reading incident"" and discussed keeping it comfortably below a limit of 5% of net income from group continuing operations - or Â£285m. Later that year Lloyds shareholders were asked to approve the purchase of HBOS. Again, the prospectus mentioned nothing about the fraud - nor about Â£40bn pounds in ""stressed assets"" - loans where the bank might not get its money back.

MPs seek report into HBOS Reading probe,"Investigators looking into allegations of a cover-up of a Â£1bn pound fraud at HBOS have been told by MPs they must hand over their findings to parliament. Treasury Select Committee chair Nicky Morgan says she found the details disclosed in a leaked report into the alleged cover-up ""deeply troubling"". The report claims HBOS failed to disclose the fraud before being rescued by Lloyds during the financial crisis. Ms Morgan said the committee will seek ""maximum transparency"". The Lloyds Banking Group internal report - known as Project Lord Turnbull - claimed that since 2007, HBOS had a strategy to conceal a fraud at its Reading office where corrupt bankers forced business customers to take on a firm of so-called turnaround consultants. But instead of being helped, customers ended up ruined. Many lost their livelihoods, their marriages and their health. The report surfaced on the internet last week and was later published by Kevin Hollinrake MP, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking. Read the Project Lord Turnbull report here:Part one,externalandPart two,external In April, Lloyds Banking Group appointed Dame Linda Dobbs to investigate. However, the bank hasn't committed to making Dame Linda's findings public. MPs are insisting they must be turned over to parliament. Ms Morgan said: ""The fraud at HBOS Reading was a shocking crime that destroyed lives and livelihoods. There are numerous investigations into the events, including the Dame Linda Dobbs Review and an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)."" She said: ""There are deeply troubling allegations raised in the ""Project Lord Turnbull"" report, which are at the heart of Dame Linda's and the FCA's investigations. The committee will consider the findings of this work when it's completed. Treasury Select Committee chair Nicky Morgan ""In the meantime, we will continue to press for maximum transparency. It is overwhelmingly in the public interest to understand how such a huge criminal fraud was allowed to happen, and why it took so long for it to come to light."" Ex-HBOS banker 'sold his soul for swag' HBOS: A highly unusual fraud case Lloyds said it ""remains determined to get to the bottom of what happened in HBOS Reading and we share the Treasury Committee's desire for transparency"". ""We welcome the statement by Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury Select Committee. We continue to support the FCA investigation and the separate, independent Dame Linda Dobbs review. ""We will, of course, assist the Treasury Select Committee in its consideration of these matters and will fulfil any requests made to us, including provision of Dame Linda's review findings."" The Project Lord Turnbull report was written in 2013 by a senior manager at Lloyds called Sally Masterton who was helping Thames Valley Police with inquiries into the fraud at HBOS's office in Reading. Mrs Masterton came across new information raising concerns about a cover-up of the fraud. After relaying her concerns to a senior executive, who asked her to write-up her findings, Mrs Masterton produced the report. Its executive summary said: ""Concealment set in motion a course of events that has had and continues to have far-reaching and very serious consequences, extending to the Lloyds TSB takeover. LBG is significantly exposed."" After writing a draft report and submitting its front section on 5 September 2013, Mrs Masterton was put on enforced leave on 23 September 2013. In May 2008, the government knew HBOS was running low on cash but wanted to avoid another nationalisation. HBOS executives proposed to raise money from the bank's shareholders to beef up its finances. However, in the prospectus for that fund-raising, which is meant to disclose all material financial information, there was no mention of a fraud. Mrs Masterton found emails showing HBOS executives didn't want to disclose their exposure to ""the Reading incident"" and discussed keeping it comfortably below a limit of 5% of net income from group continuing operations - or Â£285m. Later that year Lloyds shareholders were asked to approve the purchase of HBOS. Again, the prospectus mentioned nothing about the fraud - nor about Â£40bn pounds in ""stressed assets"" - loans where the bank might not get its money back.

Moorland blaze declared 'major incident',"This video can not be played Drones capture vast Saddleworth Moor blaze A huge moorland fire is continuing to spread because the land is ""as dry as a tinder box"" and winds are fanning the flames. The blaze covers 3.7miles (6km) of Saddleworth Moor and has been raging since Sunday night. More than 50 homes were evacuated in Carrbrook, near Stalybridge, Greater Manchester, and 150 people affected. One resident described seeing ""ash falling like rain"" and another said it ""looked like the apocalypse"". Dave Keelan, director of emergency response at Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, said 70 of its firefighters were tackling the blaze. He confirmed talks were ongoing to see if the Army could offer extra teams, four-wheel drive vehicles and air support. Residents described hearing explosions as the fire continued to rage Brenda Warrington, leader of Tameside Council, said firefighters were hoping for a ""really good downpour"" and rain was ""the only thing"" that would quickly deal with the blaze. ""We do need mother nature to help us quite frankly,"" she said. ""It's as dry as a tinder box up there. A lot of winds are fanning the fire."" Saddleworth Moor fire in pictures Army called in to tackle moorlands fire How do you tackle a moorland blaze? Mr Keelan said there were four different areas of fire embedded within peat, which is ""extremely difficult"" for crews to extinguish. ""They are working extremely hard, as they have been for the past couple of days, in really arduous conditions in heat and smoke,"" he said. Members of the public are assisted with face masks being distributed by the council Matt Lomas, 76, who was evacuated with his wife, daughter and eight-month-old granddaughter Isla, said: ""We could see flames 50ft high like a raging ball of fire all on the hill side. ""It was really scary, we were really worried the smoke would hurt Isla so we had to get out."" Angela Brown, 59, said she saw ""ash falling like rain"" from the raging fire. ""It was terrifying. It was getting closer and closer. Every so often there was a crackle and flames would shoot in the air."" Firefighters are tackling the blaze and hoping rain will assist them Pete Woodward, 43, said: ""It looked like the apocalypse. There was a towering inferno of flames."" He said he ""just grabbed a toothbrush and underpants"" and got out with his partner and two young daughters. ""The flames were 500 metres long, it was a raging wildfire. You could hear the odd explosion but thankfully the house survived."" People living in Carrbrook moved animals amid the dense smoke The fire began on Sunday night, reignited on Monday during the hot weather and then spread throughout Tuesday, fanned by evening winds. Police said the homes in Carr Rise, Carr Lane and Calico Crescent were evacuated on Tuesday evening due to the proximity of the flames. The majority of people had returned by Wednesday afternoon. Satellite images give a sense of how far the smoke is spreading Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said a ""request to the military for extra support"" is being prepared ""so there is a back-up plan"" to support firefighters. ""I think everybody feels a great deal of gratitude towards them [firefighters] but it's hit the point where reinforcements are needed and that's what we're arranging,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live.

This video can not be played Saddleworth Moor resident: ""You could hardly breathe and your eyes were burning"" At the scene: Stewart Whittingham, BBC News Online Thick smoke is swirling around the village of Carrbrook, making people cough and cover their mouths. Ash covers a welcome mat at one house, and evacuated neighbours hug each other in the street. Some have tears in their eyes while others shake their heads as the look at the charred hillside. One or two cuddle their precious pet cats and dogs. Thick smoke can still be seen on the hilltops from the fires burning on the moors beyond. Snuggled up to his mother, seven-year-old Oscar McFie sums up the mood: ""It was scary, but we're safe."" Firefighters recommenced ""offensive firefighting"" on Wednesday morning The fire service earlier confirmed the blaze was spreading and said crews had recommenced ""offensive firefighting"". Assistant Chief Fire Officer Leon Parkes said crews planned to ""put a heavy attack"" on the fire, which has been declared a ""major incident"". Heatwave set to last until the weekend In pictures: Heatwave hits the UK Staying safe and cool in UK heatwave conditions Smoke and flames can still be seen for miles but Mr Parkes said crews had ""quelled the risk"" to homes at risk from the flames. He said it had not been established what might have caused the fire. Greater Manchester Police's Saddleworth division said about 2,000 acres of moorland had been destroyed in the fire. Some 65,000 gallons of water were dropped on the blaze by a helicopter on Tuesday to fight the fire which was ""unprecedented in recent times"", it added. Firefighter Ricky Case, who has been out on the hills, said: ""It's just the sheer vastness of it. It's one of the biggest ones I've been on in a long time."" Matt Lomas was evacuated with his eight-month-old granddaughter Isla Farmer Chris Keytes, 58, and his wife Jane, 50, refused to leave despite the fire being just 30ft from his farm and police asking them to go. ""I was concerned [but] we're set up with masks and we put a towel under the door,"" Mr Keytes said. ""We've had fires before but this one was pretty close."" Firefighters continued to battle the fire near Stalybridge at daybreak on Wednesday Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn praised firefighters ahead of Prime Minster's Questions earlier. Mrs May told MPs the government is keeping the situation ""under constant review"". She offered her sympathy to the firefighters and residents and added that ""operational policy arrangements"" were in place ""to provide support if required"". Mr Corbyn said: ""I'm sure all our thoughts are with the firefighters and the communities and families and the member for Stalybridge and Hyde is there today to support them."" Huge amounts of smoke has drifted westwards, with large parts of Greater Manchester experiencing poor visibility. BBC Weather's Simon King said there was a ""brisk easterly wind"" forecast for Wednesday with ""little to no rain in the forecast for at least a week"". The fire service said it plans ""a heavy attack"" on the fire The fire service said smoke levels in the air were not ""toxic"" but could be an ""irritant"", and advised people to close windows. Public Health England also advised people to wash their faces with soap and water and keep hydrated. Four schools in the Tameside area have been closed, the council said. The Wildlife Trust said the fire would also have ""devastating consequences for some animals and birds"". Director of conservation Tim Mitcham said: ""Only the most mobile of animals escape and of course we are in peak breeding period for many. ""The habitat will recover but it will take time.""

Ministers scrap community prisons plan,"This video can not be played Justice Secretary David Gauke defends cuts to five women's community prisons The government has abandoned plans for five community prisons for women in England and Wales. Instead, the Ministry of Justice will trial five residential centres to help offenders with issues such as finding work and drug rehabilitation. Justice Secretary David Gauke said short custodial sentences had failed to halt the ""cycle of offending"". Campaigners and police bodies have warned the provision for women must be ""properly funded"". Meanwhile, a justice minister has said sentences under a year should be axed for all but the most serious crimes. Rory Stewart told the Commons Justice Select Committee that community penalties were more effective and he wanted to ""significantly reduce, if not eliminate"" terms of under 12 months. Fresh doubts over women's prisons plans Women criminals 'need help not prison' Why are community sentences falling out of favour? Mr Gauke cited figures that 70.7% of women and 62.9% of men released from custody between April and June 2016 after a sentence of less than a year went on to re-offend within 12 months. He said there was ""persuasive evidence"" that the new approach would help reduce re-offending rates. Mothers at the trial residential centres might be able to have their children with them, he added. Analysis: By BBC Home Affairs correspondent Danny Shaw The female offender strategy represents a U-turn from the approach proposed by Liz Truss, when she was justice secretary, that there should be five new community prisons. Partly this is down to money; it costs millions more to build new jails than it does community centres, and at a time when the Ministry of Justice is having to find savings that will have been a key consideration. But the policy also reflects a determination at the department to promote alternatives to locking people up in order to relieve pressure on prisons and reduce reoffending. Ministers say research shows that offenders on community sentences are less likely to commit further crimes than those who've served short jail terms. But the research needs further, careful analysis - because it does not compare like with like: the reoffending figures cover the period an offender spends on a community sentence but do not include the time a prisoner spends in jail. The government has pledged to spend Â£5m over two years on ""community provision"" for women. The Association of Police and Crime Commissioners welcomed the change in strategy. But Dame Vera Baird QC, representing the the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, warned the scheme would only work if properly funded and questioned the MoJ's decision to hand Â£50m - originally earmarked for the prisons - back to the Treasury. Frances Crook, chief executive of the Howard League for Penal Reform, said ministers deserved ""real praise"" for the change in approach but - like the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners - warned it was ""essential"" that programme was ""properly funded"". Peter Dawson, director of the Prison Reform Trust, said ""thousands"" of women would benefit from the change. He described the strategy as a ""welcome recognition of the futility of short prison sentences"" for women whose offending is often driven by ""unmet mental health needs"". Women serving sentences of less than a year are more likely to re-offend than men with comparable sentences - although they are slightly less likely to re-offend overall. But it's not a straightforward comparison. Women represent just 4.6% of the total prison population of 82,989. And due to the nature of the crimes they commit, which are often less violent, they are much more likely than men to serve short sentences. Last year, 80% of sentences handed to women were a year or less and 25% a month or less, compared with men for whom 66% were sentenced to less than a year and 14% to less than a month. AMinistry of Justice report last year,externalfound that these short-term sentences were ""consistently associated with higher rates of proven re-offending"" than other forms of sentencing - that applies to all prisoners, male and female. Part of this is because these very small sentences often do nothing to rehabilitate the problems which might have led to imprisonment in the first place. Studies have found that, in general, women prisoners are more vulnerable which can add to the cycle of re-offending. They are twice as likely to have mental health needs, more likely to have drug problems and to have experienced domestic abuse. And they are less likely to have a job or home to go back to on release. During Tuesday's appearance at the Commons Justice Select Committee, Mr Stewart said although he wanted to scrap short prison terms, there would be cases - such as violent or sexual crimes - where prison terms were justified. The Penrith and The Border MP said: ""My number one priority is to protect the public and I believe that the best way of protecting the public is to significantly reduce, if not eliminate, the under 12-month prison population because people on community sentences are less likely to reoffend than people who are put in prison. ""I am not going to be reducing the prison population just to save money. ""If somebody ought to be in prison, they ought to be in prison, and then my job is to go to the Treasury and get the money to pay for that prison place."" Government not 'cost-cutting' on prisons.

Beer sales restricted amid CO2 shortageTesco-owned wholesaler Booker restricts beer and cider sales because of the CO2 gas shortage.BusinessComments,"Food wholesaler Booker is rationing beer and cider because of a shortage of CO2 used in carbonated drinks. The Tesco-owned retailer, which is used by bars, restaurants and traders, is capping customers to 10 cases of beer, and five of cider or soft drinks. It is more evidence that a scarcity of CO2 is hurting the food and drink sectors, and comes after Heineken and Coca-Cola faced disruption. Scotland's biggest abattoir has halted operations because of the gas shortage. Quality Pork Limited (QPL), at Brechin, which puts 6,000 pigs a week through its production line, stopped operations on Tuesday afternoon because it ran out of CO2 used to stun the animals before slaughter. QPL plans to send about 1,000 pigs to another plant near Manchester this week, but operators say other abattoirs also face a carbon dioxide shortage. Booker said in a statement: ""Due to the international shortage of CO2, we are experiencing some supply issues on soft drinks and beer. ""We are currently working hard with our suppliers to minimise the impact for our customers and cannot comment further at this stage."" CO2 producers in the UK and mainland Europe have scaled back operations for maintenance, causing a shortage of the gas, whose many uses include improving the shelf life of packaged food and creating dry ice to keep products cool during transport. Why the CO2 shortage really matters Pig welfare at risk as CO2 shortage bites 'Urgent action needed' over CO2 shortage Heineken said its John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel brands had been hit, while Coca-Cola Great Britain said production had been interrupted until fresh CO2 supplies arrived. ""We are currently responding to an industry-wide issue that is impacting the supply of CO2 in the UK. Our focus is on limiting the effect this may have on the availability of our products,"" Coca-Cola said. Small UK bottling firms have also been hit. In the West Midlands, Holden's, which has 80 customers, shut down last Friday until further notice. ""I'm left with people sitting around doing nothing,"" said operations director Mark Hammond. Supermarket Morrisons said some frozen products had been affected by the shortage, and it aimed to resume selling its full online range ""as soon as possible"". The food and drink industry hopes that supplies will begin returning to normal in early July, although trade bodies have complained about a lack of communication from CO2 suppliers. Andy McGowan, chief executive of Scottish Pig Producers, a co-operative that runs the Brechin abattoir in collaboration with QPL, said he did not know when they would get a fresh CO2 delivery from their supplier. ""That's the frustrating thing - they're not telling us anything. We're pretty dismayed. The top priority is animal welfare - we will not have ourselves in a situation where the welfare is suffering,"" he said. Poultry slaughterhouses have already called for priority supplies of dwindling CO2 stocks, saying the current shortage could have a ""potentially huge effect"" on British food production. But that call for the food industry to be given priority has raised fears among drinks firms and smaller businesses that they will be at the back of the queue when gas supplies start to return to normal.

"Tax over-40s for old age care, say MPsThe cross-party groups also say retired people with generous pensions and investments should pay too.Health","A new tax for the over-40s in England should be introduced to help pay for elderly care for all, MPs say. Retired people should also be made to pay it if they have lucrative pensions or investments,two influential House of Commons' committees said.,external The contribution - dubbed a social care premium by MPs - could then be used to ensure everyone who needs support in their old age gets it. It comes as ministers are considering how to reform social care. Currently only the poorest get help towards the cost of care, whether it is provided in people's homes or in a care home. Other people have to pay for it themselves, with one in 10 facing lifetime costs of more than Â£100,000. However, increasingly people are relying on family and friends or go without care, which includes everything from help with washing and dressing to support in taking medications. Polling carried out by Ipsos Mori as part of the work done by the four leading health think-tanks for the BBC to mark the 70th birthday of the NHS showed only 15% of people thought the current system was fair. Although appetite for a new tax was mixed and only one in four people were in favour of using wealth tied up in people's houses. The MPs on the Housing, Communities and Local Government and Health and Social Care committees said changes were long overdue. A combination of the ageing population and a squeeze on council budgets has left the system at breaking point. The cross-party groups believe only a radical solution can tackle the problem. Their report said employers should also contribute to the social care premium and argues it could be topped up by an extra levy on inheritance tax on the wealthiest estates. The MPs believe it could lead to everyone getting care paid for - although those in care homes would still have to contribute towards their accommodation costs. Who gets social care and who pays for it? 10 charts that show whatâs gone wrong with social care How can social care be funded? The committees do not say how much should be levied, acknowledging there would need to be a full review on how much money the system needs. But they said a degree of ""intergenerational fairness"" was needed, given the under-40s as a whole were more likely to be struggling with housing, employment and the cost of living than older generations. They also suggested the money raised could be used to support the care system for younger adults with disabilities, which forms part of the wider social care system. Currently the care provided by councils costs Â£20bn a year - less than a fifth of the NHS budget. Sarah Wollaston, chair of the Health and Social Care Committee, said: ""We can no longer delay finding a fair and sustainable settlement for social care. ""Too many people are being left without the care and support they need and it is time for a decision to be made about how the costs are shared."" The government has said it will be publishing a green paper on social care soon - this is expected in the autumn. A funding rise has recently been agreed for the NHS,which will see its budget increase by Â£20bn a year by 2023. Ministers have said tax rises will be required to fund this, but the MPs said the levy they are proposing could also contribute towards that. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, gave the proposals her backing, saying a ""bold new vision"" was needed. She said while the idea of paying more was a ""bitter pill, it just might be one worth swallowing - but only for a system that we can all rely on.""

Mouldy fatberg draws crowds,"The fatberg, which has begun to ""sweat"" and grow mould, could be preserved in the museum's collection A slice of fatberg put on show at the Museum of London could be preserved for future generations. The lump of congealed fat, oil and wet wipes has begun to ""sweat"" and change colour - and flies have hatched in it. But curator Vyki Sparkes says the fatberg caused a ""marked increase"" in visitors to the museum and they are now thinking of preserving it, when it finishes its public display this week. There has been an ""incredible reaction"" from visitors, she says. It has become one the museum's most popular exhibits, says the curator. The piece of fatberg was taken from a ""monster fatberg"", over 250m (820ft) long and weighing 130 tonnes, which had become something of asewer celebrity, when it was found under the streets of Whitechapel. Fatbergs are an accumulation of materials flushed into the sewers that form huge solid blocks - with the Whitechapel fatberg taking nine weeks to break up with drills. In the first such exhibition of its kind, the Museum of London put this slice of urban history on public view in February, as an example of the challenges of getting rid of waste in the capital. The fatberg when it went on show in February The display ends at the weekend, but Ms Sparkes says they have been taken aback by its appeal, with people making special trips to see the fatberg and boosting visitor numbers.

MPs seek report into HBOS Reading fraud,"Investigators looking into allegations of a cover-up of a Â£1bn pound fraud at HBOS have been told by MPs they must hand over their findings to parliament. Treasury Select Committee chair Nicky Morgan says she found the details disclosed in a leaked report into the alleged cover-up ""deeply troubling"". The report claims HBOS failed to disclose the fraud before being rescued by Lloyds during the financial crisis. Ms Morgan said the committee will seek ""maximum transparency"". The Lloyds Banking Group internal report - known as Project Lord Turnbull - claimed that since 2007, HBOS had a strategy to conceal a fraud at its Reading office where corrupt bankers forced business customers to take on a firm of so-called turnaround consultants. But instead of being helped, customers ended up ruined. Many lost their livelihoods, their marriages and their health. The report surfaced on the internet last week and was later published by Kevin Hollinrake MP, chair of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Fair Business Banking. Read the Project Lord Turnbull report here:Part one,externalandPart two,external In April, Lloyds Banking Group appointed Dame Linda Dobbs to investigate. However, the bank hasn't committed to making Dame Linda's findings public. MPs are insisting they must be turned over to parliament. Ms Morgan said: ""The fraud at HBOS Reading was a shocking crime that destroyed lives and livelihoods. There are numerous investigations into the events, including the Dame Linda Dobbs Review and an investigation by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA)."" She said: ""There are deeply troubling allegations raised in the ""Project Lord Turnbull"" report, which are at the heart of Dame Linda's and the FCA's investigations. The committee will consider the findings of this work when it's completed. Treasury Select Committee chair Nicky Morgan ""In the meantime, we will continue to press for maximum transparency. It is overwhelmingly in the public interest to understand how such a huge criminal fraud was allowed to happen, and why it took so long for it to come to light."" Ex-HBOS banker 'sold his soul for swag' HBOS: A highly unusual fraud case Lloyds said it ""remains determined to get to the bottom of what happened in HBOS Reading and we share the Treasury Committee's desire for transparency"". ""We welcome the statement by Nicky Morgan MP, chair of the Treasury Select Committee. We continue to support the FCA investigation and the separate, independent Dame Linda Dobbs review. ""We will, of course, assist the Treasury Select Committee in its consideration of these matters and will fulfil any requests made to us, including provision of Dame Linda's review findings."" The Project Lord Turnbull report was written in 2013 by a senior manager at Lloyds called Sally Masterton who was helping Thames Valley Police with inquiries into the fraud at HBOS's office in Reading. Mrs Masterton came across new information raising concerns about a cover-up of the fraud. After relaying her concerns to a senior executive, who asked her to write-up her findings, Mrs Masterton produced the report. Its executive summary said: ""Concealment set in motion a course of events that has had and continues to have far-reaching and very serious consequences, extending to the Lloyds TSB takeover. LBG is significantly exposed."" After writing a draft report and submitting its front section on 5 September 2013, Mrs Masterton was put on enforced leave on 23 September 2013. In May 2008, the government knew HBOS was running low on cash but wanted to avoid another nationalisation. HBOS executives proposed to raise money from the bank's shareholders to beef up its finances. However, in the prospectus for that fund-raising, which is meant to disclose all material financial information, there was no mention of a fraud. Mrs Masterton found emails showing HBOS executives didn't want to disclose their exposure to ""the Reading incident"" and discussed keeping it comfortably below a limit of 5% of net income from group continuing operations - or Â£285m. Later that year Lloyds shareholders were asked to approve the purchase of HBOS. Again, the prospectus mentioned nothing about the fraud - nor about Â£40bn pounds in ""stressed assets"" - loans where the bank might not get its money back.

Mouldy fatberg draws crowdsA slice of fatberg could be preserved after attracting visitors to a London museum.Family & Education,"The fatberg, which has begun to ""sweat"" and grow mould, could be preserved in the museum's collection A slice of fatberg put on show at the Museum of London could be preserved for future generations. The lump of congealed fat, oil and wet wipes has begun to ""sweat"" and change colour - and flies have hatched in it. But curator Vyki Sparkes says the fatberg caused a ""marked increase"" in visitors to the museum and they are now thinking of preserving it, when it finishes its public display this week. There has been an ""incredible reaction"" from visitors, she says. It has become one the museum's most popular exhibits, says the curator. The piece of fatberg was taken from a ""monster fatberg"", over 250m (820ft) long and weighing 130 tonnes, which had become something of asewer celebrity, when it was found under the streets of Whitechapel. Fatbergs are an accumulation of materials flushed into the sewers that form huge solid blocks - with the Whitechapel fatberg taking nine weeks to break up with drills. In the first such exhibition of its kind, the Museum of London put this slice of urban history on public view in February, as an example of the challenges of getting rid of waste in the capital. The fatberg when it went on show in February The display ends at the weekend, but Ms Sparkes says they have been taken aback by its appeal, with people making special trips to see the fatberg and boosting visitor numbers. There has been a mixture of fascination and revulsion, she says, not least to see how the item has changed, under its glass case. ""We've never worked on anything like it,"" she says.

Sudan court scraps teen's death sentenceThe death sentence for a woman who killed her husband after he allegedly raped her is overturned.Africa,"Noura Hussein was sentenced to five years in jail An appeals court in Sudan has overturned the death sentence of a woman who killed her husband after he allegedly raped her, her lawyer says. Noura Hussein, 19, was instead sentenced to five years in jail, lawyer Abdelaha Mohamad said. Her mother, Zainab Ahmed, told the BBC she was happy her daughter's life had been spared. International celebrities had backed an online campaign, #JusticeforNoura, to demand Ms Hussein's release. Last month, an Islamic court had sentenced her to death by hanging, following her conviction for the premeditated murder of her husband, Abdulrahman Mohamed Hammad. Ms Hussein said her husband had recruited some of his own cousins who allegedly held her down as he raped her. When he allegedly attempted to do the same the following day she lashed out at him with a knife and stabbed him to death. 'Hoping for a miracle to stop our daughter being hanged' Sudan country profile Child marriages declining, says Unicef Ms Hussein was forced into the marriage at the age of 16. Her husband, who was also her cousin, was 16 years her senior. According to a 2017 report by the UN's children's fund Unicef,one third of Sudanese girls are married before they turn 18,external. In a statement, charityAmnesty International called the decision ""hugely welcome news"",external, but said the five years in prison was a ""disproportionate punishment"". It urged the country to reform its laws on marriage and marital rape ""so that victims are not the ones who are penalised"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""She had got a knife ready to take her own life if he touched her again,"" Zainab Ahmed said. Is a child bride really married every seven seconds? What is it like to be a child bride? After the husband's death, Ms Hussein ran to her family's home to tell them what had happened. Fearing revenge, her father took their whole family to the police station in a bid to protect them - where she was instead arrested. Her jail sentence caused international outrage, with celebrities like Naomi Campbell and Emma Watson tweeting their support for Ms Hussein.

Uber granted short-term London licence,"Uber has been granted a short-term licence to operate in London following a court hearing. Transport for London (TfL) refused to renew the licence when it expired last September, saying the US taxi app was not a ""fit and proper"" operator. Uber has now been awarded a licence but it has been put on probation for 15 months. The company had been seeking a five-year licence when it was refused last year. Following a two-day hearing at Westminster Magistrates' Court, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot said Uber was now considered ""fit and proper"". She ordered the company to pay TfL's legal costs of Â£425,000. Uber changes app following TfL concerns over licensing Uber drops English language test appeal for London drivers Call for women-only Uber Pools for London Uber to introduce limit on drivers' hours London mayor Sadiq Khan said: ""After years of operating poorly in London, Uber has now accepted that TfL's action in refusing to renew their licence was totally justified. Today our stance has been vindicated by the court. ""Uber has been put on probation - their 15 month licence has a clear set of conditions that TfL will thoroughly monitor and enforce."" Tom Elvidge, Uber's UK general manager, said he was pleased with today's decision: ""We will continue to work with TfL to address their concerns and earn their trust, while providing the best possible service for our customers."" One of the areas of concern that TfL highlighted last year was about how Uber reported crime. The company said that it had made ""wholesale"" changes to the business since last September. This includes reporting crimes directly to the police instead of logging criminal complaints with TfL, which caused delays. During this week's hearing, Helen Chapman, the licensing, regulation and charging director at TfL, said that Uber's behaviour over reporting allegations to police was ""very disturbing"". So in the end the humility strategy worked. When Transport for London denied Uber a new licence last September, the company responded aggressively promising to see the regulator in court over its anti-competitive ruling. But by the time this week's hearing started it was in full retreat. For much of the hearing, Chief Magistrate Emma Arbuthnot seemed unconvinced - Uber had shown a gung-ho attitude, determined to grow its business come what may. She wanted reassurance that the people who'd been responsible for statements of questionable honesty in the past had gone and that the culture really had changed. But for the arrival of the ""impressive"" Laurel Powers-Freeling as non-executive chairman she might have been disinclined to grant a new licence. So Uber is now free to continue operating in a very important market - but on probation with Transport for London watching its every move. A taxi-driver who sat through the hearing was unimpressed - ""three strikes and you're in"" he told me. But something has changed. Uber once thought it could go round the world ignoring local rules - now other cities may follow London in attempting to clip its wings. She said: ""I think we have had five years of a very difficult relationship where Uber has felt they haven't required regulation and being operated in the same way as everybody else we regulate."" Ms Chapman said that the changes implemented by Uber ""could, if applied correctly, enhance public safety"". TfL said the way the firm was run had potential public safety and security implications when it decided not to renew its licence to operate in London last year - a decision backed by Mr Khan. In particular, it highlighted Uber's approach to reporting serious criminal offences, how medical certificates are obtained and background checks on drivers. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan backed TfL's decision not to renew Uber licence to operate in the capital last year Among the changes implemented by Uber, drivers can now only use the app in the region in which they hold a private hire licence and their working hours are more tightly regulated. A licensed driver on the app has to now take an uninterrupted six-hour break after 10 hours of taking passengers or travelling to pick them up. The firm also made changes to its app in London to ""make it clearer"" to passengers that its drivers are licensed by TfL and that it accepts ride requests before allocating drivers. It also dropped an appeal against a move that would make all its drivers in the city take English language tests.
