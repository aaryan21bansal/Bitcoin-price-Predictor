Covid deaths set to cut state pension costs,"The amount the government has to spend on state pensions will fall by Â£1.5bn by 2022, partly because of over-65s dying of Covid, forecasts suggest. The government will also receive an extra Â£0.9bn from inheritance tax, partly due to Covid-related deaths. The figures have been published by the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - the government's fiscal watchdog. It said it had ""revised up our assumption for excess deaths this year and next relative to November"". More than 144,000 deaths involving Covid-19 have occurred in the UK since the start of the pandemic, figures published by the UK's statistics agencies show. The majority of coronavirus deaths have been among people aged over 65, many of whom will have been receiving the state pension. The OBR estimates spending on the state pension will fall by Â£600m in 2020-21 and Â£900m in 2021-22 compared with forecasts made before the pandemic. The watchdog said the forecast for lower state pension spending was partly because of the weaker outlook for average earnings growth, which lowers the effect of the yearly triple lock uprating. But it added that excess deaths due to the pandemic have also reduced the number of people receiving pensions. ""With virus-related deaths rising sharply again in recent months, we have revised up the number of excess pensioner-age deaths in 2020-21 from 90,000 in our November forecast to around 100,000 in this one,""the OBR said in its Economic And Fiscal Outlook,external, which is published alongside the Budget. It has increased its forecast because: ""Higher virus-related deaths in the current wave of the virus have outweighed the effect of lockdown reducing deaths from other causes, particularly from influenza and other respiratory diseases"". Meanwhile the Treasury predicted that inheritance tax receipts will increase from Â£5.1bn in 2019-20 to Â£6bn in 2021-22, before falling to Â£5.8bn the following year. The rise in inheritance tax receipts is partly due to the freeze of inheritance tax thresholds until April 2026 announced in the Budget and the growth in the value of estates, but higher Covid-19 deaths will also contribute, the OBR said.

Murder arrest in hospital death investigation,"The arrested man has been suspended by Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust A healthcare professional has been arrested on suspicion of murder and rape as part of an investigation into a patient's death at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, police have said. Lancashire Police said the man was arrested as part of the investigation into Valerie Kneale's death in 2018. Ms Kneale, 75, died from a haemorrhage caused by a ""non-medical related internal injury"", a spokesman said. The arrested man has been suspended by Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust. The force spokesman said the man was being held on suspicion of murder, two offences of rape and one offence of sexual assault. A post-mortem examination on Mrs Kneale, who died on 16 November 2018, was one of a number carried out as part of an investigation launched at the time into allegations of mistreatment and neglect on the hospital's stroke unit. Amurder investigation was launchedwhen the cause of her death was found. The spokesman said investigating officers had received information about other allegations of serious sexual assaults against two patients, as well as the sexual assault of a healthcare professional working on the stroke unit. Aseparate investigation into suspected poisoning of patients on the unit, which has previously seen seven hospital workers arrested, remains in progress. Det Ch Insp Jill Johnston said the force was ""committed"" to thoroughly investigating the ""complicated and sensitive allegations"". She added that those involved were receiving specialist support and were being ""updated throughout the process by trained officers"".

Chancellor announces Â£1bn for 45 areas of England,"Workington is one of 45 towns to receive part of the Â£1bn funding Chancellor Rishi Sunak has announced Â£1bn towards 45 areas of England as part of his Budget. The list of places receiving money from theTowns Fund,externalis dominated by the north west, Yorkshire and the Midlands. The government said the money would help to ""level up"" towns and aid recovery from the Covid-19 pandemic. Shadow work and pensions secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, said there was ""just no logic to where that money goes other than through a political ends"". Mr Sunak told the House of Commons the deals would be ""from Castleford to Clay Cross, Rochdale to Rowley Regis and Whitby to Wolverhampton"". Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Ten ways the Budget will affect you Darlington 'Treasury North' Budget move welcomed Workington in Cumbria will receive Â£23m, which the local council said would support projects including a sports village and innovation centre. Mike Johnson, Conservative deputy leader of Allerdale Borough Council, called it ""absolutely fantastic news"" and said the authority would work to ""bring these projects to life and make the town an even better place to live, work and visit"". Great Yarmouth will receive about Â£20m in funding from the deal Peter Barnes, the BBC's head of political research There are 45 towns named but as some cover multiple constituencies, I've counted 56 constituencies that benefit. Forty-seven are Conservative constituencies - including 14 gained from Labour at the 2019 election plus quite a few more recent Conservative gains, while nine are Labour constituencies. Fifty-three of the constituencies voted ""leave"" at the EU referendum. Three voted ""remain"". In a way that's not very surprising - Labour seats and ""remain"" areas are concentrated in cities - but it's still pretty striking. The plans that the Norfolk seaside town of Great Yarmouth has for its Â£20m include job creation, supporting new homes and ""to tap into and grow a thriving arts and cultural scene"". Chairman of the town deal board, Henry Cator, said the ""ambition [was] to realise a vibrant and inclusive coastal economy"". Meanwhile, Lincolnshire has five towns, as well as Lincoln, in the list to receive funding. Jo Walker, assistant director for growth at City of Lincoln Council, said the Â£19m it was due to receive would ""help make a significant difference in the city as we come out of lockdown and begin our recovery from the pandemic"". But Mr Reynolds, the Labour MP for Stalybridge and Hyde, used the example of Greater Manchester and called decisions for where funds would go ""inexplicable"". He said: ""A government serious about levelling up would look at things like council funding. It would look at the funding of the health service to address health inequalities in post-industrial areas. ""Instead what we seem to get are these pots from the chancellor dependent on giving money to backbench Conservative MPs, and I find that so frustrating and a misuse of public money."" Challenged on the allocations at a Downing Street news briefing, Mr Sunak said that ""if you looked at all the things"" the government was doing it was ""benefitting people in every corner of the country"".

Google promises to drop personalised ad tracking,"Google has promised not to develop any new way of tracking individual users for adverts once it phases out its current method. The tech giant is one of the world's largest advertising sellers and also owns the world's most popular web browser, Chrome. But it is following other browser providers by eliminating third-party tracking cookies. That move is already being looked at by the UK's competition authority. The Competition and Markets Authority said in January that Google's plan to remove the cookies - which would effectively share less information with advertisers -could have a ""significant impact"" on the advertising market and news websites. One group of marketers opposed to the idea claims that Google will gain an advantage by eliminating such cookies, because it has other ways of obtaining personal information from users. Cookies temporarily store small amounts of information about what a user is doing on a website and are an important part of the modern internet. For example, they can ""remember"" things, such as what is in an online shopping basket or whether a user is logged in. But a third-party tracking cookie can be used to ""follow"" a user from site to site, so a website can ""know"" that you were shopping around for a type of product - like clothes or shoes - and advertise those things to you elsewhere. Those are the type that Google is phasing out, following the lead of some major competitor web browsers, including Mozilla Firefox and Apple's Safari, which already block them by default. Some critics had been concerned that Google's plan to stop these cookies would prevent its rivals from building useful catalogues of ad targeting information - but that Google itself might still be able to do so. The company appeared to tackle that idea directly in its new announcement. ""Today, we're making explicit that once third-party cookies are phased out, we will not build [alternative] identifiers to track individuals as they browse across the web, nor will we use them in our products,"" the company said in a blog post. 'Spy pixels in emails have become endemic' UK plans tailored set of rules for each tech giant It said the knock-on effect was that other providers could end up offering ""a level of user identity for ad tracking across the web that we will not"" (although Firefox and Safari already block the offending cookies by default). ""We don't believe these solutions will meet rising consumer expectations for privacy, nor will they stand up to rapidly evolving regulatory restrictions, and therefore aren't a sustainable long-term investment,"" Google said. But that portrayal has been challenged by industry group Marketers for an Open Web, who argue Google will have an unfair advantage. Director James Rosewell said Google hasn't promised to stop personalised marketing, or gathering of data, inside its own products - which would involve changing its product terms and conditions. Regulators still need to ensure competition, through legislation, he said, or ""advertisers will have little choice as to where they spend their money"". And there are fewer privacy advantages for the average user, he argued. ""You have one large trillion-dollar company that effectively, through an unfair contract... tracks you more of the time, the only difference is you're going to be logged in, and part of their walled garden."" ""How does that make people more private, or more secure, versus something that doesn't have directly identifiable information -  their name, their email address - it just uses a random string of characters?"" The shift away from cookies has been prompted by years of tightening regulation and increased consumer awareness. But stopping the use of tracking cookies does not prevent all personalised tracking, as the industry has come up with creative solutions to generate personalised data. So-called ""fingerprinting"", for example, tries to use a huge range of details about your device - the type of phone or computer, browser version, language, IP address, or even what fonts you have installed - to identify the machine. The advertiser might not know the person's name, but it can still ""follow"" that unique fingerprint around the web. Google, which will continue to sell ads, argues that it and other companies need to come up with a solution that ""delivers results"" for advertisers. It now says that people should not have to be tracked invasively in order to ""get the benefits"" of targeted advertising. One way of doing so, Google said in its blog post, was to ""hide individuals within large crowds of people with common interests"", so that an individual person's browsing history would be difficult to figure out.

Councillor suspended for getting 'non-NHS' jab,"The post showed Jamila Azad and another woman receiving injections from a man in medical scrubs and PPE A Labour councillor has had the whip removed by the party after claiming on social media to have received a Covid vaccination from a private doctor. Jamila Azad, who has been elected to both Oxfordshire County Council and Oxford City Council, has since removed the post from her Facebook page. The government said jabs were only allowed to be administered by the NHS. Ms Azad said she did not want to comment. However, her family said she received the vaccine through the NHS. Labour has said she has not been suspended from the party but will effectively sit as an independent councillor while an investigation is carried out. The original Facebook post showed Ms Azad and another woman receiving injections from a man in medical scrubs and PPE, according to theLocal Democracy Reporting Service (LDRS). The comment said it was a ""Private Care Doctor for Covid 19 vaccine"" It added: ""A long wait for NHS waiting list. We had take away from Akber take away."" Ms Azad declined to comment about the issue It is unclear where Ms Azad may have received the vaccine. According to The Department of Health and Social Care, it would be illegal to administer vaccines outside of the NHS. The Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, which would be responsible for any enforcement action, said it was investigating. Lynda Scammell from the agency said: ""Vaccines that are not authorised for use in UK, and if purchased from outside the legitimate NHS supply route, cannot be guaranteed to meet standards of quality, safety and effectiveness."" Councillors Susan Brown and Liz Brighouse, the leaders of the Labour groups at Oxford City Council and Oxfordshire County Council respectively, issued a joint statement in relation to the post. It said: ""Following a recent post on her Facebook account about her Covid-19 vaccination, Councillor Jamila Azad has been suspended by the whips of both the Oxfordshire County Council and Oxford City Council Labour groups, pending further investigation. ""Councillor Azad has now removed the post in question. ""We will be making no further comment on this matter until formal investigations into it have been completed."" Councillor Craig Simmons, who leads the Greens at Oxford City Council, said Ms Azad would have breached the authority's code of conduct if she had paid for the vaccine privately. ""If [she] did indeed bypass the NHS and secure a vaccine from a private medical facility through illegal means then her position is untenable,"" he said. ""Principles such as selflessness, honesty and integrity are core to the code and Councillor Azad's behaviour, should the allegations be proven, would fall far short of what is expected and required of all councillors.""

Tax rises 'needed to stop 'irresponsible' debt,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers. The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected. Official forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of thefurlough schemewill limit job losses. Mr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop ""irresponsible"" debt. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the ""vanguard"" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines. It said this will foster a ""swifter and more sustained"" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022. This would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year. Mr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, includingtax breaks designed to encourage business investment. However, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances. Mr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further Â£4bn a year. Mr Sunak said it would be ""irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked"". Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as ""three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain"". Mr Sanger added: ""Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers."" The government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions. The OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around Â£180bn in the past year. It expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a ""degree of euphoria"", especially among better-off households who ""treat themselves"" when the economy opens up. The main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical ""super-deduction"" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is Â£60bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year. The happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer. The jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in Â£16bn corporation tax and the Â£8bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. So Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of ""Singapore-on-Thames"". Singapore is staying in South East Asia. The timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. However, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained ""considerable"", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was ""betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz"". He added: ""The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax."" Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Ten ways the Budget affects your finances Business rates holiday extended to June Furlough to be extended until September Unemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. However, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year. Government borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of Â£354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures. The size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade. Mr Sunak said: ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" From April, he will alsofreeze the amount of money employees earnbefore paying income tax at Â£12,570 until the middle of the decade. The OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze. The level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at Â£50,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years.

What are freeports and where will they be?,"The Celtic Freeport will be based around the ports of Port Talbot, pictured, and Milford Haven Two sites in Wales have been selected to host a freeport. The Celtic Freeport and Anglesey Freeport are expected to be operational later this year. Eight freeports have already been set up in England, with a further two soon to be operational in Scotland. Freeports aim to create economic activity - like trade, investment and jobs - near shipping ports or airports. Goods imported into freeports are exempt from taxes, called tariffs, that are normally paid to the UK government. It means manufacturers in freeports can import raw materials tariff-free, only paying tariffs on finished products leaving the site for elsewhere in the UK. Or the goods can be re-exported overseas without UK duties being paid. Companies inside the sites will also be able to claim lower property taxes, including on new buildings they buy. Firms also benefit from lower rates of national insurance - a tax paid on employees' wages - if they take on new staff. Are freeports the future? Not all at sea: One of England's freeports is being set up near East Midlands Airport Teessidebecame the first to enter operation, in November 2021. TheThamesfreeport in Essex opened the following month. Sites nearLiverpool,PlymouthandHullhave also been set up, as have shared freeports forFelixstowe and HarwichandSouthampton and Portsmouth. The only freeport in England near an airport is byEast Midlands Airportin Leicestershire. The locations were announced at the March 2021 Budget by Rishi Sunak, when he was chancellor, from 18 areas that applied. Southampton is one of the UK's largest container terminals InScotland,Cromarty Firth and the Forth were chosen from five areas that appliedfor freeport status. The SNP-led Scottish government has called the sites ""green"" freeports, because bids had to include plans for lowering carbon emissions. Rishi Sunak visited the Port of Cromarty Firth after its winning bid was announced However, the SNP's government partners, the Scottish Greens, say there are ""no hard requirements"" to meet the climate targets. It says that, internationally, freeports are linked to ""crime, money laundering, smuggling, and low wages"". The tax and customs benefits available to companies, however, mirror those in place elsewhere in the UK. InWales, bids from Celtic Freeport and Anglesey Freeporthave been given the green light by the UK and Welsh governments. The former covers Port Talbot, in the county of Neath Port Talbot, and Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, and the latter Holyhead, on Anglesey. A third Welsh bid, based around Newport and Cardiff Airport, failed. TheNorthern Irelandgovernment says it is working with the Treasury to identify whether the freeport model can be adopted under itspost-Brexit arrangements. They are not a new idea. The UK set up seven freeports after 1984, including ones at Liverpool and Southampton, but these were phased out in 2012. However, the UK government argued bringing them back could attract investment to areas that ""need it most"". Ministers said they will help with ""levelling up"" - the goal to close the gap between rich and poor areas that was a key Conservative pledge at the 2019 general election. But critics argue freeports don't help the economy overall. The Office for Budgetary Responsibilityhas predicted,externaltax breaks in England's freeports will cost the UK government Â£50m a year. It says historical evidence suggests their ""main effect"" will be to move economic activity from one place to another. What is levelling up and how is it going? Back to the future: Liverpool is set to regain its freeport status after a decade-long hiatus Freeports are allowed in the European Union - withabout 80 sites,externalbased in EU countries. But some Brexit-backing politicians, including Mr Sunak, have previously argued the EU's state aid rules restricted the benefits that can be offered to businesses based inside the sites. Jonathan Branton, a partner at law firm DWF, says the UK does have more flexibility now it doesn't have to follow EU rules. He also points out tax breaks offered to freeport firms would no longer require prior agreement from the European Commission. However, he adds that the Brexit trade deal - agreed by the UK and the EU - still requires subsidies to be justified, otherwise they could be challenged in UK courts. In more extreme circumstances, the EU could respond to UK subsidies by introducing tariffs on some UK goods deemed to be damaging EU trade or investment. And the UK will still be subject to World Trade Organization rules - which say you can't introduce subsidies linked just to export performance.

"Economic recovery will take a long time, Sunak warns","After earlier setting out his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak tells a No 10 briefing ""our plan is working"" But he warns ""it is going to take us a long time to fully recover from the damage coronavirus has done to our economy"" Sunak defends his plan to increase corporation tax to 25% from 2023, saying it is ""still an internationally competitive rate"" A million more people will also start paying income tax - Sunak promises taxes will be spent on funding ""strong public services"" The furlough scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages - will be extended until the end of September Universal credit top-up of Â£20 per week will continue for a further six months But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer calls it a Budget that ""papers over the cracks"" He says there is no plan to ""fix"" social care or the NHS or to address inequality Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage of the Budget here. Our reporters today were: Justin Parkinson, Kate Whannel, Richard Morris, Dearbail Jordan, Lucy Webster, Sinead Wilson, Alice Evans, Victoria Lindrea, Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald. Thanks for following along with us. Goodnight. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the Budget gives a lot on emergency pandemic support for the economy, but takes in the form of tax changes. This video can not be played Budget 2021: BBC political editor on Sunakâs economics Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Million, billion trillionâ¦ When the numbers get bigger and bigger, the words can start
to sound the same. But a billion is a thousand times bigger than a million. And
a trillion is a thousand times bigger than a billion. To put that into perspective, if a million seconds adds up
to 11 and a half days, a billion seconds add up to 33 and a half years - and a
trillion seconds? More than 33,000 years. An awful lot, in other words. But in a modern economy we
spend an awful lot. If you take the total money spent on healthcare in the UK,
it would, (according to the Office for National Statistics), take less than five
years to spend Â£1tn. Alternatively Â£1tn could buy you more than four million
houses at the average UK property price, or fund more than 500 NASA missions to
Mars. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take. Business will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level. The deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice. ""Honest Rishi Sunak"", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid-19 over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes. Boxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers. Despite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid-19, public spending overall is still set to contract. Rishi Sunak has done much more than extend the emergency lifelines - the modern-day Conservatives will raise taxes to a proportion of national income not seen since the 1960s. Even before the pandemic, the prime minister had little appetite to pare back public spending. But the past year has ended any Tory dreams of a lean and low tax economy. And with any flicker to the cost of borrowing, or an even more prolonged pandemic, what is already a grim picture for the country's books may become tougher still. Here's a summary of the key Budget announcements:  You can read full details of all the announcements here. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter man on phone The Budget is packed with policies that will affect your finances. Here are just some of the ways: Paying the wages of those on furlough:The furlough scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - has been extended until September. Jabs, then jobs:The extra Â£1.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. Support for the self-employed:Support for the self-employed comes in the form of grants. From next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to Â£7,500 in total. But changes to how the scheme works are coming. Finding the deposit for a mortgage:The chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan. Read the full guide to find out more. One of the biggest headlines from the Budget is the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of September. The chancellor confirmed the Job Retention Support scheme will continue as the UK goes through the final stages of the pandemic. Almost five million people are still on furlough, which covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they can't work, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per month. As the economy opens up over the summer, employers who use the scheme will have to start paying into it. But workers will still receive up to 80% of their pay packet for hours they can't work. Find out more about who is eligible for furlough. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank, believes the chancellor is taking a big risk in lifting the UK's corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, starting in 2023. âWhat we can be sure of is that
Rishi Sunak has spent big again, extending some support right through 2021 at a
cost of an additional Â£60bn or more,"" he says. ""As a result borrowing is now
forecast to again be above 10% of national income in the coming financial year. But he adds: ""Whether the big fiscal tightening planned for subsequent years will actually
happen is less certain. It continues to depend on spending being lower than
planned prior to the pandemic. And it also depends on a large increase in
corporation tax actually being implemented without additional measures to at
least ease its long-run impact,"" Mr Johnson says. ""Make no mistake, this proposed increase in the
main rate of corporation tax is a big reversal of decades of policy direction
and a significant risk. For all the rhetoric about it leaving the headline rate
here below that in other G7 countries, oureffectivetax rate will
be relatively high."" The chancellor announced that two further grants will be offered to self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. An estimated 600,000 newly self-employed workers will be able to claim the support for the first time, using their 2019-2020 tax return. They missed out on the earlier income support grants because they couldn't prove their self-employed status. Those most affected by the pandemic will be able to claim up to 80% of their average trading profits, subject to a maximum cap. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. Find out more about what help is available to the self-employed Laura Mvula performs at Gorilla in Manchester - a venue that narrowly avoided closure in 2020 Entertainment and arts bodies have broadly welcomed the Budget announcements, while also demanding greater support and clarity. The chancellor announced Â£390m to help arts venues in England, including theatres, museums and galleries, reopen. The lion's share (Â£300m) will go into the pre-existing Culture Recovery Fund, and Â£90m will go to helping national museums and cultural bodies. Elsewhere, Mr Sunak announced that the Film and TV Production Restart Scheme will be extended for six months until 31 December 2021. Reacting to the Budget, Music Venue Trust boss Mark Davyd welcomed the extensions to furlough, support for the self-empolyed and the VAT cut on ticket sales. ""These measures are supportive of the next steps in the campaign to reopen every venue safely"" he said. Greg Parmley, CEO of LIVE, the UK's official industry body for live music, said he ""warmly welcomed"" the additional financial support, which he described as ""due recognition from [the] government that the live music industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic"". ""The extension of the reduced 5% rate of VAT, in particular, will provide significant support to businesses who have had their revenue decimated over the past year,"" he said. Read more here Reality Check There were several references to ""levelling up"" in Wednesday's Budget. It was also one of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most-used terms of the 2019 election campaign. The idea is that people and communities that feel they have been left behind get a chance to catch up. So far, what it means in practice and if there's any way its success can be judged, is a bit vague. Many organisations have put forward suggestions of things that need to be addressed such as employment rates, pay, health and formal education, but there seems to be fairly broad agreement that one of the central issues is the differences in productivity between regions - that's the amount of value created per hour worked.

Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Rishi Sunakâs
big day is in some ways a big gamble - a gamble that the swift roll-out of
jabs will underpin the recovery and will do some of the heavy lifting in
repairing public finances by boosting tax receipts. But once the various
existing support packages are tailed off in the coming months, there are two
key unanswered questions. Firstly, where will the support for job creation come from? And where, asks the governmentâs own fiscal watchdog, is the provision for public
services going forward, in particular for health? From track and tracing, to dealing with possible new mutant strains, the challenge of dealing with the coronavirus doesnât just go away. The chancellorâs plans have him switching
from giving to taking mode in the next few years, but the reality may be quite
different. Rishi Sunak's media briefing came after his Budget speech today. He began by saying he wants to be ""honest about the problems we face"", and said and it will take ""a long time"" to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. He repeatedthe headline policies from the Budget:  In response to questions from journalists, Mr Sunak said: Ben Riley-Smith from the Daily Telegraph asks if the government will rule out rises in capital gains tax, and if the UK economy should open earlier if vaccination data says it's safe to do so. Rishi Sunak says that he cannot comment on fiscal policy beyond what's been announced today in the budget. He says he wants the roadmap to reopening the country to be ""cautious but irreversible"", so once the economy is reopened, he doesn't want to have to do another lockdown. And that, is the last question of the press conference. Graham Hiscott of the Daily Mirror asks if the chancellor will extend support schemes if the timetable for easing restrictions slips. He also asks why there is no pay rise for many public sector workers. Rishi Sunak says the government purposely extended support schemes beyond the end of the current timetable to allow for any changes to the roadmap. On public sector pay, he says wages are falling in the private sector but not in the public sector and that ""I thought, for reasons of fairness, it was reasonable to take a more targeted approach to public sector pay"". He says people in the NHS will receive a pay rise and that those in the public sector, who earn less than Â£24,000, will see their pay will go up by 1%. George Parker from the FT asks about the levelling up programme. He notes that 40 of the 45 areas that will get support are represented by Tory MPs, including the Chancellor's own constituency. Was fair criteria used he asks or did politics influence the decision? Rishi Sunak says there is an index of economic need and it is transparently published. He stresses that no area is excluded from bidding - the areas named today are those that have been identified as need extra support. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The governmentâs
spending watchdog believes that, between last March and the end of this month,
the state will have borrowed a Â£355bn - a peacetime record. Even as we move
towards recovery next year, borrowing will remain very high. Money is still
required to fight coronavirus, and to supporting people and businesses through
the economic shutdown. And that shutdown
doesnât do much for the tax take. If the economy
does grow as the chancellor hopes then borrowing should then return pretty steadily to more normal levels. But, as in so
many other things, the future is very uncertain and depends on how quickly we
escape the pandemic. The temporary Â£20 a week universal credit increase has been
extended until the end of September, affecting more than 5.5 million
households. The boost was introduced in April 2020, to help struggling
families during the pandemic. It was set to finish at the end of this month. Working tax credit claimants will also get an equivalent
increase for the next six months, through a one-off payment of Â£500. Find out more about what the
changes mean for youhere. Philip Aldrick from The Times asks what gives Mr Sunak confidence that tax rises in 2023 will not ""choke off recovery"". Rishi Sunak says it is ""not right"" to compare the past ten years of public finances with what's happening now during a pandemic. He says the government wants businesses to invest, which is why the corporation tax increase only comes in two years, after the Office for Budget Responsibility expects the effects of coronavirus to have left the UK economy. He says it is important to remember that corporation tax is a tax on profits, which means only successful companies will make significant contributions from it. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sunak vows to protect jobs but tax hikes loom,"This video can not be played The chancellor sets out a three-part plan to âprotect the jobs and livelihoods of the British peopleâ. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled more support for workers and businesses struggling with lockdown in his first Budget since the pandemic was declared. The furlough scheme will be extended to September - along with higher universal credit payments. Buttaxes on large company profits will rise in 2023and a million more people will start paying income tax. It will take the UK's tax burden to its highest level since the 1960s, said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget measures to salvage the UK's Covid-ravaged economy were ""nowhere near ambitious enough"". Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Sunak hails 'swifter and more sustained' recovery Million more set to pay income tax by 2026 In his Budget speech, Mr Sunak said unemployment will be lower - and growth higher - than previously thought as the UK emerges from lockdown later this year, citing forecasts from the OBR watchdog. But he warned that repairing the long-term economic damage ""will take time"", with the economy in five years' time predicted to be 3% smaller than it would have been without the pandemic. Despite the Â£280bn of support already committed to protecting the economy, the harm done by coronavirus had been ""acute"", he told MPs. ""Our economy has shrunk by 10% - the largest fall in over 300 years. Our borrowing is the highest it has been outside of wartime. ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" The headline rate of corporation tax will go up from 19% to 25% from 2023, although smaller firms will be exempt. And the freeze on income tax thresholds is expected tobring 1.3 million more people into paying income tax- and a million more into paying at the higher rate. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Budget is set to raise an extra Â£29bn by 2025-26, which was ""big by recent standards"". And it added that the UK's tax ""burden"" is set to rise to its ""highest sustained level"" ever. IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""Mr Sunak made much of his desire to be honest and to level with the British people. ""The fact that he felt constrained to raise taxes by hitting companies and through freezing allowances, rather than through more explicit rises in people's taxes, suggests there are limits to how far he wants to level with us, as he attempts to raise the overall tax burden to its highest sustained level in history."" There has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take. Business will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level. The deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice.

Boxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers. Despite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid, public spending overall is still set to contract. The chancellor extended the furlough scheme to September, paying up to 80% of people's wages - and announced further grants for self-employed people, with the scheme widened to include 600,000 who were not previously entitled, including many newly self-employed people. He alsoextended the Â£20-a-week top-up to universal creditfor six months. Other Budget measures include: Anincrease the limit on contactless paymentsfrom Â£45 to Â£100 Eight 'freeports' in England, with lower taxes and ""cheaper customs"" Business rates holiday in England extended by three months Â£100m to set up a taskforce to tackle fraud in government Covid schemes More money for vaccine roll-out Â£5bn to helpHigh Street firms reopen Return of 95% mortgagesbacked by the government scheme to aid first-time buyers Â£408m for museums, theatres and galleries in England to help them reopen when Covid restrictions ease Â£150m to help communities take over pubs in danger of closing All alcohol duties will be frozen, which Mr Sunak said would help pubs and restaurants recover, and there will be no increase in fuel duty. But duty on cigarettes will go up by 2%, plus inflation. The reduced 5% VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector will be extended for six months to 30 September, and will not return to the full standard rate of 20% until April next year. Mr Sunak also announced that 750 civil service jobs at the Treasury will be transferred to Darlington, in the north-east of England, and there will be more than Â£1bn shared out among 45 struggling towns in England. This video can not be played Budget 2021: Who is Rishi Sunak and what does he believe? At a post-Budget Downing Street press conference, Mr Sunak vowed to protect people and businesses ""well beyond the end of lockdown"", and to build a ""fairer and more just"" country in the memory of those who have lost their lives to coronavirus. It comes as thelatest government figures on Wednesday showed,externala further 315 people had died with coronavirus in the UK within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis, and there were another 6,385 confirmed cases. Mr Sunak hit back at critics who say the business tax hike will choke off recovery, saying it will ""still be the lowest out of the G7 economies,"" including the US, France and Germany. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget did nothing to ""fix the NHS and social care"", reduce inequality or create more affordable homes. ""The scale of what the chancellor announced today is nowhere near ambitious enough,"" he told MPs, and he claimed Mr Sunak was ""itching to get back to his free-market principles and to pull away support as quickly as he can"". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said furlough should be in kept place ""as long as businesses and devolved governments need it"". ""This Budget is carefully laying the ground for more Tory austerity, a decade more of Conservative cuts,"" he told MPs. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine warned that the universal credit top-up will end at the same time as furlough, meaning people could lose their jobs and not receive the extra help they will need. Plaid Cymru said it was a ""Budget of half measures and quick fixes"", and not making the universal credit uplift permanent would ""lead to 26,000 families in Wales not being able to afford essentials in six months' time"".

"Sunak hails 'swifter, more sustained' recovery","Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers. The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected. Official forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of thefurlough schemewill limit job losses. Mr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop ""irresponsible"" debt. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the ""vanguard"" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines. It said this will foster a ""swifter and more sustained"" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022. This would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year. Mr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, includingtax breaks designed to encourage business investment. However, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances. Mr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further Â£4bn a year. Mr Sunak said it would be ""irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked"". Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as ""three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain"". Mr Sanger added: ""Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers."" The government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions. The OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around Â£180bn in the past year. It expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a ""degree of euphoria"", especially among better-off households who ""treat themselves"" when the economy opens up. The main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical ""super-deduction"" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is Â£60bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year. The happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer. The jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in Â£16bn corporation tax and the Â£8bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. So Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of ""Singapore-on-Thames"". Singapore is staying in South East Asia. The timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. However, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained ""considerable"", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was ""betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz"". He added: ""The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax."" Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Ten ways the Budget affects your finances Business rates holiday extended to June Furlough to be extended until September Unemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. However, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year. Government borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of Â£354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures. The size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade. Mr Sunak said: ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" From April, he will alsofreeze the amount of money employees earnbefore paying income tax at Â£12,570 until the middle of the decade. The OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze. The level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at Â£50,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years.

Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled the contents of his Budget in the House of Commons.

Relief extended for businesses on rates and VAT,"Pubs are among business allowed a loan of up to Â£18,000, as they are among last to open Pubs, restaurants and other non-essential retail businesses have been given further help in the Budget. Measures include extending the VAT cut for the hospitality sector, seen during the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. Gyms and other non-essential retail premises in England will also see the year-long business rates holiday extended for another three months. Hospitality businesses including restaurants and pubs have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, exempted them from paying business rates last year, but that tax holiday was due to end this month. They will now be exempt until the end of June. After that they will be discounted to one third of the normal charge for the rest of the financial year, up to a maximum of Â£2m for closed businesses. The chancellor called it ""a Â£6bn tax cut for businesses"". Major supermarkets and other retailers which had been allowed to stay open as essential businesses said they would repay the rates relief they received last year, giving back Â£2bn of the estimated Â£11bn it cost the Treasury. Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's said they would do it again this time. Sainsbury's said in a statement: ""Despite significant ongoing costs associated with protecting colleagues and customers from Covid-19, we expect that the vast majority of Sainsbury's stores will remain open this year. ""We will therefore forgo the business rates relief on all Sainsbury's stores again this year. We will also forgo the business rates relief on all standalone Argos stores once they reopen."" The VAT discount to 5% for food and drink sold in pubs and restaurants will last until the end of September. After that it will increase to 12.5% - which is still below the normal rate of 20% - for a further  six months. Mr Sunak pointed out there were 150,000 hospitality and tourism businesses employing 2.4 million people. Other measures announced in the Budget include a business restart scheme, which allocates a total of Â£5bn in funding for small business grants of up to Â£18,000. Under the scheme, non-essential retail businesses will receive grants of up to Â£6,000 per premises, as they will be allowed to open first. Hospitality and leisure businesses, including personal care and gyms, will get grants of up to Â£18,000, because they will stay closed for longer and will be more affected by restrictions. Mr Sunak said some businesses would still need loans despite the restart grants. He said he was introducing a new recovery loan scheme which would allow businesses of any size to apply for loans from Â£25,000 up to Â£10m. Christian Mole of business services group EY said the industry still faced serious challenges, even once it opened up fully in May: ""Outdoor services will only be profitable for a small portion of the sector. ""Even after the scheduled 17 May full reopening, social distancing measures are likely to continue to limit operating capacity in restaurants and pubs. Across all hospitality, many operators also face significantly increased debts and deferred rental obligations. ""Hospitality businesses will need ongoing government support as long as these challenges remain in place, so it is encouraging to see the sector-specific support being offered.""

Million more set to pay income tax by 2026,"More than one million people are set to start paying income tax in the next five years, official forecasts say, due to a move announced in the Budget. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said that the threshold at which the tax starts being paid will be frozen until 2026 after a rise this April. It means getting a pay rise could pull people into a higher rate of tax. Commentators have called it an increase in an individual's tax burden ""by stealth"". Ten ways the Budget will affect you Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance The chancellor said that he wanted to be honest with the British public about the way in which money would be raised to pay for support schemes during the coronavirus pandemic. At present, people start paying 20% income tax when they earn Â£12,500 a year, known as the personal allowance. The first Â£12,500 they earn is tax-free with the 20% rate only being charged on everything they earn above that amount, up to the higher rate tax threshold. The starting point for paying the higher 40% rate is Â£50,001. These thresholds will go up to Â£12,570 and Â£50,270 in April, but will then be frozen until April 2026. The Office for Budget Responsibility, the government's official but independent forecaster, said this policy would bring 1.3 million more people into paying income tax and one million more into paying at the higher rate. This is known as fiscal drag. While the Scottish government has the ability to vary tax rates and bands under its devolved powers, the tax free personal allowance threshold is set by the chancellor and applies to the whole of the UK. The OBR said that, when taking the rise in the cost of living into account, it would effectively bring the personal allowance in 2025-2026 to the level it was in 2014-2015. The Budget documents show this hits middle to higher income earners the hardest. The policy will bring an extra Â£8bn a year into the Treasury coffers, compared with what it would have received if it had raised the thresholds in line with inflation. The Conservative manifesto pledged that the main rates of income tax, national insurance and VAT would not rise, and this does not break that pledge. ""The next few years will see the burden of tax on individuals rise quietly by stealth,"" said Jason Hollands, from financial advisers Tilney. ""But given pre-Budget fearsÂ of a potential Viking-like raid on personal wealth, middle-class BritonsÂ - particularly those with savings and investments - can sleep a little easier tonight."" Becky O'Connor, head of pensions and savings at Interactive Investor, said: ""Freezing allowances is a back-handed way of raising taxes, as wage inflation and asset price inflation increase the number of people pushed over the thresholds at which they have to pay more tax. ""Frozen allowances and thresholds have a habit of remaining fixed for many years, dragging more people into tax charges over time.""

EU says UK grace period extension breaches law,"Getting goods across the Irish Sea border involves a range of new processes, checks and documentation The EU says a UK move to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks will be a breach of international law. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures. The grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied. The first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October. European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the move amounted to ""a violation of the relevant substantive provisions"" of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, known as the NI Protocol. He said the EU would respond in accordance with the ""legal means"" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal. Following a call on Wednesday evening between Mr Å efÄoviÄ and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said ""official-level notification"" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week. The spokesperson said Lord Frost underlined the extension was needed for ""operational reasons"" and such measures were ""well precedented in other international trade arrangements, and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith"". NI Secretary Brandon Lewis announced the extension on Wednesday afternoon Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the UK government's move clearly undermined its commitment to the implementation of the protocol and described the unilateral decision as ""deeply unhelpful"". He said he had made his regret over the decision clear to Lord Frost and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. The grace period affects supermarkets and other retailers, which face having to provide export health certificates for all shipments of animal products. ""For supermarkets and their suppliers, as part of the operational plan the UK committed to at the UK-EU Joint Committee on 24 February, the current Scheme for Temporary Agri-food Movements to Northern Ireland will continue until 1 October,"" said a government statement. ""Certification requirements will then be introduced in phases alongside the roll out of the Digital Assistance Scheme."" It is understood the government is describing this to the EU as an ""operational easement"", rather than a formal extension of the grace period. It is using the example of how the Irish government temporarily relaxed safety and security declarations on products arriving from GB in January. The Northern Ireland Protocolis part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union. But anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the move and said the EU had refused to deal with an issue that ""would have caused a huge amount of problems for us at our ports"". The DUP leader added that it showed the UK government ""can go further, so we need to see permanent solutions"". However, her deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, described the government's decision as ""another unilateral attempt to override what has been agreed"". ""What everyone should be focused on is achieving agreement to find solutions to the issues that are outstanding, but it's very clear the protocol must be made to work."" Simon Hoare, the chairman of Westminster's NI Affairs Select Committee, tweeted that the case for extending the grace periods was ""compelling"" but that the unilateral move struck him as an ""approach most likely to have negative/unhelpful consequences"". The Labour Party's shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the Prime Minister should ""show some responsibility and find the lasting solutions with the EU that are the only way to give businesses the certainty they are crying out for"". MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has previously said the introduction of the NI Protocol has been ""administratively extremely challenging"" In Northern Ireland, reaction has been mixed, with Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry welcoming the extension of grace periods but warning of ""long-term detrimental consequences for Northern Ireland"" over the government's unilateral action. Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken, meanwhile, described the protocol as ""unsalvageable"" and criticised the EU and Irish government for reacting in a ""dramatic, over-the-top manner to what are minimal changes"". ""Simon Coveney and his EU counterparts are showing gravity-defying levels of arrogance and hypocrisy, given their past actions,"" he added. The government said further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from GB to NI. It is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations. Guidance will also be set out in regard to the issue of soil attached to the movement of plants, seeds, bulbs, vegetables and agricultural machinery. Under the terms of the Brexit deal, soil from Great Britain is not permitted to enter Northern Ireland as it conflicts with EU plant regulations. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Palace 'very concerned' by Meghan bullying claims,"Buckingham Palace says it will investigate claims the Duchess of Sussex bullied royal staff, adding that it was ""very concerned"" by the allegations. It follows a report in the Times newspaper that Meghan faced a bullying complaint when she was a working royal. Her spokesman said the duchess was ""saddened"" by the ""latest attack on her character"". The palace said it ""does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment"". It will speak to the members of staff involved ""to see if lessons can be learned"", a statement added. According to the story in the Times,,externalthe complaint was made in October 2018, while the duke and duchess were living at Kensington Palace. A leaked email sent from a staff member, which was published by the newspaper, alleges that Meghan drove two personal assistants out of the household. The report claims she undermined the confidence of a third member of staff. In a statement, Buckingham Palace - which is responsible for the hiring of royal staff - said: ""We are clearly very concerned about allegations in the Times following claims made by former staff of the Duke and Duchess of Sussex. ""Accordingly, our HR team will look into the circumstances outlined in the article. Members of staff involved at the time, including those who have left the Household, will be invited to participate to see if lessons can be learned. ""The Royal Household has had a Dignity at Work policy in place for a number of years and does not and will not tolerate bullying or harassment in the workplace."" The Meghan and Harry story Royal Family tree and line of succession Why Meghan gets compared to Princess Diana An earlier statement issued by Meghan's spokesman said: ""The duchess is saddened by this latest attack on her character, particularly as someone who has been the target of bullying herself and is deeply committed to supporting those who have experienced pain and trauma. ""She is determined to continue her work building compassion around the world and will keep striving to set an example for doing what is right and doing what is good."" On one thing everyone is agreed: the interview that Meghan has given Oprah Winfrey - that will be broadcast in the US on Sunday - is concentrating minds. Palace staff have for some time itched to get their side of the story out; some feel that they went out of their way to help Meghan after the wedding only to be treated rudely or later dismissed as uncaring or worse. Team Sussex were braced for the story. ""It's a fairly extensive list of things that has been pulled together,"" one source told the BBC. ""The timing is not coincidental."" Meghan's side do not dispute the existence or content of the email; and it is pretty strong stuff. It makes flesh the rumours and allegations that swirled around the duchess when a number of staff left some months after the 2018 wedding. The duchess' people have pushed back. The people named in the leaked email knew nothing about the complaint, they say, and it never turned into a formal issue. But now it has; the inquiry announced tonight is a clear indication that Buckingham Palace is treating the matter seriously. Whatever the truth, it ratchets up the tension - and publicity - around the interview to come in just a few days' time. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. Harry has previously said the decision to step back was in order to protect himself and his family from the press. Last month,it was announced the couple would not returnas working members of the Royal Family. Oprah Winfrey's interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will air in the US on Sunday It comes ahead of Meghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, which will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March. In the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March. CBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about ""stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood"" and ""how she is handling life under intense public pressure"". She will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans.

Murder arrest in hospital death investigationA healthcare worker is held on suspicion of murder as part of a probe into a patient's death.Lancashire,"The arrested man has been suspended by Blackpool Teaching Hospitals NHS Trust A healthcare professional has been arrested on suspicion of murder and rape as part of an investigation into a patient's death at Blackpool Victoria Hospital, police have said. Lancashire Police said the man was arrested as part of the investigation into Valerie Kneale's death in 2018.

Amurder investigation was launchedwhen the cause of her death was found. The spokesman said investigating officers had received information about other allegations of serious sexual assaults against two patients, as well as the sexual assault of a healthcare professional working on the stroke unit. Aseparate investigation into suspected poisoning of patients on the unit, which has previously seen seven hospital workers arrested, remains in progress.

But now it has; the inquiry announced tonight is a clear indication that Buckingham Palace is treating the matter seriously. Whatever the truth, it ratchets up the tension - and publicity - around the interview to come in just a few days' time. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex quit their roles as senior working royals in March 2020, and now live in California. Harry has previously said the decision to step back was in order to protect himself and his family from the press. Last month,it was announced the couple would not returnas working members of the Royal Family. Oprah Winfrey's interview with the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will air in the US on Sunday It comes ahead of Meghan and Prince Harry's TV interview with Oprah Winfrey, which will be aired on CBS in the US on the evening of Sunday 7 March. In the UK, the interview will be screened on ITV at 21:00 GMT on Monday 8 March. CBS has said Meghan will be interviewed about ""stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood"" and ""how she is handling life under intense public pressure"". She will then be joined by Prince Harry, and the couple will speak about their move to the US last year and their future plans.

EU says UK grace period extension breaches lawThe grace periods mean checks on goods going from GB to NI are not yet fully implemented.Northern IrelandComments,"Getting goods across the Irish Sea border involves a range of new processes, checks and documentation The EU says a UK move to unilaterally extend grace periods for Irish Sea border checks will be a breach of international law. Northern Ireland has remained a part of the EU's single market for goods so products arriving from GB undergo EU import procedures. The grace periods mean procedures and checks are not yet fully applied. The first of these periods will expire at the end of March, but the UK has said it will be extended until October. European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ said the move amounted to ""a violation of the relevant substantive provisions"" of the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland, known as the NI Protocol. He said the EU would respond in accordance with the ""legal means"" established by the protocol and the wider Brexit deal. Following a call on Wednesday evening between Mr Å efÄoviÄ and Lord Frost, the Cabinet Office minister with responsibility for EU relations, a UK government spokesperson said ""official-level notification"" of the move was made to the commission earlier this week. The spokesperson said Lord Frost underlined the extension was needed for ""operational reasons"" and such measures were ""well precedented in other international trade arrangements, and that they were entirely consistent with our intention to discharge our obligations under the Protocol in good faith"". NI Secretary Brandon Lewis announced the extension on Wednesday afternoon Irish Foreign Affairs Minister Simon Coveney said the UK government's move clearly undermined its commitment to the implementation of the protocol and described the unilateral decision as ""deeply unhelpful"". He said he had made his regret over the decision clear to Lord Frost and Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. The grace period affects supermarkets and other retailers, which face having to provide export health certificates for all shipments of animal products. ""For supermarkets and their suppliers, as part of the operational plan the UK committed to at the UK-EU Joint Committee on 24 February, the current Scheme for Temporary Agri-food Movements to Northern Ireland will continue until 1 October,"" said a government statement. ""Certification requirements will then be introduced in phases alongside the roll out of the Digital Assistance Scheme."" It is understood the government is describing this to the EU as an ""operational easement"", rather than a formal extension of the grace period. It is using the example of how the Irish government temporarily relaxed safety and security declarations on products arriving from GB in January. The Northern Ireland Protocolis part of the Brexit deal which prevents a hardening of the land border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It does that by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. That has created a new trade border with Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Unionists oppose the protocol, arguing that it has damaged internal trade from GB to NI and poses a risk to the future of the UK union. But anti-Brexit parties in NI say that it must be implemented in full, and that issues should be worked out through joint UK-EU processes. Northern Ireland's First Minister Arlene Foster welcomed the move and said the EU had refused to deal with an issue that ""would have caused a huge amount of problems for us at our ports"". The DUP leader added that it showed the UK government ""can go further, so we need to see permanent solutions"". However, her deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, described the government's decision as ""another unilateral attempt to override what has been agreed"". ""What everyone should be focused on is achieving agreement to find solutions to the issues that are outstanding, but it's very clear the protocol must be made to work."" Simon Hoare, the chairman of Westminster's NI Affairs Select Committee, tweeted that the case for extending the grace periods was ""compelling"" but that the unilateral move struck him as an ""approach most likely to have negative/unhelpful consequences"". The Labour Party's shadow NI Secretary Louise Haigh said the Prime Minister should ""show some responsibility and find the lasting solutions with the EU that are the only way to give businesses the certainty they are crying out for"". MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ has previously said the introduction of the NI Protocol has been ""administratively extremely challenging"" In Northern Ireland, reaction has been mixed, with Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry welcoming the extension of grace periods but warning of ""long-term detrimental consequences for Northern Ireland"" over the government's unilateral action. Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken, meanwhile, described the protocol as ""unsalvageable"" and criticised the EU and Irish government for reacting in a ""dramatic, over-the-top manner to what are minimal changes"". ""Simon Coveney and his EU counterparts are showing gravity-defying levels of arrogance and hypocrisy, given their past actions,"" he added. The government said further guidance will be provided later this week on a grace period for parcel movements from GB to NI. It is due to to end on 1 April, meaning all parcels would need customs declarations. Guidance will also be set out in regard to the issue of soil attached to the movement of plants, seeds, bulbs, vegetables and agricultural machinery. Under the terms of the Brexit deal, soil from Great Britain is not permitted to enter Northern Ireland as it conflicts with EU plant regulations. What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

What is 'levelling up' and how is it going?,"MPs have criticised levelling up schemes after finding that only 10% of the promised funding has been spent so far. The Public Accounts Committee also criticised a lack of transparency in how the money was allocated. Levelling up is a government policy to reduce inequality based on where people live. It was a big slogan for the Conservatives in the 2019 election and was inthe party's manifesto,external. Rishi Sunak says its aim is ""to create jobs, drive growth, and make sure that people feel enormous pride in the places that they call home"". Only 10% of flagship levelling up funds spent, say MPs The Levelling Up Fund awarded Â£1.7bn to projects in October 2021, Â£2.1bn in January 2023 and another Â£1.1bn in November 2023. The North West of England received the most money overall, followed by Yorkshire and the Humber. Questions were raised when the South East of England was awarded the second largest amount of funding in the second round. The government highlighted funding per head of the population. If you look at the funding awards this way, Wales comes out on top and the North of England does better than the South of England. The Public Accounts Committee said that only Â£3.7bn had been allocated to local authorities by December 2023, while councils had been able to spend only Â£1.24bn as of Sept 2023. It said the first round of levelling up funding was awarded to ""shovel-ready"" projects that were due to be completed in March, but 60 out of 71 (85%) have had to extend their deadlines, with further delays in other schemes said to be ""likely"". Levelling up funding process is broken, says Conservative mayor Andy Street Levelling up: Cost of living could deepen inequality, says Gove Areas were invited to bid for investment in transport, cultural, town centre and regeneration projects. Local MPs were allowed to give their formal support to two bids before the proposals were judged by officials from the Treasury, Levelling Up Department and Department for Transport. Assessing how fair this is, is not straightforward. Some projects - such as transport - may spread across several constituencies, represented by MPs from different parties. For the projects that can be allocated to a single party, we can say that more money was allocated to Conservative constituencies than to Labour ones. But there are significantly more Conservative ones. BBC analysis of the second round of funding found: 52% of successful bids that can be allocated to a party were in Conservative constituencies (the Conservatives won 56% of seats in the Commons in 2019) 24% of them were in Labour areas (Labour won 31% of the seats in 2019) Projects in Tory constituencies were awarded a total of Â£1.21bn, compared with Â£471m in Labour ones. There was one successful bid in a Lib Dem constituency, seven for the SNP, five for the DUP, three for Sinn Fein, and one each for the Alliance Party and Plaid Cymru. Areas have also been competing for money under the government's Towns Fund. In that contest, of the 56 constituencies that won, 47 had Conservative MPs. A zoo, a park and a pool - who got first round levelling up cash? Towns Fund: How were the winners chosen? On the second round of funding, Rishi Sunak said: ""two thirds of all the levelling up funding is going to the most deprived parts of our country"". BBC analysis shows that using the government'sindex of multiple deprivation,external, which is the usual measure, in the second round about 57% of England's funding went to the areas with the highest deprivation, down from 69% in the first round. That analysis excludes a small number of awards that were given to areas covering multiple local authorities. We asked the Levelling Up department about Mr Sunak's claim. It said it was not based on the government's index of multiple deprivation but was instead based on measures involving productivity, employment, vacancy rates, lack of skills and transport links. Labour said the money awarded was dwarfed by the cuts to local authority funding since 2010, with Alex Norris telling MPs: ""the government have nicked a tenner from our wallets and expect us to be grateful for getting less than two quid back."" The Institute for Fiscal Studies found,externalthat between 2009-10 and 2019-20, English councils' non-education funding per resident had fallen by almost a quarter, after adjusting for rising prices. The Institute for Government found,externalthat councils in the most deprived areas had been worst hit because they were the most reliant on central government funding. Andy Street, the Conservative mayor of the West Midlandscriticised the Levelling Up funding processas being part of Whitehall's ""broken begging bowl culture"". He suggested the money would have been allocated better by local decision-makers than civil servants in London. Some government departments will have a new hub in Darlington Having 22,000 civil servants based outside London by the end of the decade, with a target for 25% of roles to be outside London by 2025 The government wants to level up skills with an extra Â£126m announced in March 2021 to fund work placements and training for 16 to 24-year-olds in England Locations for eight freeports have been chosen in England,external, with two planned in Scotland and two in Wales.

What extra help will the self-employed get?,"More help for the self-employed has been announced in the Budget, with grants available until the end of September. These will be the first payments available to an estimated 600,000 people who missed out on earlier support because they couldn't demonstrate their self-employed status on their tax return. Previous claimants will also be able to apply. Two further payments will be available for self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. These represent the fourth and fifth grants paid out bythe Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS),external. The fourth covers the three-month period from February until the end of April. As with two of the previous SEISS grants, it is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. The fifth grant covers May to the end of September, but the amount available depends on loss of income. Workers whose turnover has fallen by at least 30% can still apply for a grant for up to 80% of profits, up to a value of Â£7,500 in total. Those whose income has fallen by less than that can apply for up to 30% of trading profits capped at Â£2,850. Claims can be made from next month for the fourth grant. Claims for the fifth grant will open in July. Check if you can claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,external Nearly a fifth of self-employed people - 600,000 people - missed out on previous grants. That's because they had only recently started working for themselves, and so could not prove their income status on their tax return. But those who completed tax returns for the 2019-2020 financial year will qualify for these new payments, provided they filed their return by midnight on 2 March 2021. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. (Although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE). As a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income have been ineligible for SEISS grants, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Why can't some workers get Covid help? Ten ways the Budget will affect you The chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year. If they suffered any loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to Â£2,500 per month. Help was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months, and businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans. This video can not be played ""I'm devastated that I have been penalised because of my husband's death"" More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up, giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022. Those with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis. This is how it has worked: HMRC uses existing information to identify those eligible and invite applications The application requires people to confirm they meet the eligibility requirements It will be paid straight into a bank account, which eligible taxpayers need to confirm on their application form There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of Â£781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash. Of those eligible for previous grants, 77% have taken up the offer - a total of 2.6 million people, averaging around Â£10,800 in payments each. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education The chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

The seven key questions facing Nicola Sturgeon,"Scotland's first minister gave evidence to a Holyrood inquiry looking into her government's 2018 harassment investigation of Alex Salmond. It was found to be unlawful by a court in a process which cost the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mr Salmond - and others - have made a number of allegations against the government and against Nicola Sturgeon herself. So, what were the key questions, and how did she answer them? This was the most serious allegation for Ms Sturgeon. Mr Salmond had saidhe believed Ms Sturgeon definitely broke the code. Her political opponents say if she did, she would have to quit. The allegations focus on when she found out about the Scottish government investigation into Mr Salmond. She initially claimed it was 2 April 2018, but since then another meeting on 29 March, when it's claimed she was told the details, has emerged. This isn't just a matter of a few days. If Ms Sturgeon knew what the second meeting was about, she would have known it was government business and she should have reported it to civil servants at the time. That didn't happen. Mr Salmond has said Ms Sturgeon is guilty of several breaches of the code in relation to these meetings. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? She told the committee that the fact that she did not remember the 29 meeting had been the subject of comment and scepticism and she wished her memory of it was ""more vivid"". The first minister said she recalled that it may have been indicated ""in general terms"" there was a harassment issue but the purpose of the meeting was to arrange for her to see Mr Salmond himself. Ms Sturgeon said that what she heard on 2 April in the dining room of her home was so significant that it may have ""obliterated"" what came before. She said Mr Salmond's account to her of his ""deeply inappropriate behaviour"" is a ""moment in my life that I will never forget"". The first minister said she did not record the meeting with Alex Salmond on 2 April immediately because she did not want to compromise the independence or the confidentiality of the process. Ms Sturgeon said the terms of the procedure excluded her from any investigation into a former minister and she should not even have known an investigation was under way. In her view, any undue influence on the procedure would have been more likely to arise if those conducting the investigation had been informed that she knew about it. Mr Salmond believes there was a malicious and concerted plot against him from several people close to Nicola Sturgeon - including her husband, who is the SNP's chief executive, and her Scottish government chief of staff. The evidence, Mr Salmond has claimed, shows there was a deliberate effort to damage his reputation ""even to the extent of having me imprisoned"". Much of this evidence Mr Salmond refers to, however, has not yet been published, so we don't know for sure how strong it is. But he told the committee last week he had been given a memory stick in the run-up to his criminal case, where he was cleared of all charges. Mr Salmond claims it shows senior allies of Ms Sturgeon ""pressurising police"". He also alleges there was ""construction of evidence"" and ""collusion of witnesses"". What did Nicola Sturgeon say? Ms Sturgeon said the suggestion that anyone acted with malice or as part of a plot against Alex Salmond was ""absurd"". She argued there was ""not a shred of evidence"" to support Mr Salmond's claims and she had ""no motive, intention, (or) desire"" to conspire against him. Ms Sturgeon said text messages between leading SNP figures - including her husband - were not evidence of a plot. She said they had been taken out of context and were ""not as presented"". The Scottish government has been criticised for failing to provide all the documents the committee asked for. On Tuesday,legal advice was made availableunder the threat of a confidence vote against Ms Sturgeon's deputy, John Swinney. Another question is why the documents Mr Salmond believes show a conspiracy were not published earlier. The straight answer is that they were provided to him for his legal case - which means they can't be used for any other reason. But the committee now has them after compelling the Crown Office to hand them over. There was a colossal row last week when part of Mr Salmond's evidence to the committee was taken down from the parliament's website. It contained some of the most damning allegations against Ms Sturgeon and claims she misled parliament. Parts of the document were withdrawn after the Crown Office - Scotland's prosecution service - said extracts were in contempt of court and could identify Mr Salmond's accusers. Mr Salmond has claimed the lines between the government and Crown Office have become blurred - something the Lord Advocate has said is untrue. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? Ms Sturgeon said it had been a complex matter and the government had provided information in a proper way. The first minister says, for different reasons, she shared a lot of the frustration. She said when information is not provided there is ""a lot of mystique and intrigue"" built up, which proves not to be the case when it is released. Ms Sturgeon said many of the things said about the legal advice proved not to be true. Alex Salmond wants resignations. He has said the government's Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans should resign and that the head of the Crown Office - the Lord Advocate, James Wolffe - should be considering his position. Mr Salmond argued Scotland's institutions hadn't failed - but their leadership had in this case. He even left the door open to Ms Sturgeon having to resign herself - saying it was for others to judge if she should quit. That's a damning conclusion from the man who led the Scottish government for seven years. Ms Sturgeon will be asked if he's wrong - and is likely to mount a passionate defence of her government. She has also made clear she is sticking by her permanent secretary and the Lord Advocate - as well as the others who Mr Salmond has said should be thinking about their position. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? The first minister said there were serious mistakes made by the civil service. ""But the civil service in Scotland acts properly and impartially at all time,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon said attacks on the civil service and the prosecution service were unfair and deeply unfounded. She said there had been an attack on ""the very fundamentals of our democracy"", which she finds ""deeply distressing"". This is a big part of the committee's remit. They are trying to find out what led to the introduction of a policy which Mr Salmond successfully challenged in court. It's been argued the policy was introduced too quickly and failed everyone involved; Mr Salmond and those who accused him of harassment. It's widely accepted this was a big mistake from the government. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? The first minister said organisations all over the world were reviewing their policies at that time due to the #metoo movement. Ms Sturgeon said gaps and weaknesses in the existing policies were identified and they were keen to address them quickly but they did not cut corners. She said the harassment policy had not failed but it had not been properly followed in Alex Salmond's case. The Scottish government conceded the judicial review on the ground that their had been ""prior contact"" between the independent investigating officer and those who had made harassment complaints. The Scottish government initially defended the harassment policy in the face of Mr Salmond's legal challenge. On Tuesday nightit finally published its legal advice,external, which shows concerns were raised by the senior counsel - an external legal adviser - in October 2018. In December, external lawyers said the least worst option would be to admit defeat. The case wasn't conceded until January 2019. This has raised questions over whether the government should have made that decision earlier - and potentially saved a lot of money in the process. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? Ms Sturgeon said that every time a government defends a legal action it is risking public funds. She also insisted the government had not prolonged its defence of the investigation and had acted in accordance with the views of the law officers. Ms Sturgeon said that on 11 December the law officers' view was there was no question or need to drop the case. But she agreed the note on the 19 December was ""catastrophic"" and led to the ultimate concession. The first minister insisted she was acting in accordance with the views of the law officers. Jackie Baillie will want to know more about claims of a breach of confidentiality Mr Salmond claimed in his evidence that the name of one of the complainants was revealed during the government investigation. On Tuesday night, that claim was backed up by two witnesses. Revealing the name would be a significant breach of confidentiality. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? Replying to the claim that a senior member of Ms Sturgeon's team revealed the name of the complainant to Mr Salmond's former chief of staff, the first minister said: ""I am not accepting that that happened."" She said her assumption was Mr Salmond had previously apologised to one of the women and may have worked out another's identity ""through his own investigations"". Challenged about details of the investigation being leaked to the Daily Record newspaper in 2018 - the first public confirmation of allegations against Mr Salmond - Ms Sturgeon said it ""didn't come from me, or anyone acting on my instruction or request"".

Biden: Enough vaccine for all in US by end of May,"A queue for vaccinations in New York. A key task for President Biden is getting the supplies into arms The US will have enough coronavirus vaccines for every adult by the end of May, President Joe Biden has said. This will be two months earlier than previously expected, but Mr Biden said the vaccination drive must be extended, too, and people convinced to take it. And he warned people to ""stay vigilant"" because ""this fight is far from over"", with new variants a major concern. His caution is at odds with some states, which are relaxing restrictions in order to boost their economies. Mr Biden's new timeline does not mean all adults in the US will be vaccinated by the end of May, as the jabs will take longer to administer. Although there has been a sharp fall in confirmed cases since the start of the year - the figure of 68,000 a day now is well down on the 8 January peak of 300,000 - that drop has levelled off over the past week, fuelling fears of another wave. Biden calls 500,000 death toll a heartbreaking milestone Imagining what 500,000 lost lives look like More than 76 million vaccination doses have been administered - covering 15.3% of the population and the US remains on track to meet Mr Biden's pledge of delivering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office. Some 1.74 million doses are being administered every day. The president said that drug manufacturer Merck -which this year discontinued work on its own vaccine,external- would now be helping Johnson & Johnson to produce its newly approved one-shot drug. ""We're now on track to have enough vaccine supply for every adult in America by the end of May,"" he said, adding it was ""the type of collaboration between companies we saw in World War Two"". But the president acknowledged that supply was only one issue, with the nation needing to extend its vaccination drive and convince people to take the shots. ""We need vaccinators, people who put the shots in people's arms, millions of Americans' arms,"" he said. ""Great news, but stay vigilant,"" Mr Biden said. ""It's not over yet."" Another key announcement was the pledge to give every teacher at least one shot by the end of March, and speed up the reopening of schools. But on a general reopening, President Biden was more cautious, saying he was unsure when a return to normal would be possible, although he did then say before ""this time next year"". Some are now relaxing rules, despite a warning from top federal health officials last week not to ease up. Mr Biden repeated that, saying: ""We cannot let our guard down now or assure that victory is inevitable. We can't assume that."" Individual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel. About 35 required face coverings to be worn in public places, although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy. Drive-through vaccination in Texas. The governor says it is time to open the state ""100%"" The governor ofTexason Tuesday issued an executive order, effective from 10 March, that rescinds most of the coronavirus measures he imposed. Greg Abbott lifted the regulation ordering people to wear masksand said that businesses would be allowed to resume full capacity next week. ""It is now time to open Texas 100%,"" the Republican said. ""Too many small business owners have struggled to pay their bills. This must end."" He said that with increased vaccinations and improved treatment for Covid-19, the state was ""in a far better position now"". The Democratic party in the state said the ""crazy"" move would throw away all of the gains. Mississippihas followed Texas in removing the order on mask wearing, but it will come into effect even earlier - from Wednesday. Other states have also announced a relaxation of some rules. Michigan, which has a Democratic governor, is to ease capacity limits on restaurants, and on public and residential gatherings. South Carolinahas removed limits on large gatherings, while capacity limits on restaurants inMassachusettswere removed. Some cities have also acted.Chicagohas reopened public schools andSan Franciscoannounced the easing of rules on museums, cinemas, gyms and indoor dining.

On Monday the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned of a ""potential fourth surge of cases"" if the country lapsed into complacency. Covid-19 data shows that, while infections and deaths have declined in recent weeks, they are still at high levels relative to other countries. Covid-19 variants pose 'real threat' to vaccine progress, CDC warns The emergence of new variants could also require booster shots for those already vaccinated. Patients in hospital with Covid continue to fall, from a peak of 131,000 on 12 January to 46,000 in the first week of March. Deaths per day over the same period have fallen from 4,400 to 1,300 The US has recorded 28.7 million infections and 516,000 deaths related to Covid-19 since the pandemic began,according to Johns Hopkins University research,external. The confirmed infections figure is nearly double that of second-highest India (11 million) and Brazil (10.5 million) But the US ranks ninth in terms of deaths per 100,000 population, behind countries such as the UK and Italy At least 90,000 more Americans are expected to have died with the virus by 1 June, an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projection says.

Covid spending spree to be followed by tax rises,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers. The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected. Official forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of thefurlough schemewill limit job losses. Mr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop ""irresponsible"" debt. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the ""vanguard"" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines. It said this will foster a ""swifter and more sustained"" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022. This would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year. Mr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, includingtax breaks designed to encourage business investment. However, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances. Mr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further Â£4bn a year. Mr Sunak said it would be ""irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked"". Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as ""three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain"". Mr Sanger added: ""Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers."" The government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions. The OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around Â£180bn in the past year. It expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a ""degree of euphoria"", especially among better-off households who ""treat themselves"" when the economy opens up. The main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical ""super-deduction"" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is Â£60bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year. The happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer. The jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in Â£16bn corporation tax and the Â£8bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. So Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of ""Singapore-on-Thames"". Singapore is staying in South East Asia. The timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. However, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained ""considerable"", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was ""betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz"". He added: ""The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax."" Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Ten ways the Budget affects your finances Business rates holiday extended to June Furlough to be extended until September Unemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. However, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year. Government borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of Â£354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures. The size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade. Mr Sunak said: ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" From April, he will alsofreeze the amount of money employees earnbefore paying income tax at Â£12,570 until the middle of the decade. The OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze. The level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at Â£50,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years.

"Sturgeon 'had no reason to want to get' SalmondScotland's first minister tells an inquiry that claims of a plot against her predecessor are ""absurd"".","This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says claims of conspiracy against Alex Salmond 'absurd' Nicola Sturgeon has insisted she had no reason to want to ""get"" Alex Salmond as she dismissed claims of a plot against him as ""absurd"". The first minister was speaking at the inquiry into her government's unlawful handling of harassment complaints against her predecessor. She apologised to the two women who had made the complaints, saying they were let down by a ""very serious error"". But she rejected much of Mr Salmond's version of events. And she insisted her government had nothing to hide, despite accusations of a cover-up from opposition parties. Mr Salmond has previously claimed several people within the SNP and Scottish government - including Ms Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, the party's chief executive - were involved in a ""deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort"" to damage his reputation, even to the extent of attempting to have him imprisoned. In her eight hours of evidence to the committee, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""thought often"" about the impact of the past three years on Mr Salmond, but said he had shown no sign of thinking of others. Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's evidence session What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon? The Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon story She said she had watched Mr Salmond give evidence to the inquiry committee last Friday and had found  herself ""searching for any sign at all that he recognised how difficult this had been for others too"". The first minister added: ""First of all, for women who believed his behaviour towards them was inappropriate. ""But also for those of us who have campaigned alongside him, worked with him, cared for him, and consider him a friend - who now stand unfairly accused of plotting against him."" Mr Salmond told the inquiry last week that he had ""no doubt"" that Ms Sturgeon had breached the ministerial code. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that Mr Salmond had been cleared of all of the sexual assault allegations against him by a High Court jury. But she added: ""I know just from what he told me that his behaviour was not always appropriate. ""And yet across six hours of testimony, there was not a single word of regret, reflection or even a simple acknowledgement of that. ""I can only hope that in private, the reality might be different."" The first minister said the female complainers had come forward ""of their own free will"", and that while some offered support to each other, this was not evidence of a conspiracy. The inquiry meeting is being held at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh She went on to tell the cross-party committee of MSPs that Mr Salmond had been one of the ""closest people to me in my entire life"". She added: ""I would never have wanted to 'get' Alex Salmond - I would never, ever have wanted any of this to happen. I had no motive, intention or desire to 'get' Alex Salmond."" The inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants. Mr Salmond used his evidence session last week to accuse his former protege of repeatedly misleading parliament, and said he had ""no doubt"" she had breached the ministerial code - which she denies. A separate inquiry headed by Irish lawyer James Hamilton is specifically looking at whether this was the case. Ms Sturgeon is facing calls to quit from Scottish Conservatives after new documents released on Tuesday evening raised further questions about her involvement in the saga and appeared to back Mr Salmond's evidence. Ms Sturgeon was Mr Salmond's deputy for many years before succeeding him as SNP leader and first minister in 2014 They included government emails showing it continued a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond despite its lawyers advising it was likely to lose. It ended up paying Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than Â£500,000, on top of its own costs, after the investigation was found to have been unlawful and ""tainted with bias"" ahead of a judicial review. Calls for Sturgeon to quit over Salmond revelations Ms Sturgeon insisted that her meetings with lawyers had initially left her satisfied that the government was not ""in some way prolonging a judicial review that was dead in the water"". She admitted that advice received shortly before it did finally admit defeat had been ""dreadful"" and ""catastrophic"", but said the government had taken a ""legally sound"" approach by then deciding to concede the case. Labour's Jackie Ballie said the legal advice had only been handed over at the ""11th hour"" after two votes in parliament and the threat of a no confidence vote in the deputy first minister, and complained that some documents had not been provided. The committee has regularly complained that its work was being obstructed by the government, with SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, who chairs the inquiry, saying that she shared Ms Baillie's frustration. Ms Sturgeon insisted she had always acted ""properly and appropriately"" and there was ""no intention"" by the government to withhold information from the committee. Ms Sturgeon was questioned at length about claims the name of a complainer was passed to Mr Salmond while the meeting between a meeting between the two first ministers was being set up. Mr Salmond said the name had been revealed to his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein, and two other former SNP employees - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have written to the committee to support his account. However Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she had been given assurances that ""it did not happen in the way that has been described"". She said she believed that Mr Salmond was already aware of the identities of the two complainers, and that Mr Hamilton and Mr Pringle were not present at the meeting in question. She said she was prevented from going into more detail due to legal constraints, but added: ""I understand evidence has been given to this committee that denies that allegation, and I believe there has been an offer of confidential evidence as well."" As Ms Sturgeon was speaking, Mr Salmond's spokesman released a statement saying he had lodged a formal complaint with Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, about ""the conduct of the official who is alleged to have breached civil service rules by disclosing the name of a complainant."" The view in Nicola Sturgeon's team tonight is there was no knock-out blow - no truly dreadful moment for the first minister. They seem pretty happy with her performance in eight long hours of questions. There are still outstanding questions; the most significant of which is whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. The committee will provide an answer - but perhaps more significant is the view of James Hamilton, the Irish lawyer heading a separate inquiry into the issue. The view in Bute House is that his report will be hard to ignore. The political debate over this is likely to continue in the coming days too. Ms Sturgeon's political opponents still believe her account is muddled and inconsistent. Then there's Alex Salmond. He's sent documents to the committee today to support his evidence last week. Might we hear more from him in the coming days? The first minister had originally told parliament she first became aware of the specific allegations against Mr Salmond when she met him in her Glasgow home on 2 April 2018. But she subsequently claimed to have ""forgotten"" about an earlier meeting with his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her Scottish Parliament office on 29 March when she says she was told ""in general terms"" that a ""harassment-type issue had arisen."" Some committee members expressed scepticism that Ms Sturgeon could genuinely forget about such a meeting. Ms Sturgeon said she had not taken an official record of her two meetings with Mr Salmond in her home because she thought this could ""potentially compromise the confidentiality"" of the complaints process. She said if a meeting with Mr Salmond appeared in a diary then questions could be asked about it, and that there would be more risk to the complaints process if she told people within government that she was aware it was ongoing. And she said she did not agree with Mr Salmond's assertion that there had been a ""shared understanding"" ahead of the meeting as to what was to be discussed - which would suggest she knew in advance about the allegations against him. Ms Sturgeon also denied claims that she had told Mr Salmond she would be willing to intervene in the case if necessary But she said Mr Salmond had been a ""long-standing friend and colleague"", and she had therefore tried to let him down gently when he made the request  - and accepted that she may not have been frank enough. The first minister added: ""I did not intend to intervene, and I did not intervene, and while I know it is more complex than this, I think in terms of his anger towards me I think that is the root of it with Mr Salmond."" Ms Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, has denied Mr Salmond's claim that he was involved in plotting his downfall The first minister also insisted that the complaints procedure was not put in place to target Mr Salmond, as some of his supporters have claimed. She told the committee that she was not aware of any allegations or concerns about sexually inappropriate behaviour on the part of Mr Salmond until a media enquiry from Sky News was made in November 2017. Ms Sturgeon also insisted that details of the allegations against Mr Salmond that were leaked to the Daily Record newspaper - which broke the story in August 2018 - had not come from her or from anyone acting on her authority or instruction. Ms Sturgeon finished her evidence by admitting that mistakes had been made - but dismissed suggestions from Mr Salmond that this was because Scotland's leadership and institutions had failed. She added: ""Actually what comes out of it is the message that no matter how powerful you are or were, no matter your status or connections, if you are accused of serious offences they will be investigated and you will have the chance to defend yourself in court. That is how these things should work. ""The idea that because somebody doesn't like what has happened over the last couple of years we allow this attack to be made on the fundamentals of our democracy I find deeply distressing and deeply unfair."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross claimed that the abiding memory of the evidence session would be Ms Sturgeon repeatedly saying ""I can't recall"". He added: ""She dodged and evaded almost every difficult question. The first minister vividly remembers the details she believes exonerate her, then forgets entirely anything that damages her."" Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, who sits on the committee, said ""serious questions remain"" about the first minister's conduct. She added: ""Quite frankly we are not much further forward in understanding her role in this catastrophic failure of the Scottish government. ""Most galling of all was the first minister's complete failure to understand the obstruction that this Committee has faced and continues to face. ""The first minister promised the committee that it would receive all the information that it needed - this now sounds like a bad joke.""

Sturgeon 'had no reason to want to get' Salmond,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says claims of conspiracy against Alex Salmond 'absurd' Nicola Sturgeon has insisted she had no reason to want to ""get"" Alex Salmond as she dismissed claims of a plot against him as ""absurd"". The first minister was speaking at the inquiry into her government's unlawful handling of harassment complaints against her predecessor. She apologised to the two women who had made the complaints, saying they were let down by a ""very serious error"". But she rejected much of Mr Salmond's version of events. And she insisted her government had nothing to hide, despite accusations of a cover-up from opposition parties. Mr Salmond has previously claimed several people within the SNP and Scottish government - including Ms Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, the party's chief executive - were involved in a ""deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort"" to damage his reputation, even to the extent of attempting to have him imprisoned. In her eight hours of evidence to the committee, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""thought often"" about the impact of the past three years on Mr Salmond, but said he had shown no sign of thinking of others. Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's evidence session What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon? The Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon story She said she had watched Mr Salmond give evidence to the inquiry committee last Friday and had found  herself ""searching for any sign at all that he recognised how difficult this had been for others too"". The first minister added: ""First of all, for women who believed his behaviour towards them was inappropriate. ""But also for those of us who have campaigned alongside him, worked with him, cared for him, and consider him a friend - who now stand unfairly accused of plotting against him."" Mr Salmond told the inquiry last week that he had ""no doubt"" that Ms Sturgeon had breached the ministerial code. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that Mr Salmond had been cleared of all of the sexual assault allegations against him by a High Court jury. But she added: ""I know just from what he told me that his behaviour was not always appropriate. ""And yet across six hours of testimony, there was not a single word of regret, reflection or even a simple acknowledgement of that. ""I can only hope that in private, the reality might be different."" The first minister said the female complainers had come forward ""of their own free will"", and that while some offered support to each other, this was not evidence of a conspiracy. The inquiry meeting is being held at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh She went on to tell the cross-party committee of MSPs that Mr Salmond had been one of the ""closest people to me in my entire life"". She added: ""I would never have wanted to 'get' Alex Salmond - I would never, ever have wanted any of this to happen. I had no motive, intention or desire to 'get' Alex Salmond."" The inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants. Mr Salmond used his evidence session last week to accuse his former protege of repeatedly misleading parliament, and said he had ""no doubt"" she had breached the ministerial code - which she denies. A separate inquiry headed by Irish lawyer James Hamilton is specifically looking at whether this was the case. Ms Sturgeon is facing calls to quit from Scottish Conservatives after new documents released on Tuesday evening raised further questions about her involvement in the saga and appeared to back Mr Salmond's evidence. Ms Sturgeon was Mr Salmond's deputy for many years before succeeding him as SNP leader and first minister in 2014 They included government emails showing it continued a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond despite its lawyers advising it was likely to lose. It ended up paying Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than Â£500,000, on top of its own costs, after the investigation was found to have been unlawful and ""tainted with bias"" ahead of a judicial review. Calls for Sturgeon to quit over Salmond revelations Ms Sturgeon insisted that her meetings with lawyers had initially left her satisfied that the government was not ""in some way prolonging a judicial review that was dead in the water"". She admitted that advice received shortly before it did finally admit defeat had been ""dreadful"" and ""catastrophic"", but said the government had taken a ""legally sound"" approach by then deciding to concede the case. Labour's Jackie Ballie said the legal advice had only been handed over at the ""11th hour"" after two votes in parliament and the threat of a no confidence vote in the deputy first minister, and complained that some documents had not been provided. The committee has regularly complained that its work was being obstructed by the government, with SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, who chairs the inquiry, saying that she shared Ms Baillie's frustration. Ms Sturgeon insisted she had always acted ""properly and appropriately"" and there was ""no intention"" by the government to withhold information from the committee. Ms Sturgeon was questioned at length about claims the name of a complainer was passed to Mr Salmond while the meeting between a meeting between the two first ministers was being set up. Mr Salmond said the name had been revealed to his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein, and two other former SNP employees - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have written to the committee to support his account. However Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she had been given assurances that ""it did not happen in the way that has been described"". She said she believed that Mr Salmond was already aware of the identities of the two complainers, and that Mr Hamilton and Mr Pringle were not present at the meeting in question. She said she was prevented from going into more detail due to legal constraints, but added: ""I understand evidence has been given to this committee that denies that allegation, and I believe there has been an offer of confidential evidence as well."" As Ms Sturgeon was speaking, Mr Salmond's spokesman released a statement saying he had lodged a formal complaint with Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, about ""the conduct of the official who is alleged to have breached civil service rules by disclosing the name of a complainant."" The view in Nicola Sturgeon's team tonight is there was no knock-out blow - no truly dreadful moment for the first minister. They seem pretty happy with her performance in eight long hours of questions. There are still outstanding questions; the most significant of which is whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code.

How long will the Â£20 universal credit boost last?,"Many people receiving universal credit (UC) will now have to work longer hours, as part of government plans to encourage people into employment. However, the Turn2Us charity warned of a ""drastic impact"" on people with long-term health conditions, caring responsibilities or irregular incomes. Universal credit isa single benefit payment for working-age people,external. It was introduced to replace a range of different benefits for unemployed and low-paid people. There were 6.4 million people on UC in January in England, Scotland and Wales, according toofficial government statistics.,externalNearly 40% of claimants have jobs. The government is expected to spend Â£90bn on UC in 2024-25. That compares with Â£153bn on state pensions and other benefits for pensioners, Â£40bn on disability benefits and Â£14bn on child benefit. For UC claimants required to work, the minimum number of hours was increased from 15 to 18, on Monday 13 May. The rule change means180,000 people will have to work more or risk losing their benefits, the Department for Work and Pensions says. The 18-hour minimum applies to people earning the National Living Wage (Â£11.44 for those aged 21 or over). Someone earning more per hour can work fewer hours, as long as their total earnings meet a level called the Administrative Earnings Threshold (AET). The AET now stands at Â£892, which is what you would earn in a month if you worked for 18 hours a week at the minimum wage. Universal credit claimants must seek 18 hours work Sunak sets out plans to tackle 'sick note culture' If a couple is earning less than Â£1,437 between them, they will be expected to try to increase their earnings. Claimants already risk having their benefits reduced if they don't take steps to earn more and meet regularly with a work coach. Certain groups will remain exempt from sanctions - including people who can't work because of long-term sickness, or a disability. Turn2Us has claimed government plans to speed up the roll-out of UC - and bring down spending on welfare - could affect vulnerable people disproportionately. The government says its plans are necessary to get more people back in work and boost the economy, as levels of long-term sickness have increased. It claims that changes it is phasing in for the welfare system as a whole could save Â£4bn a year. Labour, however, says the Conservatives' failure to tackle problems facing the NHS, such as long waiting lists, should be prioritised instead. The amount you get depends on whether you are single, or claiming as a couple, and your age. There is one standard allowance per household: Single claimant under 25: Â£311.68 a month Single claimant 25 or over: Â£393.45 a month Joint claimants both under 25: Â£489.23 a month Joint claimants either aged 25 or over: Â£617.60 a month You may be entitled to extra money if, for example, you have children. Extra money may also be available for rent payments, which works in different ways across the UK. You may also be able to claima reduction in council tax,externalwhile on UC, orassistance to pay your mortgage,external, although you would need to meet strict criteria. Under the UC taper, payments are reduced as claimants earn more. The current taper ""rate"" is 55%. This means thatfor every additional Â£1 earned over the work allowance,external, UC payments are reduced by 55p. It is complicated to work out exactly how much UC you might receive. Some people have found they are entitled to less money under UC than they would have been under the previous benefit arrangements. Those with Â£16,000 or more in savings are not eligible. It usually takes about five weeks from the date of claiming to receiving a first payment, although an advance loan may be possible. An application for UCmay put a stop to any tax credits you receive,even if it proves to be unsuccessful. 'One click and I was worse off' from benefit claim The main benefit for anyone losing their job after a period in work isnew-style jobseeker's allowance (JSA).,external This is worth Â£71.70 a week if you are under 25, or Â£90.50 a week if you are 25 or over. You can get this for up to six months and it will be paid into your bank, building society, or credit union account every two weeks. Unlike UC, your partner's or spouse's income will not affect your claim, although you may get less if you have part-time earnings or a pension. You may be able to claim new-style JSA as well as universal credit.

"'Vaccine, vaccine' - Dolly sings before Covid-19 jab","This video can not be played Watch Dolly Parton sing a special vaccine edition of her hit song Jolene Country star Dolly Parton has been given a Covid-19 vaccine dose, after urging others to follow her example by reimagining one of her hit songs. Parton, 75, sang an adapted version of Jolene before receiving the shot at Vanderbilt University Medical Center in Nashville, Tennessee on Tuesday. ""Vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, vaccine, I'm begging of you, please don't hesitate,"" Parton sang in a video. She was injected with a vaccine developed by Moderna. Parton was credited with helping fund the Moderna vaccine after donating $1m (Â£716,000) to Vanderbilt University Medical Centre. A portion of the singer's money went towards funding an early stage-trial of the Moderna vaccine. In trials, the Moderna vaccine was found to offer nearly 95% protection against severe Covid-19. Dolly Parton was vaccinated with a jab developed by Moderna The Grammy-winning musician said she had been ""waiting a while"" for her vaccination. ""I'm old enough to get it and I'm smart enough to get it,""  the singer told fans in a video posted from the university. Last monthParton told the Associated Press,externalshe wanted to wait until vaccines were more widely available because ""I don't want it to look like I'm jumping the line"". Now vaccine supply has increased - in the US at least - Parton said she ""wanted to encourage everybody"" to get theirs. Dolly Parton 'honoured and proud' to help Covid-19 battle Moderna: Covid-19 vaccine shows nearly 95% protection ""I just want to say to all of you cowards out there - don't be such a chicken squat. Get out there and get your shot,"" she said. The 9 to 5 singer is the latest star to promote coronavirus vaccinations. Other celebrities who have had a Covid-19 vaccine include: - Sir David Attenborough The naturalist and broadcaster, 94, received the Covid-19 jab in January, months after speaking of the ""immense suffering"" caused by the pandemic. - Jane Fonda The Academy Award-winning actress, 83, shared the news of her jab in an Instagram post in February, posting: ""It doesn't hurt"".

"What are freeports, where will they be?","The Celtic Freeport will be based around the ports of Port Talbot, pictured, and Milford Haven Two sites in Wales have been selected to host a freeport. The Celtic Freeport and Anglesey Freeport are expected to be operational later this year. Eight freeports have already been set up in England, with a further two soon to be operational in Scotland. Freeports aim to create economic activity - like trade, investment and jobs - near shipping ports or airports. Goods imported into freeports are exempt from taxes, called tariffs, that are normally paid to the UK government. It means manufacturers in freeports can import raw materials tariff-free, only paying tariffs on finished products leaving the site for elsewhere in the UK. Or the goods can be re-exported overseas without UK duties being paid. Companies inside the sites will also be able to claim lower property taxes, including on new buildings they buy. Firms also benefit from lower rates of national insurance - a tax paid on employees' wages - if they take on new staff. Are freeports the future? Not all at sea: One of England's freeports is being set up near East Midlands Airport Teessidebecame the first to enter operation, in November 2021. TheThamesfreeport in Essex opened the following month. Sites nearLiverpool,PlymouthandHullhave also been set up, as have shared freeports forFelixstowe and HarwichandSouthampton and Portsmouth. The only freeport in England near an airport is byEast Midlands Airportin Leicestershire. The locations were announced at the March 2021 Budget by Rishi Sunak, when he was chancellor, from 18 areas that applied. Southampton is one of the UK's largest container terminals InScotland,Cromarty Firth and the Forth were chosen from five areas that appliedfor freeport status. The SNP-led Scottish government has called the sites ""green"" freeports, because bids had to include plans for lowering carbon emissions. Rishi Sunak visited the Port of Cromarty Firth after its winning bid was announced However, the SNP's government partners, the Scottish Greens, say there are ""no hard requirements"" to meet the climate targets. It says that, internationally, freeports are linked to ""crime, money laundering, smuggling, and low wages"". The tax and customs benefits available to companies, however, mirror those in place elsewhere in the UK. InWales, bids from Celtic Freeport and Anglesey Freeporthave been given the green light by the UK and Welsh governments. The former covers Port Talbot, in the county of Neath Port Talbot, and Milford Haven, in Pembrokeshire, and the latter Holyhead, on Anglesey. A third Welsh bid, based around Newport and Cardiff Airport, failed. TheNorthern Irelandgovernment says it is working with the Treasury to identify whether the freeport model can be adopted under itspost-Brexit arrangements. They are not a new idea. The UK set up seven freeports after 1984, including ones at Liverpool and Southampton, but these were phased out in 2012. However, the UK government argued bringing them back could attract investment to areas that ""need it most"". Ministers said they will help with ""levelling up"" - the goal to close the gap between rich and poor areas that was a key Conservative pledge at the 2019 general election. But critics argue freeports don't help the economy overall. The Office for Budgetary Responsibilityhas predicted,externaltax breaks in England's freeports will cost the UK government Â£50m a year. It says historical evidence suggests their ""main effect"" will be to move economic activity from one place to another. What is levelling up and how is it going? Back to the future: Liverpool is set to regain its freeport status after a decade-long hiatus Freeports are allowed in the European Union - withabout 80 sites,externalbased in EU countries. But some Brexit-backing politicians, including Mr Sunak, have previously argued the EU's state aid rules restricted the benefits that can be offered to businesses based inside the sites. Jonathan Branton, a partner at law firm DWF, says the UK does have more flexibility now it doesn't have to follow EU rules. He also points out tax breaks offered to freeport firms would no longer require prior agreement from the European Commission. However, he adds that the Brexit trade deal - agreed by the UK and the EU - still requires subsidies to be justified, otherwise they could be challenged in UK courts. In more extreme circumstances, the EU could respond to UK subsidies by introducing tariffs on some UK goods deemed to be damaging EU trade or investment. And the UK will still be subject to World Trade Organization rules - which say you can't introduce subsidies linked just to export performance.

Business rates holiday extended to June,"Pubs are among business allowed a loan of up to Â£18,000, as they are among last to open Pubs, restaurants and other non-essential retail businesses have been given further help in the Budget. Measures include extending the VAT cut for the hospitality sector, seen during the Eat Out to Help Out scheme. Gyms and other non-essential retail premises in England will also see the year-long business rates holiday extended for another three months. Hospitality businesses including restaurants and pubs have been hit particularly hard by the pandemic. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, exempted them from paying business rates last year, but that tax holiday was due to end this month. They will now be exempt until the end of June. After that they will be discounted to one third of the normal charge for the rest of the financial year, up to a maximum of Â£2m for closed businesses. The chancellor called it ""a Â£6bn tax cut for businesses"". Major supermarkets and other retailers which had been allowed to stay open as essential businesses said they would repay the rates relief they received last year, giving back Â£2bn of the estimated Â£11bn it cost the Treasury. Asda, Tesco and Sainsbury's said they would do it again this time. Sainsbury's said in a statement: ""Despite significant ongoing costs associated with protecting colleagues and customers from Covid-19, we expect that the vast majority of Sainsbury's stores will remain open this year. ""We will therefore forgo the business rates relief on all Sainsbury's stores again this year. We will also forgo the business rates relief on all standalone Argos stores once they reopen."" The VAT discount to 5% for food and drink sold in pubs and restaurants will last until the end of September. After that it will increase to 12.5% - which is still below the normal rate of 20% - for a further  six months. Mr Sunak pointed out there were 150,000 hospitality and tourism businesses employing 2.4 million people. Other measures announced in the Budget include a business restart scheme, which allocates a total of Â£5bn in funding for small business grants of up to Â£18,000. Under the scheme, non-essential retail businesses will receive grants of up to Â£6,000 per premises, as they will be allowed to open first. Hospitality and leisure businesses, including personal care and gyms, will get grants of up to Â£18,000, because they will stay closed for longer and will be more affected by restrictions. Mr Sunak said some businesses would still need loans despite the restart grants. He said he was introducing a new recovery loan scheme which would allow businesses of any size to apply for loans from Â£25,000 up to Â£10m. Christian Mole of business services group EY said the industry still faced serious challenges, even once it opened up fully in May: ""Outdoor services will only be profitable for a small portion of the sector. ""Even after the scheduled 17 May full reopening, social distancing measures are likely to continue to limit operating capacity in restaurants and pubs. Across all hospitality, many operators also face significantly increased debts and deferred rental obligations. ""Hospitality businesses will need ongoing government support as long as these challenges remain in place, so it is encouraging to see the sector-specific support being offered.""

What help is there for self-employed?,"More help for the self-employed has been announced in the Budget, with grants available until the end of September. These will be the first payments available to an estimated 600,000 people who missed out on earlier support because they couldn't demonstrate their self-employed status on their tax return. Previous claimants will also be able to apply. Two further payments will be available for self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. These represent the fourth and fifth grants paid out bythe Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS),external. The fourth covers the three-month period from February until the end of April. As with two of the previous SEISS grants, it is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. The fifth grant covers May to the end of September, but the amount available depends on loss of income. Workers whose turnover has fallen by at least 30% can still apply for a grant for up to 80% of profits, up to a value of Â£7,500 in total. Those whose income has fallen by less than that can apply for up to 30% of trading profits capped at Â£2,850. Claims can be made from next month for the fourth grant. Claims for the fifth grant will open in July. Check if you can claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,external Nearly a fifth of self-employed people - 600,000 people - missed out on previous grants. That's because they had only recently started working for themselves, and so could not prove their income status on their tax return. But those who completed tax returns for the 2019-2020 financial year will qualify for these new payments, provided they filed their return by midnight on 2 March 2021. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. (Although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE). As a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income have been ineligible for SEISS grants, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Why can't some workers get Covid help? Ten ways the Budget will affect you The chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year. If they suffered any loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to Â£2,500 per month. Help was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months, and businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans. This video can not be played ""I'm devastated that I have been penalised because of my husband's death"" More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up, giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022. Those with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis. This is how it has worked: HMRC uses existing information to identify those eligible and invite applications The application requires people to confirm they meet the eligibility requirements It will be paid straight into a bank account, which eligible taxpayers need to confirm on their application form There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of Â£781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash. Of those eligible for previous grants, 77% have taken up the offer - a total of 2.6 million people, averaging around Â£10,800 in payments each. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education The chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

Furlough extended to September,"The furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September by the chancellor in the Budget later. Rishi Sunak said the scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - would help millions through ""the challenging months ahead"". Some 600,000 more self-employed people will also be eligible for government help as access to grants is widened. But Labour said the support schemes should have been extended ""months ago"". The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected more than 11 million jobs since its inception last March and had been due to close at the end of April. It has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as tens of thousands of businesses remain shut. Employers will be expected to pay 10% towards the hours their staff do not work in July, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens. Government support for self-employed people has also been extended until September. A fourth grant under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) scheme will run from February until April, covering up to 80% of three months' trading profits up to Â£7,500. There will be a fifth grant from May to September. People whose turnover has fallen by 30% or more will get the 80% grant, but self-employed people whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will get a 30% grant. The government is widening access to grants, meaning some 600,000 more self-employed people will be eligible. People who filed their tax returns for 2019-20 by midnight on Tuesday are now eligible. Speaking ahead of the Budget, the chancellor said: ""Our Covid support schemes have been a lifeline to millions, protecting jobs and incomes across the UK. ""There's now light at the end of the tunnel with a roadmap for reopening, so it's only right that we continue to help business and individuals through the challenging months ahead - and beyond."" However, he is expected to warn in his Budget that there are tough economic times ahead. Can I go on furlough and how does it work? What help will the self-employed get in the Budget? Five things to look out for in the Budget What we know so far about the Budget Are you currently on furlough?  Share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy It is incredible to think that last year's Budget did not even contain the word ""furlough"". Official confirmation of a pandemic came hours after its publication, swiftly rendering most of its numbers obsolete. But so far in this crisis, unemployment has gone up only modestly. Furlough and the separate support scheme for the self-employed have prevented mass unemployment. These extensions now aim to prevent a rapid rise in joblessness at the end of the schemes. The BBC understands that unemployment forecasts will be revised down on Wednesday as the chancellor promises to deploy his ""full fiscal firepower"" to ""protect livelihoods"" - the theme of the Budget red book. At more than Â£10bn, this intervention is almost worthy of a Budget in and of itself. But the full document will reveal whether the chancellor's borrowing spree is limited to the ""rescue phase"" of this crisis, or if his confidence in a jobs bounce-back means the economy does not need further stimulus and could even sustain some business-focused tax rises. After the jabs, the jobs are the great hope. Economic think tank the Resolution Foundation's chief executive, Torsten Bell, said the phased tapering-off of the furlough scheme would avoid a ""risky cliff-edge"" for employers, but warned that the ""peak of unemployment is ahead rather than behind us"". However, Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the changes to support schemes ""could have been made months ago"" - accusing Mr Sunak of focusing on ""getting his moment in the sun rather than protecting jobs and livelihoods"". The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has said furlough must be in place  ""as long as businesses and devolved governments need it"". He said he was ""concerned companies are going to have to step in and pay greater contributions"". And Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said that while the extra months of furlough support offer ""some stability in the rocky months ahead"", the scheme should be extended until 2022. But Chris Wootton, chief financial officer at Sports Direct, said that although the furlough extension was helpful, other assistance was needed for businesses such as his, chiefly through business rates, payment of which has been suspended for almost a year. He told the BBC: ""What we really want is structural reform. This is just kicking the can down the road. ""We don't know what the systemic changes to consumer behaviour are going to be. We said even before Covid happened that a number of House of Fraser stores where we're working very closely with landlords, paying zero rent, they are still losing money because the business rates are far from fair.""

Seven questions facing Sturgeon,"Scotland's first minister gave evidence to a Holyrood inquiry looking into her government's 2018 harassment investigation of Alex Salmond. It was found to be unlawful by a court in a process which cost the taxpayer hundreds of thousands of pounds. Mr Salmond - and others - have made a number of allegations against the government and against Nicola Sturgeon herself. So, what were the key questions, and how did she answer them? This was the most serious allegation for Ms Sturgeon. Mr Salmond had saidhe believed Ms Sturgeon definitely broke the code. Her political opponents say if she did, she would have to quit. The allegations focus on when she found out about the Scottish government investigation into Mr Salmond. She initially claimed it was 2 April 2018, but since then another meeting on 29 March, when it's claimed she was told the details, has emerged. This isn't just a matter of a few days. If Ms Sturgeon knew what the second meeting was about, she would have known it was government business and she should have reported it to civil servants at the time. That didn't happen. Mr Salmond has said Ms Sturgeon is guilty of several breaches of the code in relation to these meetings. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? She told the committee that the fact that she did not remember the 29 meeting had been the subject of comment and scepticism and she wished her memory of it was ""more vivid"". The first minister said she recalled that it may have been indicated ""in general terms"" there was a harassment issue but the purpose of the meeting was to arrange for her to see Mr Salmond himself. Ms Sturgeon said that what she heard on 2 April in the dining room of her home was so significant that it may have ""obliterated"" what came before. She said Mr Salmond's account to her of his ""deeply inappropriate behaviour"" is a ""moment in my life that I will never forget"". The first minister said she did not record the meeting with Alex Salmond on 2 April immediately because she did not want to compromise the independence or the confidentiality of the process. Ms Sturgeon said the terms of the procedure excluded her from any investigation into a former minister and she should not even have known an investigation was under way. In her view, any undue influence on the procedure would have been more likely to arise if those conducting the investigation had been informed that she knew about it. Mr Salmond believes there was a malicious and concerted plot against him from several people close to Nicola Sturgeon - including her husband, who is the SNP's chief executive, and her Scottish government chief of staff. The evidence, Mr Salmond has claimed, shows there was a deliberate effort to damage his reputation ""even to the extent of having me imprisoned"". Much of this evidence Mr Salmond refers to, however, has not yet been published, so we don't know for sure how strong it is. But he told the committee last week he had been given a memory stick in the run-up to his criminal case, where he was cleared of all charges. Mr Salmond claims it shows senior allies of Ms Sturgeon ""pressurising police"". He also alleges there was ""construction of evidence"" and ""collusion of witnesses"". What did Nicola Sturgeon say? Ms Sturgeon said the suggestion that anyone acted with malice or as part of a plot against Alex Salmond was ""absurd"". She argued there was ""not a shred of evidence"" to support Mr Salmond's claims and she had ""no motive, intention, (or) desire"" to conspire against him. Ms Sturgeon said text messages between leading SNP figures - including her husband - were not evidence of a plot. She said they had been taken out of context and were ""not as presented"". The Scottish government has been criticised for failing to provide all the documents the committee asked for. On Tuesday,legal advice was made availableunder the threat of a confidence vote against Ms Sturgeon's deputy, John Swinney. Another question is why the documents Mr Salmond believes show a conspiracy were not published earlier. The straight answer is that they were provided to him for his legal case - which means they can't be used for any other reason. But the committee now has them after compelling the Crown Office to hand them over. There was a colossal row last week when part of Mr Salmond's evidence to the committee was taken down from the parliament's website. It contained some of the most damning allegations against Ms Sturgeon and claims she misled parliament. Parts of the document were withdrawn after the Crown Office - Scotland's prosecution service - said extracts were in contempt of court and could identify Mr Salmond's accusers. Mr Salmond has claimed the lines between the government and Crown Office have become blurred - something the Lord Advocate has said is untrue. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? Ms Sturgeon said it had been a complex matter and the government had provided information in a proper way. The first minister says, for different reasons, she shared a lot of the frustration. She said when information is not provided there is ""a lot of mystique and intrigue"" built up, which proves not to be the case when it is released. Ms Sturgeon said many of the things said about the legal advice proved not to be true. Alex Salmond wants resignations. He has said the government's Permanent Secretary Leslie Evans should resign and that the head of the Crown Office - the Lord Advocate, James Wolffe - should be considering his position. Mr Salmond argued Scotland's institutions hadn't failed - but their leadership had in this case. He even left the door open to Ms Sturgeon having to resign herself - saying it was for others to judge if she should quit. That's a damning conclusion from the man who led the Scottish government for seven years. Ms Sturgeon will be asked if he's wrong - and is likely to mount a passionate defence of her government. She has also made clear she is sticking by her permanent secretary and the Lord Advocate - as well as the others who Mr Salmond has said should be thinking about their position. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? The first minister said there were serious mistakes made by the civil service. ""But the civil service in Scotland acts properly and impartially at all time,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon said attacks on the civil service and the prosecution service were unfair and deeply unfounded. She said there had been an attack on ""the very fundamentals of our democracy"", which she finds ""deeply distressing"". This is a big part of the committee's remit. They are trying to find out what led to the introduction of a policy which Mr Salmond successfully challenged in court. It's been argued the policy was introduced too quickly and failed everyone involved; Mr Salmond and those who accused him of harassment. It's widely accepted this was a big mistake from the government. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? The first minister said organisations all over the world were reviewing their policies at that time due to the #metoo movement. Ms Sturgeon said gaps and weaknesses in the existing policies were identified and they were keen to address them quickly but they did not cut corners. She said the harassment policy had not failed but it had not been properly followed in Alex Salmond's case. The Scottish government conceded the judicial review on the ground that their had been ""prior contact"" between the independent investigating officer and those who had made harassment complaints. The Scottish government initially defended the harassment policy in the face of Mr Salmond's legal challenge. On Tuesday nightit finally published its legal advice,external, which shows concerns were raised by the senior counsel - an external legal adviser - in October 2018. In December, external lawyers said the least worst option would be to admit defeat. The case wasn't conceded until January 2019. This has raised questions over whether the government should have made that decision earlier - and potentially saved a lot of money in the process. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? Ms Sturgeon said that every time a government defends a legal action it is risking public funds. She also insisted the government had not prolonged its defence of the investigation and had acted in accordance with the views of the law officers. Ms Sturgeon said that on 11 December the law officers' view was there was no question or need to drop the case. But she agreed the note on the 19 December was ""catastrophic"" and led to the ultimate concession. The first minister insisted she was acting in accordance with the views of the law officers. Jackie Baillie will want to know more about claims of a breach of confidentiality Mr Salmond claimed in his evidence that the name of one of the complainants was revealed during the government investigation. On Tuesday night, that claim was backed up by two witnesses. Revealing the name would be a significant breach of confidentiality. What did Nicola Sturgeon say? Replying to the claim that a senior member of Ms Sturgeon's team revealed the name of the complainant to Mr Salmond's former chief of staff, the first minister said: ""I am not accepting that that happened."" She said her assumption was Mr Salmond had previously apologised to one of the women and may have worked out another's identity ""through his own investigations"". Challenged about details of the investigation being leaked to the Daily Record newspaper in 2018 - the first public confirmation of allegations against Mr Salmond - Ms Sturgeon said it ""didn't come from me, or anyone acting on my instruction or request"".

Economy to recover 'six months faster than forecast',"Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers. The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected. Official forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of thefurlough schemewill limit job losses. Mr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop ""irresponsible"" debt. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the ""vanguard"" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines. It said this will foster a ""swifter and more sustained"" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022. This would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year. Mr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, includingtax breaks designed to encourage business investment. However, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances. Mr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further Â£4bn a year. Mr Sunak said it would be ""irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked"". Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as ""three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain"". Mr Sanger added: ""Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers."" The government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions. The OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around Â£180bn in the past year. It expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a ""degree of euphoria"", especially among better-off households who ""treat themselves"" when the economy opens up. The main thrust of this Budget is significant extra immediate crisis support, both in terms of the furlough scheme and self employed support, and a radical ""super-deduction"" policy to encourage business investment right now.. That is Â£60bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year. The happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer. The jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in Â£16bn corporation tax and the Â£8bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. So Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of ""Singapore-on-Thames"". Singapore is staying in South East Asia. The timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. However, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained ""considerable"", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was ""betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz"". He added: ""The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax."" Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Ten ways the Budget affects your finances Business rates holiday extended to June Furlough to be extended until September Unemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. However, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year. Government borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of Â£354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures. The size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade. Mr Sunak said: ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" From April, he will alsofreeze the amount of money employees earnbefore paying income tax at Â£12,570 until the middle of the decade. The OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze. The level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at Â£50,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years.

Sunak vows to 'protect jobs and livelihoods'The chancellor extends furlough for workers - and sets out plans to increase business taxes in his Budget.,"This video can not be played The chancellor sets out a three-part plan to âprotect the jobs and livelihoods of the British peopleâ. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled more support for workers and businesses struggling with lockdown in his first Budget since the pandemic was declared. The furlough scheme will be extended to September - along with higher universal credit payments. Buttaxes on large company profits will rise in 2023and a million more people will start paying income tax. It will take the UK's tax burden to its highest level since the 1960s, said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget measures to salvage the UK's Covid-ravaged economy were ""nowhere near ambitious enough"". Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Sunak hails 'swifter and more sustained' recovery Million more set to pay income tax by 2026 In his Budget speech, Mr Sunak said unemployment will be lower - and growth higher - than previously thought as the UK emerges from lockdown later this year, citing forecasts from the OBR watchdog. But he warned that repairing the long-term economic damage ""will take time"", with the economy in five years' time predicted to be 3% smaller than it would have been without the pandemic. Despite the Â£280bn of support already committed to protecting the economy, the harm done by coronavirus had been ""acute"", he told MPs. ""Our economy has shrunk by 10% - the largest fall in over 300 years. Our borrowing is the highest it has been outside of wartime. ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" The headline rate of corporation tax will go up from 19% to 25% from 2023, although smaller firms will be exempt. And the freeze on income tax thresholds is expected tobring 1.3 million more people into paying income tax- and a million more into paying at the higher rate. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Budget is set to raise an extra Â£29bn by 2025-26, which was ""big by recent standards"". And it added that the UK's tax ""burden"" is set to rise to its ""highest sustained level"" ever. IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""Mr Sunak made much of his desire to be honest and to level with the British people. ""The fact that he felt constrained to raise taxes by hitting companies and through freezing allowances, rather than through more explicit rises in people's taxes, suggests there are limits to how far he wants to level with us, as he attempts to raise the overall tax burden to its highest sustained level in history."" There has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take. Business will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level. The deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice. ""Honest Rishi Sunak"", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes. Boxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers. Despite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid, public spending overall is still set to contract. The chancellor extended the furlough scheme to September, paying up to 80% of people's wages - and announced further grants for self-employed people, with the scheme widened to include 600,000 who were not previously entitled, including many newly self-employed people. He alsoextended the Â£20-a-week top-up to universal creditfor six months. Other Budget measures include: Anincrease the limit on contactless paymentsfrom Â£45 to Â£100 Eight 'freeports' in England, with lower taxes and ""cheaper customs"" Business rates holiday in England extended by three months Â£100m to set up a taskforce to tackle fraud in government Covid schemes More money for vaccine roll-out Â£5bn to helpHigh Street firms reopen Return of 95% mortgagesbacked by the government scheme to aid first-time buyers Â£408m for museums, theatres and galleries in England to help them reopen when Covid restrictions ease Â£150m to help communities take over pubs in danger of closing All alcohol duties will be frozen, which Mr Sunak said would help pubs and restaurants recover, and there will be no increase in fuel duty. But duty on cigarettes will go up by 2%, plus inflation. The reduced 5% VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector will be extended for six months to 30 September, and will not return to the full standard rate of 20% until April next year. Mr Sunak also announced that 750 civil service jobs at the Treasury will be transferred to Darlington, in the north-east of England, and there will be more than Â£1bn shared out among 45 struggling towns in England.

At a post-Budget Downing Street press conference, Mr Sunak vowed to protect people and businesses ""well beyond the end of lockdown"", and to build a ""fairer and more just"" country in the memory of those who have lost their lives to coronavirus. It comes as thelatest government figures on Wednesday showed,externala further 315 people had died with coronavirus in the UK within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis, and there were another 6,385 confirmed cases. Mr Sunak hit back at critics who say the business tax hike will choke off recovery, saying it will ""still be the lowest out of the G7 economies,"" including the US, France and Germany. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget did nothing to ""fix the NHS and social care"", reduce inequality or create more affordable homes. ""The scale of what the chancellor announced today is nowhere near ambitious enough,"" he told MPs, and he claimed Mr Sunak was ""itching to get back to his free-market principles and to pull away support as quickly as he can"". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said furlough should be in kept place ""as long as businesses and devolved governments need it"". ""This Budget is carefully laying the ground for more Tory austerity, a decade more of Conservative cuts,"" he told MPs. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine warned that the universal credit top-up will end at the same time as furlough, meaning people could lose their jobs and not receive the extra help they will need.

A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year. The happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer. The jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in Â£16bn corporation tax and the Â£8bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. So Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of ""Singapore-on-Thames"". Singapore is staying in South East Asia. The timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. However, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained ""considerable"", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was ""betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz"". He added: ""The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax.""

BBC reporter freed by Ethiopia's militaryGirmay Gebru is freed without charge after being detained in the conflict-hit Tigray region on Monday.Africa,"It is not clear why the BBC's Girmay Gebru was detained The BBC reporter in Ethiopia's conflict-hit region of Tigray has been released without charge. Girmay Gebru was taken from a cafÃ© in the regional capital, Mekelle, on Monday, and detained by the military. A local journalist, Tamirat Yemane, and two translators - Alula Akalu and Fitsum Berhane, who were working for the Financial Times and the AFP news agency - have also been freed. No official reason has been given for their detention. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent US 'gravely concerned' about Ethiopia atrocities Tigray at risk of huge 'humanitarian disaster' Girmay, who works for BBC Tigrinya, says he is happy to be home after two days in detention. It is not clear whether four of Girmay's neighbours detained alongside him on Monday have also been released. The BBC says it is ""pleased and relieved"" Girmay has been released. ""We are seeking a full explanation from the authorities as to why he and others were arrested when they had clearly committed no offence,"" the BBC said. Ethiopia's government has been fighting regional forces in Tigray since November. After months of an effective media blackout since the start of the conflict in Tigray, the government granted access to some international media organisations last week. How a massacre in Ethiopiaâs sacred city unfolded The Nobel Peace Prize winner who sent his troops to battle 'I lost my hand when a soldier tried to rape me' Medics on the run: 'I hid in the woods to flee shooting' Both AFP and the Financial Times had received permission to visit the region. Despite this, their workers were detained, which led to condemnation from the international community. The US government joined media rights organisations in calling for the media workers' release. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said their detention was inconsistent with the Ethiopian government's commitment to allow international media access to Tigray. This is not the first time media workers have been arrested in Ethiopia since the conflict began. In January police detained a cameramanworking for Reuters news agency who was covering the Tigray conflict. Kumerra Gemechu was held for 12 days before being released without charge. Just over two weeks later, Dawit Kebede Araya, a reporter with the state-owned broadcaster Tigray TV was shot dead in Mekelle.

Fighting continues in Tigray despite the government declaring victory over the Tigray People's Liberation Front, which used to be the region's ruling party.

Ten ways the Budget will affect you,"With lives and livelihoods still at risk, Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget is focused on short-term support for people's jobs and finances. But there are signs of what will happen next and how this will affect the money in your pocket. Although it was announced in advance, like many other key measures, the extension of furlough is significant for millions of people. The scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic -Â has been extended until September. Furlough to be extended until September in Budget Young and lower-paid people have been among the most likely to have been furloughed during the pandemic. While this is designed to protect their jobs from redundancy, many will have found that their income has been a fifth less than they had anticipated over the course of 18 months. The National Living Wage will rise to Â£8.91 from April, from Â£8.72. That is a 2.2% rise and will be for people aged 23 and over. Money promised for the vaccine rollout does not directly affect the amount of money that goes into the pockets of individuals. But the extra Â£1.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. Quicker jabs mean more jobs protected, which means that incomes can recover or be maintained. Tax on company profits to jump to 25% Stamp duty holiday extended to end of June Furlough supports employed people. The equivalent for the self-employed comes in the form of grants through the Coronavirus Self-Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS). From next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to Â£7,500 in total. This will then be followed by a fifth grant later in the year, covering May to September. However, the amount paid will depend on the amount of turnover lost. People whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will receive a grant that is equivalent to 30% of average trading profits. While many self-employed people remain ineligible - the source of considerable debate - those who can show they were trading in 2019-20 from their tax returns will now be eligible for the first time. They can receive the fourth and fifth grants. What extra help will the self-employed get? Another source of speculation for months has been the future for a Â£20-a-week top-up to universal credit. This has been described as a financial lifeline during the pandemic for many of those who have lost jobs or whose finances were already stretched. The chancellor said this would continue for another six months, but would then be withdrawn. Those on working tax credits will receive a one-off Â£500 payment. The government pledged in its manifesto not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. Although income tax is not rising, the tax bill that people may face in future years could go up. At present, people start paying 20% income tax when they earn Â£12,500 a year. The starting point for paying the higher 40% rate is Â£50,000. These thresholds will go up to Â£12,570 and Â£50,270 in April, but will then be frozen for five years. With these thresholds maintained at the same level until April 2026, many people receiving a pay rise may find themselves in a new tax bracket and having to pay more. Million more set to pay income tax by 2026 The government's official forecaster said this would mean 1.3 million more people paying income tax and one million more paying the higher rate of tax. That will raise a significant amount of money for the Treasury, estimated to be an extra Â£8bn a year by 2025-26, compared to what would have been the case if thresholds rose in line with the cost of living. Scotland has some tax-raising powers of its own. Million more set to pay income tax by 2026 Sunak: Tax rises to follow Covid spending spree Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance The chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan. This will be available when buying properties worth up to Â£600,000. However, some potential homeowners may still find it hard to get a mortgage if they do not have a regular income, while getting into negative equity if house prices fall is a threat. The new products will be available from next month. However, while there is support for homeownership, there are no specific policies to help those behind on their rents. Low-deposit buyers to get mortgage boost in Budget This tax break for homebuyers in England and Northern Ireland - as well as similar relief in Scotland and Wales - was due to finish at the end of March. This created a rush, as well as difficulties for some buyers to complete in time. The chancellor has now said that the current stamp duty holiday in England and Northern Ireland - which means no stamp duty is paid on the first Â£500,000 of a property purchase - will be extended until 30 June. This relief will be reduced to the first Â£250,000 of a purchase until the end of September, before returning to its pre-pandemic level of Â£125,000 from the start of October. In total, 46% of sales would be exempt from stamp duty as a result of this policy, according to property portal Zoopla. Ministers in Wales have extended its stamp duty break until the end of June. Stamp duty holiday extended to end of June All duties on alcohol will stay as they are, for a second year in a row. These had been earmarked to rise. There has been a freeze on fuel duty for a decade and this will continue for at least another year. About 60% of the price you pay for fuel is tax - a mixture of fuel duty and VAT. There will be a new savings product designed to raise money for environmental projects. This ""green bond"" will be issued by the government-backed National Savings and Investments (NS&I), which has been criticised by savers and MPs for its customer service performance during the pandemic. It will be issued in the summer, but there are no details yet on the interest rate that will be paid to savers. What is your reaction to this year's Budget?

When has the stamp duty holiday been extended until?,"The Chancellor Rachel Reeves has announced an increase in the amount of stamp duty paid by second-home buyers, landlords and companies. The higher rate paid on additional properties will rise from 3% to 5% from 31 October. There had been speculation the the government might cancel a planned cut in residential stamp duty thresholds in March 2025, but it has not done so. Budget 2024: Key points at-a-glance How the Budget will affect you and your money Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT) isa tax due if if you buy a property or land over a certain price in England and Northern Ireland,external. You pay the tax when you: buy a freehold property buy a new or existing leasehold buy a property through a shared ownership scheme take on a mortgage or buy a share in a house The amount of stamp duty you owe depends on the cost of the property, whether it will be used for residential purposes, and whether you own any other property. At the moment, buyers of homes worth less than Â£250,000 don't pay stamp duty. This was doubled from Â£125,000 under Liz Truss's mini-Budget in September 2022. The threshold is Â£425,000 for those buying their first property. This was raised from Â£300,000 as part of the mini-Budget. These higher thresholds will end in March 2025, when they are expected to revert to previous levels. Â£0-Â£250,000 (Â£425,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£250,001-Â£925,000 = 5% Â£925,001-Â£1.5m = 10% Â£1.5m+ = 12% If you already own a residential property worth Â£40,000 or more, and you buy another (or a part of one),you have to pay an additional 3% on top of the rates above,external. This will rise to 5% from 31 October. The single rate of stamp duty charged when firms buy dwellings worth more than Â£500,000 will also increase from 15% to 17%. Stamp Duty Land Tax (SDLT)raised Â£15.4bn for the government in the 2022/23 financial year,external, a 9% increase on the Â£14.1bn raised in 2021/22. Calculate how much SDLT you will have to pay,external In Scotland, the current rates for theLand and Buildings Transaction Tax,external(LBTT) are: Â£0-Â£145,000 (Â£175,000 for first-time buyers) = 0% Â£145,001-Â£250,000 = 2% Â£250,001-Â£325,000 = 5% Â£325,001-Â£750,000 = 10% Â£750,001+ = 12% Purchasers who already have a residential property also have to payan Additional Dwelling Supplement (ADS),externalon top of LBTT if their share of the new property is worth Â£40,000 or more. The ADS is 6% of the purchase price. This includes people buying a second home, a rental property or a holiday home.

In Scotland and Wales you have 30 days from the point of purchase. If it takes longer, you could face a fine, or be charged interest on the duty you owe. House buyers often pay via their solicitors, but you can also pay directly online, or by cheque or cash in many banks. It is also possible to add stamp duty to mortgage loans and increase your debt to cover the cost of the tax, but you could end up paying significantly more in interest payments.

"Sunak hails 'swifter and more sustained' recoveryHowever, the chancellor says repairing the long-term economic damage from Covid ""will take time"".Business","Chancellor Rishi Sunak has warned that a spending spree to support workers and spur investment will be followed by tax rises as the economy recovers. The UK's rapid Covid-19 vaccine rollout is expected to help the economy get back to its pre-pandemic size six months sooner than previously expected. Official forecasts expect growth to hit 4% this year, while an extension of thefurlough schemewill limit job losses. Mr Sunak said future tax hikes were needed to stop ""irresponsible"" debt. The government's independent forecaster, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR), said the UK had been at the ""vanguard"" of the discovery of new and effective vaccines. It said this will foster a ""swifter and more sustained"" economic recovery, with the pace of growth expected to strengthen to 7.3% in 2022. This would be the highest growth rate since official records began in 1949 and help the economy to return to its pre-pandemic size in the middle of next year. Mr Sunak unveiled plans to spend tens of billions of pounds more over the next two years to support the economic recovery, includingtax breaks designed to encourage business investment. However, the chancellor said tax rises were also needed to help repair the public finances. Mr Sunak announced that corporation tax will rise from 19% to 25% for large companies in 2023, while day-to-day spending by government departments will be cut by a further Â£4bn a year. Mr Sunak said it would be ""irresponsible to allow our future borrowing and debt to rise unchecked"". Chris Sanger, head of tax policy at EY, described the Budget as ""three years of support, followed by three years (and more) of pain"". Mr Sanger added: ""Time [is] the Chancellor's friend in his aim of replenishing the Government's coffers."" The government's target to have all adults vaccinated this summer is expected to pave the way for the lifting of public health restrictions. The OBR noted that British households had built up a savings war chest of around Â£180bn in the past year. It expects a quarter of this to be spent as lockdowns end, saying there could be a ""degree of euphoria"", especially among better-off households who ""treat themselves"" when the economy opens up.

That is Â£60bn extra in one year and it comes from borrowed money. That leaves borrowing in the coming financial year significantly higher than expected. A much larger proportion of the exceptional world war-style borrowing over the past year will stay in place in the coming year. The happy result of this is that unemployment, though rising, peaks at a much lower level than previous expectations, just over 6%, rather than, say, 10%. This is a consequence of both the vaccine rollout and the support package, leading to a reopening of the economy over summer. The jabs and then the jobs. But then the payback, with a massive rise in Â£16bn corporation tax and the Â£8bn changes to thresholds for the last two years of the Parliament. The Conservative manifesto commitments on not increasing VAT, income tax or national insurance are binding here. So Rishi Sunak is left with the first rise in corporation tax since Dennis Healey's 1974 Budget. It turns a careful strategy of using corporation tax as a lever for foreign investment on its head. For many in the vanguard of the Conservative Brexit movement, very low levels of this tax were one of the building blocks of ""Singapore-on-Thames"". Singapore is staying in South East Asia. The timing of this tax rise at the end of a Parliament is not the normal order of things. But the Covid pandemic is far from normal. However, the watchdog warned that economic uncertainty remained ""considerable"", and would depend on controlling variants of the virus. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the chancellor was ""betting on a recovery fuelled by a consumer spending blitz"". He added: ""The chancellor may think that this is time for a victory lap, but I'm afraid this Budget won't feel so good for the millions of key workers who are having their pay frozen, for the businesses swamped by debt, and the families paying more in council tax."" Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Ten ways the Budget affects your finances Business rates holiday extended to June Furlough to be extended until September Unemployment is expected to peak at a lower rate of 6.5%, keeping it well below levels seen during the 2008 financial crisis. However, this means half a million more people are expected to be out of work by the end of this year. Government borrowing is expected to rise to a peacetime high of Â£354.6bn this year to help pay for economic support measures. The size of the UK's debt pile is also expected to remain larger than the economy until at least the middle of the decade. Mr Sunak said: ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" From April, he will alsofreeze the amount of money employees earnbefore paying income tax at Â£12,570 until the middle of the decade. The OBR estimates an extra 1.3 million people will start to pay income tax by 2026 as a result of the freeze. The level at which employees start paying the higher, 40% rate of tax will also be frozen at Â£50,270 from April, dragging an extra million people into the band within five years.

BBC reporter freed by Ethiopia's militaryGirmay Gebru is freed without charge after being detained in the conflict-hit Tigray region on Monday.,"It is not clear why the BBC's Girmay Gebru was detained The BBC reporter in Ethiopia's conflict-hit region of Tigray has been released without charge. Girmay Gebru was taken from a cafÃ© in the regional capital, Mekelle, on Monday, and detained by the military. A local journalist, Tamirat Yemane, and two translators - Alula Akalu and Fitsum Berhane, who were working for the Financial Times and the AFP news agency - have also been freed. No official reason has been given for their detention. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent US 'gravely concerned' about Ethiopia atrocities Tigray at risk of huge 'humanitarian disaster' Girmay, who works for BBC Tigrinya, says he is happy to be home after two days in detention. It is not clear whether four of Girmay's neighbours detained alongside him on Monday have also been released. The BBC says it is ""pleased and relieved"" Girmay has been released. ""We are seeking a full explanation from the authorities as to why he and others were arrested when they had clearly committed no offence,"" the BBC said. Ethiopia's government has been fighting regional forces in Tigray since November. After months of an effective media blackout since the start of the conflict in Tigray, the government granted access to some international media organisations last week. How a massacre in Ethiopiaâs sacred city unfolded The Nobel Peace Prize winner who sent his troops to battle 'I lost my hand when a soldier tried to rape me' Medics on the run: 'I hid in the woods to flee shooting' Both AFP and the Financial Times had received permission to visit the region. Despite this, their workers were detained, which led to condemnation from the international community. The US government joined media rights organisations in calling for the media workers' release. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said their detention was inconsistent with the Ethiopian government's commitment to allow international media access to Tigray. This is not the first time media workers have been arrested in Ethiopia since the conflict began. In January police detained a cameramanworking for Reuters news agency who was covering the Tigray conflict. Kumerra Gemechu was held for 12 days before being released without charge. Just over two weeks later, Dawit Kebede Araya, a reporter with the state-owned broadcaster Tigray TV was shot dead in Mekelle.

Budget 2021: The challenge facing Sunak,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget will be one of the most-closely watched in years, as the government grapples with the enormous economic costs of the Covid-19 pandemic, and as he charts a financial roadmap for the country. In his 3 March statement, the chancellor will outline the state of the UK economy and its outlook for the future - and give details of the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. So how is the UK economy faring under the twin impacts of coronavirus and Brexit? In the following charts, we take a snapshot of the nation's economic health - highlighting some of the economic challenges facing the chancellor. The UK's national debt has reached its highest level since 1963 - reflecting the huge cost of pandemic support measures such as the furlough scheme. National debt here means the total amount the government owes to its lenders - it is the accumulation of borrowing over many years. So far this year, the annual total for government borrowing - the amount the government borrows to make up for the gap between what it spends and what it raises in taxes - has reached Â£270.6bn, which is Â£222bn more than a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that this figure could reach Â£393.5bn by the end of the financial year in March. This would be the highest amount in any year since the Second World War. But it is also worth pointing out that this figure has been above 100% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or annual national income in 131 of the last 320 years. The 21st Century so far has been one of rising levels of public sector net borrowing (how much both central and local government have borrowed to carry out their spending programmes). Last month's figure was Â£8.8bn, the highest January borrowing amount since monthly records began in 1993. As a result of the pandemic, public sector net debt has risen by Â£316.4bn over the 10 months since last April to an all-time high of Â£2.1 trillion. Unemployment is currently 5.1%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the highest figure for five years, and shows the effects of lockdowns on the economy due to the pandemic, with many workplaces forced to close their doors. So far, this hasn't resulted in a rapid rise in unemployment, as the furlough support scheme has helped to protect jobs, but this could change if the scheme ends as planned in April. Most economists expect the unemployment rate to continue rising in 2021. However, the roll-out of Covid vaccines is happening quickly and this may help to keep unemployment down if it allows a staged re-start of the UK economy. Young people have been hit particularly hard by the labour market fallout from coronavirus, with workers aged under 24 accounting for nearly half of the total fall in employment during the economic slump, according to research by the Institute for Employment Studies (IES). At the same time, more people are chasing fewer jobs, so young people are struggling to enter the employment market. Significantly, young people account for 46% of the overall fall in employment during the pandemic - even though they only account for just one in nine of the workforce. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hinted that furlough support for workers will continue beyond April, as he pledged not to ""pull the rug out"" from under the UK economy when he unveiled plans to ease the national lockdown in four steps. If the government does not extend the job support schemes, then the latest forecast from the Bank of England suggests that UK unemployment will reach 7.75% during the summer. Full-time work has risen during the pandemic, despite the impact of Covid on the labour market. However, the numbers of those in part-time jobs or self-employed have dropped, as freelancers and those in precarious work bear the brunt of the crisis. Campaign groups are calling on the chancellor to plug gaps in schemes such as the self-employed income support scheme (SEISS) to support millions of self-employed people and other workers excluded from furlough. The Resolution Foundation think tank says that 2.3 million workers are missing out on help because they are not covered by SEISS. UK house prices climbed 8.5% last year - that's the highest annual growth rate since October 2014 - with the average UK house price reaching a record high of Â£252,000 in December 2020. The North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%. One of the factors behind the rise has been the stamp duty holiday in England that was introduced last July. However, if the tax break ends on 31 March as planned, sales and house price rises are likely to slow afterwards. What is the Budget and when will it happen?

What help are the self-employed getting?,"More help for the self-employed has been announced in the Budget, with grants available until the end of September. These will be the first payments available to an estimated 600,000 people who missed out on earlier support because they couldn't demonstrate their self-employed status on their tax return. Previous claimants will also be able to apply. Two further payments will be available for self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. These represent the fourth and fifth grants paid out bythe Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS),external. The fourth covers the three-month period from February until the end of April. As with two of the previous SEISS grants, it is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. The fifth grant covers May to the end of September, but the amount available depends on loss of income. Workers whose turnover has fallen by at least 30% can still apply for a grant for up to 80% of profits, up to a value of Â£7,500 in total. Those whose income has fallen by less than that can apply for up to 30% of trading profits capped at Â£2,850. Claims can be made from next month for the fourth grant. Claims for the fifth grant will open in July. Check if you can claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,external Nearly a fifth of self-employed people - 600,000 people - missed out on previous grants. That's because they had only recently started working for themselves, and so could not prove their income status on their tax return. But those who completed tax returns for the 2019-2020 financial year will qualify for these new payments, provided they filed their return by midnight on 2 March 2021. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. (Although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE). As a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income have been ineligible for SEISS grants, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Why can't some workers get Covid help? Ten ways the Budget will affect you The chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year. If they suffered any loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to Â£2,500 per month. Help was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months, and businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans. This video can not be played ""I'm devastated that I have been penalised because of my husband's death"" More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up, giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022. Those with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis. This is how it has worked: HMRC uses existing information to identify those eligible and invite applications The application requires people to confirm they meet the eligibility requirements It will be paid straight into a bank account, which eligible taxpayers need to confirm on their application form There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of Â£781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash. Of those eligible for previous grants, 77% have taken up the offer - a total of 2.6 million people, averaging around Â£10,800 in payments each. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education The chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

Five things to look out for in the Budget,"Chancellors typically view Budgets as political theatre - a moment to set the tone as they show off their wisdom, generosity and vision for the future. But when Rishi Sunak lays out the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday it will not be him taking centre stage, but the ongoing crisis engulfing the nation's health and finances. The government has borrowed a record Â£270bn so far fighting the pandemic and has to come up with a way of paying it back. But it also needs to continue supporting the millions still out of work or on furlough due to lockdown. What is the Budget and when will it happen? How much will coronavirus cost the UK? Ahead of the speech, Mr Sunak has promisedmore money for the vaccination rollout;a Â£5bn scheme to help High Street businesses reopen;and a mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers. But he's warned of tough economic times ahead and there are reports that he plans to raise some taxes. Here are five things to look out for in Wednesday's speech: The chancellor has already said he ""is preparing a Budget that provides support for people"" as unemployment hovers at a five-year high and four million workers are on furlough. On Wednesday, he is set to announce the furlough support scheme will be extended until the end of September, with employers asked to contribute to workers' salaries from July. From then, employers will be expected to contribute 10%, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens. Employees will continue to receive 80% of their salary for hours not worked until the scheme ends. He is also tipped to extend a Â£20-per-week uplift to Universal Credit for six months, after intense pressure from MPs and charities to do more to help the poor get through the pandemic. Some want him to go further and make the uplift permanent - but the chancellor may resist as he struggles to get government borrowing under control. How does the furlough scheme work? How could the Budget affect universal credit? Mr Sunak may have promised grants of up to Â£18,000 to get businesses going again, but the bigger question is what he will do about business rates. MPs across the board say the tax, which is calculated using the value of a company's premises, is unfair and outdated. The boss of Next, Lord Simon Wolfson,recently told the BBC that a huge number of shops will have to close unnecessarily.high streets couldif rates aren't reformed. The chancellor is likely to leave the thorny question of what to do about rates - including levying a so called ""Amazon tax"" on online retailers - until the autumn. However, reports suggest he will extend the business rates holiday - brought in last year to support shops - beyond its current end date of 31 March and into the summer. Despite the anticipated generosity, the chancellor has said he will use the Budget to ""level"" with the public about the challenges facing the economy and the need to repay the vast sums of public money spent during the crisis. According to reports, Mr Sunak is likely to announce some tax increases - although whatever he does will have to fit around with the Conservative party manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. Some think he will instead raise corporation tax from its current level of 19% to 23%, which is still below the G7 average. The rise would be staggered over the course of the parliament, reportedly bringing in Â£12bn. There are also rumours he will freeze the personal income tax allowance, which usually rises in line with inflation, pushing many taxpayers into higher bands and netting HMRC about Â£6bn. Tory backbenchers are strongly opposed to tax rises, while the Labour leader Keir Starmer has warned they risk ""choking off"" a rapid economic recovery. But ex-Conservative leader Lord Hague has said ""personal and business"" taxes must rise to help government finances. Southampton is teaming up with Portsmouth as part of a south coast freeport bid The chancellor is likely to set out his vision for a post-Covid (and post-Brexit) economy, which could mean more money for ""levelling up"" different parts of the UK. According to the Financial Times, he is preparing to announce the locations offreeports- special economic zones with low taxes that would help stimulate regional growth. He's also expected to announce more funding to help the UK meet its decarbonisation goals. There are likely to be measures to promote more environmentally friendly homes and renewable energy - but he is not expected to raise fuel duty. The stamp duty holiday introduced last year not only propped up the housing market at the start of the crisis, but also drove up the average value of a home by 8.5% in 2020. That tax break is up at the end of March, and many buyers have found themselves facing big bills if they don't complete their transactions on time. However, Mr Sunak will extend stamp duty holiday to prevent this cliff edge, reports suggest. The government mortgage guarantee scheme will offer 95% mortgages for houses worth up to Â£600,000. It is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, which closed to new loans at the end of 2016. This is a policy that the Treasury says ""reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis"". But housing charity Shelter said that scheme increased house prices by 1.4%, making housing less affordable for many. What is the stamp duty holiday and when does it end?

What is the Budget and what time does it happen?,"On Budget day the chancellor usually holds up a traditional red box full of financial documents On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget. He'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on. Each year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services. The Budget speech will be delivered onWednesday 27 October. It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. This year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: It's the second of the year - there was a Budget in March too It comes on the same day asthe results of a spending review,external, which details how government will fund public services for the next three years After the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing. The Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid. A number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise inthe minimum wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50and anend to the public sector pay freeze. The chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions: Reducing the UK's net greenhouse emissions to zero by 2050 to combat climate change Levelling up - bringing jobs and investment to the poorer regions of the UK. Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Though many businesses are open again, the impact of the pandemic on government finances will last for years Measures such as thefurlough scheme- which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic. To close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. In the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed Â£320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. Economists expect it to borrow around Â£180bn more this year, another enormous sum. During his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead. Where does the government borrow billions from? The government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises. One major tax rise was announced in September - the Â£12bnHealth and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT. There has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier. At the same time,the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills. He is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. Six things that could affect you in the Budget Why is the cost of living going up? Overall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England. The government has already said thatthe NHS in England will receive an extra Â£5.9bnto help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. But other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport,are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgetsnext year. They have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful. Could alcohol duty be reformed in the Budget? Some parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. Others, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December. If the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rulecalled the Barnett formula.

Sunak set to spend but begins to think about caution,"The never knowingly under-hyped Rishi Sunak will give what he has already described as a ""Budget like no other"". The Covid crisis has certainly led him to do things that no other Conservative chancellor has. The government shut down much of the economy, meaning shops were shuttered, tills were empty, incomes collapsed. It filled much of the gap with an alphabet soup of what the Treasury would drily term ""interventions"" - CBILS, CJRS, SEISS, the CCFF, and so on - essentially different ways of filling people's pockets with enormous amounts of cash in a time of crisis. Alongside that there have been the huge costs of PPE, the test-and-trace programme and vaccines. Some people, some of the self-employed for example, have not been caught by the safety net stitched together at high speed. But there is no doubt that it has made a huge difference in the last year. One senior minister, perhaps not that modestly, suggests: ""One day we will be through this, and we will look back and realise that we prevented mass unemployment."" There was a feeling at the start of the pandemic that there was no choice. And, with the country still in lockdown, that logic persists. So, however the chancellor presents his decisions on Wednesday, extending emergency support is a political no-brainer, over which he has simply had not much choice. And this time, perhaps, he has to get out ahead of the argument, rather than risk being dragged there as schemes get close to their end dates. George Osborne was a rather different chancellor, at a rather different time Mr Sunak's warm-up slogan is ""We're using the full measure of our fiscal firepower to protect the jobs and livelihoods of the British people"". The Budget won't just be about carrying on the emergency support, however, with a hefty dollop of Brand Sunak, with a TV press conference and sofa chat on Wednesday evening, on top of the traditional red box doorstep and green bench moments. It will also be about how he hopes to return the Tories to their more traditional trademark - being careful with the country's cash. There won't be a return to the kind of political argument over the deficit and the debate that David Cameron and George Osborne dominated in the early part of the last decade. As one Treasury minister said: ""Austerity? You just can't do it now."" That's partly because the Tories made lots of pricey commitments in their election manifesto, and partly because Boris Johnson is, for a Conservative, a spender not a saver (even hypothetical bridges don't come cheap). But the economic conversation is different this time. Interest rates are rock-bottom. Much of the debt the government has run up has been bought by the Bank of England. And governments around the world have been spending and borrowing eye-watering amounts to get through this emergency. There's a really goodexplanation of how it all works here. In short, there isn't unbearable pressure on the chancellor to start saying how, and when, he'll start trying to close the gap between what the government's been spending, and what it takes into its coffers. And no-one, not even the self-described hawk former Chancellor Lord Hammond, thinks that theoverall debt will be paid off for decades. But, conscious of the Tory trademark, Mr Sunak will start talking about how to start balancing the books too. There has been a lot of speculation (it's the Budget) about raising taxes, and in particular corporation tax - the tax firms pay on their profits. That's notable because it would be a reversal of one of his predecessor Mr Osborne's flagship policies. But also he would face a lot of opposition in his party, and outside, not just on the principle of raising taxes on business from Conservatives, but for doing so during what is still a huge economic emergency. One prominent economist even told me it was ""economically bonkers"" to consider raising taxes now, in the hope of then cutting them in a couple of years. It is indeed, despite public protestations that he hasn't said this to his MPs, at least part of the Treasury's calculation that it would be better to increase taxes soon, to ensure that 2024's is a tax-cutting, pre-election Budget. One Treasury minister suggests that raising taxes, while also looking like you are concerned with balancing the books in the long term, neutralises Labour: ""If we take all the New Labour clothes, where do they go?"" Labour's angst over what to tax and when in the last few days bears some of that out. But, as with any Budget, the calculations are not just for the carefully choreographed ""grid"" of announcements and speculation in the run-up to the moment itself, not even for the speech itself and the spreadsheets that get pored over in the hours after, but for setting a path, political and economic, for months - and years - to come.

Analysis: Crucial Budget for business,"There has arguably never been a moment in living memory where business and government need each other more than now. Clinging together like the passengers in the front car of a rollercoaster - this Budget is the moment the photo is snapped after the sickening plunge, grimaces fixed for the ride ahead. Business needs the government to go on another massive spending splurge to get us to the other side of lockdown. In many ways, the ""roadmap"" out of lockdown already told us the most important stuff that will be in the Budget. Furlough, the business rates holiday, additional grants and VAT deferrals and cuts for hospitality are all pretty much guaranteed to the end of June, when the government hopes firms will be able to operate with few restrictions. After that, the roles start to reverse. Westminster will need help from businesses to preserve and create millions of jobs. Companies will need incentives to invest, build, hire and train - particularly younger workers who have suffered the most and on whose economic future the success of this moment may be judged for decades. Governments can encourage, but ultimately it is businesses which create. Budget 2021: The challenges facing Rishi Sunak Mortgage guarantee to help buyers with 5% deposit BBC editors on what to expect in the Budget Increased capital allowances, the expansion of youth training programmes and subsidies like the Kickstart Scheme are all expected in a speech behind which the mantra ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" will be almost audible from the Treasury building. The tight embrace between government and business seems a long way since the concerns of business were swatted away with a four-letter ""swish"" by a prime minister who saw them as an irritant in the project of getting Brexit done. The UK is in more debt than it's been in for more than 50 years. At over Â£2 trillion, it is equivalent to 100% of its entire annual income for the first time since the early 1960s, when debt was still on a downward trajectory from spending on World War Two. By far the most powerful weapon against debt is growth: it has a doubly positive effect. It increases the denominator (the bottom number) of the debt to GDP ratio, while reducing the numerator (the top bit) by keeping the bill for benefits like Universal Credit lower. That is why the next twist on this rollercoaster ride is the most perilous. No-one really knows how many of the almost five million workers still on furlough have a job to go back to. More than anything, this Budget is about how many of them can return to, or find new, work. This video can not be played What factors could shape Rishi Sunak's thinking in his 2021 Budget? There will be some eye-catching whizzes and bangs as the government experiments with ideas like freeports, drums up extra funding for start-ups and proposes looser stock market listing rules to grow new firms and attract international investors. But sooner or later - and I suspect the emphasis will be later than recent headlines suggest - the government will need businesses help to pay off some the UK's enormous debts. Corporation tax will rise slowly. But this is perhaps a good example of how little politics figures in this Budget. The chancellor arguably has more to fear from his own backbenches than he does from a Labour party, who find themselves in the unusual position of siding with the very MPs in their opposition on tax rises on businesses - who already enjoy the lowest rates in the G8. But corporation tax is pretty small beer anyway. It contributes less than 8% of all tax collected by the government, compared with the 45% it receives from income tax and National Insurance from individuals who have - you guessed it - jobs, jobs, jobs. The government is also scared that the ""free money"" window may be closing. Ever since the financial crisis, governments have been able to borrow at close to zero rates of interest. There are signs that is changing. A 1% rise in borrowing costs will cost the government five times more than it will get by raising the corporation tax rate by 1%. That is why the government and businesses will need to hold each others' hands on a ride they really are in together. What is the Budget and when will it happen?

Johnson hails âBudget for recoveryâ,"After earlier setting out his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak tells a No 10 briefing ""our plan is working"" But he warns ""it is going to take us a long time to fully recover from the damage coronavirus has done to our economy"" Sunak defends his plan to increase corporation tax to 25% from 2023, saying it is ""still an internationally competitive rate"" A million more people will also start paying income tax - Sunak promises taxes will be spent on funding ""strong public services"" The furlough scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages - will be extended until the end of September Universal credit top-up of Â£20 per week will continue for a further six months But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer calls it a Budget that ""papers over the cracks"" He says there is no plan to ""fix"" social care or the NHS or to address inequality Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage of the Budget here.

Thanks for following along with us. Goodnight. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the Budget gives a lot on emergency pandemic support for the economy, but takes in the form of tax changes. This video can not be played Budget 2021: BBC political editor on Sunakâs economics Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Million, billion trillionâ¦ When the numbers get bigger and bigger, the words can start
to sound the same. But a billion is a thousand times bigger than a million. And
a trillion is a thousand times bigger than a billion. To put that into perspective, if a million seconds adds up
to 11 and a half days, a billion seconds add up to 33 and a half years - and a
trillion seconds? More than 33,000 years. An awful lot, in other words. But in a modern economy we
spend an awful lot. If you take the total money spent on healthcare in the UK,
it would, (according to the Office for National Statistics), take less than five
years to spend Â£1tn. Alternatively Â£1tn could buy you more than four million
houses at the average UK property price, or fund more than 500 NASA missions to
Mars. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take. Business will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level. The deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice. ""Honest Rishi Sunak"", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid-19 over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes. Boxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers. Despite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid-19, public spending overall is still set to contract. Rishi Sunak has done much more than extend the emergency lifelines - the modern-day Conservatives will raise taxes to a proportion of national income not seen since the 1960s. Even before the pandemic, the prime minister had little appetite to pare back public spending. But the past year has ended any Tory dreams of a lean and low tax economy. And with any flicker to the cost of borrowing, or an even more prolonged pandemic, what is already a grim picture for the country's books may become tougher still. Here's a summary of the key Budget announcements:  You can read full details of all the announcements here. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter man on phone The Budget is packed with policies that will affect your finances. Here are just some of the ways: Paying the wages of those on furlough:The furlough scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - has been extended until September. Jabs, then jobs:The extra Â£1.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. Support for the self-employed:Support for the self-employed comes in the form of grants. From next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to Â£7,500 in total. But changes to how the scheme works are coming. Finding the deposit for a mortgage:The chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan. Read the full guide to find out more. One of the biggest headlines from the Budget is the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of September. The chancellor confirmed the Job Retention Support scheme will continue as the UK goes through the final stages of the pandemic. Almost five million people are still on furlough, which covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they can't work, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per month. As the economy opens up over the summer, employers who use the scheme will have to start paying into it. But workers will still receive up to 80% of their pay packet for hours they can't work. Find out more about who is eligible for furlough. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank, believes the chancellor is taking a big risk in lifting the UK's corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, starting in 2023. âWhat we can be sure of is that
Rishi Sunak has spent big again, extending some support right through 2021 at a
cost of an additional Â£60bn or more,"" he says. ""As a result borrowing is now
forecast to again be above 10% of national income in the coming financial year. But he adds: ""Whether the big fiscal tightening planned for subsequent years will actually
happen is less certain. It continues to depend on spending being lower than
planned prior to the pandemic. And it also depends on a large increase in
corporation tax actually being implemented without additional measures to at
least ease its long-run impact,"" Mr Johnson says. ""Make no mistake, this proposed increase in the
main rate of corporation tax is a big reversal of decades of policy direction
and a significant risk. For all the rhetoric about it leaving the headline rate
here below that in other G7 countries, oureffectivetax rate will
be relatively high."" The chancellor announced that two further grants will be offered to self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. An estimated 600,000 newly self-employed workers will be able to claim the support for the first time, using their 2019-2020 tax return. They missed out on the earlier income support grants because they couldn't prove their self-employed status. Those most affected by the pandemic will be able to claim up to 80% of their average trading profits, subject to a maximum cap. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. Find out more about what help is available to the self-employed Laura Mvula performs at Gorilla in Manchester - a venue that narrowly avoided closure in 2020 Entertainment and arts bodies have broadly welcomed the Budget announcements, while also demanding greater support and clarity. The chancellor announced Â£390m to help arts venues in England, including theatres, museums and galleries, reopen. The lion's share (Â£300m) will go into the pre-existing Culture Recovery Fund, and Â£90m will go to helping national museums and cultural bodies. Elsewhere, Mr Sunak announced that the Film and TV Production Restart Scheme will be extended for six months until 31 December 2021. Reacting to the Budget, Music Venue Trust boss Mark Davyd welcomed the extensions to furlough, support for the self-empolyed and the VAT cut on ticket sales. ""These measures are supportive of the next steps in the campaign to reopen every venue safely"" he said. Greg Parmley, CEO of LIVE, the UK's official industry body for live music, said he ""warmly welcomed"" the additional financial support, which he described as ""due recognition from [the] government that the live music industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic"". ""The extension of the reduced 5% rate of VAT, in particular, will provide significant support to businesses who have had their revenue decimated over the past year,"" he said. Read more here Reality Check There were several references to ""levelling up"" in Wednesday's Budget. It was also one of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most-used terms of the 2019 election campaign. The idea is that people and communities that feel they have been left behind get a chance to catch up. So far, what it means in practice and if there's any way its success can be judged, is a bit vague. Many organisations have put forward suggestions of things that need to be addressed such as employment rates, pay, health and formal education, but there seems to be fairly broad agreement that one of the central issues is the differences in productivity between regions - that's the amount of value created per hour worked.

Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Rishi Sunakâs
big day is in some ways a big gamble - a gamble that the swift roll-out of
jabs will underpin the recovery and will do some of the heavy lifting in
repairing public finances by boosting tax receipts. But once the various
existing support packages are tailed off in the coming months, there are two
key unanswered questions. Firstly, where will the support for job creation come from? And where, asks the governmentâs own fiscal watchdog, is the provision for public
services going forward, in particular for health? From track and tracing, to dealing with possible new mutant strains, the challenge of dealing with the coronavirus doesnât just go away. The chancellorâs plans have him switching
from giving to taking mode in the next few years, but the reality may be quite
different. Rishi Sunak's media briefing came after his Budget speech today. He began by saying he wants to be ""honest about the problems we face"", and said and it will take ""a long time"" to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. He repeatedthe headline policies from the Budget:  In response to questions from journalists, Mr Sunak said: Ben Riley-Smith from the Daily Telegraph asks if the government will rule out rises in capital gains tax, and if the UK economy should open earlier if vaccination data says it's safe to do so. Rishi Sunak says that he cannot comment on fiscal policy beyond what's been announced today in the budget. He says he wants the roadmap to reopening the country to be ""cautious but irreversible"", so once the economy is reopened, he doesn't want to have to do another lockdown. And that, is the last question of the press conference. Graham Hiscott of the Daily Mirror asks if the chancellor will extend support schemes if the timetable for easing restrictions slips. He also asks why there is no pay rise for many public sector workers. Rishi Sunak says the government purposely extended support schemes beyond the end of the current timetable to allow for any changes to the roadmap. On public sector pay, he says wages are falling in the private sector but not in the public sector and that ""I thought, for reasons of fairness, it was reasonable to take a more targeted approach to public sector pay"". He says people in the NHS will receive a pay rise and that those in the public sector, who earn less than Â£24,000, will see their pay will go up by 1%. George Parker from the FT asks about the levelling up programme. He notes that 40 of the 45 areas that will get support are represented by Tory MPs, including the Chancellor's own constituency. Was fair criteria used he asks or did politics influence the decision? Rishi Sunak says there is an index of economic need and it is transparently published. He stresses that no area is excluded from bidding - the areas named today are those that have been identified as need extra support. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The governmentâs
spending watchdog believes that, between last March and the end of this month,
the state will have borrowed a Â£355bn - a peacetime record. Even as we move
towards recovery next year, borrowing will remain very high. Money is still
required to fight coronavirus, and to supporting people and businesses through
the economic shutdown. And that shutdown
doesnât do much for the tax take. If the economy
does grow as the chancellor hopes then borrowing should then return pretty steadily to more normal levels. But, as in so
many other things, the future is very uncertain and depends on how quickly we
escape the pandemic. The temporary Â£20 a week universal credit increase has been
extended until the end of September, affecting more than 5.5 million
households. The boost was introduced in April 2020, to help struggling
families during the pandemic. It was set to finish at the end of this month. Working tax credit claimants will also get an equivalent
increase for the next six months, through a one-off payment of Â£500. Find out more about what the
changes mean for youhere. Philip Aldrick from The Times asks what gives Mr Sunak confidence that tax rises in 2023 will not ""choke off recovery"". Rishi Sunak says it is ""not right"" to compare the past ten years of public finances with what's happening now during a pandemic. He says the government wants businesses to invest, which is why the corporation tax increase only comes in two years, after the Office for Budget Responsibility expects the effects of coronavirus to have left the UK economy. He says it is important to remember that corporation tax is a tax on profits, which means only successful companies will make significant contributions from it. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Sunak to set out recovery plans in BudgetThe chancellor will promise to do ""whatever it takes"" to help the UK's pandemic-damaged economy.","This video can not be played The chancellor sets out a three-part plan to âprotect the jobs and livelihoods of the British peopleâ. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled more support for workers and businesses struggling with lockdown in his first Budget since the pandemic was declared. The furlough scheme will be extended to September - along with higher universal credit payments. Buttaxes on large company profits will rise in 2023and a million more people will start paying income tax. It will take the UK's tax burden to its highest level since the 1960s, said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget measures to salvage the UK's Covid-ravaged economy were ""nowhere near ambitious enough"". Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Sunak hails 'swifter and more sustained' recovery Million more set to pay income tax by 2026 In his Budget speech, Mr Sunak said unemployment will be lower - and growth higher - than previously thought as the UK emerges from lockdown later this year, citing forecasts from the OBR watchdog. But he warned that repairing the long-term economic damage ""will take time"", with the economy in five years' time predicted to be 3% smaller than it would have been without the pandemic. Despite the Â£280bn of support already committed to protecting the economy, the harm done by coronavirus had been ""acute"", he told MPs. ""Our economy has shrunk by 10% - the largest fall in over 300 years. Our borrowing is the highest it has been outside of wartime. ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" The headline rate of corporation tax will go up from 19% to 25% from 2023, although smaller firms will be exempt. And the freeze on income tax thresholds is expected tobring 1.3 million more people into paying income tax- and a million more into paying at the higher rate. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Budget is set to raise an extra Â£29bn by 2025-26, which was ""big by recent standards"". And it added that the UK's tax ""burden"" is set to rise to its ""highest sustained level"" ever. IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""Mr Sunak made much of his desire to be honest and to level with the British people. ""The fact that he felt constrained to raise taxes by hitting companies and through freezing allowances, rather than through more explicit rises in people's taxes, suggests there are limits to how far he wants to level with us, as he attempts to raise the overall tax burden to its highest sustained level in history."" There has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take. Business will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level. The deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice. ""Honest Rishi Sunak"", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes. Boxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers. Despite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid, public spending overall is still set to contract. The chancellor extended the furlough scheme to September, paying up to 80% of people's wages - and announced further grants for self-employed people, with the scheme widened to include 600,000 who were not previously entitled, including many newly self-employed people. He alsoextended the Â£20-a-week top-up to universal creditfor six months. Other Budget measures include: Anincrease the limit on contactless paymentsfrom Â£45 to Â£100 Eight 'freeports' in England, with lower taxes and ""cheaper customs"" Business rates holiday in England extended by three months Â£100m to set up a taskforce to tackle fraud in government Covid schemes More money for vaccine roll-out Â£5bn to helpHigh Street firms reopen Return of 95% mortgagesbacked by the government scheme to aid first-time buyers Â£408m for museums, theatres and galleries in England to help them reopen when Covid restrictions ease Â£150m to help communities take over pubs in danger of closing All alcohol duties will be frozen, which Mr Sunak said would help pubs and restaurants recover, and there will be no increase in fuel duty. But duty on cigarettes will go up by 2%, plus inflation. The reduced 5% VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector will be extended for six months to 30 September, and will not return to the full standard rate of 20% until April next year. Mr Sunak also announced that 750 civil service jobs at the Treasury will be transferred to Darlington, in the north-east of England, and there will be more than Â£1bn shared out among 45 struggling towns in England. This video can not be played Budget 2021: Who is Rishi Sunak and what does he believe? At a post-Budget Downing Street press conference, Mr Sunak vowed to protect people and businesses ""well beyond the end of lockdown"", and to build a ""fairer and more just"" country in the memory of those who have lost their lives to coronavirus. It comes as thelatest government figures on Wednesday showed,externala further 315 people had died with coronavirus in the UK within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis, and there were another 6,385 confirmed cases. Mr Sunak hit back at critics who say the business tax hike will choke off recovery, saying it will ""still be the lowest out of the G7 economies,"" including the US, France and Germany. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget did nothing to ""fix the NHS and social care"", reduce inequality or create more affordable homes. ""The scale of what the chancellor announced today is nowhere near ambitious enough,"" he told MPs, and he claimed Mr Sunak was ""itching to get back to his free-market principles and to pull away support as quickly as he can"". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said furlough should be in kept place ""as long as businesses and devolved governments need it"". ""This Budget is carefully laying the ground for more Tory austerity, a decade more of Conservative cuts,"" he told MPs. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine warned that the universal credit top-up will end at the same time as furlough, meaning people could lose their jobs and not receive the extra help they will need.

Chancellor to set out Covid recovery plan,"After earlier setting out his Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunak tells a No 10 briefing ""our plan is working"" But he warns ""it is going to take us a long time to fully recover from the damage coronavirus has done to our economy"" Sunak defends his plan to increase corporation tax to 25% from 2023, saying it is ""still an internationally competitive rate"" A million more people will also start paying income tax - Sunak promises taxes will be spent on funding ""strong public services"" The furlough scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages - will be extended until the end of September Universal credit top-up of Â£20 per week will continue for a further six months But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer calls it a Budget that ""papers over the cracks"" He says there is no plan to ""fix"" social care or the NHS or to address inequality Edited by Johanna Howitt BBC Politics We'll end our coverage of the Budget here.

Thanks for following along with us. Goodnight. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the Budget gives a lot on emergency pandemic support for the economy, but takes in the form of tax changes. This video can not be played Budget 2021: BBC political editor on Sunakâs economics Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Million, billion trillionâ¦ When the numbers get bigger and bigger, the words can start
to sound the same. But a billion is a thousand times bigger than a million. And
a trillion is a thousand times bigger than a billion. To put that into perspective, if a million seconds adds up
to 11 and a half days, a billion seconds add up to 33 and a half years - and a
trillion seconds? More than 33,000 years. An awful lot, in other words. But in a modern economy we
spend an awful lot. If you take the total money spent on healthcare in the UK,
it would, (according to the Office for National Statistics), take less than five
years to spend Â£1tn. Alternatively Â£1tn could buy you more than four million
houses at the average UK property price, or fund more than 500 NASA missions to
Mars. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take. Business will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level. The deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice. ""Honest Rishi Sunak"", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid-19 over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes. Boxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers. Despite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid-19, public spending overall is still set to contract. Rishi Sunak has done much more than extend the emergency lifelines - the modern-day Conservatives will raise taxes to a proportion of national income not seen since the 1960s. Even before the pandemic, the prime minister had little appetite to pare back public spending. But the past year has ended any Tory dreams of a lean and low tax economy. And with any flicker to the cost of borrowing, or an even more prolonged pandemic, what is already a grim picture for the country's books may become tougher still. Here's a summary of the key Budget announcements:  You can read full details of all the announcements here. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter man on phone The Budget is packed with policies that will affect your finances. Here are just some of the ways: Paying the wages of those on furlough:The furlough scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - has been extended until September. Jabs, then jobs:The extra Â£1.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. Support for the self-employed:Support for the self-employed comes in the form of grants. From next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to Â£7,500 in total. But changes to how the scheme works are coming. Finding the deposit for a mortgage:The chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan. Read the full guide to find out more. One of the biggest headlines from the Budget is the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of September. The chancellor confirmed the Job Retention Support scheme will continue as the UK goes through the final stages of the pandemic. Almost five million people are still on furlough, which covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they can't work, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per month. As the economy opens up over the summer, employers who use the scheme will have to start paying into it. But workers will still receive up to 80% of their pay packet for hours they can't work. Find out more about who is eligible for furlough. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank, believes the chancellor is taking a big risk in lifting the UK's corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, starting in 2023. âWhat we can be sure of is that
Rishi Sunak has spent big again, extending some support right through 2021 at a
cost of an additional Â£60bn or more,"" he says. ""As a result borrowing is now
forecast to again be above 10% of national income in the coming financial year. But he adds: ""Whether the big fiscal tightening planned for subsequent years will actually
happen is less certain. It continues to depend on spending being lower than
planned prior to the pandemic. And it also depends on a large increase in
corporation tax actually being implemented without additional measures to at
least ease its long-run impact,"" Mr Johnson says. ""Make no mistake, this proposed increase in the
main rate of corporation tax is a big reversal of decades of policy direction
and a significant risk. For all the rhetoric about it leaving the headline rate
here below that in other G7 countries, oureffectivetax rate will
be relatively high."" The chancellor announced that two further grants will be offered to self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. An estimated 600,000 newly self-employed workers will be able to claim the support for the first time, using their 2019-2020 tax return. They missed out on the earlier income support grants because they couldn't prove their self-employed status. Those most affected by the pandemic will be able to claim up to 80% of their average trading profits, subject to a maximum cap. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. Find out more about what help is available to the self-employed Laura Mvula performs at Gorilla in Manchester - a venue that narrowly avoided closure in 2020 Entertainment and arts bodies have broadly welcomed the Budget announcements, while also demanding greater support and clarity. The chancellor announced Â£390m to help arts venues in England, including theatres, museums and galleries, reopen. The lion's share (Â£300m) will go into the pre-existing Culture Recovery Fund, and Â£90m will go to helping national museums and cultural bodies. Elsewhere, Mr Sunak announced that the Film and TV Production Restart Scheme will be extended for six months until 31 December 2021. Reacting to the Budget, Music Venue Trust boss Mark Davyd welcomed the extensions to furlough, support for the self-empolyed and the VAT cut on ticket sales. ""These measures are supportive of the next steps in the campaign to reopen every venue safely"" he said. Greg Parmley, CEO of LIVE, the UK's official industry body for live music, said he ""warmly welcomed"" the additional financial support, which he described as ""due recognition from [the] government that the live music industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic"". ""The extension of the reduced 5% rate of VAT, in particular, will provide significant support to businesses who have had their revenue decimated over the past year,"" he said. Read more here Reality Check There were several references to ""levelling up"" in Wednesday's Budget. It was also one of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most-used terms of the 2019 election campaign. The idea is that people and communities that feel they have been left behind get a chance to catch up. So far, what it means in practice and if there's any way its success can be judged, is a bit vague. Many organisations have put forward suggestions of things that need to be addressed such as employment rates, pay, health and formal education, but there seems to be fairly broad agreement that one of the central issues is the differences in productivity between regions - that's the amount of value created per hour worked.

Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Rishi Sunakâs
big day is in some ways a big gamble - a gamble that the swift roll-out of
jabs will underpin the recovery and will do some of the heavy lifting in
repairing public finances by boosting tax receipts. But once the various
existing support packages are tailed off in the coming months, there are two
key unanswered questions. Firstly, where will the support for job creation come from? And where, asks the governmentâs own fiscal watchdog, is the provision for public
services going forward, in particular for health? From track and tracing, to dealing with possible new mutant strains, the challenge of dealing with the coronavirus doesnât just go away. The chancellorâs plans have him switching
from giving to taking mode in the next few years, but the reality may be quite
different. Rishi Sunak's media briefing came after his Budget speech today. He began by saying he wants to be ""honest about the problems we face"", and said and it will take ""a long time"" to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. He repeatedthe headline policies from the Budget:  In response to questions from journalists, Mr Sunak said: Ben Riley-Smith from the Daily Telegraph asks if the government will rule out rises in capital gains tax, and if the UK economy should open earlier if vaccination data says it's safe to do so. Rishi Sunak says that he cannot comment on fiscal policy beyond what's been announced today in the budget. He says he wants the roadmap to reopening the country to be ""cautious but irreversible"", so once the economy is reopened, he doesn't want to have to do another lockdown. And that, is the last question of the press conference. Graham Hiscott of the Daily Mirror asks if the chancellor will extend support schemes if the timetable for easing restrictions slips. He also asks why there is no pay rise for many public sector workers. Rishi Sunak says the government purposely extended support schemes beyond the end of the current timetable to allow for any changes to the roadmap. On public sector pay, he says wages are falling in the private sector but not in the public sector and that ""I thought, for reasons of fairness, it was reasonable to take a more targeted approach to public sector pay"". He says people in the NHS will receive a pay rise and that those in the public sector, who earn less than Â£24,000, will see their pay will go up by 1%. George Parker from the FT asks about the levelling up programme. He notes that 40 of the 45 areas that will get support are represented by Tory MPs, including the Chancellor's own constituency. Was fair criteria used he asks or did politics influence the decision? Rishi Sunak says there is an index of economic need and it is transparently published. He stresses that no area is excluded from bidding - the areas named today are those that have been identified as need extra support. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The governmentâs
spending watchdog believes that, between last March and the end of this month,
the state will have borrowed a Â£355bn - a peacetime record. Even as we move
towards recovery next year, borrowing will remain very high. Money is still
required to fight coronavirus, and to supporting people and businesses through
the economic shutdown. And that shutdown
doesnât do much for the tax take. If the economy
does grow as the chancellor hopes then borrowing should then return pretty steadily to more normal levels. But, as in so
many other things, the future is very uncertain and depends on how quickly we
escape the pandemic. The temporary Â£20 a week universal credit increase has been
extended until the end of September, affecting more than 5.5 million
households. The boost was introduced in April 2020, to help struggling
families during the pandemic. It was set to finish at the end of this month. Working tax credit claimants will also get an equivalent
increase for the next six months, through a one-off payment of Â£500. Find out more about what the
changes mean for youhere. Philip Aldrick from The Times asks what gives Mr Sunak confidence that tax rises in 2023 will not ""choke off recovery"". Rishi Sunak says it is ""not right"" to compare the past ten years of public finances with what's happening now during a pandemic. He says the government wants businesses to invest, which is why the corporation tax increase only comes in two years, after the Office for Budget Responsibility expects the effects of coronavirus to have left the UK economy. He says it is important to remember that corporation tax is a tax on profits, which means only successful companies will make significant contributions from it. Â© 2025 BBC.

Sunak to set out recovery plans in Budget,"This video can not be played The chancellor sets out a three-part plan to âprotect the jobs and livelihoods of the British peopleâ. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has unveiled more support for workers and businesses struggling with lockdown in his first Budget since the pandemic was declared. The furlough scheme will be extended to September - along with higher universal credit payments. Buttaxes on large company profits will rise in 2023and a million more people will start paying income tax. It will take the UK's tax burden to its highest level since the 1960s, said the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR). Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget measures to salvage the UK's Covid-ravaged economy were ""nowhere near ambitious enough"". Budget 2021: Key points at-a-glance Sunak hails 'swifter and more sustained' recovery Million more set to pay income tax by 2026 In his Budget speech, Mr Sunak said unemployment will be lower - and growth higher - than previously thought as the UK emerges from lockdown later this year, citing forecasts from the OBR watchdog. But he warned that repairing the long-term economic damage ""will take time"", with the economy in five years' time predicted to be 3% smaller than it would have been without the pandemic. Despite the Â£280bn of support already committed to protecting the economy, the harm done by coronavirus had been ""acute"", he told MPs. ""Our economy has shrunk by 10% - the largest fall in over 300 years. Our borrowing is the highest it has been outside of wartime. ""It's going to take this country - and the whole world - a long time to recover from this extraordinary economic situation. But we will recover."" The headline rate of corporation tax will go up from 19% to 25% from 2023, although smaller firms will be exempt. And the freeze on income tax thresholds is expected tobring 1.3 million more people into paying income tax- and a million more into paying at the higher rate. The Institute for Fiscal Studies said the Budget is set to raise an extra Â£29bn by 2025-26, which was ""big by recent standards"". And it added that the UK's tax ""burden"" is set to rise to its ""highest sustained level"" ever. IFS director Paul Johnson said: ""Mr Sunak made much of his desire to be honest and to level with the British people. ""The fact that he felt constrained to raise taxes by hitting companies and through freezing allowances, rather than through more explicit rises in people's taxes, suggests there are limits to how far he wants to level with us, as he attempts to raise the overall tax burden to its highest sustained level in history."" There has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take. Business will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level. The deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice. ""Honest Rishi Sunak"", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes. Boxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers. Despite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid, public spending overall is still set to contract. The chancellor extended the furlough scheme to September, paying up to 80% of people's wages - and announced further grants for self-employed people, with the scheme widened to include 600,000 who were not previously entitled, including many newly self-employed people. He alsoextended the Â£20-a-week top-up to universal creditfor six months. Other Budget measures include: Anincrease the limit on contactless paymentsfrom Â£45 to Â£100 Eight 'freeports' in England, with lower taxes and ""cheaper customs"" Business rates holiday in England extended by three months Â£100m to set up a taskforce to tackle fraud in government Covid schemes More money for vaccine roll-out Â£5bn to helpHigh Street firms reopen Return of 95% mortgagesbacked by the government scheme to aid first-time buyers Â£408m for museums, theatres and galleries in England to help them reopen when Covid restrictions ease Â£150m to help communities take over pubs in danger of closing All alcohol duties will be frozen, which Mr Sunak said would help pubs and restaurants recover, and there will be no increase in fuel duty. But duty on cigarettes will go up by 2%, plus inflation. The reduced 5% VAT for the hospitality and tourism sector will be extended for six months to 30 September, and will not return to the full standard rate of 20% until April next year. Mr Sunak also announced that 750 civil service jobs at the Treasury will be transferred to Darlington, in the north-east of England, and there will be more than Â£1bn shared out among 45 struggling towns in England. This video can not be played Budget 2021: Who is Rishi Sunak and what does he believe? At a post-Budget Downing Street press conference, Mr Sunak vowed to protect people and businesses ""well beyond the end of lockdown"", and to build a ""fairer and more just"" country in the memory of those who have lost their lives to coronavirus. It comes as thelatest government figures on Wednesday showed,externala further 315 people had died with coronavirus in the UK within 28 days of a coronavirus diagnosis, and there were another 6,385 confirmed cases. Mr Sunak hit back at critics who say the business tax hike will choke off recovery, saying it will ""still be the lowest out of the G7 economies,"" including the US, France and Germany. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the Budget did nothing to ""fix the NHS and social care"", reduce inequality or create more affordable homes. ""The scale of what the chancellor announced today is nowhere near ambitious enough,"" he told MPs, and he claimed Mr Sunak was ""itching to get back to his free-market principles and to pull away support as quickly as he can"". The SNP's leader at Westminster, Ian Blackford, said furlough should be in kept place ""as long as businesses and devolved governments need it"". ""This Budget is carefully laying the ground for more Tory austerity, a decade more of Conservative cuts,"" he told MPs. Liberal Democrat Treasury spokesperson Christine Jardine warned that the universal credit top-up will end at the same time as furlough, meaning people could lose their jobs and not receive the extra help they will need. Plaid Cymru said it was a ""Budget of half measures and quick fixes"", and not making the universal credit uplift permanent would ""lead to 26,000 families in Wales not being able to afford essentials in six months' time"".

What is the Budget and what time does it happen?Budget 2021: The challenge facing SunakWhat help are the self-employed getting?VideoVideoWho is Rishi Sunak and what does he believe?What we know so far about the Budget,"On Budget day the chancellor usually holds up a traditional red box full of financial documents On Wednesday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will unveil his Budget. He'll say how much of our money the government will take in taxes, and what they will spend it on. Each year, the chancellor of the exchequer - who is in charge of the government's finances - makes a Budget statement to MPs in the House of Commons. It outlines the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. It also includes big decisions on what the government will spend money on - including health, schools, police and other public services. The Budget speech will be delivered onWednesday 27 October. It usually starts at about 12:30 UK time and lasts about an hour. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer will give his response straight afterwards. This year's Autumn Budget is unusual for two reasons: It's the second of the year - there was a Budget in March too It comes on the same day asthe results of a spending review,external, which details how government will fund public services for the next three years After the speech, the independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) - which monitors government spending - will publish a report on how the economy is doing. The Budget is likely to include help to support businesses and individuals recover from the economic effects of Covid. A number of measures have been announced in advance of the Budget, including a rise inthe minimum wage from Â£8.91 per hour to Â£9.50and anend to the public sector pay freeze. The chancellor will likely set out some more details of the government's long term ambitions: Reducing the UK's net greenhouse emissions to zero by 2050 to combat climate change Levelling up - bringing jobs and investment to the poorer regions of the UK. Budget 2021: What has already been announced? Though many businesses are open again, the impact of the pandemic on government finances will last for years Measures such as thefurlough scheme- which finished at the end of September - were expensive, and government income is down because it collected less money in tax during the pandemic. To close the gap between higher spending and less money, the government has had to borrow more. In the year ending April 2021, the government borrowed Â£320bn - the highest figure seen outside wartime. Economists expect it to borrow around Â£180bn more this year, another enormous sum. During his Budget speech, the Chancellor will set out the latest borrowing forecasts for the years ahead. Where does the government borrow billions from? The government needs to cut the gap between what it spends and what it raises. One major tax rise was announced in September - the Â£12bnHealth and Social Care Levy. This broke a promise the Conservatives made at the last election, not to raise the three biggest taxes - income tax, national insurance and VAT. There has been speculation that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier. At the same time,the cost of living is rising. So the chancellor may want to cut some taxes, such as the amount of VAT pay on energy bills. He is also expected to announce major changes to the complicated alcohol tax system, which could see sparkling wine become cheaper. Six things that could affect you in the Budget Why is the cost of living going up? Overall government spending will rise next year, with big increases already announced for health and schools in England. The government has already said thatthe NHS in England will receive an extra Â£5.9bnto help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans. But other government departments, such as courts, prisons, local government and transport,are braced for cuts to their day-to-day budgetsnext year. They have already faced a decade of tight spending, and making further cuts will be painful. Could alcohol duty be reformed in the Budget? Some parts of the Budget, such as defence spending, affect the whole of the UK. Others, such as education, only affect England. This is because Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland make their own decisions. Scotland has income tax-raising powers, which means its rates differ from the rest of the UK. The Scottish government will publish its Budget on 9 December. If the government announces extra spending on areas that only affect England, the other nations get an equivalent extra sum of money to spend as they choose, according to a rulecalled the Barnett formula.

Budget 2021: The challenge facing SunakWhat help are the self-employed getting?VideoVideoWho is Rishi Sunak and what does he believe?What we know so far about the Budget,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget will be one of the most-closely watched in years, as the government grapples with the enormous economic costs of the Covid-19 pandemic, and as he charts a financial roadmap for the country. In his 3 March statement, the chancellor will outline the state of the UK economy and its outlook for the future - and give details of the government's plans for raising or lowering taxes. So how is the UK economy faring under the twin impacts of coronavirus and Brexit? In the following charts, we take a snapshot of the nation's economic health - highlighting some of the economic challenges facing the chancellor. The UK's national debt has reached its highest level since 1963 - reflecting the huge cost of pandemic support measures such as the furlough scheme. National debt here means the total amount the government owes to its lenders - it is the accumulation of borrowing over many years. So far this year, the annual total for government borrowing - the amount the government borrows to make up for the gap between what it spends and what it raises in taxes - has reached Â£270.6bn, which is Â£222bn more than a year ago, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). The independent Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR) estimates that this figure could reach Â£393.5bn by the end of the financial year in March. This would be the highest amount in any year since the Second World War. But it is also worth pointing out that this figure has been above 100% of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) or annual national income in 131 of the last 320 years. The 21st Century so far has been one of rising levels of public sector net borrowing (how much both central and local government have borrowed to carry out their spending programmes). Last month's figure was Â£8.8bn, the highest January borrowing amount since monthly records began in 1993. As a result of the pandemic, public sector net debt has risen by Â£316.4bn over the 10 months since last April to an all-time high of Â£2.1 trillion. Unemployment is currently 5.1%, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). This is the highest figure for five years, and shows the effects of lockdowns on the economy due to the pandemic, with many workplaces forced to close their doors. So far, this hasn't resulted in a rapid rise in unemployment, as the furlough support scheme has helped to protect jobs, but this could change if the scheme ends as planned in April. Most economists expect the unemployment rate to continue rising in 2021. However, the roll-out of Covid vaccines is happening quickly and this may help to keep unemployment down if it allows a staged re-start of the UK economy. Young people have been hit particularly hard by the labour market fallout from coronavirus, with workers aged under 24 accounting for nearly half of the total fall in employment during the economic slump, according to research by the Institute for Employment Studies (IES). At the same time, more people are chasing fewer jobs, so young people are struggling to enter the employment market. Significantly, young people account for 46% of the overall fall in employment during the pandemic - even though they only account for just one in nine of the workforce. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has hinted that furlough support for workers will continue beyond April, as he pledged not to ""pull the rug out"" from under the UK economy when he unveiled plans to ease the national lockdown in four steps. If the government does not extend the job support schemes, then the latest forecast from the Bank of England suggests that UK unemployment will reach 7.75% during the summer. Full-time work has risen during the pandemic, despite the impact of Covid on the labour market. However, the numbers of those in part-time jobs or self-employed have dropped, as freelancers and those in precarious work bear the brunt of the crisis. Campaign groups are calling on the chancellor to plug gaps in schemes such as the self-employed income support scheme (SEISS) to support millions of self-employed people and other workers excluded from furlough. The Resolution Foundation think tank says that 2.3 million workers are missing out on help because they are not covered by SEISS. UK house prices climbed 8.5% last year - that's the highest annual growth rate since October 2014 - with the average UK house price reaching a record high of Â£252,000 in December 2020. The North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%. One of the factors behind the rise has been the stamp duty holiday in England that was introduced last July. However, if the tax break ends on 31 March as planned, sales and house price rises are likely to slow afterwards. What is the Budget and when will it happen?

What help are the self-employed getting?VideoVideoWho is Rishi Sunak and what does he believe?What we know so far about the Budget,"More help for the self-employed has been announced in the Budget, with grants available until the end of September. These will be the first payments available to an estimated 600,000 people who missed out on earlier support because they couldn't demonstrate their self-employed status on their tax return. Previous claimants will also be able to apply. Two further payments will be available for self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. These represent the fourth and fifth grants paid out bythe Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS),external. The fourth covers the three-month period from February until the end of April. As with two of the previous SEISS grants, it is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. The fifth grant covers May to the end of September, but the amount available depends on loss of income. Workers whose turnover has fallen by at least 30% can still apply for a grant for up to 80% of profits, up to a value of Â£7,500 in total. Those whose income has fallen by less than that can apply for up to 30% of trading profits capped at Â£2,850. Claims can be made from next month for the fourth grant. Claims for the fifth grant will open in July. Check if you can claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,external Nearly a fifth of self-employed people - 600,000 people - missed out on previous grants. That's because they had only recently started working for themselves, and so could not prove their income status on their tax return. But those who completed tax returns for the 2019-2020 financial year will qualify for these new payments, provided they filed their return by midnight on 2 March 2021. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. (Although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE). As a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income have been ineligible for SEISS grants, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Why can't some workers get Covid help? Ten ways the Budget will affect you The chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year. If they suffered any loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to Â£2,500 per month. Help was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months, and businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans. This video can not be played ""I'm devastated that I have been penalised because of my husband's death"" More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up, giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022. Those with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis. This is how it has worked: HMRC uses existing information to identify those eligible and invite applications The application requires people to confirm they meet the eligibility requirements It will be paid straight into a bank account, which eligible taxpayers need to confirm on their application form There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of Â£781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash. Of those eligible for previous grants, 77% have taken up the offer - a total of 2.6 million people, averaging around Â£10,800 in payments each. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education The chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?

Thanks for following along with us. Goodnight. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the Budget gives a lot on emergency pandemic support for the economy, but takes in the form of tax changes. This video can not be played Budget 2021: BBC political editor on Sunakâs economics Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Million, billion trillionâ¦ When the numbers get bigger and bigger, the words can start
to sound the same. But a billion is a thousand times bigger than a million. And
a trillion is a thousand times bigger than a billion. To put that into perspective, if a million seconds adds up
to 11 and a half days, a billion seconds add up to 33 and a half years - and a
trillion seconds? More than 33,000 years. An awful lot, in other words. But in a modern economy we
spend an awful lot. If you take the total money spent on healthcare in the UK,
it would, (according to the Office for National Statistics), take less than five
years to spend Â£1tn. Alternatively Â£1tn could buy you more than four million
houses at the average UK property price, or fund more than 500 NASA missions to
Mars. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take. Business will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level. The deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice. ""Honest Rishi Sunak"", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid-19 over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes. Boxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers. Despite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid-19, public spending overall is still set to contract. Rishi Sunak has done much more than extend the emergency lifelines - the modern-day Conservatives will raise taxes to a proportion of national income not seen since the 1960s. Even before the pandemic, the prime minister had little appetite to pare back public spending. But the past year has ended any Tory dreams of a lean and low tax economy. And with any flicker to the cost of borrowing, or an even more prolonged pandemic, what is already a grim picture for the country's books may become tougher still. Here's a summary of the key Budget announcements:  You can read full details of all the announcements here. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter man on phone The Budget is packed with policies that will affect your finances. Here are just some of the ways: Paying the wages of those on furlough:The furlough scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - has been extended until September. Jabs, then jobs:The extra Â£1.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. Support for the self-employed:Support for the self-employed comes in the form of grants. From next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to Â£7,500 in total. But changes to how the scheme works are coming. Finding the deposit for a mortgage:The chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan. Read the full guide to find out more. One of the biggest headlines from the Budget is the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of September. The chancellor confirmed the Job Retention Support scheme will continue as the UK goes through the final stages of the pandemic. Almost five million people are still on furlough, which covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they can't work, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per month. As the economy opens up over the summer, employers who use the scheme will have to start paying into it. But workers will still receive up to 80% of their pay packet for hours they can't work. Find out more about who is eligible for furlough. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank, believes the chancellor is taking a big risk in lifting the UK's corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, starting in 2023. âWhat we can be sure of is that
Rishi Sunak has spent big again, extending some support right through 2021 at a
cost of an additional Â£60bn or more,"" he says. ""As a result borrowing is now
forecast to again be above 10% of national income in the coming financial year. But he adds: ""Whether the big fiscal tightening planned for subsequent years will actually
happen is less certain. It continues to depend on spending being lower than
planned prior to the pandemic. And it also depends on a large increase in
corporation tax actually being implemented without additional measures to at
least ease its long-run impact,"" Mr Johnson says. ""Make no mistake, this proposed increase in the
main rate of corporation tax is a big reversal of decades of policy direction
and a significant risk. For all the rhetoric about it leaving the headline rate
here below that in other G7 countries, oureffectivetax rate will
be relatively high."" The chancellor announced that two further grants will be offered to self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. An estimated 600,000 newly self-employed workers will be able to claim the support for the first time, using their 2019-2020 tax return. They missed out on the earlier income support grants because they couldn't prove their self-employed status. Those most affected by the pandemic will be able to claim up to 80% of their average trading profits, subject to a maximum cap. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. Find out more about what help is available to the self-employed Laura Mvula performs at Gorilla in Manchester - a venue that narrowly avoided closure in 2020 Entertainment and arts bodies have broadly welcomed the Budget announcements, while also demanding greater support and clarity. The chancellor announced Â£390m to help arts venues in England, including theatres, museums and galleries, reopen. The lion's share (Â£300m) will go into the pre-existing Culture Recovery Fund, and Â£90m will go to helping national museums and cultural bodies. Elsewhere, Mr Sunak announced that the Film and TV Production Restart Scheme will be extended for six months until 31 December 2021. Reacting to the Budget, Music Venue Trust boss Mark Davyd welcomed the extensions to furlough, support for the self-empolyed and the VAT cut on ticket sales. ""These measures are supportive of the next steps in the campaign to reopen every venue safely"" he said. Greg Parmley, CEO of LIVE, the UK's official industry body for live music, said he ""warmly welcomed"" the additional financial support, which he described as ""due recognition from [the] government that the live music industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic"". ""The extension of the reduced 5% rate of VAT, in particular, will provide significant support to businesses who have had their revenue decimated over the past year,"" he said. Read more here Reality Check There were several references to ""levelling up"" in Wednesday's Budget. It was also one of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most-used terms of the 2019 election campaign. The idea is that people and communities that feel they have been left behind get a chance to catch up. So far, what it means in practice and if there's any way its success can be judged, is a bit vague. Many organisations have put forward suggestions of things that need to be addressed such as employment rates, pay, health and formal education, but there seems to be fairly broad agreement that one of the central issues is the differences in productivity between regions - that's the amount of value created per hour worked.

Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Rishi Sunakâs
big day is in some ways a big gamble - a gamble that the swift roll-out of
jabs will underpin the recovery and will do some of the heavy lifting in
repairing public finances by boosting tax receipts. But once the various
existing support packages are tailed off in the coming months, there are two
key unanswered questions. Firstly, where will the support for job creation come from? And where, asks the governmentâs own fiscal watchdog, is the provision for public
services going forward, in particular for health? From track and tracing, to dealing with possible new mutant strains, the challenge of dealing with the coronavirus doesnât just go away. The chancellorâs plans have him switching
from giving to taking mode in the next few years, but the reality may be quite
different. Rishi Sunak's media briefing came after his Budget speech today. He began by saying he wants to be ""honest about the problems we face"", and said and it will take ""a long time"" to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. He repeatedthe headline policies from the Budget:  In response to questions from journalists, Mr Sunak said: Ben Riley-Smith from the Daily Telegraph asks if the government will rule out rises in capital gains tax, and if the UK economy should open earlier if vaccination data says it's safe to do so. Rishi Sunak says that he cannot comment on fiscal policy beyond what's been announced today in the budget. He says he wants the roadmap to reopening the country to be ""cautious but irreversible"", so once the economy is reopened, he doesn't want to have to do another lockdown. And that, is the last question of the press conference. Graham Hiscott of the Daily Mirror asks if the chancellor will extend support schemes if the timetable for easing restrictions slips. He also asks why there is no pay rise for many public sector workers. Rishi Sunak says the government purposely extended support schemes beyond the end of the current timetable to allow for any changes to the roadmap. On public sector pay, he says wages are falling in the private sector but not in the public sector and that ""I thought, for reasons of fairness, it was reasonable to take a more targeted approach to public sector pay"". He says people in the NHS will receive a pay rise and that those in the public sector, who earn less than Â£24,000, will see their pay will go up by 1%. George Parker from the FT asks about the levelling up programme. He notes that 40 of the 45 areas that will get support are represented by Tory MPs, including the Chancellor's own constituency. Was fair criteria used he asks or did politics influence the decision? Rishi Sunak says there is an index of economic need and it is transparently published. He stresses that no area is excluded from bidding - the areas named today are those that have been identified as need extra support. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The governmentâs
spending watchdog believes that, between last March and the end of this month,
the state will have borrowed a Â£355bn - a peacetime record. Even as we move
towards recovery next year, borrowing will remain very high. Money is still
required to fight coronavirus, and to supporting people and businesses through
the economic shutdown. And that shutdown
doesnât do much for the tax take. If the economy
does grow as the chancellor hopes then borrowing should then return pretty steadily to more normal levels. But, as in so
many other things, the future is very uncertain and depends on how quickly we
escape the pandemic. The temporary Â£20 a week universal credit increase has been
extended until the end of September, affecting more than 5.5 million
households. The boost was introduced in April 2020, to help struggling
families during the pandemic. It was set to finish at the end of this month. Working tax credit claimants will also get an equivalent
increase for the next six months, through a one-off payment of Â£500. Find out more about what the
changes mean for youhere. Philip Aldrick from The Times asks what gives Mr Sunak confidence that tax rises in 2023 will not ""choke off recovery"". Rishi Sunak says it is ""not right"" to compare the past ten years of public finances with what's happening now during a pandemic. He says the government wants businesses to invest, which is why the corporation tax increase only comes in two years, after the Office for Budget Responsibility expects the effects of coronavirus to have left the UK economy. He says it is important to remember that corporation tax is a tax on profits, which means only successful companies will make significant contributions from it. Â© 2025 BBC.

Circuit-breaker lockdown imposed after Covid spike,"Restrictions will come into force at 00:01 GMT on Wednesday A 21-day ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown has been announced to limit the spread of Covid-19 on the Isle of Man, the chief minister has said. The island has seen a rise in cases in recent days, with some stemming froman infected ferry crew member. Howard Quayle said an increase in other - unexplained - cases indicated there was transmission ""that we cannot see and do not understand"". The new restrictions came into force at midnight. Under the new measures, people are required to stay at home unless for exercise or essential travel, avoid mixing with other households and socially distance when outside. Schools are shut to most pupils and non-essential businesses are required to close. And all hospitality and leisure venues have also shut their doors to customers although takeaway and delivery services are still allowed. People are required to stay at home except for exercise or essential travel Edward Cox, who owns the Front Porch bar in Douglas, said the lockdown was the right decision but it was ""absolutely gutting"". He added that he felt the government was not ""prepared enough"" for another outbreak and the island ""should never have got to this position"". The Â£1,500 in government support offered would ""not touch the sides"" and he would be forced to throw out large quantities of fresh food, he added. Unlikethe January lockdown, construction work is allowed to continue provided it is outdoors or in a vacant property. Financial support measures, which were put in place during the island's previous two lockdown periods, have been reactivated. In recent days, the island has seen a small number of confirmed Covid-19 cases where the source is not known, one of them in a school. Bill Shimmins MHK said the government's response to the current cluster of cases was ""akin to a slow-motion train crash"". He added that, had measures been imposed earlier, it would have avoided ""this incredibly damaging lockdown"". More than 40 Covid-19 cases have been linked to the cluster involving the ferry crew member, who tested positive for the virus on 18 February. Officials believed it was largely under control, but five unexplained cases have been identified since Friday. Mr Quayle said there was insufficient data to support measures being taken earlier and the response had to be ""proportionate"". There are currently 52 active cases of Covid-19 on the Isle of Man.

BBC reporter freed by Ethiopia's military,"It is not clear why the BBC's Girmay Gebru was detained The BBC reporter in Ethiopia's conflict-hit region of Tigray has been released without charge. Girmay Gebru was taken from a cafÃ© in the regional capital, Mekelle, on Monday, and detained by the military. A local journalist, Tamirat Yemane, and two translators - Alula Akalu and Fitsum Berhane, who were working for the Financial Times and the AFP news agency - have also been freed. No official reason has been given for their detention. Africa Live: Updates on this and other stories from the continent US 'gravely concerned' about Ethiopia atrocities Tigray at risk of huge 'humanitarian disaster' Girmay, who works for BBC Tigrinya, says he is happy to be home after two days in detention. It is not clear whether four of Girmay's neighbours detained alongside him on Monday have also been released. The BBC says it is ""pleased and relieved"" Girmay has been released. ""We are seeking a full explanation from the authorities as to why he and others were arrested when they had clearly committed no offence,"" the BBC said. Ethiopia's government has been fighting regional forces in Tigray since November. After months of an effective media blackout since the start of the conflict in Tigray, the government granted access to some international media organisations last week. How a massacre in Ethiopiaâs sacred city unfolded The Nobel Peace Prize winner who sent his troops to battle 'I lost my hand when a soldier tried to rape me' Medics on the run: 'I hid in the woods to flee shooting' Both AFP and the Financial Times had received permission to visit the region. Despite this, their workers were detained, which led to condemnation from the international community. The US government joined media rights organisations in calling for the media workers' release. US State Department spokesperson Ned Price said their detention was inconsistent with the Ethiopian government's commitment to allow international media access to Tigray. This is not the first time media workers have been arrested in Ethiopia since the conflict began. In January police detained a cameramanworking for Reuters news agency who was covering the Tigray conflict. Kumerra Gemechu was held for 12 days before being released without charge. Just over two weeks later, Dawit Kebede Araya, a reporter with the state-owned broadcaster Tigray TV was shot dead in Mekelle. Then in February, theCommittee to Protect journalists said,externalthat freelance reporter Lucy Kassa's home in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa was raided by armed men who threatened to kill her if she kept on investigating stories about the conflict in Tigray. This video can not be played What does the future hold for Ethiopia, and what challenges remain in the Tigray region? Fighting continues in Tigray despite the government declaring victory over the Tigray People's Liberation Front, which used to be the region's ruling party. Hundreds have been killed and tens of thousands displaced. There is international concern over growing reports of atrocities committed by all sides and the worsening humanitarian crisis.

"Sturgeon says Salmond conspiracy claims 'absurd'Scotland's first minister tells an inquiry that she had no motive or desire to ""get"" her predecessor.","This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says claims of conspiracy against Alex Salmond 'absurd' Nicola Sturgeon has insisted she had no reason to want to ""get"" Alex Salmond as she dismissed claims of a plot against him as ""absurd"". The first minister was speaking at the inquiry into her government's unlawful handling of harassment complaints against her predecessor. She apologised to the two women who had made the complaints, saying they were let down by a ""very serious error"". But she rejected much of Mr Salmond's version of events. And she insisted her government had nothing to hide, despite accusations of a cover-up from opposition parties. Mr Salmond has previously claimed several people within the SNP and Scottish government - including Ms Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, the party's chief executive - were involved in a ""deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort"" to damage his reputation, even to the extent of attempting to have him imprisoned. In her eight hours of evidence to the committee, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""thought often"" about the impact of the past three years on Mr Salmond, but said he had shown no sign of thinking of others. Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's evidence session What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon? The Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon story She said she had watched Mr Salmond give evidence to the inquiry committee last Friday and had found  herself ""searching for any sign at all that he recognised how difficult this had been for others too"". The first minister added: ""First of all, for women who believed his behaviour towards them was inappropriate. ""But also for those of us who have campaigned alongside him, worked with him, cared for him, and consider him a friend - who now stand unfairly accused of plotting against him."" Mr Salmond told the inquiry last week that he had ""no doubt"" that Ms Sturgeon had breached the ministerial code. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that Mr Salmond had been cleared of all of the sexual assault allegations against him by a High Court jury. But she added: ""I know just from what he told me that his behaviour was not always appropriate. ""And yet across six hours of testimony, there was not a single word of regret, reflection or even a simple acknowledgement of that. ""I can only hope that in private, the reality might be different."" The first minister said the female complainers had come forward ""of their own free will"", and that while some offered support to each other, this was not evidence of a conspiracy. The inquiry meeting is being held at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh She went on to tell the cross-party committee of MSPs that Mr Salmond had been one of the ""closest people to me in my entire life"". She added: ""I would never have wanted to 'get' Alex Salmond - I would never, ever have wanted any of this to happen. I had no motive, intention or desire to 'get' Alex Salmond."" The inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants. Mr Salmond used his evidence session last week to accuse his former protege of repeatedly misleading parliament, and said he had ""no doubt"" she had breached the ministerial code - which she denies. A separate inquiry headed by Irish lawyer James Hamilton is specifically looking at whether this was the case. Ms Sturgeon is facing calls to quit from Scottish Conservatives after new documents released on Tuesday evening raised further questions about her involvement in the saga and appeared to back Mr Salmond's evidence. Ms Sturgeon was Mr Salmond's deputy for many years before succeeding him as SNP leader and first minister in 2014 They included government emails showing it continued a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond despite its lawyers advising it was likely to lose. It ended up paying Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than Â£500,000, on top of its own costs, after the investigation was found to have been unlawful and ""tainted with bias"" ahead of a judicial review. Calls for Sturgeon to quit over Salmond revelations Ms Sturgeon insisted that her meetings with lawyers had initially left her satisfied that the government was not ""in some way prolonging a judicial review that was dead in the water"". She admitted that advice received shortly before it did finally admit defeat had been ""dreadful"" and ""catastrophic"", but said the government had taken a ""legally sound"" approach by then deciding to concede the case. Labour's Jackie Ballie said the legal advice had only been handed over at the ""11th hour"" after two votes in parliament and the threat of a no confidence vote in the deputy first minister, and complained that some documents had not been provided. The committee has regularly complained that its work was being obstructed by the government, with SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, who chairs the inquiry, saying that she shared Ms Baillie's frustration. Ms Sturgeon insisted she had always acted ""properly and appropriately"" and there was ""no intention"" by the government to withhold information from the committee. Ms Sturgeon was questioned at length about claims the name of a complainer was passed to Mr Salmond while the meeting between a meeting between the two first ministers was being set up. Mr Salmond said the name had been revealed to his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein, and two other former SNP employees - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have written to the committee to support his account. However Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she had been given assurances that ""it did not happen in the way that has been described"". She said she believed that Mr Salmond was already aware of the identities of the two complainers, and that Mr Hamilton and Mr Pringle were not present at the meeting in question. She said she was prevented from going into more detail due to legal constraints, but added: ""I understand evidence has been given to this committee that denies that allegation, and I believe there has been an offer of confidential evidence as well."" As Ms Sturgeon was speaking, Mr Salmond's spokesman released a statement saying he had lodged a formal complaint with Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, about ""the conduct of the official who is alleged to have breached civil service rules by disclosing the name of a complainant."" The view in Nicola Sturgeon's team tonight is there was no knock-out blow - no truly dreadful moment for the first minister. They seem pretty happy with her performance in eight long hours of questions. There are still outstanding questions; the most significant of which is whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. The committee will provide an answer - but perhaps more significant is the view of James Hamilton, the Irish lawyer heading a separate inquiry into the issue. The view in Bute House is that his report will be hard to ignore. The political debate over this is likely to continue in the coming days too. Ms Sturgeon's political opponents still believe her account is muddled and inconsistent. Then there's Alex Salmond. He's sent documents to the committee today to support his evidence last week. Might we hear more from him in the coming days? The first minister had originally told parliament she first became aware of the specific allegations against Mr Salmond when she met him in her Glasgow home on 2 April 2018. But she subsequently claimed to have ""forgotten"" about an earlier meeting with his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her Scottish Parliament office on 29 March when she says she was told ""in general terms"" that a ""harassment-type issue had arisen."" Some committee members expressed scepticism that Ms Sturgeon could genuinely forget about such a meeting. Ms Sturgeon said she had not taken an official record of her two meetings with Mr Salmond in her home because she thought this could ""potentially compromise the confidentiality"" of the complaints process. She said if a meeting with Mr Salmond appeared in a diary then questions could be asked about it, and that there would be more risk to the complaints process if she told people within government that she was aware it was ongoing. And she said she did not agree with Mr Salmond's assertion that there had been a ""shared understanding"" ahead of the meeting as to what was to be discussed - which would suggest she knew in advance about the allegations against him. Ms Sturgeon also denied claims that she had told Mr Salmond she would be willing to intervene in the case if necessary But she said Mr Salmond had been a ""long-standing friend and colleague"", and she had therefore tried to let him down gently when he made the request  - and accepted that she may not have been frank enough. The first minister added: ""I did not intend to intervene, and I did not intervene, and while I know it is more complex than this, I think in terms of his anger towards me I think that is the root of it with Mr Salmond."" Ms Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, has denied Mr Salmond's claim that he was involved in plotting his downfall The first minister also insisted that the complaints procedure was not put in place to target Mr Salmond, as some of his supporters have claimed. She told the committee that she was not aware of any allegations or concerns about sexually inappropriate behaviour on the part of Mr Salmond until a media enquiry from Sky News was made in November 2017. Ms Sturgeon also insisted that details of the allegations against Mr Salmond that were leaked to the Daily Record newspaper - which broke the story in August 2018 - had not come from her or from anyone acting on her authority or instruction. Ms Sturgeon finished her evidence by admitting that mistakes had been made - but dismissed suggestions from Mr Salmond that this was because Scotland's leadership and institutions had failed. She added: ""Actually what comes out of it is the message that no matter how powerful you are or were, no matter your status or connections, if you are accused of serious offences they will be investigated and you will have the chance to defend yourself in court. That is how these things should work. ""The idea that because somebody doesn't like what has happened over the last couple of years we allow this attack to be made on the fundamentals of our democracy I find deeply distressing and deeply unfair."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross claimed that the abiding memory of the evidence session would be Ms Sturgeon repeatedly saying ""I can't recall"". He added: ""She dodged and evaded almost every difficult question. The first minister vividly remembers the details she believes exonerate her, then forgets entirely anything that damages her."" Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, who sits on the committee, said ""serious questions remain"" about the first minister's conduct. She added: ""Quite frankly we are not much further forward in understanding her role in this catastrophic failure of the Scottish government. ""Most galling of all was the first minister's complete failure to understand the obstruction that this Committee has faced and continues to face. ""The first minister promised the committee that it would receive all the information that it needed - this now sounds like a bad joke.""

They seem pretty happy with her performance in eight long hours of questions. There are still outstanding questions; the most significant of which is whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. The committee will provide an answer - but perhaps more significant is the view of James Hamilton, the Irish lawyer heading a separate inquiry into the issue. The view in Bute House is that his report will be hard to ignore. The political debate over this is likely to continue in the coming days too. Ms Sturgeon's political opponents still believe her account is muddled and inconsistent. Then there's Alex Salmond. He's sent documents to the committee today to support his evidence last week. Might we hear more from him in the coming days? The first minister had originally told parliament she first became aware of the specific allegations against Mr Salmond when she met him in her Glasgow home on 2 April 2018. But she subsequently claimed to have ""forgotten"" about an earlier meeting with his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her Scottish Parliament office on 29 March when she says she was told ""in general terms"" that a ""harassment-type issue had arisen."" Some committee members expressed scepticism that Ms Sturgeon could genuinely forget about such a meeting. Ms Sturgeon said she had not taken an official record of her two meetings with Mr Salmond in her home because she thought this could ""potentially compromise the confidentiality"" of the complaints process. She said if a meeting with Mr Salmond appeared in a diary then questions could be asked about it, and that there would be more risk to the complaints process if she told people within government that she was aware it was ongoing. And she said she did not agree with Mr Salmond's assertion that there had been a ""shared understanding"" ahead of the meeting as to what was to be discussed - which would suggest she knew in advance about the allegations against him. Ms Sturgeon also denied claims that she had told Mr Salmond she would be willing to intervene in the case if necessary But she said Mr Salmond had been a ""long-standing friend and colleague"", and she had therefore tried to let him down gently when he made the request  - and accepted that she may not have been frank enough. The first minister added: ""I did not intend to intervene, and I did not intervene, and while I know it is more complex than this, I think in terms of his anger towards me I think that is the root of it with Mr Salmond."" Ms Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, has denied Mr Salmond's claim that he was involved in plotting his downfall The first minister also insisted that the complaints procedure was not put in place to target Mr Salmond, as some of his supporters have claimed. She told the committee that she was not aware of any allegations or concerns about sexually inappropriate behaviour on the part of Mr Salmond until a media enquiry from Sky News was made in November 2017. Ms Sturgeon also insisted that details of the allegations against Mr Salmond that were leaked to the Daily Record newspaper - which broke the story in August 2018 - had not come from her or from anyone acting on her authority or instruction. Ms Sturgeon finished her evidence by admitting that mistakes had been made - but dismissed suggestions from Mr Salmond that this was because Scotland's leadership and institutions had failed. She added: ""Actually what comes out of it is the message that no matter how powerful you are or were, no matter your status or connections, if you are accused of serious offences they will be investigated and you will have the chance to defend yourself in court. That is how these things should work. ""The idea that because somebody doesn't like what has happened over the last couple of years we allow this attack to be made on the fundamentals of our democracy I find deeply distressing and deeply unfair."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross claimed that the abiding memory of the evidence session would be Ms Sturgeon repeatedly saying ""I can't recall"". He added: ""She dodged and evaded almost every difficult question. The first minister vividly remembers the details she believes exonerate her, then forgets entirely anything that damages her."" Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, who sits on the committee, said ""serious questions remain"" about the first minister's conduct. She added: ""Quite frankly we are not much further forward in understanding her role in this catastrophic failure of the Scottish government. ""Most galling of all was the first minister's complete failure to understand the obstruction that this Committee has faced and continues to face. ""The first minister promised the committee that it would receive all the information that it needed - this now sounds like a bad joke.""

Furlough to be extended until September in Budget,"The furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September by the chancellor in the Budget later. Rishi Sunak said the scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - would help millions through ""the challenging months ahead"". Some 600,000 more self-employed people will also be eligible for government help as access to grants is widened. But Labour said the support schemes should have been extended ""months ago"". The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected more than 11 million jobs since its inception last March and had been due to close at the end of April. It has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as tens of thousands of businesses remain shut. Employers will be expected to pay 10% towards the hours their staff do not work in July, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens. Government support for self-employed people has also been extended until September. A fourth grant under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) scheme will run from February until April, covering up to 80% of three months' trading profits up to Â£7,500. There will be a fifth grant from May to September. People whose turnover has fallen by 30% or more will get the 80% grant, but self-employed people whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will get a 30% grant. The government is widening access to grants, meaning some 600,000 more self-employed people will be eligible. People who filed their tax returns for 2019-20 by midnight on Tuesday are now eligible. Speaking ahead of the Budget, the chancellor said: ""Our Covid support schemes have been a lifeline to millions, protecting jobs and incomes across the UK. ""There's now light at the end of the tunnel with a roadmap for reopening, so it's only right that we continue to help business and individuals through the challenging months ahead - and beyond."" However, he is expected to warn in his Budget that there are tough economic times ahead. Can I go on furlough and how does it work? What help will the self-employed get in the Budget? Five things to look out for in the Budget What we know so far about the Budget Are you currently on furlough?  Share your experiences. Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy It is incredible to think that last year's Budget did not even contain the word ""furlough"". Official confirmation of a pandemic came hours after its publication, swiftly rendering most of its numbers obsolete. But so far in this crisis, unemployment has gone up only modestly. Furlough and the separate support scheme for the self-employed have prevented mass unemployment. These extensions now aim to prevent a rapid rise in joblessness at the end of the schemes. The BBC understands that unemployment forecasts will be revised down on Wednesday as the chancellor promises to deploy his ""full fiscal firepower"" to ""protect livelihoods"" - the theme of the Budget red book. At more than Â£10bn, this intervention is almost worthy of a Budget in and of itself. But the full document will reveal whether the chancellor's borrowing spree is limited to the ""rescue phase"" of this crisis, or if his confidence in a jobs bounce-back means the economy does not need further stimulus and could even sustain some business-focused tax rises. After the jabs, the jobs are the great hope. Economic think tank the Resolution Foundation's chief executive, Torsten Bell, said the phased tapering-off of the furlough scheme would avoid a ""risky cliff-edge"" for employers, but warned that the ""peak of unemployment is ahead rather than behind us"". However, Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the changes to support schemes ""could have been made months ago"" - accusing Mr Sunak of focusing on ""getting his moment in the sun rather than protecting jobs and livelihoods"". The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has said furlough must be in place  ""as long as businesses and devolved governments need it"". He said he was ""concerned companies are going to have to step in and pay greater contributions"". And Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said that while the extra months of furlough support offer ""some stability in the rocky months ahead"", the scheme should be extended until 2022. But Chris Wootton, chief financial officer at Sports Direct, said that although the furlough extension was helpful, other assistance was needed for businesses such as his, chiefly through business rates, payment of which has been suspended for almost a year. He told the BBC: ""What we really want is structural reform. This is just kicking the can down the road. ""We don't know what the systemic changes to consumer behaviour are going to be. We said even before Covid happened that a number of House of Fraser stores where we're working very closely with landlords, paying zero rent, they are still losing money because the business rates are far from fair.""

Sturgeon says Salmond conspiracy claims 'absurd'The first minister rejects much of Mr Salmond's version of events as she gives evidence to an inquiry.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says claims of conspiracy against Alex Salmond 'absurd' Nicola Sturgeon has insisted she had no reason to want to ""get"" Alex Salmond as she dismissed claims of a plot against him as ""absurd"". The first minister was speaking at the inquiry into her government's unlawful handling of harassment complaints against her predecessor. She apologised to the two women who had made the complaints, saying they were let down by a ""very serious error"". But she rejected much of Mr Salmond's version of events. And she insisted her government had nothing to hide, despite accusations of a cover-up from opposition parties. Mr Salmond has previously claimed several people within the SNP and Scottish government - including Ms Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, the party's chief executive - were involved in a ""deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort"" to damage his reputation, even to the extent of attempting to have him imprisoned. In her eight hours of evidence to the committee, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""thought often"" about the impact of the past three years on Mr Salmond, but said he had shown no sign of thinking of others. Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's evidence session What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon? The Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon story She said she had watched Mr Salmond give evidence to the inquiry committee last Friday and had found  herself ""searching for any sign at all that he recognised how difficult this had been for others too"". The first minister added: ""First of all, for women who believed his behaviour towards them was inappropriate. ""But also for those of us who have campaigned alongside him, worked with him, cared for him, and consider him a friend - who now stand unfairly accused of plotting against him."" Mr Salmond told the inquiry last week that he had ""no doubt"" that Ms Sturgeon had breached the ministerial code. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that Mr Salmond had been cleared of all of the sexual assault allegations against him by a High Court jury. But she added: ""I know just from what he told me that his behaviour was not always appropriate. ""And yet across six hours of testimony, there was not a single word of regret, reflection or even a simple acknowledgement of that. ""I can only hope that in private, the reality might be different."" The first minister said the female complainers had come forward ""of their own free will"", and that while some offered support to each other, this was not evidence of a conspiracy. The inquiry meeting is being held at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh She went on to tell the cross-party committee of MSPs that Mr Salmond had been one of the ""closest people to me in my entire life"". She added: ""I would never have wanted to 'get' Alex Salmond - I would never, ever have wanted any of this to happen. I had no motive, intention or desire to 'get' Alex Salmond."" The inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants. Mr Salmond used his evidence session last week to accuse his former protege of repeatedly misleading parliament, and said he had ""no doubt"" she had breached the ministerial code - which she denies. A separate inquiry headed by Irish lawyer James Hamilton is specifically looking at whether this was the case. Ms Sturgeon is facing calls to quit from Scottish Conservatives after new documents released on Tuesday evening raised further questions about her involvement in the saga and appeared to back Mr Salmond's evidence. Ms Sturgeon was Mr Salmond's deputy for many years before succeeding him as SNP leader and first minister in 2014 They included government emails showing it continued a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond despite its lawyers advising it was likely to lose. It ended up paying Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than Â£500,000, on top of its own costs, after the investigation was found to have been unlawful and ""tainted with bias"" ahead of a judicial review. Calls for Sturgeon to quit over Salmond revelations Ms Sturgeon insisted that her meetings with lawyers had initially left her satisfied that the government was not ""in some way prolonging a judicial review that was dead in the water"". She admitted that advice received shortly before it did finally admit defeat had been ""dreadful"" and ""catastrophic"", but said the government had taken a ""legally sound"" approach by then deciding to concede the case. Labour's Jackie Ballie said the legal advice had only been handed over at the ""11th hour"" after two votes in parliament and the threat of a no confidence vote in the deputy first minister, and complained that some documents had not been provided. The committee has regularly complained that its work was being obstructed by the government, with SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, who chairs the inquiry, saying that she shared Ms Baillie's frustration. Ms Sturgeon insisted she had always acted ""properly and appropriately"" and there was ""no intention"" by the government to withhold information from the committee. Ms Sturgeon was questioned at length about claims the name of a complainer was passed to Mr Salmond while the meeting between a meeting between the two first ministers was being set up. Mr Salmond said the name had been revealed to his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein, and two other former SNP employees - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have written to the committee to support his account. However Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she had been given assurances that ""it did not happen in the way that has been described"". She said she believed that Mr Salmond was already aware of the identities of the two complainers, and that Mr Hamilton and Mr Pringle were not present at the meeting in question. She said she was prevented from going into more detail due to legal constraints, but added: ""I understand evidence has been given to this committee that denies that allegation, and I believe there has been an offer of confidential evidence as well."" As Ms Sturgeon was speaking, Mr Salmond's spokesman released a statement saying he had lodged a formal complaint with Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, about ""the conduct of the official who is alleged to have breached civil service rules by disclosing the name of a complainant."" The view in Nicola Sturgeon's team tonight is there was no knock-out blow - no truly dreadful moment for the first minister.

Thanks for following along with us. Goodnight. BBC Politics LiveBBC2's lunchtime political programme BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg says the Budget gives a lot on emergency pandemic support for the economy, but takes in the form of tax changes. This video can not be played Budget 2021: BBC political editor on Sunakâs economics Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check Million, billion trillionâ¦ When the numbers get bigger and bigger, the words can start
to sound the same. But a billion is a thousand times bigger than a million. And
a trillion is a thousand times bigger than a billion. To put that into perspective, if a million seconds adds up
to 11 and a half days, a billion seconds add up to 33 and a half years - and a
trillion seconds? More than 33,000 years. An awful lot, in other words. But in a modern economy we
spend an awful lot. If you take the total money spent on healthcare in the UK,
it would, (according to the Office for National Statistics), take less than five
years to spend Â£1tn. Alternatively Â£1tn could buy you more than four million
houses at the average UK property price, or fund more than 500 NASA missions to
Mars. Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor There has been a lot of give, and there will be a lot of take. Business will, in time, pay billions more. More than a million people will have to start paying income tax, and a million extra will pay at a higher level. The deeply strange circumstances of the pandemic have turned the party with a theoretical love of low taxes into a government that will crank them up significantly in practice. ""Honest Rishi Sunak"", as he hopes to be represented, has chosen his determination to start dealing with the cost of Covid-19 over the Tories' traditional backing for low taxes. Boxed in by election promises, he has chosen two huge future money raisers. Despite those hikes, and the hundreds of billions spent on Covid-19, public spending overall is still set to contract. Rishi Sunak has done much more than extend the emergency lifelines - the modern-day Conservatives will raise taxes to a proportion of national income not seen since the 1960s. Even before the pandemic, the prime minister had little appetite to pare back public spending. But the past year has ended any Tory dreams of a lean and low tax economy. And with any flicker to the cost of borrowing, or an even more prolonged pandemic, what is already a grim picture for the country's books may become tougher still. Here's a summary of the key Budget announcements:  You can read full details of all the announcements here. Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter man on phone The Budget is packed with policies that will affect your finances. Here are just some of the ways: Paying the wages of those on furlough:The furlough scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - has been extended until September. Jabs, then jobs:The extra Â£1.65bn to help vaccinate every adult by the end of July should mean people can get back to work and the economy can start to recover. Support for the self-employed:Support for the self-employed comes in the form of grants. From next month, claims can be made for a fourth grant worth 80% of three months' average trading profits, up to Â£7,500 in total. But changes to how the scheme works are coming. Finding the deposit for a mortgage:The chancellor confirmed that a government guarantee means first-time buyers should get a wider choice of mortgages that require a deposit of just 5% of the loan. Read the full guide to find out more. One of the biggest headlines from the Budget is the extension of the furlough scheme until the end of September. The chancellor confirmed the Job Retention Support scheme will continue as the UK goes through the final stages of the pandemic. Almost five million people are still on furlough, which covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they can't work, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per month. As the economy opens up over the summer, employers who use the scheme will have to start paying into it. But workers will still receive up to 80% of their pay packet for hours they can't work. Find out more about who is eligible for furlough. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute of Fiscal Studies think tank, believes the chancellor is taking a big risk in lifting the UK's corporation tax rate from 19% to 25%, starting in 2023. âWhat we can be sure of is that
Rishi Sunak has spent big again, extending some support right through 2021 at a
cost of an additional Â£60bn or more,"" he says. ""As a result borrowing is now
forecast to again be above 10% of national income in the coming financial year. But he adds: ""Whether the big fiscal tightening planned for subsequent years will actually
happen is less certain. It continues to depend on spending being lower than
planned prior to the pandemic. And it also depends on a large increase in
corporation tax actually being implemented without additional measures to at
least ease its long-run impact,"" Mr Johnson says. ""Make no mistake, this proposed increase in the
main rate of corporation tax is a big reversal of decades of policy direction
and a significant risk. For all the rhetoric about it leaving the headline rate
here below that in other G7 countries, oureffectivetax rate will
be relatively high."" The chancellor announced that two further grants will be offered to self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. An estimated 600,000 newly self-employed workers will be able to claim the support for the first time, using their 2019-2020 tax return. They missed out on the earlier income support grants because they couldn't prove their self-employed status. Those most affected by the pandemic will be able to claim up to 80% of their average trading profits, subject to a maximum cap. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. Find out more about what help is available to the self-employed Laura Mvula performs at Gorilla in Manchester - a venue that narrowly avoided closure in 2020 Entertainment and arts bodies have broadly welcomed the Budget announcements, while also demanding greater support and clarity. The chancellor announced Â£390m to help arts venues in England, including theatres, museums and galleries, reopen. The lion's share (Â£300m) will go into the pre-existing Culture Recovery Fund, and Â£90m will go to helping national museums and cultural bodies. Elsewhere, Mr Sunak announced that the Film and TV Production Restart Scheme will be extended for six months until 31 December 2021. Reacting to the Budget, Music Venue Trust boss Mark Davyd welcomed the extensions to furlough, support for the self-empolyed and the VAT cut on ticket sales. ""These measures are supportive of the next steps in the campaign to reopen every venue safely"" he said. Greg Parmley, CEO of LIVE, the UK's official industry body for live music, said he ""warmly welcomed"" the additional financial support, which he described as ""due recognition from [the] government that the live music industry has been one of the hardest hit by the pandemic"". ""The extension of the reduced 5% rate of VAT, in particular, will provide significant support to businesses who have had their revenue decimated over the past year,"" he said. Read more here Reality Check There were several references to ""levelling up"" in Wednesday's Budget. It was also one of Prime Minister Boris Johnson's most-used terms of the 2019 election campaign. The idea is that people and communities that feel they have been left behind get a chance to catch up. So far, what it means in practice and if there's any way its success can be judged, is a bit vague. Many organisations have put forward suggestions of things that need to be addressed such as employment rates, pay, health and formal education, but there seems to be fairly broad agreement that one of the central issues is the differences in productivity between regions - that's the amount of value created per hour worked. You can read more here Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the Budget he has delivered protects jobs, businesses and will bring prosperity across the UK. Dharshini DavidEconomics Correspondent Rishi Sunakâs
big day is in some ways a big gamble - a gamble that the swift roll-out of
jabs will underpin the recovery and will do some of the heavy lifting in
repairing public finances by boosting tax receipts. But once the various
existing support packages are tailed off in the coming months, there are two
key unanswered questions. Firstly, where will the support for job creation come from? And where, asks the governmentâs own fiscal watchdog, is the provision for public
services going forward, in particular for health? From track and tracing, to dealing with possible new mutant strains, the challenge of dealing with the coronavirus doesnât just go away. The chancellorâs plans have him switching
from giving to taking mode in the next few years, but the reality may be quite
different. Rishi Sunak's media briefing came after his Budget speech today. He began by saying he wants to be ""honest about the problems we face"", and said and it will take ""a long time"" to recover from the coronavirus pandemic. He repeatedthe headline policies from the Budget:  In response to questions from journalists, Mr Sunak said: Ben Riley-Smith from the Daily Telegraph asks if the government will rule out rises in capital gains tax, and if the UK economy should open earlier if vaccination data says it's safe to do so. Rishi Sunak says that he cannot comment on fiscal policy beyond what's been announced today in the budget. He says he wants the roadmap to reopening the country to be ""cautious but irreversible"", so once the economy is reopened, he doesn't want to have to do another lockdown. And that, is the last question of the press conference. Graham Hiscott of the Daily Mirror asks if the chancellor will extend support schemes if the timetable for easing restrictions slips. He also asks why there is no pay rise for many public sector workers. Rishi Sunak says the government purposely extended support schemes beyond the end of the current timetable to allow for any changes to the roadmap. On public sector pay, he says wages are falling in the private sector but not in the public sector and that ""I thought, for reasons of fairness, it was reasonable to take a more targeted approach to public sector pay"". He says people in the NHS will receive a pay rise and that those in the public sector, who earn less than Â£24,000, will see their pay will go up by 1%. George Parker from the FT asks about the levelling up programme. He notes that 40 of the 45 areas that will get support are represented by Tory MPs, including the Chancellor's own constituency. Was fair criteria used he asks or did politics influence the decision? Rishi Sunak says there is an index of economic need and it is transparently published. He stresses that no area is excluded from bidding - the areas named today are those that have been identified as need extra support. Robert CuffeBBC head of statistics The governmentâs
spending watchdog believes that, between last March and the end of this month,
the state will have borrowed a Â£355bn - a peacetime record. Even as we move
towards recovery next year, borrowing will remain very high. Money is still
required to fight coronavirus, and to supporting people and businesses through
the economic shutdown. And that shutdown
doesnât do much for the tax take. If the economy
does grow as the chancellor hopes then borrowing should then return pretty steadily to more normal levels. But, as in so
many other things, the future is very uncertain and depends on how quickly we
escape the pandemic. The temporary Â£20 a week universal credit increase has been
extended until the end of September, affecting more than 5.5 million
households. The boost was introduced in April 2020, to help struggling
families during the pandemic. It was set to finish at the end of this month. Working tax credit claimants will also get an equivalent
increase for the next six months, through a one-off payment of Â£500. Find out more about what the
changes mean for youhere. Philip Aldrick from The Times asks what gives Mr Sunak confidence that tax rises in 2023 will not ""choke off recovery"". Rishi Sunak says it is ""not right"" to compare the past ten years of public finances with what's happening now during a pandemic. He says the government wants businesses to invest, which is why the corporation tax increase only comes in two years, after the Office for Budget Responsibility expects the effects of coronavirus to have left the UK economy. He says it is important to remember that corporation tax is a tax on profits, which means only successful companies will make significant contributions from it. Â© 2025 BBC.

Love Island's Molly-Mae broke rules with giveawayThe advertising watchdog reprimands the social media influencer over an Instagram prize draw.,"Molly-Mae Hague appeared on series five of Love Island Molly-Mae Hague has fallen foul of the UK's advertising watchdog for a second time. The Love Island star has been reprimanded for running an Â£8,000 online prize draw that failed tofollow the rules for such competitions,external. The watchdog said she had been unable to provide evidence the winners had been randomly and fairly picked. One lawyer said it suggests the authority is now pursuing a wider range of cases against influencers. Until recently, its focus has been on those who simply failed to flag paid-for posts as being ads. Ms Hague previously had a complaint upheld against her for failing to make clear one of her postswas an advert for an online clothing retailer. The 21-year-old rose to prominence after appearing on ITV's dating reality show Love Island in 2019, when she was one of the runners-up. She has more than five million followers on Instagram, and close to 1.5 million on YouTube. Last September, she ran the offending giveaway. Its prizes included tanning foams, sold under her own brand. To enter users had to: like the Instagram post involved tag a friend, to help attract their attention ensure they had subscribed to her main Instagram channel, that of her cosmetics brand, and her YouTube channel Prizes included tubes of Ms Hague's tanning products among other items The original post was liked close to 1.2 million times and attracted almost three million comments. Twelve people subsequently contacted the Advertising Standards Authority, challenging whether Ms Hague had included all the entrants in the draw to give them an equal and fair chance of winning - a relatively high number of complaints. Ms Hague subsequently told the authority she had been overwhelmed by the response. The ASA said she claimed a member of her management team had manually selected 100 entrants at random and assigned each a number. It said she added that another independent party had then used Google's number-picking tool to choose a winner. But the regulator noted that an Instagram Story she had published after the competition's close stated that the winner had actually been picked from a smaller shortlisted group of 25 people. ""We were concerned by the inconsistencies,"" it said, adding that in any case she had failed to provide any evidence that the narrowed-down group had been chosen randomly. ""The promotion was not administered fairly,"" it concluded. Ms Hague did not respond to a BBC request for comment. The ruling came a month after the watchdog acted against two other tanning brands which had used influencers. In those cases it saidthat digital photo filtersshould not be applied to social media ads if they exaggerated a product's effect . One observer said the ASA was making it clear that the rules concerning influencer-led promotions went beyond labelling ads as such. ""Targeting someone like Molly-Mae sends a message to other influencers, who may have smaller followings, to remind them that they are under the same requirements as any other brand,"" Nick Breen from law firm Reed Smith told the BBC. ""So, as they do more sophisticated campaigns - beyond copying and pasting marketing from an advertiser - they need to take even more care.""

Sturgeon says Salmond conspiracy claims 'absurd'The first minister rejects much of Mr Salmond's version of evidence as she gives evidence to an inquiry.Scotland politics,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon says claims of conspiracy against Alex Salmond 'absurd' Nicola Sturgeon has insisted she had no reason to want to ""get"" Alex Salmond as she dismissed claims of a plot against him as ""absurd"". The first minister was speaking at the inquiry into her government's unlawful handling of harassment complaints against her predecessor. She apologised to the two women who had made the complaints, saying they were let down by a ""very serious error"". But she rejected much of Mr Salmond's version of events. And she insisted her government had nothing to hide, despite accusations of a cover-up from opposition parties. Mr Salmond has previously claimed several people within the SNP and Scottish government - including Ms Sturgeon's husband Peter Murrell, the party's chief executive - were involved in a ""deliberate, prolonged, malicious and concerted effort"" to damage his reputation, even to the extent of attempting to have him imprisoned. In her eight hours of evidence to the committee, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""thought often"" about the impact of the past three years on Mr Salmond, but said he had shown no sign of thinking of others. Look back on Nicola Sturgeon's evidence session What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? Could Alex Salmond bring down Nicola Sturgeon? The Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon story She said she had watched Mr Salmond give evidence to the inquiry committee last Friday and had found  herself ""searching for any sign at all that he recognised how difficult this had been for others too"". The first minister added: ""First of all, for women who believed his behaviour towards them was inappropriate. ""But also for those of us who have campaigned alongside him, worked with him, cared for him, and consider him a friend - who now stand unfairly accused of plotting against him."" Mr Salmond told the inquiry last week that he had ""no doubt"" that Ms Sturgeon had breached the ministerial code. Ms Sturgeon acknowledged that Mr Salmond had been cleared of all of the sexual assault allegations against him by a High Court jury. But she added: ""I know just from what he told me that his behaviour was not always appropriate. ""And yet across six hours of testimony, there was not a single word of regret, reflection or even a simple acknowledgement of that. ""I can only hope that in private, the reality might be different."" The first minister said the female complainers had come forward ""of their own free will"", and that while some offered support to each other, this was not evidence of a conspiracy. The inquiry meeting is being held at the Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh She went on to tell the cross-party committee of MSPs that Mr Salmond had been one of the ""closest people to me in my entire life"". She added: ""I would never have wanted to 'get' Alex Salmond - I would never, ever have wanted any of this to happen. I had no motive, intention or desire to 'get' Alex Salmond."" The inquiry is examining the Scottish government's botched handling of sexual harassment complaints made against Mr Salmond by two female civil servants. Mr Salmond used his evidence session last week to accuse his former protege of repeatedly misleading parliament, and said he had ""no doubt"" she had breached the ministerial code - which she denies. A separate inquiry headed by Irish lawyer James Hamilton is specifically looking at whether this was the case. Ms Sturgeon is facing calls to quit from Scottish Conservatives after new documents released on Tuesday evening raised further questions about her involvement in the saga and appeared to back Mr Salmond's evidence. Ms Sturgeon was Mr Salmond's deputy for many years before succeeding him as SNP leader and first minister in 2014 They included government emails showing it continued a doomed legal fight with Mr Salmond despite its lawyers advising it was likely to lose. It ended up paying Mr Salmond's legal fees of more than Â£500,000, on top of its own costs, after the investigation was found to have been unlawful and ""tainted with bias"" ahead of a judicial review. Calls for Sturgeon to quit over Salmond revelations Ms Sturgeon insisted that her meetings with lawyers had initially left her satisfied that the government was not ""in some way prolonging a judicial review that was dead in the water"". She admitted that advice received shortly before it did finally admit defeat had been ""dreadful"" and ""catastrophic"", but said the government had taken a ""legally sound"" approach by then deciding to concede the case. Labour's Jackie Ballie said the legal advice had only been handed over at the ""11th hour"" after two votes in parliament and the threat of a no confidence vote in the deputy first minister, and complained that some documents had not been provided. The committee has regularly complained that its work was being obstructed by the government, with SNP MSP Linda Fabiani, who chairs the inquiry, saying that she shared Ms Baillie's frustration. Ms Sturgeon insisted she had always acted ""properly and appropriately"" and there was ""no intention"" by the government to withhold information from the committee. Ms Sturgeon was questioned at length about claims the name of a complainer was passed to Mr Salmond while the meeting between a meeting between the two first ministers was being set up. Mr Salmond said the name had been revealed to his former chief of staff Geoff Aberdein, and two other former SNP employees - Kevin Pringle and Duncan Hamilton - have written to the committee to support his account. However Ms Sturgeon told the inquiry that she had been given assurances that ""it did not happen in the way that has been described"". She said she believed that Mr Salmond was already aware of the identities of the two complainers, and that Mr Hamilton and Mr Pringle were not present at the meeting in question. She said she was prevented from going into more detail due to legal constraints, but added: ""I understand evidence has been given to this committee that denies that allegation, and I believe there has been an offer of confidential evidence as well."" As Ms Sturgeon was speaking, Mr Salmond's spokesman released a statement saying he had lodged a formal complaint with Scotland's top civil servant, Leslie Evans, about ""the conduct of the official who is alleged to have breached civil service rules by disclosing the name of a complainant."" The view in Nicola Sturgeon's team tonight is there was no knock-out blow - no truly dreadful moment for the first minister. They seem pretty happy with her performance in eight long hours of questions. There are still outstanding questions; the most significant of which is whether Ms Sturgeon broke the ministerial code. The committee will provide an answer - but perhaps more significant is the view of James Hamilton, the Irish lawyer heading a separate inquiry into the issue. The view in Bute House is that his report will be hard to ignore. The political debate over this is likely to continue in the coming days too. Ms Sturgeon's political opponents still believe her account is muddled and inconsistent. Then there's Alex Salmond. He's sent documents to the committee today to support his evidence last week. Might we hear more from him in the coming days? The first minister had originally told parliament she first became aware of the specific allegations against Mr Salmond when she met him in her Glasgow home on 2 April 2018. But she subsequently claimed to have ""forgotten"" about an earlier meeting with his former chief of staff, Geoff Aberdein, in her Scottish Parliament office on 29 March when she says she was told ""in general terms"" that a ""harassment-type issue had arisen."" Some committee members expressed scepticism that Ms Sturgeon could genuinely forget about such a meeting. Ms Sturgeon said she had not taken an official record of her two meetings with Mr Salmond in her home because she thought this could ""potentially compromise the confidentiality"" of the complaints process. She said if a meeting with Mr Salmond appeared in a diary then questions could be asked about it, and that there would be more risk to the complaints process if she told people within government that she was aware it was ongoing. And she said she did not agree with Mr Salmond's assertion that there had been a ""shared understanding"" ahead of the meeting as to what was to be discussed - which would suggest she knew in advance about the allegations against him. Ms Sturgeon also denied claims that she had told Mr Salmond she would be willing to intervene in the case if necessary But she said Mr Salmond had been a ""long-standing friend and colleague"", and she had therefore tried to let him down gently when he made the request  - and accepted that she may not have been frank enough. The first minister added: ""I did not intend to intervene, and I did not intervene, and while I know it is more complex than this, I think in terms of his anger towards me I think that is the root of it with Mr Salmond."" Ms Sturgeon's husband, Peter Murrell, has denied Mr Salmond's claim that he was involved in plotting his downfall The first minister also insisted that the complaints procedure was not put in place to target Mr Salmond, as some of his supporters have claimed. She told the committee that she was not aware of any allegations or concerns about sexually inappropriate behaviour on the part of Mr Salmond until a media enquiry from Sky News was made in November 2017. Ms Sturgeon also insisted that details of the allegations against Mr Salmond that were leaked to the Daily Record newspaper - which broke the story in August 2018 - had not come from her or from anyone acting on her authority or instruction. Ms Sturgeon finished her evidence by admitting that mistakes had been made - but dismissed suggestions from Mr Salmond that this was because Scotland's leadership and institutions had failed. She added: ""Actually what comes out of it is the message that no matter how powerful you are or were, no matter your status or connections, if you are accused of serious offences they will be investigated and you will have the chance to defend yourself in court. That is how these things should work. ""The idea that because somebody doesn't like what has happened over the last couple of years we allow this attack to be made on the fundamentals of our democracy I find deeply distressing and deeply unfair."" Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross claimed that the abiding memory of the evidence session would be Ms Sturgeon repeatedly saying ""I can't recall"". He added: ""She dodged and evaded almost every difficult question. The first minister vividly remembers the details she believes exonerate her, then forgets entirely anything that damages her."" Scottish Labour MSP Jackie Baillie, who sits on the committee, said ""serious questions remain"" about the first minister's conduct. She added: ""Quite frankly we are not much further forward in understanding her role in this catastrophic failure of the Scottish government. ""Most galling of all was the first minister's complete failure to understand the obstruction that this Committee has faced and continues to face. ""The first minister promised the committee that it would receive all the information that it needed - this now sounds like a bad joke.""

Crucial Budget speech,"There has arguably never been a moment in living memory where business and government need each other more than now. Clinging together like the passengers in the front car of a rollercoaster - this Budget is the moment the photo is snapped after the sickening plunge, grimaces fixed for the ride ahead. Business needs the government to go on another massive spending splurge to get us to the other side of lockdown. In many ways, the ""roadmap"" out of lockdown already told us the most important stuff that will be in the Budget. Furlough, the business rates holiday, additional grants and VAT deferrals and cuts for hospitality are all pretty much guaranteed to the end of June, when the government hopes firms will be able to operate with few restrictions. After that, the roles start to reverse. Westminster will need help from businesses to preserve and create millions of jobs. Companies will need incentives to invest, build, hire and train - particularly younger workers who have suffered the most and on whose economic future the success of this moment may be judged for decades. Governments can encourage, but ultimately it is businesses which create. Budget 2021: The challenges facing Rishi Sunak Mortgage guarantee to help buyers with 5% deposit BBC editors on what to expect in the Budget Increased capital allowances, the expansion of youth training programmes and subsidies like the Kickstart Scheme are all expected in a speech behind which the mantra ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" will be almost audible from the Treasury building. The tight embrace between government and business seems a long way since the concerns of business were swatted away with a four-letter ""swish"" by a prime minister who saw them as an irritant in the project of getting Brexit done. The UK is in more debt than it's been in for more than 50 years. At over Â£2 trillion, it is equivalent to 100% of its entire annual income for the first time since the early 1960s, when debt was still on a downward trajectory from spending on World War Two. By far the most powerful weapon against debt is growth: it has a doubly positive effect. It increases the denominator (the bottom number) of the debt to GDP ratio, while reducing the numerator (the top bit) by keeping the bill for benefits like Universal Credit lower. That is why the next twist on this rollercoaster ride is the most perilous. No-one really knows how many of the almost five million workers still on furlough have a job to go back to. More than anything, this Budget is about how many of them can return to, or find new, work. This video can not be played What factors could shape Rishi Sunak's thinking in his 2021 Budget? There will be some eye-catching whizzes and bangs as the government experiments with ideas like freeports, drums up extra funding for start-ups and proposes looser stock market listing rules to grow new firms and attract international investors. But sooner or later - and I suspect the emphasis will be later than recent headlines suggest - the government will need businesses help to pay off some the UK's enormous debts. Corporation tax will rise slowly. But this is perhaps a good example of how little politics figures in this Budget. The chancellor arguably has more to fear from his own backbenches than he does from a Labour party, who find themselves in the unusual position of siding with the very MPs in their opposition on tax rises on businesses - who already enjoy the lowest rates in the G8. But corporation tax is pretty small beer anyway. It contributes less than 8% of all tax collected by the government, compared with the 45% it receives from income tax and National Insurance from individuals who have - you guessed it - jobs, jobs, jobs. The government is also scared that the ""free money"" window may be closing. Ever since the financial crisis, governments have been able to borrow at close to zero rates of interest. There are signs that is changing. A 1% rise in borrowing costs will cost the government five times more than it will get by raising the corporation tax rate by 1%. That is why the government and businesses will need to hold each others' hands on a ride they really are in together. What is the Budget and when will it happen?

Texas ends mask rule as states drop Covid measures,"States across the US have started to ease Covid-19 restrictions, causing concern among health officials Texas will lift its mask requirement and allow businesses to reopen at full capacity next week, Governor Greg Abbott has announced. ""It is now time to open Texas 100%,"" the Republican said on Tuesday. Texas is the largest US state to end its mask mandate. Mr Abbott has faced criticism from his party over the measure, which was imposed last July. But the administration of US President Joe Biden has made it clear coronavirus restrictions are still necessary. The announcement in Texas came as similar rules were lifted in other states, including Michigan, Louisiana, and Mississippi, which also ended its mask mandate. The roll-out of vaccinations against Covid-19 has boosted confidence in a return to pre-pandemic life in the US. On Tuesday, President Biden said the US was on track to have enough vaccines for every adult in the country by the end of May. Yet the wave of reopenings has put states at odds with the Biden administration and its senior health officials, who have reacted with dismay to the relaxation of coronavirus measures at a precarious time in the pandemic. Covid-19 variants pose 'real threat' to vaccine progress, CDC warns Biden calls 500,000 death toll a heartbreaking milestone On Monday the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned of a ""potential fourth surge of cases"" if the country lapsed into complacency. Covid-19 data shows that, while infections and deaths have declined in recent weeks, they are still at high levels relative to other countries. In total, the US has recorded more than 28 million infections and 516,000 deaths related to Covid-19, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. Mr Abbott issued an executive order that rescinded most of the coronavirus measures he imposed earlier in the pandemic. Thenew executive order,external, which is to take effect on 10 March, lifts all mask requirements and forbids local authorities from penalising residents who do not wear a face covering. It removes all restrictions on businesses in counties without a high number of Covid-19 patients in hospital. Mr Abbott has been under pressure to lift the restrictions ""Too many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities,"" Mr Abbott said in a speech at the Chamber of Commerce in the city of Lubbock. ""Too many small business owners have struggled to pay their bills. This must end."" He said that with increased vaccinations and improved treatment for Covid-19, the state was ""in a far better position now"". But, he added, ""Covid has not suddenly disappeared"". Following weeks of decline, coronavirus infections and related deaths are creeping up again in Texas,data from the Covid Tracking Project showed,external. Texas has recorded more than 43,000 deaths related to Covid-19, the third-highest state toll in the US. This video can not be played The 'colourful' lives lost to Covid - how obituaries are helping us all mourn Angelica Casas, reporting from San Antonio, Texas Governor Abbott's announcement was no surprise to Texans. After all, the state's pandemic response has been political from the start. The state's Republican leadership favoured former President Donald Trump's relatively relaxed approach to imposing restrictions. But that created tension with local officials in the state's major cities, which all lean Democrat. It was control of the disease vs control of the economy. Mask requirements vs maintaining personal liberties. And when the surges came, state politicians were more reactive than proactive. A year later, not much has changed. The state's death toll and current case rate are still among the highest in the US. That's why critics say Governor Abbott's decision does not follow the science. So the decision will be a test to the state - but also to Mr Abbott's relationship with President Biden, who has addressed the pandemic with more urgency than his predecessor. Individual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel. About 35 required face coverings to be worn in public places - either indoors or outdoors - although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy. With cases and deaths falling sharply in recent weeks, several states have begun easing the restrictions. Shortly after Mr Abbott's announcement, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said he would do the same in an even shorter time frame. ""Starting tomorrow, we are lifting all of our county mask mandates and businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules,"" Mr Reeves said. Health experts have warned that the pandemic was far from over and cases could pick up if curbs were lifted too soon. President Biden has urged Americans to remain vigilant against the threat of the virus President Biden - in contrast with his predecessor Mr Trump - has made fighting the virus a priority for his administration. On Tuesday, Mr Biden said he was upbeat about reaching his goal of delivering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, but urged Americans to remain vigilant in wearing masks and observing social distancing. ""Today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic,"" Biden said in a televised statement from the White House. ""But I have to be honest with you. This fight is far from over."" The 28.7 million total confirmed US infections is nearly double that of second-highest India (11 million) and Brazil (10.5 million),according to Johns Hopkins University research,external But the US ranks ninth in terms of deaths per 100,000 population, behind countries such as the UK and Italy At least 90,000 more Americans are expected to have died with the virus by 1 June, an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projection says. By late May, the virus will kill around 500 Americans per day - down from approximately 2,000 now Hospital admission rates have fallen sharply since January The growing number of new variants, which could spark further outbreaks, remains a concern LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Australian cabinet minister denies rape allegation,"Christian Porter has rejected the 1988 rape allegation Australia's Attorney General Christian Porter has identified himself as the cabinet minister at the centre of a rape accusation - an allegation he strongly denies. A letter sent to Prime Minister Scott Morrison last week alleged Mr Porter had raped a 16-year-old girl in 1988. The woman took her own life last year. New South Wales Police have closed their investigation into the matter. Mr Porter, 50, said he retained Mr Morrison's support as attorney general. ""The things that are being claimed did not happen,"" he told reporters in Perth on Wednesday. ""Nothing in the allegations that have been printed ever happened."" Australian media have widely reported the allegation against a cabinet minister since last Friday, but not previously revealed his identity. A former crown prosecutor, Mr Porter entered parliament in 2013 and became attorney general in 2017. As the chief law officer of the nation, he controls one of the most senior government portfolios and is responsible for legal affairs, national and public security. This video can not be played Australian Attorney General Christian Porter: ""Nothing in the allegations... ever happened"" The alleged victim reported her complaint to New South Wales Police last year but did not make a formal statement. The investigation was suspended after she died last June, aged 49. But last week a letter was sent by friends of the woman to Mr Morrison and opposition lawmakers, raising the allegations again. Mr Porter said the letter accused him of raping the girl at a high school debating tournament at Sydney University in 1988. He has strongly denied any wrongdoing, adding the only information he knew about the allegations was what had been reported in the media. The attorney general said he had known the woman ""for the briefest periods, in debating competitions, when we were teenagers, about 33 years ago"". She had been one of his teammates, he added. Prime Minister Scott Morrison (left) has previously rejected calls for the minister to stand down Asked by journalists, he said he did not think he had ever been alone with the woman and had had no contact with her since January 1988. Mr Porter said Mr Morrison had given him his ""full backing"" to remain as attorney general. ""If I stand down from my position as attorney general because of an allegation about something that simply did not happen, then any person in Australia can lose their career... based on nothing more than an accusation that appears in print,"" he said. But he would take two weeks of leave for his mental health, he added. The case was referred to police again last week by opposition lawmakers. But on Tuesday, police confirmed they were dropping their investigation because there was ""insufficient admissible evidence to proceed"". Sexual assault cases typically cannot proceed to prosecution in Australia without an alleged victim's testimony. But Mr Morrison's government has faced calls for a separate, independent investigation into the allegations. The woman's friends and many prominent Australians have called for a judicial investigation - an inquiry led by a judge into a matter of public concern. Mr Porter said he had never been contacted by police or anyone else about the allegations. The government has been rocked by a wave of sexual assault allegationsin the past fortnight. It began with Brittany Higgins, a former aide to two government ministers, alleging she had been attacked by a male political adviser in 2019. She said she had later felt pressured to stay silent or risk losing her job. How an aide's rape allegations have rocked Australian politics Her account inspired other women in Australian politics circles to come forward with allegations. The friends of Mr Porter's accuser said they had also come forward because of the debate stirred by Ms Higgins' case. There are many reasons why this allegation has been so explosive and potentially damaging for Scott Morrison's government. It involves a sitting cabinet minister - the attorney general, the first law officer of the land, noting of course that he is entitled to the presumption of innocence. The alleged victim took her own life last year and so is not here to speak for herself. But it's also the secrecy and opaqueness by which the prime minister and members of his cabinet have chosen to deal with the whole matter.  Given it seemed inevitable that police would close their case, the government is facing calls to launch its own investigation. Legally, this is a bit of uncharted territory: would it be a private investigation? Would a retired judge oversee it? Would it involve a parliamentary committee? Politically, however, Scott Morrison and the whole Canberra bubble face a much more persistent issue. Remember, this all comes after Brittany Higgins inspired so many other women to come forward. This again brings to the surface a wider debate about what many have described as a toxic work culture for women in Australia's corridors of power.

"BBC Three will return to TV screens after six yearsThe channel will make a comeback, after scoring hits with Normal People and Fleabag online.Entertainment & ArtsComments","BBC Three is set to return as a TV channel BBC Three will return as a fully-fledged TV channel in January 2022, six years after it moved online. The channel has since been responsible for major hits including Fleabag, Normal People and Killing Eve - prompting calls for its resurrection. Last year, BBC research concluded there was a ""strong case"" for it to come back as a regular TV channel, focusing on younger audiences. MP Julian Knight said the move showed the BBC had ""failed"" those viewers. ""I question whether putting the clock back five years is the right way to win over 18-35s,"" said Mr Knight, who chairs the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS). ""The BBC needs to back success and make sure its programmes reach as many young people as possible wherever they live in the UK,"" said the BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore. ""So regardless of the debates about the past, we want to give BBC Three its own broadcast channel again."" As announced in the BBC's Annual Plan last year, the channel's budget will also be doubled over the next two years - a decision that was also criticised by Mr Knight, who accused the BBC of putting extra investment into programmes while ""those over 75 are being chased to pay up for their TV licences"". The BBC ended the provision of free TV licences for most over-75s last year, after the government decided to stop paying for the benefit. RuPaul's Drag Race UK, currently in its second season, has proved a runaway success When it returns, BBC Three will be targeted at audiences aged 16-34, broadcasting from 19:00 to 04:00 each day. As a result, CBBC's broadcast hours will revert to closing at 19:00 - as was the case before 2016. It currently runs until 21:00. The move will still need approval from media regulator Ofcom before it can go ahead. Seven years ago the BBC announced that BBC Three would become digital only. The main reason given was the need to save money. The public narrative was: Young audiences congregate online rather than watch linear TV, so there's no point providing a linear service. Since then, three things have happened. The flight of young audiences to digital platforms, and away from scheduled TV, has accelerated. BBC Three has produced a big range of huge, global hits. And the pressure on the BBC, not least from Ofcom, to prove that it still appeals to young people has grown sharply. This last point is critical. The BBC commissioned research showing that there is still a market of young people - albeit smaller than years ago - on linear platforms. Given the success of the shows commissioned by BBC Three, the feeling at the top of the organisation was that putting them back on a linear platform would create upside in terms of audience numbers, for relatively low cost. Despite the need for more savings today, that cost can be justified because when the BBC negotiates with the government over the future of the licence fee, it needs the strongest possible argument on its relevance and universal appeal. BBC Three was originally taken off air in March 2016. The corporation said the move would save Â£30m a year, helping it to reduce its spending after cuts imposed by the government in 2010. Much of the budget was reallocated to fund drama on BBC One, while BBC Three was expected to target younger audiences online. But the plans caused controversy, prompting the Save BBC Three campaign which saw more than 300,000 people sign a petition to keep it on air. Journalist and founder of the campaign Jono Read said the channel's return was ""great news"". ""It became clear that the decision to to take it off air was a counter-productive move that bosses had taken to sacrifice the station under the guise of budget cuts, and one that was deeply unpopular with its audience. ""Nonetheless the online move has shown real potential for BBC Three and I think it will thrive when it is once again given the chance to combine traditional and new media when it returns to TV in 2022"", he says. Many of BBC Three's commissions have ended up on linear TV, with shows like Killing Eve and Fleabag attracting huge audiences on BBC One. Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones in BBC Three's Normal People Normal People, about the tangled love lives of two Irish teenagers, also became the breakout hit of the first lockdown. It was requested on the BBC iPlayer 62.7 million times last year, more than any other programme. Other hit shows on the channel include Man Like Mobeen, This Country, Ru Paul's Drag Race UK and the Jesy Nelson documentary Odd One Out. In its online incarnation, BBC Three has won a raft of awards, including RTS Channel of the Year in 2017 and Digital Channel of the Year 2019 at the Edinburgh TV Festival.

Stamp duty holiday deadline 'is making us nervous',"Simon Ashley and his twin boys - Ralph and Henry - need more room Speculation is rife about a possible extension of the stamp duty holiday in England. Tens of thousands of property buyers have urged Chancellor Rishi Sunak to offer help. Earlier this month the BBC spoke to some of them. With twin boys approaching the age of two, Simon Ashley and his wife Katie soon realised they needed more space at home. So the family decided to take advantage of the stamp duty holiday and move to a bigger property just outside Harrogate. The chain was quickly settled, and they thought they would be in their new home by Christmas. But, with many thousands of people also planning to move during the pandemic, they now face a race to beat the tax break deadline at the end of March. ""The stamp duty holiday is a big thing for us. To put it bluntly, the impact is just over Â£12,000,"" said Simon, aged 34. ""It is making us nervous. ""The problem we have being in a chain is that we don't know how it will affect the people below us. It could stop it all, which will be terrible."" The tax concession in England and Northern Ireland means no stamp duty is paid on the first Â£500,000 of a property sale. In Scotland, where the equivalent levy is called the Land and Buildings Transaction Tax, and in Wales, where buyers pay Land Transaction Tax, there have been temporary tax breaks too. All are set to return to their pre-pandemic thresholds on 1 April. When does the stamp duty holiday end? What is the Budget and when will it happen? For buyers - particularly those in more expensive areas, or buying larger properties - that will mean the end of a tax saving of up to Â£15,000. Data from property portal Zoopla, for the BBC, suggests that between 70% and 82% of sales would be stamp duty free if they completed by the end of March. That, and savings at the higher end of the market, created a surge in activity. In turn, that meant professionals in the sector, from surveyors and solicitors, to local councils and estate agents, were all busy. The extra workload, at a time when many faced Covid-related staff shortages and practical working restrictions, meant delays in the house-buying process. Nigel Moore and Fergus the border collie are moving to the coast That affected families like the Ashleys and many thousands of others, like Nigel Moore. He is typical of a trend as people look to move out of the city to the country or coast, with regular working from home set to continue. Plans to move to the north Norfolk coast with wife Ashley-Jane and border collie Fergus have been brought forward by years, but then delayed too by the stamp duty rush. He says he is ""looking closely at the diary"", hoping to complete in time, but - as he works in the mortgage industry - he knows others will not be so lucky. Estimates suggest that as many as 300,000 sales could fall through because the stamp duty break will expire - although there is no way of knowing yet how accurate that prediction will be. Zoopla predicts that there will be a sudden drop-off in sales, with an expectation of 20% fewer transactions between April and June compared with the first three months of the year. That so-called cliff-edge has prompted lobbying of ministers - and particularly of the chancellor, Mr Sunak - to extend the tax breaks. A petition, set up by a buyer whose new home will not be built in time, is calling for a six-month extension to the stamp duty holiday. It has been signed by nearly 150,000 people. Some in the housing sector suggest that will just create another cliff-edge, but six months later, and so they want the chancellor to think a little more imaginatively. Beth Rudolf, from The Conveyancing Association, said: ""What we'd really like is for anybody who is already in a transaction to still receive the stamp duty concession when they complete. It is all about trying to bring fairness back."" This so-called tapering, to allow buyers ready to complete to benefit, could stop the sudden drop in activity seen after stamp duty concessions used by previous chancellors. It may also stop pressure on sellers to drop their price to ensure a sale. Finance ministers in Scotland and Wales have confirmed their plans to cancel the tax break at the end of March, giving people time to prepare, and there is still little sign of Mr Sunak doing things any differently at next month's Budget. A Treasury spokesman said: ""The temporary stamp duty cut is helping to protect hundreds of thousands of jobs which rely on the property market by stimulating economic activity. ""Its time limited nature is what has encouraged people to take advantage of the scheme."" For people like Simon Ashley, who says the money he has saved would be pumped back into the economy, that time limit may be coming a bit too soon. What is stamp duty and how much do I pay?

What help are the self-employed getting in the Budget?,"More help for the self-employed has been announced in the Budget, with grants available until the end of September. These will be the first payments available to an estimated 600,000 people who missed out on earlier support because they couldn't demonstrate their self-employed status on their tax return. Previous claimants will also be able to apply. Two further payments will be available for self-employed people struggling to work because of coronavirus. These represent the fourth and fifth grants paid out bythe Coronavirus Self Employed Income Support Scheme (SEISS),external. The fourth covers the three-month period from February until the end of April. As with two of the previous SEISS grants, it is worth up to 80% of trading profits, averaged over three months, up to Â£7,500 in total. The fifth grant covers May to the end of September, but the amount available depends on loss of income. Workers whose turnover has fallen by at least 30% can still apply for a grant for up to 80% of profits, up to a value of Â£7,500 in total. Those whose income has fallen by less than that can apply for up to 30% of trading profits capped at Â£2,850. Claims can be made from next month for the fourth grant. Claims for the fifth grant will open in July. Check if you can claim a grant through the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme,external Nearly a fifth of self-employed people - 600,000 people - missed out on previous grants. That's because they had only recently started working for themselves, and so could not prove their income status on their tax return. But those who completed tax returns for the 2019-2020 financial year will qualify for these new payments, provided they filed their return by midnight on 2 March 2021. However, self-employed people who pay themselves a salary and dividends through their own company are still not covered by the scheme. (Although they will have some of their salary covered by job retention schemes if they operate through PAYE). As a result, an estimated 18% of those for whom self-employment makes up most of their income have been ineligible for SEISS grants, according to the Institute for Fiscal Studies. Why can't some workers get Covid help? Ten ways the Budget will affect you The chancellor's first package of measures were unveiled in March last year. If they suffered any loss in income, people who were self-employed or in partnerships were paid a taxable grant worth 80% of their profits, up to Â£2,500 per month. Help was initially given as one lump-sum payment to cover three months, and businesses have also been able to apply to banks for government-backed support loans. This video can not be played ""I'm devastated that I have been penalised because of my husband's death"" More than half of a claimant's income needs to come from self-employment. The schemes have been open to those with a trading profit of less than Â£50,000 in 2018-19, or an average trading profit of less than Â£50,000 from 2016-17, 2017-18 and 2018-19. The government's help comes on top of extended delays for tax payments through the self-assessment system. Payment plans can be set up, giving people more time to pay their full tax bill up to January 2022. Those with the lowest income are in line to receive more generous benefits payments compared with before the crisis. This is how it has worked: HMRC uses existing information to identify those eligible and invite applications The application requires people to confirm they meet the eligibility requirements It will be paid straight into a bank account, which eligible taxpayers need to confirm on their application form There are more than five million self-employed people in the UK, earning an average of Â£781 a month. The number has risen fast since the 2008 financial crash. Of those eligible for previous grants, 77% have taken up the offer - a total of 2.6 million people, averaging around Â£10,800 in payments each. Roughly a fifth of the self-employed are in the construction sector, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), with hundreds of thousands of others working in the motor trade, professional services, and education The chancellor has suggested that in future, tax breaks for the self-employed - such as lower national insurance - may end. These were in place because the self-employed do not get sick pay or holiday pay. They were also meant to encourage entrepreneurship. This signals a massive change in UK tax policy, potentially equalising the tax treatment of employees and the self-employed. SUPPORT BUBBLES:What are they and who can be in yours?
