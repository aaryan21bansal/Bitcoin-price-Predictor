Woman jailed for people smugglingWendy Thomas hid three people in a car and tried to drive them into the UK via the Channel tunnel.22m22 minutes agoSouth East Wales,"Wendy Thomas hid two women and a man in a car she tried to drive into the UK A woman who hid three people in a car and tried to drive them into the UK has been jailed for people smuggling. The Home Office said officers discovered the stowaways after stopping Wendy Thomas' car at the Eurotunnel terminal in France on 9 October 2016. Two of them were unresponsive and were rushed to hospital. Thomas, 50, of Cardiff, admitted assisting illegal immigration and was sentenced to 33 months at Blackfriars Crown Court. The man was found under a duvet in the car's foot well The two women were taken to hospital after being found unresponsive Two women were found inside a large black holdall in the boot of Thomas' car and had been covered by pillows and a large soft toy. The third passenger, a man who later claimed to be an Iranian national and was handed to the French authorities, was found hiding under cushions and a quilt in the rear foot wells. Thomas' co-conspirators Adriano Bettoja-Allen, 37, and his wife Jeanette, 49, of Newport, were also sentenced for their parts in two separate ""carefully planned"" attempts to smuggle people into the UK. The Home Office said investigations started following the arrest of Dawood Shahbeik at St Pancras International station, after he arrived on the Eurostar from Calais on 2 October 2016. Text messages on his mobile phone referred to a person who had been taken to a house in Newport, while a search of his luggage revealed a damaged Iranian passport and a large amount of cash. The pillows and large toy used to hide the three stowaways Thomas was arrested a week after Shahbeik and text messages on both their phones showed they had been in regular contact with Adriano Bettoja-Allen. Investigators found he and his wife had travelled through Calais on 2 October after meeting Shahbeik in Dunkirk. They also found Thomas and Bettoja-Allen had travelled in separate vehicles from Folkestone, Kent, to Coquelles, France, on the same Eurotunnel train on 8 October. Adriano Bettoja-Allen returned to the UK less than two hours after Thomas had been stopped by Border Force officers and financial checks also uncovered a large deposit into Thomas' bank account in September 2016. Adriano Bettoja-Allen was jailed for five years for his part in the smuggling operation Adriano Bettoja-Allen admitted assisting illegal immigration and was sentenced to five years in prison. Jeanette Bettoja-Allen pleaded guilty to the same charge and was sentenced to 11 months, suspended for two years. Shahbeik, who also admitted the same charge, was sentenced to 18 months in prison at an earlier hearing. Speaking after the case concluded, David Fairclough, assistant director from Immigration Enforcement's Criminal and Financial Investigation team, said: ""Adriano Bettoja-Allen was revealed by our investigations to be the common link between what initially appeared to be unconnected incidents. ""Our investigations showed that far from being opportunistic attempts to undermine the UK's border controls, the offences had been carefully planned. ""The fact that two women ended up in hospital demonstrates the dangerous lengths people smugglers will go to.""

Police 'sided with murder victim's abusers',"Bijan Ebrahimi was beaten to death and set alight in July 2013 A police force and council ""repeatedly sided with the abusers"" of a man murdered after being wrongly accused of being paedophile, a report has found. The Safer Bristol Partnership (SBP) found a ""collective failure"" by Avon and Somerset Police and Bristol City Council in the case of Bijan Ebrahimi. The disabled Iranian refugee was beaten to death and set alighton a Bristol estatein July 2013. The SBP found there was""institutional racism"",externalfrom both parties. The council and police say they accept the report's findings. Lee James, then 24, wasjailed for lifein November 2013 for killing Mr Ebrahimi three days after the Iranian national was arrested following complaints he had been taking pictures of children near James's home. James repeatedly stamped on the 44-year-old's head during the attack in Brislington, shouting ""have some of that"". While the SBP report said there was no evidence of any individual being intentionally racist towards Mr Ebrahimi, it did find he had been ""repeatedly targeted for racist abuse and victimisation by some members of the public"". This video can not be played Mr Ebrahimi's sister Manisha Moores said the findings were ""shocking"" It said this had been repeatedly reported to the police and the council but representatives of both organisations took the side of those who had been victimising him. In a letter to Mr Ebrahimi's family, Bristol mayor Marvin Rees apologised. He said: ""We accept all of the findings of the Safer Bristol-commissioned independent review, including 'evidence of both discriminatory behaviour and institutional racism on the part of Bristol City Council. ""We appreciate that no amount of lessons learned or changes in practice can possibly mitigate the impact this had on Bijan and his family."" Lee James, right, set Bijan Ebrahimi on fire. Stephen Norley, left, admitted helping Avon and Somerset Police, which was criticised for ""conscious or unconscious racial bias"" in the case in anIPCC report,externalearlier this year, also said it accepted the findings. ""We failed him when he needed us the most and for that we're extremely sorry,"" a spokesman said. ""We continue to do everything in our power to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again."" Analysis by Jon Kay, BBC News correspondent The phrase ""institutional racism"" was notoriously used in the 1999 MacPherson report into the Metropolitan Police's handling of the Stephen Lawrence case. Now, the Ebrahimi family say they are ""disgusted"" and ""shocked"" to see the same phrase used again - two decades later - in a report about the way Bijan was treated in Bristol. Although they accept that changes have been made since Bijan was murdered, his sisters say they now want more extensive changes across the UK - to make sure institutional racism is a thing of the past. The SBP report accuses council and police officers of being ""prejudicial"" in their dealings with Mr Ebrahimi. It said they accepted allegations against him without investigating them objectively and had not appreciated his vulnerability as a refugee. The report said: ""As an Iranian man living in this environment, Mr Ebrahimi was disadvantaged by the inappropriate responses by Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Bristol City Council to his racist victimisation. ""Representatives of those organisations displayed a distinct lack of understanding of his plight and, accordingly, unwitting prejudice against him. ""There is therefore, based on the definition fromthe Macpherson report,,externalevidence of both discriminatory behaviour and institutional racism on the part of Bristol City Council and Avon and Somerset Constabulary."" The SBP added that institutional racism was defined as ""the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin"". Timeline of Bijan Ebrahimi case 16 July 2013 - Bijan Ebrahimi is found ""in flames"" at a property in Brislington. The case is referred to the IPCC 19 September 2013 - The IPCC serves notices of gross misconduct against six police officers 28 November 2013 - Lee James is jailed for life for Mr Ebrahimi's murder. Stephen Norley is sentenced to four years for assisting him 21 December 2015 - Kevin Duffy and Andrew Passmore areconvicted of misconduct in public office 22 January 2015 - The pair are dismissed from the force 9 February 2016 - Duffy is jailed for 10 months and Passmore for four 3 May 2016 - PCs Helen Harris and Leanne Winter are dismissed from the force 4 July 2017- IPCC finds ""conscious or unconscious racial bias"" in police handling of the case 18 December 2017- Safer Bristol Partnership finds evidence of discriminatory behaviour and institutional racism The report makes 14 recommendations, including changes to the way crimes are recorded at Avon and Somerset Police and a staff awareness programme around institutional racism. This video can not be played Racism ""blighted"" the life of Bijan Ebrahimi, says family lawyer Tony Murphy Mr Ebrahimi's sisters, Mojgan Kahayatian and Manisha Moores, said: ""No review can ever bring back our beloved Bijan but it is important that his voice has been heard. ""Bijan always said that racism must be challenged wherever it is found, including in town halls and police stations. ""Bristol City Council took nearly five years to accept that it failed Bijan and the need for change. ""This is far too long, although late is better than never. ""We will not rest until improved systems are put in place to protect other vulnerable people."" The family's solicitor, Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy, said: ""Acknowledging the institutional nature of the racism at the core of this tragedy is an essential first step towards systemic change. ""There is no reason why the council could not have taken this step much sooner and its delay has been injurious, not just to Bijan's family, but to public confidence in the council's ability to combat racism.

Collapsed rape trial man to sue police,"Liam Allan said he was ""disappointed"" he had not yet received an apology from the Met Police A man wrongly accused of rape says he will sue the Metropolitan Police over its failure to disclose vital evidence that led to the collapse of the trial. Liam Allan was charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault but his trial collapsed after police were ordered to hand over phone records. The 22-year-old student said he was ""disappointed"" he had not yet received an apology. The Met Police said it was ""urgently reviewing the investigation"". The case against Mr Allan at Croydon Crown Court was dropped after three days when the evidence on a computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim pestered him for ""casual sex"". Talking to the Victoria Derbyshire programme, Mr Allan said: ""University is meant to be the best years of your life and the last two years have been spent worrying and not concentrating on anything. ""It has completely ripped apart my normal personal life."" The 22-year-old student had been charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault He added he had not yet received any contact or an apology from the Met and found that ""disappointing"". ""I feel relief on one side, that the case is over, but now there's the stress of getting compensation and the process of suing - so it's not over completely"", he said. Mr Allan faced a possible jail term of 12 years and being put on the sex offenders register for life had he been found guilty. He said he felt ""pure fear"" when he learned he had been accused of rape but would never be able to understand why the accusations were made. It is understood police had looked at thousands of phone messages when reviewing evidence in the case, but had failed to disclose to the prosecution and defence teams messages between the complainant and her friends which cast doubt on the allegations against Mr Allan. A Met spokesman said the force was ""urgently reviewing this investigation and will be working with the Crown Prosecution Service to understand exactly what has happened in this case. ""The Met understands the concerns that have been raised as a result of this case being dismissed from court and the ongoing review will seek to address those,"" he said. A spokesman for the CPS said: ""In November 2017, the police provided more material in the case of Liam Allan. Upon a review of that material, it was decided that there was no longer a realistic prospect of conviction. ""We will now be conducting a management review together with the Metropolitan Police to examine the way in which this case was handled.""

Twitter suspends Britain First leaders,"The Britain First Twitter account and that of its two leaders have been blocked Twitter has suspended the accounts of two leaders of a British far-right group shortly after revising its rules on hate speech. Paul Golding, Britain First's leader, and Jayda Fransen, his deputy, can no longer tweet and their past posts no longer appear. The organisation's official Twitter page has suffered the same fate. It appears that three of Ms Fransen's posts that President Trump retweeted have gone from his feed as a result. The messageshad featured anti-Muslim videosand proved highly controversial when the American leader shared them in November. British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said it had been ""wrong for the president to have done this"". Twitter's hate speech rules are expanded Why is Britain First big online? Russia 'meddled on Twitter' after UK terror attacks Facebook and Twitter: Nine Russian Brexit ads found by inquiries Ms Fransen and Mr Goldingwere arrested earlier this weekover separate behaviour relating to Northern Ireland. Twitter announced in October that it planned to take a tougher stance against hate symbols as well as those who posted messages that glorified or condoned violence. It has now said that those who express an affiliation with groups that use or celebrate violence to achieve their aims will be permanently suspended. Hateful imagery - such as the Nazi swastika - can still be posted, but will initially be hidden behind a ""sensitive media"" warning, that visitors must disable to proceed. However, such content will no longer be allowed on a person's profile page. Those that featured examples will be asked to remove them. Repeat violators will be banned. The company said the move would ""reduce the amount of abusive behaviour and hateful conduct"" on the network. ""If an account's profile information includes a violent threat or multiple slurs, epithets, racist or sexist tropes, incites fear, or reduces someone to less than human, it will be permanently suspended,"" it explained. ""We plan to develop internal tools to help us identify violating accounts to supplement user reports."" Twitter has promised a more robust system to appeal against decisions, but said that it was still in development. The company is not commenting about the action it is taking against individual accounts citing ""privacy and security reasons"". That has left it to others to play detective and report who else has been suspended. Many are using the hashtag #twitterpurge to do so. US accounts that appear to have fallen foul of the new rules include: Jared Taylor, head of American Renaissance, a website that champions ""racial difference"" Michael Hill and Hunter Wallace - leader and public relations chief, respectively, of the League of the South, which is described as a ""hate group"" by civil rights campaigners at the Southern Poverty Law Center the American Nazi Party, which had tweeted it was ""inevitable that we will be banned"" at the weekend the Traditionalist Worker Party, a white supremacist group End Time Paradigm, an account that specialised in anti-Semitic content Several other members of the so-called alt-right have tweeted that fans should sign up to Gab.ai - a social network thatpitches itself as a free speech alternativeto Twitter - if they too are suspended. Generation Identity, a pan-European nationalist group that opened a British branch last month, has also had its UK and Ireland Twitter account suspended.

BBC sued over Paradise Papers leaks,"Law firm Appleby is taking legal action against the BBC and the Guardian over their reporting of leaked documents detailing offshore tax-avoidance schemes, known as the Paradise Papers. It is suing for breach of confidence and wants the documents disclosed. Appleby said confidential information had been taken in a ""criminal act"". The BBC and the Guardian said they would ""vigorously"" defend the revelations, which were in the ""highest public interest"". The leak of financial documents revealed how the powerful and ultra-wealthy secretly invest cash in offshore tax havens. The papers contained details about investments made by the Queen's private estate and a tax avoidance scheme used by three stars of BBC sitcom Mrs Brown's Boys. They also showed that Formula 1 champion Lewis Hamilton avoided tax on his Â£16.5m luxury jet. About half of the 13.4m leaked documents were from Appleby, one of the world's largest providers of offshore legal services. Panoramaled research for the BBC as part of a global investigation involving nearly 100 other media organisations in 67 countries, after the records were passed to German newspaperSÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung,external. The BBC does not know the identity of the source. Appleby says the data was taken by hackers. Appleby is also seeking a permanent injunction stopping any further use of the information, and the return of all copies of the documents. In a statement, it said its overwhelming responsibility was to its clients and colleagues. The BBC said its ""serious and responsible journalism"" had revealed matters which would otherwise have remained secret and that authorities around the world were taking action as a consequence.

Two guests die in Loch Lomond hotel fire,"This video can not be played Footage of the fire at Cameron House Two guests have died after fire broke out at the Cameron House Hotel beside Loch Lomond. More than 200 guests were evacuated from the luxury resort after the alarm was raised at about 06:40. Police said one person was pronounced dead at the scene while another died after being taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. A newly-married couple and their young son were taken to hospital for treatment and later discharged. Police Scotland said the hotel, near Balloch, had been extensively damaged. Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that two people had died A number of guests were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation. The three people taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow were members of the same family who were rescued by firefighters. Speaking to the media gathered at the hotel's entrance, David McGown of the Scottish Fire and Rescue said: ""Unfortunately, and tragically, this has resulted in two people losing their life as a result of the fire. ""The fire and rescue service's condolences go out to the people involved in this tragic incident and our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the two people who lost their lives this morning. ""The fire has caused extensive damage to the central section of the hotel. ""Our crews have been working tirelessly since 07:00. We have 14 fire appliances at its height tackling this fire and more than 70 firefighters. ""As you can imagine, as well as being an absolutely tragic incident where people have lost their lives, it is an extremely complicated incident and fire to contain and will continue to do so. ""We will continue to work with partners to bring this incident to a conclusion."" Ch Insp Donald Leitch from Police Scotland said work was ongoing to establish the cause of the fire. He said: ""Police Scotland were called to Cameron House Hotel where 200 people were evacuated from the hotel which has been partly damaged. ""One person was pronounced dead at the scene. Four were taken to hospital where one person tragically died."" A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal. Fourteen fire appliances were sent to the scene Firefighters used jets to tackle the flames and smoke Smoke rises over Loch Lomond from the fire, as seen from Balloch A guest at the hotel told BBC Radio Scotland how she initially thought the fire alarm was a drill. Ainsley Huxham said: ""As soon as we left our room - I just thought it was a fire alarm, just like a practise go. ""But when we left - five stairs down from our room - we saw a whole room full of smoke and flames. ""So we had to run back down the hall, chapped on everyone's doors and shouted 'fire!'."" Emergency services working at the scene of the fire watched by guests She added: ""We got out within five minutes of the fire brigade getting called. ""And by the time we had got outside, the whole field was full of people."" Staff who turned up for their shifts at the hotel during the morning were being stopped at the entrance. Much of the interior of the main central section of the hotel, thought to be the oldest part, was visibly blackened, with upper floor windows smashed to allow the firefighters' water jets access to the flames. The Salvation Army were in attendance to provide the emergency services with food and drink. One woman who works in the kitchen told the BBC news website she just heard about the fire as she was getting ready for work. She said she didn't believe the news until she came down and saw the smoke. ""It's a really lovely hotel,"" she said. ""I'm so sorry to see this."" Stewart King, general manager of the neighbouring Duck Bay Marina, said he had been down to the hotel and was shocked by the extent of the damage. ""It was very bad,"" he said. Guests were sheltered in Cameron House's Boathouse restaurant while the situation was ongoing. Cameron House is one of Scotland's most luxurious hotels, with views across Loch Lomond. The venue offers a romantic location for weddings, a championship standard course for golfers and five-star facilities for guests. The chef Martin Wishart has a Michelin-starred restaurant at the hotel. Cameron House is owned by US investment firm KSL Capital Partners, which was reported to have paid between Â£70m and Â£80m for the 132-room property in 2015. A statement on the hotel's website read: ""Due to an ongoing incident please be aware that Cameron House will remain closed to arriving guests for at least the next 72 hours. ""We would ask all guests and customers to remain patient as we work with the emergency services to establish the extent of the damage and ascertain when we will be able to re-open. ""More information will follow in due course."" Flags were being flown at half-mast at West Dunbartonshire Council buildings. Provost William Hendrie said: ""For something like this to happen so close to Christmas is just too painful to comprehend. ""I know the staff at Cameron House will also be devastated and our thoughts also go out to them."" Andy Roger, resort director at Cameron House, said the hotel was working closely with investigators to identify the cause of the fire. ""The safety and well-being of our guests, employees and neighbours is our first priority, and our deepest condolences are with the families of those affected. ""We are working closely with the authorities to determine the cause of the fire, and to provide support to our guests and the families of those affected.""

"Man, 84, chases knife-wielding burglar","An 84-year-old man chased a knife-wielding burglar from his house during a night-time break-in. The elderly man, who suffered hand injuries, refused to hand over cash when the burglar entered his home in Gateshead on Sunday at 21:20 GMT. The intruder, thought to be a young man, fled the address at Oakwood Gardens, Lobley Hill. He was described as being about 5ft 9in (1.75m) tall, white, of medium build with black crew-cut hair and stubble. He was wearing a black tracksuit with white stripes on the arms and a hood, Northumbria Police said. A spokesman said: ""A man entered the rear of the address and approached the occupant, an 84-year-old man, inside the house and made threats with a knife. ""The victim refused to hand over any money and chased the offender out of the house [from] where the offender made off down a back path leading under the A1. ""The victim demonstrated great bravery and courage in this incident, and thankfully he was not seriously injured.

Interstellar object may hold 'alien' water,"Artwork: Observations of 'Oumuamua noted its unusual elongated shape The first known interstellar asteroid may hold water from another star system in its interior, according to a study. Discovered on 19 October,external, the object's speed and trajectory strongly suggested it originated beyond our Solar System. The body showed no signs of ""outgassing"" as it approached the Sun, strengthening the idea that it held little if any water-ice. But the latest findings suggest water might be trapped under a thick, carbon-rich coating on its surface. The results come as a project to search for life in the cosmos has been using a radio telescope to check for radio signals coming from the strange, elongated object, named 'Oumuamua. Astronomers fromthe Breakthrough Listen initiative,externalhave been looking across four different radio frequency bands for anything that might resemble a signal resulting from alien technology. But their preliminary results have drawn a blank. The latest research -along with a previous academic paper- support a natural origin for the cosmic interloper. Bizarre shape of interstellar asteroid Interstellar visitor given a name Asteroid to be checked for alien tech Furthermore, they measured the way that 'Oumuamua reflects sunlight and found it similar to icy objects from our own Solar System that are covered with a dry crust. ""We've got high signal-to-noise spectra (the 'fingerprint' of light reflected or emitted by the asteroid) both at optical wavelengths and at infrared wavelengths. Putting those together is crucial,"" Prof Alan Fitzsimmons, from Queen's University Belfast (QUB), one of the authors of thenew study in Nature Astronomy,external. He added: ""What we do know is that the spectra don't look like something artificial."" Their measurements suggest that millions of years of exposure to cosmic rays have created an insulating, carbon-rich layer on the outside that could have shielded an icy interior from its encounter with the Sun. This process of irradiation has left it with a somewhat reddish hue, similar to objects encountered in the frozen outer reaches of our Solar System. ""When it was near the Sun, the surface would have been 300C (600 Kelvin), but half a metre or more beneath the surface, the ice could have remained,"" Prof Fitzsimmons told BBC News. The Gemini North observatory was used to gather observations of 'Oumuamua Previous measurements suggest the object is at least 10 times longer than it is wide. That ratio is more extreme than that of any asteroid or comet ever observed in our Solar System. Uncertainties remain as to its size, but it is thought to be at least 400m long. ""We don't know its mass and so it could still be fragile and have a relatively low density,"" said Prof Fitzsimmons. ""That would still be consistent with the rate at which it is spinning - which is about once every seven-and-a-half hours or so. Something with the strength of talcum powder would hold itself together at that speed."" He added: ""It's entirely consistent with cometary bodies we've studied - with the Rosetta probe, for example - in our own Solar System."" Co-author Dr Michele Bannister, also from QUB, commented: ""We've discovered that this is a planetesimal with a well-baked crust that looks a lot like the tiniest worlds in the outer regions of our Solar System, has a greyish/red surface and is highly elongated, probably about the size and shape of the Gherkin skyscraper in London. ""It's fascinating that the first interstellar object discovered looks so much like a tiny world from our own home system. This suggests that the way our planets and asteroids formed has a lot of kinship to the systems around other stars."" A number of ideas have been discussed to explain the unusual shape of 'Oumuamua. These include the possibility that it could be composed of separate objects that joined together, that a collision between two bodies with molten cores ejected rock that then froze in an elongated shape, and that it is a shard of a bigger object destroyed in a supernova. Artwork: 'Oumuamua may have spent millions of years travelling the Milky Way (shown here) before its encounter with the Sun In a paperrecently published on the Arxiv pre-print server,external, GÃ¡bor Domokos, from the Budapest University of Technology in Hungary, and colleagues suggest that, over millions of years, collisions between 'Oumuamua and many speeding interstellar dust grains could produce the object's observed shape. Prof Fitzsimmons said this idea was very interesting, and added: ""I think what we're looking at here is the initial flurry of scientists running around saying: 'How did it get like this, where's it come from, what's it made of.' It's incredibly exciting. ""I think after a few months you will see people focus down on one or two possibilities for all these things. But this just shows you: it's a symptom of what an amazing, interesting object this is... we can't wait for the next one."" If planets form around other stars the same way they did in the Solar System, many objects the size of 'Oumuamua should get slung out into space. The interstellar visitor may provide the first evidence of that process. ""All the data we have at the moment turn out to be consistent with what we might expect from an object ejected by another star,"" he said. But asked about Breakthrough Listen's initiative, he said: ""If I had a radio telescope, I might give it a go.""

Trump touts 'America First' security plan,"This video can not be played Analysis: Trump's plan to confront - and sometimes work with - US rivals US President Donald Trump has outlined his new national security strategy, labelling China and Russia the primary threats to US economic dominance. His speech - which was based on his platform of ""America First"" - attacked the ""failures"" of past foreign policy. He criticised Pakistan and North Korea, and how previous administrations approached other world powers. The US faces a new era of competition, the US president said at the Ronald Reagan Building in Washington. Russia and China are ""rival powers"", he said, but the US must attempt to build a ""great partnership with them"". Trumpâs pragmatic view of troubled world As an example of this new spirit of co-operation, Mr Trump referred to a phone call of thanks he received from Russian President Vladimir Putin for intelligence the CIA provided to the Kremlin about an alleged terror plot. Butthere was harsher language for Russia and China in the new National Security Strategy document itself,external, published before the speech, which called them ""revisionist powers"". Mr Trump described ""four pillars"" to his new plan but made no mention of human rights or climate change, his critics noted. The four themes are protecting the homeland, promoting American prosperity, demonstrating peace through strength and advancing American influence. The 68-page document, which White House officials began work on 11 months ago, suggests a return to Mr Trump's campaign promises. It explicitly states that ""the United States will no longer turn a blind eye to violations, cheating or economic aggression"". Mr Trump will renew his call for a wall on the southern border Referring to his election victory during the speech, he said that in 2016 voters chose to ""Make America Great Again"". Previous American leaders had ""drifted"" and ""lost sight of America's destiny"" he said, standing before a backdrop of American flags. ""Now less than one year later I am proud to report that the entire world has heard the news and has seen the signs,"" he said. ""America is coming back and America is coming back strong."" By Barbara Plett, BBC state department correspondent National security strategies are usually released without fanfare, but President Trump wanted to make an event out of this announcement, which builds on his America First campaign priorities. So the document emphasises the economy and fair trade as security issues, as well as tough border controls and immigration policies. Mr Trump's decision to call out Russia and China as global competitors reflected the wariness within his administration about these two ""revisionist powers"". The president himself shifted quickly to talk about his recent phone calls with President Vladimir Putin, with whom he seeks a closer relationship. But the text of the document goes into quite biting detail about Russia's alleged interference in domestic politics, and about Chinese economic practices that anger the Americans. That was part of an overall theme that emphasised competition more than co-operation in international relations. It signalled engagement with the world rather than an isolationist retreat, but on more muscular terms than his predecessors. He named the US withdrawal from the Paris climate accord and the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal among his successes in office. Mr Trump also said that wealthy countries must recognise that they need to ""reimburse"" the US for the costs of defending them. He criticised North Korea for their repeated nuclear missile tests, and Pakistan for not doing enough to tackle Islamic extremism. This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'America first, America first' He also outlined his campaign promise to build a wall on the southern border, as well as reform of the immigration visa system, which he said is necessary to defend the homeland. The new policy stresses economic security but does not recognise climate change as a national security threat. His predecessor Barack Obama in 2015 declared climate change an ""urgent and growing threat to our national security"". Trump's plan to deal with US rivals.

"Police 'sided with murder victim's abusers'A report finds evidence of ""institutional racism"" in the case of murdered refugee Bijan Ebrahimi.3h3 hours agoBristol","Bijan Ebrahimi was beaten to death and set alight in July 2013 A police force and council ""repeatedly sided with the abusers"" of a man murdered after being wrongly accused of being paedophile, a report has found. The Safer Bristol Partnership (SBP) found a ""collective failure"" by Avon and Somerset Police and Bristol City Council in the case of Bijan Ebrahimi. The disabled Iranian refugee was beaten to death and set alighton a Bristol estatein July 2013. The SBP found there was""institutional racism"",externalfrom both parties. The council and police say they accept the report's findings. Lee James, then 24, wasjailed for lifein November 2013 for killing Mr Ebrahimi three days after the Iranian national was arrested following complaints he had been taking pictures of children near James's home. James repeatedly stamped on the 44-year-old's head during the attack in Brislington, shouting ""have some of that"". While the SBP report said there was no evidence of any individual being intentionally racist towards Mr Ebrahimi, it did find he had been ""repeatedly targeted for racist abuse and victimisation by some members of the public"". This video can not be played Mr Ebrahimi's sister Manisha Moores said the findings were ""shocking"" It said this had been repeatedly reported to the police and the council but representatives of both organisations took the side of those who had been victimising him. In a letter to Mr Ebrahimi's family, Bristol mayor Marvin Rees apologised. He said: ""We accept all of the findings of the Safer Bristol-commissioned independent review, including 'evidence of both discriminatory behaviour and institutional racism on the part of Bristol City Council. ""We appreciate that no amount of lessons learned or changes in practice can possibly mitigate the impact this had on Bijan and his family."" Lee James, right, set Bijan Ebrahimi on fire. Stephen Norley, left, admitted helping Avon and Somerset Police, which was criticised for ""conscious or unconscious racial bias"" in the case in anIPCC report,externalearlier this year, also said it accepted the findings. ""We failed him when he needed us the most and for that we're extremely sorry,"" a spokesman said. ""We continue to do everything in our power to prevent a tragedy like this from ever happening again."" Analysis by Jon Kay, BBC News correspondent The phrase ""institutional racism"" was notoriously used in the 1999 MacPherson report into the Metropolitan Police's handling of the Stephen Lawrence case. Now, the Ebrahimi family say they are ""disgusted"" and ""shocked"" to see the same phrase used again - two decades later - in a report about the way Bijan was treated in Bristol. Although they accept that changes have been made since Bijan was murdered, his sisters say they now want more extensive changes across the UK - to make sure institutional racism is a thing of the past. The SBP report accuses council and police officers of being ""prejudicial"" in their dealings with Mr Ebrahimi. It said they accepted allegations against him without investigating them objectively and had not appreciated his vulnerability as a refugee. The report said: ""As an Iranian man living in this environment, Mr Ebrahimi was disadvantaged by the inappropriate responses by Avon and Somerset Constabulary and Bristol City Council to his racist victimisation. ""Representatives of those organisations displayed a distinct lack of understanding of his plight and, accordingly, unwitting prejudice against him. ""There is therefore, based on the definition fromthe Macpherson report,,externalevidence of both discriminatory behaviour and institutional racism on the part of Bristol City Council and Avon and Somerset Constabulary."" The SBP added that institutional racism was defined as ""the collective failure of an organisation to provide an appropriate and professional service to people because of their colour, culture, or ethnic origin"". Timeline of Bijan Ebrahimi case 16 July 2013 - Bijan Ebrahimi is found ""in flames"" at a property in Brislington. The case is referred to the IPCC 19 September 2013 - The IPCC serves notices of gross misconduct against six police officers 28 November 2013 - Lee James is jailed for life for Mr Ebrahimi's murder. Stephen Norley is sentenced to four years for assisting him 21 December 2015 - Kevin Duffy and Andrew Passmore areconvicted of misconduct in public office 22 January 2015 - The pair are dismissed from the force 9 February 2016 - Duffy is jailed for 10 months and Passmore for four 3 May 2016 - PCs Helen Harris and Leanne Winter are dismissed from the force 4 July 2017- IPCC finds ""conscious or unconscious racial bias"" in police handling of the case 18 December 2017- Safer Bristol Partnership finds evidence of discriminatory behaviour and institutional racism The report makes 14 recommendations, including changes to the way crimes are recorded at Avon and Somerset Police and a staff awareness programme around institutional racism. This video can not be played Racism ""blighted"" the life of Bijan Ebrahimi, says family lawyer Tony Murphy Mr Ebrahimi's sisters, Mojgan Kahayatian and Manisha Moores, said: ""No review can ever bring back our beloved Bijan but it is important that his voice has been heard. ""Bijan always said that racism must be challenged wherever it is found, including in town halls and police stations. ""Bristol City Council took nearly five years to accept that it failed Bijan and the need for change. ""This is far too long, although late is better than never. ""We will not rest until improved systems are put in place to protect other vulnerable people."" The family's solicitor, Tony Murphy of Bhatt Murphy, said: ""Acknowledging the institutional nature of the racism at the core of this tragedy is an essential first step towards systemic change. ""There is no reason why the council could not have taken this step much sooner and its delay has been injurious, not just to Bijan's family, but to public confidence in the council's ability to combat racism.

Rats and cockroaches rife in 'squalid' jail,"Inspectors at Liverpool jail found filthy, leaking toilets and some areas so hazardous they could not be cleaned Inmates at Liverpool prison are being kept in the worst living conditions inspectors have ever seen, according to a report seen by BBC News. Rats and cockroaches were rife, with one area of the jail so dirty, infested and hazardous it could not be cleaned. Some prisoners live in cells that should be condemned, says the leaked document, with exposed electrical wiring and filthy, leaking lavatories. The Ministry of Justice said it didn't comment on leaked documents. Prison inspectors made what they called an unannounced visit to HMP Liverpool in September, having been made aware of concerns. What they found, says the report, was an ""abject failureâ¦ to offer a safe, decent and purposeful environment"". Cockroaches: There was no credible plan to tackle the most basic issues, says the report The ""highly experienced"" inspection team said they ""could not recall having seen worse living conditions than those at HMP Liverpool"". Multiple failures include: many prisoners living in ""squalid conditions"" half were locked up during the working day, many for over 22 hours half said they had been victimised by staff, with over a third feeling unsafe a rise in incidents of self-harm Highlighting one particular incident, the chief inspector, Peter Clarke, could not contain his exasperation. ""I found a prisoner who had complex mental health needs being held in a cell that had no furniture other than a bed,"" he said. ""The windows of both the cell and the toilet recess were broken, the light fitting in his toilet was broken with wires exposed, the lavatory was filthy and appeared to be blocked, his sink was leaking and the cell was dark and damp. ""Extraordinarily, this man had apparently been held in this condition for some weeks."" The inspectors found broken windows with jutting glass in cells The chief cause of the problems, says the report, was a failure of leadership - at local, regional and national level. Violence of all kinds had increased, fuelled by the prevalence of drugs, with most inmates telling inspectors it was ""easy or very easy"" to get drugs. In addition however, inspectors found allegations of excessive use of force by prison officers were not properly investigated by managers. Some officers are described as having a ""dismissive"" attitude to prisoners, with some staff applying ""unacceptable"" unofficial punishments, such as restricting showers. There were more than 2,000 outstanding maintenance jobs, and only 22 of the 89 recommendations made following a poor inspection report in 2015 had been fully implemented. ""It is hard to understand how the leadership of the prison could have allowed the situation to deteriorate to this extent,"" writes the chief inspector, directly criticising the Ministry of Justice. ""We saw clear evidence that local prison managers had sought help from regional and national management to improve conditions they knew to be unacceptable long before our arrival, but had met with little response."" Most damningly of all perhaps, the report concludes: ""We could see no credible plan to address these basic issues."" The report talks of a failure of leadership locally, regionally and nationally ""It's as bad a report as I've ever seen,"" said Lord Ramsbotham, a former chief inspector of prisons. ""Butâ¦ how could anyone come up from headquarters, go into Liverpool and not feel ashamed about it? ""How on Earth did the head of the prison service allow the prison to get into that state?"" Asked if, in light of the report, Liverpool could be described as England's worst jail, Lord Ramsbotham replied: ""I wouldn't dispute that."" One recently released prisoner told the BBC: ""The cockroach problem was so bad, you can hear them gnawing at you at night."" Another said a leaking toilet in his cell had led to him ""waking up with the pad swimming in urine"". Darren Harley, released last summer, said his time there was like living in a tip And Darren Harley, released in the summer after 27 months inside for drugs offences, said the prison was ""like living in a tip"". ""If you put a dog in a place like this, people would come and take you away and lock you up for cruelty to animals. ""We're human beings. So we need to be treated right."" HMP Liverpool may now have the unwelcome attribute of being labelled England's worst jail, but prisons across England and Wales are under pressure. Under the coalition government, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling dramatically cut prison budgets and staff. Since the cuts, there has been a rapid rise in suicides, self-harm, violence and assaults within prisons. Recognising its errors, the Ministry of Justice is in the process of hiring 2,500 new prison officers by next summer. The governor of HMP Liverpool, Peter Francis, was removed within days of the inspection visit, and last week a former officer at the jail, Pia Sinha, was appointed as his replacement. In a statement on the failings at Liverpool, a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: ""We do not comment on leaked reports.""

Twitter suspends Britain First leadersThe leader and deputy of a far-right British political group's Twitter accounts are frozen.3h3 hours agoTechnology,"The Britain First Twitter account and that of its two leaders have been blocked Twitter has suspended the accounts of two leaders of a British far-right group shortly after revising its rules on hate speech. Paul Golding, Britain First's leader, and Jayda Fransen, his deputy, can no longer tweet and their past posts no longer appear. The organisation's official Twitter page has suffered the same fate. It appears that three of Ms Fransen's posts that President Trump retweeted have gone from his feed as a result. The messageshad featured anti-Muslim videosand proved highly controversial when the American leader shared them in November. British Prime Minister Theresa May's spokesman said it had been ""wrong for the president to have done this"". Twitter's hate speech rules are expanded Why is Britain First big online? Russia 'meddled on Twitter' after UK terror attacks Facebook and Twitter: Nine Russian Brexit ads found by inquiries Ms Fransen and Mr Goldingwere arrested earlier this weekover separate behaviour relating to Northern Ireland. Twitter announced in October that it planned to take a tougher stance against hate symbols as well as those who posted messages that glorified or condoned violence. It has now said that those who express an affiliation with groups that use or celebrate violence to achieve their aims will be permanently suspended. Hateful imagery - such as the Nazi swastika - can still be posted, but will initially be hidden behind a ""sensitive media"" warning, that visitors must disable to proceed. However, such content will no longer be allowed on a person's profile page. Those that featured examples will be asked to remove them. Repeat violators will be banned. The company said the move would ""reduce the amount of abusive behaviour and hateful conduct"" on the network. ""If an account's profile information includes a violent threat or multiple slurs, epithets, racist or sexist tropes, incites fear, or reduces someone to less than human, it will be permanently suspended,"" it explained. ""We plan to develop internal tools to help us identify violating accounts to supplement user reports."" Twitter has promised a more robust system to appeal against decisions, but said that it was still in development. The company is not commenting about the action it is taking against individual accounts citing ""privacy and security reasons"". That has left it to others to play detective and report who else has been suspended. Many are using the hashtag #twitterpurge to do so. US accounts that appear to have fallen foul of the new rules include: Jared Taylor, head of American Renaissance, a website that champions ""racial difference"" Michael Hill and Hunter Wallace - leader and public relations chief, respectively, of the League of the South, which is described as a ""hate group"" by civil rights campaigners at the Southern Poverty Law Center the American Nazi Party, which had tweeted it was ""inevitable that we will be banned"" at the weekend the Traditionalist Worker Party, a white supremacist group End Time Paradigm, an account that specialised in anti-Semitic content Several other members of the so-called alt-right have tweeted that fans should sign up to Gab.ai - a social network thatpitches itself as a free speech alternativeto Twitter - if they too are suspended. Generation Identity, a pan-European nationalist group that opened a British branch last month, has also had its UK and Ireland Twitter account suspended.

"S Africa's ANC picks Ramaphosa as leaderAfter a bruising battle, the ANC veteran is chosen to succeed Jacob Zuma to lead the party.4m4 minutes agoAfrica","This video can not be played Are South Africans pleased with ANC leadership result? South Africa's ruling African National Congress (ANC) has selected Cyril Ramaphosa to succeed President Jacob Zuma as the party's leader. The country's deputy president defeated former cabinet minister Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma, Mr Zuma's ex-wife, after a marathon voting process. Mr Ramaphosa is in a strong position to become president in 2019 polls. The leadership battle caused fierce political infighting, raising fears the party might split before the election. Mr Ramaphosa defeated Ms Dlamini-Zuma by 2,440 votes to 2,261, an ANC spokesperson announced. The result triggered celebrations among party delegates in Johannesburg and also on the streets of the city. How the vote happened Media reports said earlier that the announcement had been delayed, with Ms Dlamini-Zuma's camp demanding a recount. The voting process started on Sunday. This video can not be played Who is Cyril Ramaphosa? Born in Soweto, Johannesburg, in 1952 Detained in 1974 and 1976 for anti-apartheid activities Launched the National Union of Mineworkers in 1982 Chairman of the National Reception Committee which prepared for Nelson Mandela's release from prison in 1990 Became an MP and chairman of constitutional assembly in 1994 Moved full-time into business in 1997, becoming one of South Africa's richest businessmen On Lonmin board during 2012 Marikana massacre Became South Africa's deputy president in 2014 Elected ANC leader in 2017 Cyril Ramaphosa: Unionist to boss Mr Ramaphosa, 65, has spoken out strongly against state corruption and has the backing of the business community. He campaigned as the anti-Zuma candidate, promising to target corruption, and his victory could mean that the ANC decides to recall Mr Zuma as national president in the next few weeks. The Supreme Court ruled in October that Mr Zuma should face corruption, fraud, racketeering and money-laundering charges. Jacob Zuma (l) may not really welcome the victory of Cyril Ramaphosa (r) The ANC recalled Mr Zuma's predecessor, Thabo Mbeki, in 2008 after Mr Zuma replaced him as ANC leader the previous year. Ms Dlamini-Zuma, 68, had been critical of the enduring power of white-owned businesses and had pledged to tackle what she said was continued racial inequality. Analysts said that Mr Zuma had backed his former wife. The ANC election came amid declining support for the party, though opinion polls still suggest backing of about 50%. Lebo Diseko, BBC News, Johannesburg To say the atmosphere inside the plenary was electric would be quite the understatement - the singing inside the hall reached crescendo point as it was announced that Cyril Ramaphosa is the new president of the ANC. There was a touching moment when Nkosazana Dlamini-Zuma came on stage and hugged the man who beat her - by less than 200 votes - to the top job in the party, and put a halt to her ambition to be South Africa's first female president. The ANC has been torn apart by infighting of late, and the leadership battle was particularly bitter. There is much work ahead for the new leader of the liberation movement. Not only does Mr Ramaphosa need to unite his party, he also needs to convince the electorate that the ANC still represents the issues of the people it fought to hard to bring freedom to. Andrew Harding, BBC News, Johannesburg Mr Zuma's future looks uncertain. In theory he could remain South African president until national elections in 2019, restricting Mr Ramaphosa's room for manoeuvre. But it's extremely likely that a victorious Mr Ramaphosa will seek the ""recall"" of President Zuma by the ANC. If that happens, then things could move very quickly, and a President Ramaphosa would probably move fast to remove Mr Zuma's allies from key positions. The heads of the National Prosecuting Authority and the state power utility have, for instance, faced particular criticism. Opinion polls suggest that the ANC stands a better chance of shoring up its waning popular support and winning the 2019 elections under Mr Ramaphosa's leadership.

BBC sued over Paradise Papers leaksThe law firm says the BBC breached confidentiality by misusing and publishing details within the documents.5m5 minutes agoUK,"Law firm Appleby is taking legal action against the BBC and the Guardian over their reporting of leaked documents detailing offshore tax-avoidance schemes, known as the Paradise Papers.

The BBC and the Guardian said they would ""vigorously"" defend the revelations, which were in the ""highest public interest"". The leak of financial documents revealed how the powerful and ultra-wealthy secretly invest cash in offshore tax havens.

"Rats and cockroaches rife in 'squalid' jailSome prisoners live in dirty and dangerous cells that should be condemned, a leaked report says.8m9 minutes agoUK","Inspectors at Liverpool jail found filthy, leaking toilets and some areas so hazardous they could not be cleaned Inmates at Liverpool prison are being kept in the worst living conditions inspectors have ever seen, according to a report seen by BBC News. Rats and cockroaches were rife, with one area of the jail so dirty, infested and hazardous it could not be cleaned. Some prisoners live in cells that should be condemned, says the leaked document, with exposed electrical wiring and filthy, leaking lavatories. The Ministry of Justice said it didn't comment on leaked documents. Prison inspectors made what they called an unannounced visit to HMP Liverpool in September, having been made aware of concerns. What they found, says the report, was an ""abject failureâ¦ to offer a safe, decent and purposeful environment"". Cockroaches: There was no credible plan to tackle the most basic issues, says the report The ""highly experienced"" inspection team said they ""could not recall having seen worse living conditions than those at HMP Liverpool"". Multiple failures include: many prisoners living in ""squalid conditions"" half were locked up during the working day, many for over 22 hours half said they had been victimised by staff, with over a third feeling unsafe a rise in incidents of self-harm Highlighting one particular incident, the chief inspector, Peter Clarke, could not contain his exasperation. ""I found a prisoner who had complex mental health needs being held in a cell that had no furniture other than a bed,"" he said. ""The windows of both the cell and the toilet recess were broken, the light fitting in his toilet was broken with wires exposed, the lavatory was filthy and appeared to be blocked, his sink was leaking and the cell was dark and damp. ""Extraordinarily, this man had apparently been held in this condition for some weeks."" The inspectors found broken windows with jutting glass in cells The chief cause of the problems, says the report, was a failure of leadership - at local, regional and national level. Violence of all kinds had increased, fuelled by the prevalence of drugs, with most inmates telling inspectors it was ""easy or very easy"" to get drugs. In addition however, inspectors found allegations of excessive use of force by prison officers were not properly investigated by managers. Some officers are described as having a ""dismissive"" attitude to prisoners, with some staff applying ""unacceptable"" unofficial punishments, such as restricting showers. There were more than 2,000 outstanding maintenance jobs, and only 22 of the 89 recommendations made following a poor inspection report in 2015 had been fully implemented. ""It is hard to understand how the leadership of the prison could have allowed the situation to deteriorate to this extent,"" writes the chief inspector, directly criticising the Ministry of Justice. ""We saw clear evidence that local prison managers had sought help from regional and national management to improve conditions they knew to be unacceptable long before our arrival, but had met with little response."" Most damningly of all perhaps, the report concludes: ""We could see no credible plan to address these basic issues."" The report talks of a failure of leadership locally, regionally and nationally ""It's as bad a report as I've ever seen,"" said Lord Ramsbotham, a former chief inspector of prisons. ""Butâ¦ how could anyone come up from headquarters, go into Liverpool and not feel ashamed about it? ""How on Earth did the head of the prison service allow the prison to get into that state?"" Asked if, in light of the report, Liverpool could be described as England's worst jail, Lord Ramsbotham replied: ""I wouldn't dispute that."" One recently released prisoner told the BBC: ""The cockroach problem was so bad, you can hear them gnawing at you at night."" Another said a leaking toilet in his cell had led to him ""waking up with the pad swimming in urine"". Darren Harley, released last summer, said his time there was like living in a tip And Darren Harley, released in the summer after 27 months inside for drugs offences, said the prison was ""like living in a tip"". ""If you put a dog in a place like this, people would come and take you away and lock you up for cruelty to animals. ""We're human beings. So we need to be treated right."" HMP Liverpool may now have the unwelcome attribute of being labelled England's worst jail, but prisons across England and Wales are under pressure. Under the coalition government, the then Justice Secretary Chris Grayling dramatically cut prison budgets and staff. Since the cuts, there has been a rapid rise in suicides, self-harm, violence and assaults within prisons. Recognising its errors, the Ministry of Justice is in the process of hiring 2,500 new prison officers by next summer. The governor of HMP Liverpool, Peter Francis, was removed within days of the inspection visit, and last week a former officer at the jail, Pia Sinha, was appointed as his replacement. In a statement on the failings at Liverpool, a Ministry of Justice spokeswoman said: ""We do not comment on leaked reports.""

How a 'completely childish' man was hanged for murder,"He was one of the last two men hanged in Britain. A habitual liar convicted of murdering a man who had been his friend, and perhaps his lover. But according to a leading criminal lawyer, who has viewed documents uncovered by the BBC, he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. Medical reports released to the National Archives this summer show that Gwynne Owen Evans, who was hanged in 1964 at the age of 24, had serious psychological problems. But his defence team made no attempt to enter a plea of diminished responsibility - a plea that, if accepted would have saved his life. Just after three o'clock in the morning, on Tuesday 7 April 1964, Mr and Mrs Fawcett, an elderly couple living in the village of Seaton, Cumbria, were awakened by a series of thuds, a shrill scream, and then more bumps coming from the adjoining house. Mr Fawcett got up, and as he was getting dressed he saw the lights in the house being switched on, upstairs and down. Then he heard a car driving away towards the village centre. He looked out, but it was going too fast for him to make out the number plate or any other details. He called a neighbour, Walter Lister, who walked over to the house and knocked on the door. When no-one answered, he called the police. By 03:25 a group of officers, led by Sgt Park, had entered the house They found the occupant, John West, lying dead at the foot of the stairs, on his back and naked from the waist down. A single 53-year-old man who worked as a driver for a local laundry, West was in a pool of blood, his head covered with cuts. More blood was spattered on the walls, down the side of the stairs, and on the banister. On the floor near the body was a home-made cosh - a piece of rubber tube with a short piece of steel tube at one end, and putty at the other. Searching upstairs, police found a lightweight raincoat folded on a chair in West's bedroom. In the pocket was a lifesaving medallion inscribed ""G O Evans"", and a piece of paper with the name Norma O'Brien written on it, next to an address in Liverpool. That tied Gwynne Evans to the murder. When police interviewed the 17-year-old O'Brien in Liverpool the next day, she remembered meeting Evans and seeing his medal while visiting her brother-in-law, a soldier at Fulwood Barracks in Preston, four months earlier. Evans had then been in the Army too, but had been discharged shortly afterwards. Police learned that Evans was one of the dead man's friends. The year before he'd been seen chauffeuring him around the neighbourhood, which suggested they were close: West was very particular about his car and hardly anyone else was allowed to drive it. They also quickly discovered that Evans was a local boy - his parents lived in Workington, just down the road from Seaton - and that until recently his name had been John Walby. He'd changed it in a third attempt to join the Army, having been kicked out twice under his original name. From Evans's parents police had obtained his current address, a small terraced house in Preston, 100 miles (160km) away. He was living there with Peter Allen, 21, Allen's wife and two young children. At the house, though, police found and arrested only Allen. Evans was out with Allen's wife, Mary, in Manchester. When the police tracked them down, Evans had in his pocket a wristwatch that had belonged to West, and Mary had a bloodstained shirt in her basket. It belonged to her husband. Listen to Sanchia Berg's report for theToday programmeon BBC Radio 4, on Monday 18 December Orcatch up later on the BBC iPlayer According to police records, Gwynne Evans quickly volunteered information about the murder - putting all the blame on Allen. He and Allen had stolen a car to drive up to Seaton to borrow money, he said, as West was an old friend who'd offered to help him in the past. Both Allen and Evans were hard up, with fines and bills to pay. Allen's wife and children came along for the drive too, and waited, asleep, outside in the car. Evans went in first, by his account, and he told police he just had a chat with West, whom he called Jack. ""I had some tea and a cheese bun and as we were talking there was a knock at the door. I honestly didn't know who it was, anyway Jack went to the door and I heard some banging. I went into the hall and I saw Peter hitting Jack with something that looked like a pipe... There was a lot of blood and I shouted to Peter, 'For Christ's sake stop it!'"" Evans insisted he hadn't hit Jack  himself. ""Peter did the thumping,"" he said. Evans told police  the two men had stolen bank books from West's home, and managed to withdraw Â£10 cash from his accounts. He said he knew the police had found his coat, with the medallion and keys in the pocket. ""If I wanted, I could have said that my coat had been stolen and my keys were in it and no judge in the country would convict me. But I am glad I have got it off my chest,"" he said. An odd thing to say, but as further questioning would show, characteristic of Evans. That evening, in Preston, Peter Allen was interviewed. Initially, he claimed ignorance of the murder. ""You can get a stack of Bibles in here and I'll stand on them and swear I know nothing about it,"" he told Det Supt Roberts, who was leading the investigation. But just a few minutes later,  according to the police notes, Allen struck the desk with his fist, buried his head in his arm and said, ""All right. I'll tell you. I'd like to tell the whole flipping world about it."" He said it started out as an innocent robbery. Sandy, as he called Evans, was to go in first, and let Allen in. But as Evans opened the front door West came out of his bedroom, and saw him. So Allen hit the older man with his fists. Then, Allen claimed, Evans gave him ""the bar"" and he set upon West with that too. Later, he revised his statement to say that Evans had also beaten West. That evening, at a quarter to midnight, the detective superintendent interviewed Gwynne Evans. First, he asked if that was his real name. The reply was surprising. ""No, I adopted it after I found out I was born in Innsbruck in 1940 and that both my parents were German,"" Evans said. This was not true. The post-mortem showed West hadn't only been hit around the head, with a cosh - he'd also been stabbed through the heart. Initially, neither man said anything about that, but according to the police report Evans - unprompted - said: ""I don't know anything about a knife. I don't have to use a knife to kill a man. I'm an expert at judo and karate. I never hit Jack- it was Peter that did all the hitting."" He wasn't a karate expert either. Police found Allen's account more credible. It tallied with the crime scene. Allen said Evans had opened the door for him, and West had unexpectedly come out of his bedroom upstairs. Evans, by contrast, claimed both he and West had been downstairs. Police thought it unlikely West would have answered the door without any trousers on, his false teeth were found on the landing at the top of the stairs, and there was blood on the wall by the staircase. Just after midnight, police interviewed Allen's wife, Mary. She said Evans had gone in first, and had come out about two hours later to get Allen. Then the two men had run out. When she asked them what had happened they said West had punched Peter - who'd punched back. Evans, she said, had told her he'd joined in. The two men appeared in the magistrates' court a few hours later, on Thursday 9 April. Mary Allen then revised her evidence, telling police Evans had stopped the car on the drive back to Preston and she'd seen him throw something away. That afternoon, she showed officers the spot, on the road between Workington and Windermere. A police dog easily found a bloodstained knife. And after reading a local newspaper report of the court hearing, Mary Allen remembered something else. She told police that when they'd all returned to Preston, early on Tuesday morning, Evans had said ""he never expected it to go in below the alarm clock"". She now realised, she said, that he was referring to the stab wound to the heart. After his appearance in court, Gwynne Evans was remanded in custody at Durham prison, where he was seen by the senior medical officer, P J Waddington. There was no evidence of medical disorder, he wrote. Evans was ""correctly orientated"". In other words, ""He knew where he was and he was fully aware of the reasons for his arrest and his committal to prison."" Waddington described Evans as being ""of spare physique"", just over 5ft 9in tall, with no physical ailments except flat feet and some small cuts on his face, possibly from picking pimples. In another report the following month, he noted that from a very young age Evans had experienced psychological problems. As a boy he'd been referred to a child guidance clinic (elsewhere identified as Dovenby mental hospital) because he was ""untrustworthy, lacked moral sense, was untruthful, and inclined to steal"". Evans confused truth with fantasy. ""Evans believes that he was born in Innsbruck and his reasons for doing so are quite absurdâ¦"" the doctor wrote. He said he was married to a German girl, and had two children - which also seemed entirely invented. Evans claimed too that he'd been employed by Securicor for a year, and there become an expert in judo. In fact he'd only worked there for a week; he left as soon as his references had been checked, presumably because they were unsatisfactory. He lied constantly. The doctor said these were for the most part ""prestige lies"" to enhance his standing. On four occasions he joined the services, only to be medically discharged. Evans had enlisted at 17 in the Border Regiment, where his fabrications led to him being sent for a psychiatric assessment. ""This soldier was sent to me by his training wing officer,"" wrote one doctor, ""on account of his frequent telling of big lies which he apparently believed himself."" His first expulsion followed four months later. In less than a year, he signed up for another regiment, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers - but here too, his lies brought about his downfall. Within three months he was before a medical board which recommended discharge on the grounds of ""personality inadequacy"". His commanding officer remarked: ""He is a failure. He cannot make friends because of feeling superior and telling complete fairy tales all the time."" The following year he joined the Royal Air Force, but was quickly discharged on the grounds of ""nervous instability"". In 1963, he signed up for the Army again, under the name of Evans, but was soon found out, and discharged for the final time. Waddington, the medical officer at Durham Prison, acknowledged Evans's ""abnormal personality"" and thought most doctors would consider him an individual with a ""psychopathic personality, using this term in the broadest sense"". But he didn't believe this amounted to an ""abnormality of mind"" that wouldsubstantiallyimpair his ""mental responsibility for his acts and omissions"" - the legal definition of diminished responsibility under the 1957 Homicide Act. Evans's own lawyers commissioned Dr G F Duggan Keen, an experienced consultant psychiatrist, to examine him. He noted that Evans had been employed in 32 jobs, by his own account, from the age of 15, excluding the spells in the Army and RAF. Many had just lasted a few weeks, due he thought, to Evans's problems forming relationships, and excessive drinking. After four meetings with Evans, he said there was ""absolutely no doubt in my mind that this man is a psychopathic personality"". But he could not identify a condition or disease. He said Evans was not ""subnormal"", nor schizophrenic, nor epileptic. He too concluded that Evans's mental responsibility was not ""substantially impaired"". Neither Waddington nor Duggan Keen explained why they came to that conclusion, and this surprises Dr Tim McInerney, a consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Bethlem Royal hospital in South London, who often gives expert assessments in murder cases. ""If, as an expert now, giving advice to the courts or to a jury as to why I don't support diminished [responsibility] I would have to explain very clearly why I reached that position,"" he says. The psychiatric reports are cursory by modern standards, running to just a few pages. Though McInerny says that was the style at the time, John Cooper QC, an experienced defence barrister and professor of law, says their brevity strikes him as a cause for concern. ""For those reports to be relied upon without them being tested, without further questions being asked of them, without further experts being used, as far as I'm concerned, is quite startling. And I would say quite startling not just to the modern eye but also at the time."" But these psychiatric judgements would play an important role in the events that led to Gwynne Evans's conviction - and his hanging. Evans and Allen went on trial at Manchester Crown Court on 29 June 1964.  The prosecution expected Evans to plead diminished responsibility. They had lined up their own psychiatrist, Dr Begg, who had met Evans twice. Like the other doctors, he said Evans was a ""grossly psychopathic personality"", and that responsibility for his actions was impaired - but, again, not substantially. However, the following day, without explanation, Evans's lawyers decided to drop the diminished responsibility plea. The note on the Director of Public Prosecutions file reads simply: ""Def advise Dim Res not being raised. Dr Begg informed."" Each man blamed the other for the murder. The evidence against Allen was much stronger - he admitted beating West and his clothes had been soaked in blood. There was no blood on Evans. There was, admittedly, evidence incriminating Evans from Allen's wife - but she would have had good reason to try to shift the blame. Evans said he'd been friendly with West, who ""was like a father to me"", and that he would never have hurt him. The murdered man, John West However, both agreed they'd been ready to rob West. And unsurprisingly, Evans lied in court - and was shown to be lying. Allen's barrister undermined Evans further by suggesting he'd had sex with West just before the murder, something Evans vehemently denied, but which was supported by medical evidence. At the time homosexuality was illegal, and it's likely this would have lowered the jury's opinion of Evans even further. The trial ran until 6 July. The prosecution argued that the men were acting ""in concert"" and it did not matter who delivered the fatal blow. Without much deliberation the jury found both guilty of capital murder - that is, murder and robbery. This doesn't surprise John Cooper QC. ""Without diminished responsibility, on my reading of these papers, the verdict of guilty was all but inevitable,"" he says. A successful plea of diminished responsibility, on the other hand, would have saved Evans's life. Evans's mother, Hannah Walby, wrote to him in clumsy round handwriting on blue notepaper: ""Please don't give up hope yet.""  The verdict had been a great shock to her, she continued, and to his brothers and sister. ""All is being done possible, you may get a reprieve."" At his appeal, heard at the High Court in July, Evans's lawyers also made no attempt to argue that he was not fully responsible for his actions. Instead his barrister, Guthrie Jones QC, sought to challenge Mary Allen's evidence, on the basis that she was Allen's wife. However, the judge had flagged this up to the jury at the trial, warning them that she was not an impartial witness - so the appeal was dismissed. The only avenue left was a reprieve. On 24 July Evans's solicitor, John Marsham of Midland Bank Chambers in Whitehaven, Cumbria, wrote to the Home Secretary, Henry Brooke. He pointed out that three doctors agreed Evans suffered mental impairment. He referred to a statement - not presented in court - from the father of a girl Evans had been seeing, a Mr Hampton. He'd put an end to their relationship because he had been so concerned about Evans's immaturity. He was ""completely childish in everything he did"" wrote the lawyer, ""he would make toys that a child would make and play with them for hours before pulling them to pieces."" Marsham added that Evans had been shown in court to be a liar, which made his conviction ""inevitable"". ""Even in the witness box he could not refrain from telling stupid and unnecessary lies"" - a story about being chased by a police car, for example. The letter was dismissed by the Home Office. Officials did nonetheless commission a final medical assessment. Three psychiatrists, Dr Pickering, Dr Mather and Prof Anderson, visited him in prison, on 27 and 28 July. ""He was a pallid slightly built young man, clearly tense, tremulous, with knitted brows throughout the interview,"" they wrote. He admitted being a habitual liar, and even lying to the doctors themselves. Prison staff also reported that he lied often, to boost his self-confidence. The governor thought him a ""happy-go-lucky extrovert liking to stand high in people's favour"". No staff thought him insane, as ""no sign of fits or transient losses or changes of consciousness were observed"". The news that there would be no reprieve reached Evans's family. On 3 August, Mrs Walby sent a letter to the Home Secretary. ""I write to you on behalf of my son who is under sentence of Death at Manchester Prison,"" she wrote. She said Evans had never been in serious trouble before he met ""this Preston couple"". He had been brought up in the church, a member of the choir and the Boy Scouts, she explained. She pointed out he had been friends with West for five years, often staying overnight at his house. ""My son is mentally impaired and I had him under a mental doctor at the age of 8 years but he is not a wicked boy,"" she pleaded. ""Please may God guide you to make a mercyful judgement. I remain, yours respectfully Mrs H Walby."" It had no effect. Three days later, on 6 August the Home Secretary wrote in red ink on the file: ""I regret I can find no mitigating circumstances such as would justify a reprieve in either case. The law must take its course."" The two men were hanged, in different prisons, at the same time: 08:00 on 13 August. I came across Evans's medical reports by chance, while checking newly released files at the National Archives earlier this year. I then showed them to John Cooper QC and Dr Tim McInerney. Cooper has no hesitation in saying that Evans was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. ""Evans was a vulnerable individual,"" he says. ""And that vulnerable individual was sent into court, into trial without the proper defence put forward for the jury to consider."" The proper defence, in his view, would have been a plea of diminished responsibility. And this plea, he argues, would have had a far greater chance of success if there had been a more thorough psychiatric examination. The 1957 Homicide Act led to a sharp drop in the number of hangings for two reasons. One was that murder became punishable by death only when combined with other offences. This did not help Evans and Allen, because they were charged with robbery as well as murder. The other reason was the new defence of diminished responsibility. It allowed many to escape the noose, and might have saved Evans. Tim McInerney has seen one case from 1963, a double murder, where the killer - with a similar psychiatric profile to Evans - escaped trial entirely, being sent instead to a special hospital. Doctors operate on the principle of ""do least harm"", he says. So he wonders what went through the minds of the doctors who examined Evans - knowing that if they didn't support diminished responsibility, he'd be hanged. John Cooper also points out that in the last years of the death penalty, ""it was in essence a postcode lottery - depending on which prison you were in, as to whether you survived"". This ""adds to the macabre nature of the last few months of the death penalty"", in his view. In 1964, Allen and Evans were the only people hanged in the UK. There were only two hangings the year before, as well. And less than a year after the two young men were executed, capital punishment was suspended in Great Britain. Parliament voted to make the suspension permanent in 1969. Pictures courtesy of the National Archives. Peter Allen and Gwynne Evans images copyright Mirrorpix.

Ofcom to probe BBC climate change items,"Interviews with former Chancellor Lord Lawson sparked complaints in 2014 and 2017 Media watchdog Ofcom has launched its first broadcasting standards investigation into the BBC since taking over as its regulator in April. Ofcom will look into whether Radio 4's Today programme broke broadcasting rules during an interview with climate change sceptic Lord Lawson in August. The BBC has admitted the item broke its guidelines and said Lord Lawson should have been challenged ""more robustly"". It followed a 2014 interview with Lord Lawson that also breached BBC rules. After that appearance,the BBC's editorial complaints unit upheld complaintsfrom three listeners that Today had given undue weight to his views and had conveyed a misleading impression of the scientific evidence. The flagship news programme invited the Conservative peer back in August 2017. BBC wrong to not challenge climate sceptic What is climate change? On that occasion, he said ""official figures"" showed average world temperatures had ""slightly declined"" - but he wasn't challenged on air and that view was shown to be false by the Met Office. The BBC admittedit should have challenged him and that the interview had breached its ""guidelines on accuracy and impartiality"". Although the BBC upheld the complaints again, one listener referred the matter to Ofcom, saying the BBC hadn't taken sufficient action. That prompted the regulator - which took over responsibility for overseeing the BBC's editorial standards in April - to investigate whether the interview broke its broadcasting code. Ofcom said: ""We are investigating whether this interview, which followed a similar interview in 2014, breached our rules on due accuracy and due impartiality."" A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We have already acknowledged that we should have challenged some of Lord Lawson's statements more robustly. ""We recognise the weight of scientific consensus on climate change and the Today programme has covered the subject on many separate occasions with a range of voices from scientific backgrounds."" In 2011, the BBC Trust drew up guidelines saying BBC coverage should reflect the ""general agreement among climate scientists"" that the evidence is in favour of global warming caused by human activity.

Flights suspended amid heavy fog,"Runway Two was closed because of fog All flights were temporarily suspended at Manchester Airport due to heavy fog and a ""minor defect"" on a runway. ""Essential repairs"" were being made to Runway One while weather conditions meant flights were ""unable to make use of Runway Two"", a spokeswoman said. It resulted in the cancellation of a number of flights and departure delays of more than five hours. Runway One was reopened shortly after 17:00 GMT but there were still some delays due to the backlog. The spokeswoman said passengers ""should check the status of their flights with their airline"" but added it hoped ""to have passengers on their way with minimal delays"".

May condemns abuse of MPs over Brexit,"Theresa May has condemned abuse of MPs following last week's Brexit vote. The prime minister said despite ""strongly held views"" on both sides of the Commons there was no place for threats of violence and intimidation. Several Conservative MPs have received abusive messages and tweets because of their views on Brexit. Speaker John Bercow said MPs were public servants doing what they thought to be right and were ""never mutineers, traitors nor enemies of the people"". Two of the MPs who rebelled against the government last week, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, said they had contacted the police about threats they received. Parliament Live: Rolling updates What next for Brexit talks? MP blames death threats on newspaper Brexit: All you need to know Ms Soubry suggested dossiers of material she had handed to the Speaker showed a direct link between newspaper headlines attacking her views and actions on Brexit and threats of violence against herself. ""This is serious stuff,"" she said. ""We have to call it out...I believe in freedom of the press but everyone has a responsibility not to incite abuse and death threats."" This video can not be played MPs are 'never mutineers nor traitors' As she ended her statement on last week's EU summit, Mrs May said it was right to debate Brexit with ""passion and conviction"". ""But there can never be a place for the threats of violence and intimidation against some members that we have seen in recent days,"" she said. ""Our politics must be better than that."" In a Commons statement shortly afterwards, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the ""bullying and demeaning"" actions of a small minority of people was a reminder there was a ""dark, unpleasant underbelly of society"". While she said she personally did not check her Twitter timeline any more, she said young people who ""lived on"" social media must be able to continue to do so safely. Responding for Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said there was a case for ""punitive fines"" for social media firms which do not promptly act on abusive material, including rape and death threats. The Daily Mail, which was criticised for publishing the photos of the 11 Tory MPs who voted against the government last week under the headline ""Proud of Yourselves?"", said its journalists also received violent abuse on social media and it was committed to ""tackling this menace"". ""No one has been more outspoken than the Daily Mail in condemning the viciousness of social media, and in particular the threats and abuse directed at politicians of all parties,"" a spokesman said. ""What must never happen is that it is used as an excuse to prevent proper and trenchant debate on the great political issues of the day, including Brexit."" In her statement, Mrs May also said the agreement secured at the summit to move talks on to the UK and EU's future relationship was ""an important step in delivering the smooth and orderly Brexit people voted for"". The prime minister also insisted the UK could secure a ""bespoke"" trade deal with the EU after Brexit despite the EU's chief negotiator suggesting this cannot happen. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said the agreement on what had been negotiated so far had been ""cobbled together"" with a ""vagueness"" that ""underlines the sharp divisions within the cabinet"". The UK voted to leave the European Union in June 2016 and Brexit is due to happen at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Amber Rudd have been on opposite sides of the EU debate Mrs May's statement to MPs came after she and her senior ministers formally discussed for the first time what the UK's long-term relationship with the EU should be. Until now the two negotiating teams have only been discussing ""divorce"" issues like how much money the UK owes. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was a ""clear divide"" between ministers, with some like Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd calling for the UK to stick closely to the EU's single market to preserve access for British firms. On the other side others, like Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, want more divergence so the UK has more freedom to strike its own trade deals with other countries. After the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, but before the final ""end state"" is reached, the government wants a temporary ""implementation period"" of about two years. This is what negotiations are expected to focus on in the coming weeks. Mrs May told MPs she wants ""access to one another's markets"" to continue ""as now"" during this period. The UK will also negotiate, and ""where possible"" sign, trade deals, which would kick in after the end of the implementation period, she said. She also said that during this period the UK will register people arriving from the EU to prepare for the new border controls promised after Brexit. The EU's negotiating position makes clear that it expects the UK to observe all of its rules - including on freedom of movement - and accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the implementation, or transition, period. Group calls for a 'shared market' with EU May: I won't be derailed on Brexit On Monday there was a warning from the EU side that whether a transitional arrangement will happen at all is not guaranteed. Mr Barnier's senior adviser Stefaan De Rynck said the EU hoped for a ""withdrawal treaty"" to be drawn up by October 2018, giving time for it to be agreed by politicians. He added: ""In that withdrawal treaty there could be a transitional arrangement, transition period, implementation period, which the prime minister refers to. ""That is not a given today, let's be very clear about that."" Describing Brexit as a ""lose-lose"" scenario, he added: ""For us, I don't think we will ever label Brexit a success. It's a mutual weakening, I think, of two parties."" But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, a key Leave campaigner, said the UK should be looking beyond the EU for trading relationships in the future. ""It's not a case of less trade, it's a case of a different type of trade, and British business will have to learn, as they do, to get by in a different world,"" he said.

'Russia meddled' after UK terror attacks,"The study indicated that the Russian-linked accounts were most active after the Manchester Arena attack Suspected Russia-linked Twitter accounts were used to ""extend the impact and harm"" of four 2017 terrorist attacks in the UK, a study says. Cardiff University researchers,externalhave found hundreds of related messages in 47 accounts previously tied to Russia. Some posts were anti-Muslim in nature, while others were critical of those who held such views, they report. Moscow has not commented but has denied past claims it sought to meddle in Western democracies via social media. Even so, one influential MP has condemned the activity. ""It is wrong that any organisation should spread disinformation following a terrorist attack, with the purpose of spreading hatred and making worse an already desperate and confusing situation,"" Damian Collins, chair of the digital, culture, media and sport select committee, told the BBC. ""At a time when victims are still lying on the ground and loved ones are in need of clear and accurate information about the situation, the deliberate spreading of disinformation is unforgivable. ""The methods of organisations such as the Russian-backed Internet Research Agency are becoming increasingly clear. Through our inquiry into fake news, I am determined that they should be exposed."" The BBC understands that the researchers did not share details of the accounts with Twitter. The social network limited itself to a brief comment: ""In each of the attacks, the tweets identified in this research represent less than 0.01% of the total tweets sent in the 24-hour period following the attack."" Cardiff University's Crime and Security Research Institute analysed millions of posts and comments gathered from various social media platforms, before honing in on 70 suspected ""sock puppet"" Twitter accounts. Forty-seven of these had previously been tied to Russia by US Congressional investigators, the Russian magazine RBK and others. It was these on which the inquiry then focused. Five people were killed and 50 injured in the Westminster attack on 22 March The researchers then determined that after: March'sattack at Westminster Bridge,35 relevant original messages had been posted by the accounts May'spop concert attack in Manchester,293 messages had been posted June'sLondon Bridge attack,140 messages had been posted June'sFinsbury Park attack,seven messages had been posted This tally of 475 messages were reposted more than 153,000 times in total by others, the researchers determined. Examples included: ""Another day, another Muslim terrorist attack. Retweet if you think that Islam needs to be banned!"" In one case, an account named @TEN_GOP - which presented itself as belonging to a Tennessee-based American - took issue with a photo of a woman in a hijab supposedly ignoring victims of the Westminster Bridge attack. ""She is being judged for her own actions & lack of sympathy. Would you just walk by? Or offer help?"" said the tweet. But another Russian-linked account, @Crystal1Johnson - which appeared to belong to a civil rights advocate - took an opposing stance. ""So this is how a world with glasses of hate look like [sic] - poor woman, being judged only by her clothes,"" it posted. The researchers highlighted that the accounts sometimes tweeted the messages directly at celebrities, including the author JK Rowling, in an attempt to get their posts noticed by their followers. One account asked JK Rowling why she had not expressed ""outrage at the Muslim terror attack"" in Manchester In addition, they note that several messages were directed at the English Defence League founder Tommy Robinson and UKIP's ex-leader Nigel Farage. ""The evidence suggests a systematic strategic political communications campaign being directed at the UK designed to amplify the public harms of terrorist attacks,"" concluded the authors. ""The implication is that we... should focus upon rapidly establishing what counter-measures are effective in offsetting the impact of 'soft facts' propagated by overseas interests as they seek to do the work of terrorist organisations by amplifying the capacity and capability of violent acts."" The researchers acknowledged that it was difficult to prove the activity had indeed been backed by the Russian authorities, but they added that they believed there were likely additional accounts they had not spotted. Another independent researcher who has also investigated suspected Russian social media posts said more work needed to be done. ""Using fragmented datasets we have observed unusual activities on Twitter - eg an increase in the number of fake accounts spreading biased information,"" commented Prof Sasha Talavera from Swansea University. ""But we cannot comment definitively about their scale and influence without a large-scale investigation.""

Shots fired in US base security incident,"A man has been arrested after driving through a military checkpoint, getting close to an aircraft at a base in Suffolk used by the US Air Force. Shots were fired by US personnel before the 44-year-old British man was overcome by staff at RAF Mildenhall. The base was temporarily put into lockdown as Suffolk police responded to reports of what they called a ""significant incident"". Police said the incident was being treated as trespass, not terrorism. Supt Kim Warner, from Suffolk Police, said the man, who suffered cuts and bruises, was arrested after a ""short pursuit"" and his vehicle was stopped by US security services. This video can not be played The base was temporarily put on lockdown There was ""no obvious motive at this stage"", he said, adding there was no wider threat to the public or the base and police were not looking for anyone else. The vehicle was brought to a halt close to a US plane, an Osprey, and it was not thought there was ""any significant damage"" to the vehicle or the aircraft, Supt Warner said. Suffolk Police was notified about a breach of security at about 13:40 GMT. ""Shots were fired by US security, I don't know how many, but I do know that shots were fired,"" Supt Warner said. ""It would be fair to say some of the minor injuries were probably as a result of him being apprehended,"" he added. The superintendent said there would now be an internal investigation by the US airbase into why guns were discharged. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

RAF Mildenhall is protected by Ministry of Defence police and US armed guards. The US Air Force said in a statement it was continuing to work with local authorities. The base is used as a transport hub by the US and is home to a fleet of refuelling aircraft and special operations forces. It has about 3,200 military personnel, with 400 to 500 UK civilian staff employed there. The base was one of 56 MoD sites earmarked for closure. However, the US Air Force said in September it was delaying plans to relocate its operations to a base in Germany until 2024. RAF Mildenhall has previously been a potential target for a terror attack against US military personnel. In May 2016,Junead Khan was given a life sentencefor preparing terrorist acts after a court heard how he used his job as a delivery driver to gather information about the base. 'Rules of engagement' Alex Dunlop, BBC Look East Defence reporter It's highly unusual for shots to be fired by US personnel. That said, in the past few years security has been stepped up at the US base, which now has a much tighter perimeter. You can't just drive into the base, you have to go through what's called the '""shed"" - your car is checked and you have to go through lots of tight security measures. RAF Mildenhallis essentially a little piece of America, with more than 3,000 US personnel based here, and there's very close co-operation between the American military police and the British civilian police. US bases here are governed by the Status of Forces Act so there are very clear rules of engagement here, with certain protocols in place when it come to the discharge of firearms. US personnel are allowed to fire guns, but these rules of engagement are not made public because of security considerations. There will undoubtedly be a conversation as a result of this incident between the Pentagon and the Ministry of Defence as to exactly what happened here and why guns were fired.

"Building safety cuts corners, says reviewThe leader of a review into building regulations after Grenfell is 'shocked' by safety practices.1han hour agoUK","The Grenfell Tower fire claimed the lives of 71 people in June 2017 Building regulations are leaving room for shortcuts, the woman leading a review into fire safety after the Grenfell Tower blaze has said. In her interim report,external, Dame Judith Hackitt said she was ""shocked"" by some of the practices she had seen, calling for better enforcement to ""hold to account those who try to cut corners."" She said a ""cultural change"" was needed instead of ""doing things cheaply"". The government says it accepts all of the report's recommendations. The independent review follows the 14 June fire, which killed 71 people. A final report is expected in spring next year. Grenfell victims remembered at St Paul's Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Dame Judith's report said the fire in the west London block - in which many people also lost their homes - ""should not have happened in our country in the 21st century"". Her review is aimed at making sure similar events do not happen in the future, rather than investigating the specific circumstances at Grenfell. She said the whole system of fire safety regulation regarding complex and high-rise buildings was ""not fit for purpose"", and left room for those who wanted to take shortcuts to do so. She called for a whole new system of enforcement and regulation for high-rise and complex buildings. But she added this did not mean buildings were unsafe, with major building failures ""very rare"" and many people in the housing system doing the right thing. The six-month anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire was marked earlier this month with a silent candlelit march Key problems Dame Judith found included regulations that were too complex and unclear; a lack of clarity about roles in design, construction and maintenance and a lack of a clear system to help residents raise concerns. Interim recommendations included: An overhaul of the ""Approved Documents"" in building regulations An accreditation system to ensure competence for people working on the design, construction, inspection and maintenance of complex buildings are suitably qualified Better consultation with fire services when designing buildings Building developers to ensure formal handover process for any new high-rise residential building before occupation More done to make sure that fire safety information is passed to the person responsible for running the building once it has been constructed Fire risk assessments are carried out at least annually Desktop studies to approve changes to cladding should be used only where appropriate and with sufficient, relevant test evidence. The cladding on the Grenfell tower is thought to have contributed to the spread of the fire Dame Judith said a ""tremendous amount of work"" had been done by central government and the fire and rescue service since Grenfell to reassure residents. But she called for a culture change across the entire industry and those parts of government that oversee it. A national memorial service was also held at St Paul's Cathedral Although separate fromthe public inquiry into the tragedy, being headed by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the review will run in parallel and add to his inquiry where it can. In a statement to MPs, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid said the government agreed there was a need for a change in culture and a more effective system ""to encourage people to do the right thing and hold to account those who try to cut corners"". He added: ""We fully support this direction of travel that has been signalled in Dame Judith's report. ""Achieving cultural change will inevitably take time, but while Dame Judith explores these issues further, she has also identified a number of areas where we can make a start today."" He went on to discuss measures that the government has already taken. ""While Dame Judith continues her vital work, we are continuing to support wider work to make existing buildings safer,"" he said. ""In the past six months, we have overseen a comprehensive set of fire safety tests on cladding components and systems,"" he said, adding that fire services had now inspected every residential tower block thought to be at risk. But Labour said the recommendations should have been implemented after a fire at Lakanal House, south London, in 2009, which left six dead. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said ministers had to start acting on existing recommendations immediately, rather than waiting for the final Hackitt report. Lord Gary Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said the report ""reinforces our warnings about the complexity and confusion in the current system"". He said the government should take action straightaway to work with councils and the industry to take the process of reform forward. Dame Judith is due appear in front of the Commons' local government committee to discuss the report.

Two guests die in Loch Lomond hotel fireFirefighters are still at scene of fire at luxury hotel after staff and guests are evacuated.1han hour agoGlasgow & West Scotland,"This video can not be played Footage of the fire at Cameron House Two guests have died after fire broke out at the Cameron House Hotel beside Loch Lomond. More than 200 guests were evacuated from the luxury resort after the alarm was raised at about 06:40. Police said one person was pronounced dead at the scene while another died after being taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. A newly-married couple and their young son were taken to hospital for treatment and later discharged. Police Scotland said the hotel, near Balloch, had been extensively damaged. Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that two people had died A number of guests were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation. The three people taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow were members of the same family who were rescued by firefighters. Speaking to the media gathered at the hotel's entrance, David McGown of the Scottish Fire and Rescue said: ""Unfortunately, and tragically, this has resulted in two people losing their life as a result of the fire. ""The fire and rescue service's condolences go out to the people involved in this tragic incident and our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the two people who lost their lives this morning. ""The fire has caused extensive damage to the central section of the hotel. ""Our crews have been working tirelessly since 07:00. We have 14 fire appliances at its height tackling this fire and more than 70 firefighters. ""As you can imagine, as well as being an absolutely tragic incident where people have lost their lives, it is an extremely complicated incident and fire to contain and will continue to do so. ""We will continue to work with partners to bring this incident to a conclusion."" Ch Insp Donald Leitch from Police Scotland said work was ongoing to establish the cause of the fire. He said: ""Police Scotland were called to Cameron House Hotel where 200 people were evacuated from the hotel which has been partly damaged. ""One person was pronounced dead at the scene. Four were taken to hospital where one person tragically died."" A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal. Fourteen fire appliances were sent to the scene Firefighters used jets to tackle the flames and smoke Smoke rises over Loch Lomond from the fire, as seen from Balloch A guest at the hotel told BBC Radio Scotland how she initially thought the fire alarm was a drill. Ainsley Huxham said: ""As soon as we left our room - I just thought it was a fire alarm, just like a practise go. ""But when we left - five stairs down from our room - we saw a whole room full of smoke and flames. ""So we had to run back down the hall, chapped on everyone's doors and shouted 'fire!'."" Emergency services working at the scene of the fire watched by guests She added: ""We got out within five minutes of the fire brigade getting called. ""And by the time we had got outside, the whole field was full of people."" Staff who turned up for their shifts at the hotel during the morning were being stopped at the entrance. Much of the interior of the main central section of the hotel, thought to be the oldest part, was visibly blackened, with upper floor windows smashed to allow the firefighters' water jets access to the flames. The Salvation Army were in attendance to provide the emergency services with food and drink. One woman who works in the kitchen told the BBC news website she just heard about the fire as she was getting ready for work. She said she didn't believe the news until she came down and saw the smoke. ""It's a really lovely hotel,"" she said. ""I'm so sorry to see this."" Stewart King, general manager of the neighbouring Duck Bay Marina, said he had been down to the hotel and was shocked by the extent of the damage. ""It was very bad,"" he said. Guests were sheltered in Cameron House's Boathouse restaurant while the situation was ongoing. Cameron House is one of Scotland's most luxurious hotels, with views across Loch Lomond. The venue offers a romantic location for weddings, a championship standard course for golfers and five-star facilities for guests. The chef Martin Wishart has a Michelin-starred restaurant at the hotel. Cameron House is owned by US investment firm KSL Capital Partners, which was reported to have paid between Â£70m and Â£80m for the 132-room property in 2015. A statement on the hotel's website read: ""Due to an ongoing incident please be aware that Cameron House will remain closed to arriving guests for at least the next 72 hours. ""We would ask all guests and customers to remain patient as we work with the emergency services to establish the extent of the damage and ascertain when we will be able to re-open. ""More information will follow in due course."" Flags were being flown at half-mast at West Dunbartonshire Council buildings. Provost William Hendrie said: ""For something like this to happen so close to Christmas is just too painful to comprehend. ""I know the staff at Cameron House will also be devastated and our thoughts also go out to them."" Andy Roger, resort director at Cameron House, said the hotel was working closely with investigators to identify the cause of the fire. ""The safety and well-being of our guests, employees and neighbours is our first priority, and our deepest condolences are with the families of those affected. ""We are working closely with the authorities to determine the cause of the fire, and to provide support to our guests and the families of those affected."" Cameron House situated by Loch Lomond is one of Scotland's most prestigious hotels Under the ownership of the Smollett family, Cameron House was extended and refurbished a number of times. It was substantially refurbished in 1830 and underwent rebuilding work following a fire in 1865. The mansion house was sold by the Smolletts in 1986 and converted into a hotel. The five star Loch Lomond venue has 132 rooms and is surrounded by 100 acres of woodland. The hotel is a popular wedding venue and houses the Michelin starred Martin Wishart at Loch Lomond restaurant. In all, the resort has five restaurants, access to a spa and a championship golf course. American investment firm KSL Capital Partners bought Cameron House for about Â£70m two years ago.

Twitter tightens hate speech rulesThere are more ways to be banned from Twitter as it expands what it considers hateful behaviour.2h2 hours agoTechnology,"Twitter has not disclosed which accounts face closure as a consequence of its new rules Twitter has widened what constitutes  hateful and harmful behaviour on its platform, and says it will begin enforcing stricter rules concerning it. Information contained in a person's profile, regardless of what they actually tweet, will now be considered. Those who express an affiliation with groups that use or celebrate violence to achieve their aims will be permanently suspended, Twitter said. Hateful imagery - such as the Nazi swastika - will now be hidden. A ""sensitive media"" prompt will be shown to users before they can opt to view it. But such content will no longer be allowed on a person's profile page, and users will be asked to remove it. Repeat violators will be banned. The company said the move would ""reduce the amount of abusive behaviour and hateful conduct"" on the network. A spokeswoman confirmed profiles would be removed, but would not give an example of an account in violation of the rules. ""If an accountâs profile information includes a violent threat or multiple slurs, epithets, racist or sexist tropes, incites fear, or reduces someone to less than human, it will be permanently suspended,"" she explained. ""We plan to develop internal tools to help us identify violating accounts to supplement user reports."" Twitter has promised a more robust system to appeal against decisions, but said that it was still in development. The new rulings will also have an important exception. ""This policy does not apply to military or government entities and we will consider exceptions for groups that are currently engaging in (or have engaged in) peaceful resolution,"" the company said. The changes had been made following consultations with Twitter's Trust and Safety Council, a group consisting of representatives from more than 40 organisations dealing with, among other things, anti-Semitism, homophobia, sexism and racism. Twitter has defined hateful imagery as ""logos, symbols, or images whose purpose is to promote hostility and malice against others based on their race, religion, disability, sexual orientation, or ethnicity/national origin"". The announcement is Twitter's latest attempt, in a difficult year for the company, to clamp down on what many people consider its most pressing issue: disgusting behaviour from a significant number of users. President Trump caused controversy when he retweeted Britain First's deputy leader The challenge for the company has been to grapple with offensive content while not being seen to censor legitimate political views. This was recently brought sharply into view when US President Donald Trump retweeted three tweets by Jayda Fransen, deputy leader of far-right group Britain First. Ms Fransen was previously convicted of religiously-aggravated harassment. UK Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said it was ""wrong for the president to have done this"". A Twitter spokesperson would not say if Britain First would fall foul of the stricter rules, adding it would not comment on individual groups or accounts.

Watchdog mulls Amazon Prime inquiry,"Amazon's promise of next-day deliveries could be investigated amid customer complaints that it is failing to meet that pledge. The UK Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) is considering whether to launch a formal inquiry into Amazon. The firm's top service, Prime, offers next-day deliveries for Â£7.99 a month. The ASA said: ""We have received a handful of complaints about Amazon parcel deliveries and we are at the initial assessment stage."" An Amazon spokesman told the BBC the ASA had confirmed to it there was no investigation at this time. The ASA said there had been five complaints since the start of the month. Amazon offers free delivery above a certain minimum spend, but express, unlimited delivery for Prime customers. It also offers this coming Saturday, 23 December, as its final order date for Christmas orders, three days later than the Wednesday offered for non-Prime customers. The BBC has been inundated with comments from Amazon Prime customers. Most reported problems with deliveries. Gary from Farnham in Surrey, said: ""Our Amazon Prime deliveries often miss their 'next day' target. We always make a point of complaining, and are generally given a 30-day extension to our annual subscription."" Craig from Carluke in South Lanarkshire, said his Prime orders were rarely delivered within a day: ""They offer next-day delivery but it actually takes two days to come, which also isn't part of the agreement which I pay for. Not acceptable."" But other customers were happy. One pointed out that it was ""unreasonable"" to expect perfection every time. ""It is a fantastic service and it is totally unreasonable to expect that things may rarely not work out,"" he said. Amazon advises customers to contact customer services if they do not receive a parcel by the estimated delivery date. The consumer rights group Which? points out that a company missing its delivery date is in breach of contract. It says that consumers have the right to terminate the purchase and get a full refund in that instance. It says the first step should be to contact the retailer directly,externalto make a complaint that a parcel has not been delivered and request they take action to remedy the situation.

Ofcom to probe BBC climate change itemsIt's the regulator's first investigation since taking over responsibility for BBC standards.8m8 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts,"Interviews with former Chancellor Lord Lawson sparked complaints in 2014 and 2017 Media watchdog Ofcom has launched its first broadcasting standards investigation into the BBC since taking over as its regulator in April. Ofcom will look into whether Radio 4's Today programme broke broadcasting rules during an interview with climate change sceptic Lord Lawson in August. The BBC has admitted the item broke its guidelines and said Lord Lawson should have been challenged ""more robustly"". It followed a 2014 interview with Lord Lawson that also breached BBC rules. After that appearance,the BBC's editorial complaints unit upheld complaintsfrom three listeners that Today had given undue weight to his views and had conveyed a misleading impression of the scientific evidence. The flagship news programme invited the Conservative peer back in August 2017. BBC wrong to not challenge climate sceptic What is climate change? On that occasion, he said ""official figures"" showed average world temperatures had ""slightly declined"" - but he wasn't challenged on air and that view was shown to be false by the Met Office. The BBC admittedit should have challenged him and that the interview had breached its ""guidelines on accuracy and impartiality"". Although the BBC upheld the complaints again, one listener referred the matter to Ofcom, saying the BBC hadn't taken sufficient action. That prompted the regulator - which took over responsibility for overseeing the BBC's editorial standards in April - to investigate whether the interview broke its broadcasting code. Ofcom said: ""We are investigating whether this interview, which followed a similar interview in 2014, breached our rules on due accuracy and due impartiality."" A BBC spokeswoman said: ""We have already acknowledged that we should have challenged some of Lord Lawson's statements more robustly. ""We recognise the weight of scientific consensus on climate change and the Today programme has covered the subject on many separate occasions with a range of voices from scientific backgrounds."" In 2011, the BBC Trust drew up guidelines saying BBC coverage should reflect the ""general agreement among climate scientists"" that the evidence is in favour of global warming caused by human activity. That doesn't mean scientific research shouldn't be properly scrutinised or that sceptical views should be excluded from BBC programmes, according to the guidelines.

"Sharp drop in UK suicide ratesRates fell for both men and women, although men still account for three-quarters of cases.4h4 hours agoHealth","Suicide rates in the UK have seen the largest decrease in 20 years, official figures reveal. There were 3.6% fewer suicides registered in 2016 than in 2015 - a decrease by 223 deaths from 6,188, Office for National Statistics data shows. Rates fell for both men and women, although men still account for three-quarters of cases. Experts believe the drop shows suicide-prevention initiatives are helping. For deaths registered in 2016 in the UK: people aged 40 to 44 years had the highest suicide rate - 15.3 per 100,000 this age group also had the highest rate among males - 24.1 per 100,000 the age group with the highest rate for females was 50 to 54 years the English rate has fallen a significant amount, the Welsh and Northern Ireland rates have both fallen slightly, and the Scottish rate has risen a small amount Mental health problems are important influences, as well as alcohol and substance misuse. Relationship breakdown can also be a factor - suicide risk is high among divorced men. Bereavement and social loneliness can be contributors. From 1981 to 1990, men aged 75 and over had the highest age-specific suicide rate. Between 1981 and 2016, the male rate of suicide for this age group more than halved. The Samaritans says deprivation is another link. Men from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are 10 times more likely to die by suicide than those in more affluent areas. A spokeswoman said: ""There is still a lot of work to be done because suicide still kills three times more people than road traffic accidents. ""Samaritans is working hard with partners, including the NHS, other charities and local authorities, to bring these figures down further. ""Suicide is not inevitable, it's preventable and politicians, employers, health bodies and educators all have a role in identifying and supporting those most at risk."" Call the Samaritans on 116 123 (UK and Ireland), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit theSamaritans website,externalto find details of the nearest branch. Vicki Nash, Head of Policy and Campaigns at Mind, the mental health charity, said: ""It is encouraging to see that the number of suicides appears to be falling. Not all suicides are mental-health related but the majority are and we know from previous research that there has been particular progress when it comes to people in touch with mental health services. ""We need to ensure that these are the beginnings of much longer-term trends - we lose almost 6,000 lives a year to suicide and every one is a tragedy, so despite these positive findings it is clear that we still have a long way to go.""

Police 'saw murdered man as nuisance',"Mr Ebrahimi was murdered outside his flat in Brislington in July 2013 Three police officers and a PCSO failed to act on complaints of a disabled man just two days before he was brutally murdered by a neighbour, a court heard. Bijan Ebrahimi, 44, was killed in a vigilante attack in 2013 after he was falsely accused of being a paedophile. Bristol Crown Court was told PCs Kevin Duffy, 52, Leanne Winter, 38, Helen Harris, 40, and PCSO Andrew Passmore 55, saw Mr Ebrahimi as ""a nuisance"". They each deny a charge of misconduct in public office. The trial follows an investigation by thepolice watchdoginto his death. Opening the case for the prosecution, Crispin Aylett QC described the events leading up to the murder. Mr Ebrahimi called the police on 11 July 2013 to report he had been attacked by his neighbour Lee James, 26, who suspected him of being a paedophile. James, who later admitted murder, was described at the time by PC Winter to be ""foaming at the mouth"" and vowed he would ""do time to protect his children"", the court learned. Mr Aylett said James was with a crowd who all took his side and ""vigilantism was in the air"". Lee James (l) and Steven Morley were jailed in 2013 Following the episode, Mr Ebrahimi was arrested but James' threats were overlooked, the court heard. Mr Ebrahimi was released by police the following day, 12 July, and after returning to his home on Capgrave Crescent, Brislington, Bristol, made 12 calls to the police in the hope PC Duffy, the local beat manager, would intervene. The prosecution claimed the officer regarded Mr Ebrahimi as a ""liar and a nuisance"" and the defendants were ""not interested"" in his complaints. The court heard PC Duffy asked PCSO Passmore to patrol the area and Mr Passmore claimed to have spent an hour in the area. ""The truth is that he can only have driven up and down the road,"" Mr Aylett said. ""Had something been done, Lee James would have at least known the police were keeping an eye. ""This was a toxic situation that required proactive policing,"" he added. ""Instead we allege that these individuals failed Mr Ebrahimi. It's not just incompetence - we suggest they disliked Mr Ebrahimi."" Two days later James attacked Mr Ebrahimi outside his flat then, with help, set fire to his body. He pleaded guilty and is serving a life sentence. Accomplice Steven Morley was sentenced to four years in prison for assisting an offender. Earlier, PC Duffy told the court Mr Ebrahimi's complaints about various neighbours were always met with counter-allegations. After Mr Ebrahimi's death, the police watchdog interviewed PC Duffy. He told them his ""experience"" of dealing with Mr Ebrahimi ""taught"" him to ""evaluate all information"" and ""seek other accounts"" before filing a report. Prosecuting, Mr Aylett added that PC Duffy's ""starting point"" was to ""disbelieve"" Mr Ebrahimi unless it was corroborated. The trial continues.

Man arrested over Briton's Lebanon death,"Police in Lebanon have arrested an Uber driver in connection with the murder of a British woman in Beirut. The body of Rebecca Dykes, who worked at the British Embassy in the city, was found by a motorway on Saturday. The arrested man was 35 and has served several prison sentences, a senior Lebanese security source told the BBC. Ms Dykes had been sexually assaulted and strangled, and the man is expected to be charged with rape and murder later this week, police sources said. Her family said in a statement: ""We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Rebecca. We are doing all we can to understand what happened."" Ms Dykes, who is believed to have been 30, had been working in Beirut as the programme and policy manager for the Department for International Development since January 2017. Lebanon country profile It is thought she spent Friday evening at a going-away party for a colleague in the popular Gemmayzeh district of Beirut. After leaving the bar at about midnight it appears she was abducted. Her body was found close to a motorway on the outskirts of the city. The body of Rebecca Dykes was found near a main road outisde Beirut The Foreign Office said it was in contact with the Lebanese authorities and confirmed an arrest had been made. The suspect was arrested in the early hours of Monday morning after police reportedly traced his car on traffic management CCTV. An official told the Reuters and AFP news agencies the preliminary investigation had showed Ms Dykes's killing ""was not politically motivated"". By Martin Patience, BBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut The Gemmayzeh district of Beirut where Rebecca Dykes was last seen alive is well-known for having some of the city's best and most expensive bars and restaurants. There is normally a relaxed atmosphere. It is a neighbourhood where foreign aid workers, diplomats and journalists mingle with wealthy Lebanese often into the early hours of the morning. Despite the chaos seen elsewhere in the region, Beirut in recent years has been regarded as relatively safe.  That is why this murder has left the international community so shocked. After a late night out, many people would previously have thought nothing of catching one of the cabs that ply the streets, or calling for an Uber. For a short while, anyway, that is likely to change. People will be more careful about how they get home.  Beirut may be relatively safe but - as in any big city across the world - this murder is a reminder of the dangers. Josie Ensor, the Daily Telegraph's correspondent in Beirut, says the case has left foreign residents in the city unsettled. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, she said Beirut was a ""very tight-knit community, so when something happens to one person, it feels quite close"". Ms Ensor, who was due to attend the same party on Friday evening, added Ms Dykes ""had just landed on her feet in Beirut and was starting to make friends and getting to know the city"". Hugo Shorter, the British Ambassador to Lebanon, said the whole embassy was ""deeply shocked"" and ""saddened"" by the news. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

More than 200 guests were evacuated from the luxury resort after the alarm was raised at about 06:40. Police said one person was pronounced dead at the scene while another died after being taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. A newly-married couple and their young son were taken to hospital for treatment and later discharged. Police Scotland said the hotel, near Balloch, had been extensively damaged. Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that two people had died A number of guests were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation. The three people taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow were members of the same family who were rescued by firefighters. Speaking to the media gathered at the hotel's entrance, David McGown of the Scottish Fire and Rescue said: ""Unfortunately, and tragically, this has resulted in two people losing their life as a result of the fire. ""The fire and rescue service's condolences go out to the people involved in this tragic incident and our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the two people who lost their lives this morning. ""The fire has caused extensive damage to the central section of the hotel. ""Our crews have been working tirelessly since 07:00. We have 14 fire appliances at its height tackling this fire and more than 70 firefighters. ""As you can imagine, as well as being an absolutely tragic incident where people have lost their lives, it is an extremely complicated incident and fire to contain and will continue to do so. ""We will continue to work with partners to bring this incident to a conclusion."" Ch Insp Donald Leitch from Police Scotland said work was ongoing to establish the cause of the fire. He said: ""Police Scotland were called to Cameron House Hotel where 200 people were evacuated from the hotel which has been partly damaged. ""One person was pronounced dead at the scene. Four were taken to hospital where one person tragically died."" A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal. Fourteen fire appliances were sent to the scene Firefighters used jets to tackle the flames and smoke Smoke rises over Loch Lomond from the fire, as seen from Balloch A guest at the hotel told BBC Radio Scotland how she initially thought the fire alarm was a drill. Ainsley Huxham said: ""As soon as we left our room - I just thought it was a fire alarm, just like a practise go. ""But when we left - five stairs down from our room - we saw a whole room full of smoke and flames. ""So we had to run back down the hall, chapped on everyone's doors and shouted 'fire!'."" Emergency services working at the scene of the fire watched by guests She added: ""We got out within five minutes of the fire brigade getting called. ""And by the time we had got outside, the whole field was full of people."" Staff who turned up for their shifts at the hotel during the morning were being stopped at the entrance. Much of the interior of the main central section of the hotel, thought to be the oldest part, was visibly blackened, with upper floor windows smashed to allow the firefighters' water jets access to the flames. The Salvation Army were in attendance to provide the emergency services with food and drink. One woman who works in the kitchen told the BBC news website she just heard about the fire as she was getting ready for work. She said she didn't believe the news until she came down and saw the smoke. ""It's a really lovely hotel,"" she said. ""I'm so sorry to see this."" Stewart King, general manager of the neighbouring Duck Bay Marina, said he had been down to the hotel and was shocked by the extent of the damage. ""It was very bad,"" he said. Guests were sheltered in Cameron House's Boathouse restaurant while the situation was ongoing. Cameron House is one of Scotland's most luxurious hotels, with views across Loch Lomond. The venue offers a romantic location for weddings, a championship standard course for golfers and five-star facilities for guests. The chef Martin Wishart has a Michelin-starred restaurant at the hotel. Cameron House is owned by US investment firm KSL Capital Partners, which was reported to have paid between Â£70m and Â£80m for the 132-room property in 2015. A statement on the hotel's website read: ""Due to an ongoing incident please be aware that Cameron House will remain closed to arriving guests for at least the next 72 hours. ""We would ask all guests and customers to remain patient as we work with the emergency services to establish the extent of the damage and ascertain when we will be able to re-open. ""More information will follow in due course."" Flags were being flown at half-mast at West Dunbartonshire Council buildings. Provost William Hendrie said: ""For something like this to happen so close to Christmas is just too painful to comprehend. ""I know the staff at Cameron House will also be devastated and our thoughts also go out to them."" Andy Roger, resort director at Cameron House, said the hotel was working closely with investigators to identify the cause of the fire. ""The safety and well-being of our guests, employees and neighbours is our first priority, and our deepest condolences are with the families of those affected. ""We are working closely with the authorities to determine the cause of the fire, and to provide support to our guests and the families of those affected.""

UK plan to tackle plastic waste threatA four-point plan for tackling plastic waste has been outlined by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove.2h2 hours agoScience & Environment,"A four-point plan for tackling plastic waste has been outlined by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove. He told BBC News that he wants to reduce the amount of plastic used in the UK, and to make it simpler for people to recycle. Environmentalists fear Mr Gove will be reluctant to set tighter rules for firms which benefit from the current use of plastics. The Environment Secretary outlined his thoughts during an informal meeting. He says he wants to: Cut the total amount of plastic in circulation. Reduce the number of different plastics in use, because that will help recycling firms Improve the rate of recycling, which has been slipping recently. And make it easier for individuals to know what goes into the recycling bin and what goes into general rubbish. Reality Check: Are seafood lovers eating plastic? Recycling schemes often differ from one borough to the next, making it very confusing for households. Mr Gove said he was considering introducing common standards throughout local authorities to make recycling simpler. But Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association told BBC News that wouldn't work. He said: ""Common standards for recycling wouldn't be effective, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem."" ""A key component is reducing the amount of unrecyclable waste we produce in the first place, which is why it's essential that manufacturers and retailers work with us to achieve this. ""What we need is packaging that is easily recyclable - this would not only make waste disposal easier for our residents, but save considerable amounts of money and energy, whilst protecting our environment. Mr Gove agreed the UK must expand its capacity to recycle, especially in the light of China's decision to refuse to recycle British waste in future. In the short term, he said, the UK would look to other East Asian nations to recycle British waste. But he said in the longer term the nation must ""stop offshoring our dirt."" He says he's been spurred to action by David Attenborough's Blue Planet series, which highlighted the harm to marine life from plastic litter. Mr Gove says the rate of recycling needs to be improved Mr Gove has already been consulting with drinks firms on a deposit scheme to cut the amount of plastic bottles finding their way into rivers and the sea. Some environmentalists doubt that plastics manufacturers, retailers, drinks manufacturers and fast food outlets will volunteer to take the measures needed to reduce the use of plastics. Dr Dominic Hogg, from the Eunomia consultancy, said the plastics issue was huge, complex and urgent. He told BBC News the problem started with industry allowing pellets used to produce plastics to escape into the environment. Then, he said there are big problems with current recycling. ""We have a variety of collection and sorting systems,"" he said. ""Not all of which generate good quality plastics. The Chinese are about to close the border on us. We have a real problem. ""We're not recycling enough plastics. We're obsessed with convenience. Too much stuff is used to deliver a product which is soon discarded - often without any recycling. ""What we're throwing is increasingly being incinerated - and incinerators are not efficient generators of electrical energy."" Many nations are trying to tackle plastic litter. Kenya, for instance, is one of many African nations that have banned single use plastic bags. It is now aboutto clamp down on plastic bottles, too. Plastic waste is just one of the big issues in Mr Gove's in-tray. The Environment Secretary told me he also intended to unveil the government's long-delayed 25-year Environment Plan in the New Year. He acknowledged that recent Brexit negotiations had delayed his plans for an early reform of fishing and farm policy in the UK. He confessed that the Brexit deal to keep current EU policies during the transition period would make early changes extremely difficult. Mr Gove said he was working with the Department for International Development (DFID) to see how UK aid money could be used to help developing nations tackle the tide of plastic waste. This would be on the agenda for the next Commonwealth heads of governments meeting, he said. He said he also wanted to expand the UK's world-leading network of ocean protected zones round far-flung territories.

Speaker John Bercow said MPs were public servants doing what they thought to be right and were ""never mutineers, traitors nor enemies of the people"". Two of the MPs who rebelled against the government last week, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, said they had contacted the police about threats they received. Parliament Live: Rolling updates What next for Brexit talks? MP blames death threats on newspaper Brexit: All you need to know Ms Soubry suggested dossiers of material she had handed to the Speaker showed a direct link between newspaper headlines attacking her views and actions on Brexit and threats of violence against herself. ""This is serious stuff,"" she said. ""We have to call it out...I believe in freedom of the press but everyone has a responsibility not to incite abuse and death threats."" This video can not be played MPs are 'never mutineers nor traitors' As she ended her statement on last week's EU summit, Mrs May said it was right to debate Brexit with ""passion and conviction"". ""But there can never be a place for the threats of violence and intimidation against some members that we have seen in recent days,"" she said. ""Our politics must be better than that."" In a Commons statement shortly afterwards, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the ""bullying and demeaning"" actions of a small minority of people was a reminder there was a ""dark, unpleasant underbelly of society"". While she said she personally did not check her Twitter timeline any more, she said young people who ""lived on"" social media must be able to continue to do so safely. Responding for Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said there was a case for ""punitive fines"" for social media firms which do not promptly act on abusive material, including rape and death threats. The Daily Mail, which was criticised for publishing the photos of the 11 Tory MPs who voted against the government last week under the headline ""Proud of Yourselves?"", said its journalists also received violent abuse on social media and it was committed to ""tackling this menace"". ""No one has been more outspoken than the Daily Mail in condemning the viciousness of social media, and in particular the threats and abuse directed at politicians of all parties,"" a spokesman said. ""What must never happen is that it is used as an excuse to prevent proper and trenchant debate on the great political issues of the day, including Brexit."" In her statement, Mrs May also said the agreement secured at the summit to move talks on to the UK and EU's future relationship was ""an important step in delivering the smooth and orderly Brexit people voted for"". The prime minister also insisted the UK could secure a ""bespoke"" trade deal with the EU after Brexit despite the EU's chief negotiator suggesting this cannot happen. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said the agreement on what had been negotiated so far had been ""cobbled together"" with a ""vagueness"" that ""underlines the sharp divisions within the cabinet"". The UK voted to leave the European Union in June 2016 and Brexit is due to happen at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Amber Rudd have been on opposite sides of the EU debate Mrs May's statement to MPs came after she and her senior ministers formally discussed for the first time what the UK's long-term relationship with the EU should be. Until now the two negotiating teams have only been discussing ""divorce"" issues like how much money the UK owes. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was a ""clear divide"" between ministers, with some like Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd calling for the UK to stick closely to the EU's single market to preserve access for British firms. On the other side others, like Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, want more divergence so the UK has more freedom to strike its own trade deals with other countries. After the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, but before the final ""end state"" is reached, the government wants a temporary ""implementation period"" of about two years. This is what negotiations are expected to focus on in the coming weeks. Mrs May told MPs she wants ""access to one another's markets"" to continue ""as now"" during this period. The UK will also negotiate, and ""where possible"" sign, trade deals, which would kick in after the end of the implementation period, she said. She also said that during this period the UK will register people arriving from the EU to prepare for the new border controls promised after Brexit. The EU's negotiating position makes clear that it expects the UK to observe all of its rules - including on freedom of movement - and accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the implementation, or transition, period. Group calls for a 'shared market' with EU May: I won't be derailed on Brexit On Monday there was a warning from the EU side that whether a transitional arrangement will happen at all is not guaranteed. Mr Barnier's senior adviser Stefaan De Rynck said the EU hoped for a ""withdrawal treaty"" to be drawn up by October 2018, giving time for it to be agreed by politicians. He added: ""In that withdrawal treaty there could be a transitional arrangement, transition period, implementation period, which the prime minister refers to. ""That is not a given today, let's be very clear about that."" Describing Brexit as a ""lose-lose"" scenario, he added: ""For us, I don't think we will ever label Brexit a success. It's a mutual weakening, I think, of two parties."" But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, a key Leave campaigner, said the UK should be looking beyond the EU for trading relationships in the future. ""It's not a case of less trade, it's a case of a different type of trade, and British business will have to learn, as they do, to get by in a different world,"" he said.

Building safety 'cuts corners' says review,"The Grenfell Tower fire claimed the lives of 71 people in June 2017 Building regulations are leaving room for shortcuts, the woman leading a review into fire safety after the Grenfell Tower blaze has said. In her interim report,external, Dame Judith Hackitt said she was ""shocked"" by some of the practices she had seen, calling for better enforcement to ""hold to account those who try to cut corners."" She said a ""cultural change"" was needed instead of ""doing things cheaply"". The government says it accepts all of the report's recommendations. The independent review follows the 14 June fire, which killed 71 people. A final report is expected in spring next year. Grenfell victims remembered at St Paul's Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Dame Judith's report said the fire in the west London block - in which many people also lost their homes - ""should not have happened in our country in the 21st century"". Her review is aimed at making sure similar events do not happen in the future, rather than investigating the specific circumstances at Grenfell. She said the whole system of fire safety regulation regarding complex and high-rise buildings was ""not fit for purpose"", and left room for those who wanted to take shortcuts to do so. She called for a whole new system of enforcement and regulation for high-rise and complex buildings. But she added this did not mean buildings were unsafe, with major building failures ""very rare"" and many people in the housing system doing the right thing. The six-month anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire was marked earlier this month with a silent candlelit march Key problems Dame Judith found included regulations that were too complex and unclear; a lack of clarity about roles in design, construction and maintenance and a lack of a clear system to help residents raise concerns. Interim recommendations included: An overhaul of the ""Approved Documents"" in building regulations An accreditation system to ensure competence for people working on the design, construction, inspection and maintenance of complex buildings are suitably qualified Better consultation with fire services when designing buildings Building developers to ensure formal handover process for any new high-rise residential building before occupation More done to make sure that fire safety information is passed to the person responsible for running the building once it has been constructed Fire risk assessments are carried out at least annually Desktop studies to approve changes to cladding should be used only where appropriate and with sufficient, relevant test evidence. The cladding on the Grenfell tower is thought to have contributed to the spread of the fire Dame Judith said a ""tremendous amount of work"" had been done by central government and the fire and rescue service since Grenfell to reassure residents. But she called for a culture change across the entire industry and those parts of government that oversee it. A national memorial service was also held at St Paul's Cathedral Although separate fromthe public inquiry into the tragedy, being headed by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the review will run in parallel and add to his inquiry where it can. In a statement to MPs, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid said the government agreed there was a need for a change in culture and a more effective system ""to encourage people to do the right thing and hold to account those who try to cut corners"". He added: ""We fully support this direction of travel that has been signalled in Dame Judith's report. ""Achieving cultural change will inevitably take time, but while Dame Judith explores these issues further, she has also identified a number of areas where we can make a start today."" He went on to discuss measures that the government has already taken. ""While Dame Judith continues her vital work, we are continuing to support wider work to make existing buildings safer,"" he said. ""In the past six months, we have overseen a comprehensive set of fire safety tests on cladding components and systems,"" he said, adding that fire services had now inspected every residential tower block thought to be at risk. But Labour said the recommendations should have been implemented after a fire at Lakanal House, south London, in 2009, which left six dead. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said ministers had to start acting on existing recommendations immediately, rather than waiting for the final Hackitt report. Lord Gary Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said the report ""reinforces our warnings about the complexity and confusion in the current system"". He said the government should take action straightaway to work with councils and the industry to take the process of reform forward. Dame Judith is due appear in front of the Commons' local government committee to discuss the report.

EU to investigate Ikea's tax affairs,"The European Commission is to open an in-depth investigation into Ikea's corporate tax structure. The Commission said Dutch-based Inter Ikea, one of the Swedish giant's two divisions, may have been given unfair tax advantages by the Netherlands. European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager said all firms ""big or small, multinational or not, should pay their fair share of tax"". The EU will look at whether Ikea's tax affairs breach EU rules on state aid. Under EU law, member states cannot give selective tax benefits to multinational groups that are not available to other firms. ""The Commission has concerns that two [Dutch] tax rulings may have given Inter Ikea Systems an unfair advantage compared to other companies,"" it said. The move is the latest crackdown by the EU competition authority on tax deals between EU countries and multi-nationals. A spokesman for Inter Ikea Group said the way it had been taxed ""has in our view been in accordance with EU rules"". ""It is good if the investigation can bring clarity and confirm that,"" he added. Denmark's Vestager takes on multinationals Is Ikea the Marmite of retailers? The Commission's Ikea inquiry is focused on two tax agreements between the Netherlands and Inter Ikea which it alleges ""have significantly reduced"" the firm's taxable profits in the Netherlands. Netherlands-based Inter Ikea operates the franchise business of Ikea. It collects royalties from other parts of Ikea and pays little tax on the proceeds. The Commission says that in 2006, a Dutch tax ruling enabled Inter Ikea to pay a ""significant"" annual licence fee to another Ikea unit in Luxembourg, thereby shifting revenue to a jurisdiction where it remained untaxed. Then in 2011, after the Luxembourg tax scheme was deemed illegal, Inter Ikea arranged a second tax ruling with the Netherlands. This ruling focused on a loan deal with an Ikea unit in Liechtenstein, which enabled Inter Ikea to shift ""a significant part of its franchise profits"" to a low-tax jurisdiction. A senior Dutch EU official said it would look at the details of the case. ""The Netherlands fully supports the Commission's work,"" they added. Richard Murphy, professor of practice in international political economy at City University, said Ikea's tax arrangements were ""unusually complicated"" and as a result, an EU probe was ""inevitable"". ""Is their level of tax disproportionate to their overall activity in a country is undoubtedly what [the European Commission] are looking at here,"" he said. The European Commission is not so much worried about different countries in the European Union having different tax policies, in fact considering it is supposed to be one, seamless market, there are a whole range of company tax rates and policies across the EU. What it does not like are tax deals that are available for one type of company, huge multi-nationals, but not to everyone else. Your local High Street furniture store has enough trouble competing with the likes of Ikea, with its massive stores, name recognition, buying power and marketing budget, without Ikea also having access to tax breaks that it could never use. That is why Ikea is just the latest in a long line of giant companies that the European Competition Commissioner Margrethe Vestager has gone after. She has already had Amazon, McDonalds and Apple in her sights, and this is big-game hunting;  Apple alone was found to have benefited to the tune of Â£11.5bn in unfair tax breaks. The EU's competition chief Margrethe Vestager is worried giant firms are gaining unfair advantages over smaller rivals The Commission has recently ordered various member states to collect billons of euros' worth of back taxes from Apple, Starbucks, Amazon and Fiat. The European Commission is worried that giant companies gain an unfair advantage over smaller rivals which have no chance of using similar tax schemes. Amazon and Apple hit in EU tax crackdown Ireland forced to collect â¬13bn Apple tax Ikea sees annual UK sales top Â£1.8bn Is Ikea the Marmite of retailers?

Four injured in Loch Lomond hotel fire,"This video can not be played Footage of the fire at Cameron House Two guests have died after fire broke out at the Cameron House Hotel beside Loch Lomond. More than 200 guests were evacuated from the luxury resort after the alarm was raised at about 06:40. Police said one person was pronounced dead at the scene while another died after being taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. A newly-married couple and their young son were taken to hospital for treatment and later discharged. Police Scotland said the hotel, near Balloch, had been extensively damaged. Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that two people had died A number of guests were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation. The three people taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow were members of the same family who were rescued by firefighters. Speaking to the media gathered at the hotel's entrance, David McGown of the Scottish Fire and Rescue said: ""Unfortunately, and tragically, this has resulted in two people losing their life as a result of the fire. ""The fire and rescue service's condolences go out to the people involved in this tragic incident and our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the two people who lost their lives this morning. ""The fire has caused extensive damage to the central section of the hotel. ""Our crews have been working tirelessly since 07:00. We have 14 fire appliances at its height tackling this fire and more than 70 firefighters. ""As you can imagine, as well as being an absolutely tragic incident where people have lost their lives, it is an extremely complicated incident and fire to contain and will continue to do so. ""We will continue to work with partners to bring this incident to a conclusion."" Ch Insp Donald Leitch from Police Scotland said work was ongoing to establish the cause of the fire. He said: ""Police Scotland were called to Cameron House Hotel where 200 people were evacuated from the hotel which has been partly damaged. ""One person was pronounced dead at the scene. Four were taken to hospital where one person tragically died."" A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal. Fourteen fire appliances were sent to the scene Firefighters used jets to tackle the flames and smoke Smoke rises over Loch Lomond from the fire, as seen from Balloch A guest at the hotel told BBC Radio Scotland how she initially thought the fire alarm was a drill. Ainsley Huxham said: ""As soon as we left our room - I just thought it was a fire alarm, just like a practise go. ""But when we left - five stairs down from our room - we saw a whole room full of smoke and flames. ""So we had to run back down the hall, chapped on everyone's doors and shouted 'fire!'."" Emergency services working at the scene of the fire watched by guests She added: ""We got out within five minutes of the fire brigade getting called. ""And by the time we had got outside, the whole field was full of people."" Staff who turned up for their shifts at the hotel during the morning were being stopped at the entrance. Much of the interior of the main central section of the hotel, thought to be the oldest part, was visibly blackened, with upper floor windows smashed to allow the firefighters' water jets access to the flames. The Salvation Army were in attendance to provide the emergency services with food and drink. One woman who works in the kitchen told the BBC news website she just heard about the fire as she was getting ready for work. She said she didn't believe the news until she came down and saw the smoke. ""It's a really lovely hotel,"" she said. ""I'm so sorry to see this."" Stewart King, general manager of the neighbouring Duck Bay Marina, said he had been down to the hotel and was shocked by the extent of the damage. ""It was very bad,"" he said. Guests were sheltered in Cameron House's Boathouse restaurant while the situation was ongoing. Cameron House is one of Scotland's most luxurious hotels, with views across Loch Lomond. The venue offers a romantic location for weddings, a championship standard course for golfers and five-star facilities for guests. The chef Martin Wishart has a Michelin-starred restaurant at the hotel. Cameron House is owned by US investment firm KSL Capital Partners, which was reported to have paid between Â£70m and Â£80m for the 132-room property in 2015. A statement on the hotel's website read: ""Due to an ongoing incident please be aware that Cameron House will remain closed to arriving guests for at least the next 72 hours. ""We would ask all guests and customers to remain patient as we work with the emergency services to establish the extent of the damage and ascertain when we will be able to re-open. ""More information will follow in due course."" Flags were being flown at half-mast at West Dunbartonshire Council buildings. Provost William Hendrie said: ""For something like this to happen so close to Christmas is just too painful to comprehend. ""I know the staff at Cameron House will also be devastated and our thoughts also go out to them."" Andy Roger, resort director at Cameron House, said the hotel was working closely with investigators to identify the cause of the fire. ""The safety and well-being of our guests, employees and neighbours is our first priority, and our deepest condolences are with the families of those affected. ""We are working closely with the authorities to determine the cause of the fire, and to provide support to our guests and the families of those affected."" Cameron House situated by Loch Lomond is one of Scotland's most prestigious hotels Under the ownership of the Smollett family, Cameron House was extended and refurbished a number of times. It was substantially refurbished in 1830 and underwent rebuilding work following a fire in 1865. The mansion house was sold by the Smolletts in 1986 and converted into a hotel. The five star Loch Lomond venue has 132 rooms and is surrounded by 100 acres of woodland. The hotel is a popular wedding venue and houses the Michelin starred Martin Wishart at Loch Lomond restaurant. In all, the resort has five restaurants, access to a spa and a championship golf course. American investment firm KSL Capital Partners bought Cameron House for about Â£70m two years ago.

UK plan to tackle plastic waste threat,"A four-point plan for tackling plastic waste has been outlined by the Environment Secretary Michael Gove. He told BBC News that he wants to reduce the amount of plastic used in the UK, and to make it simpler for people to recycle. Environmentalists fear Mr Gove will be reluctant to set tighter rules for firms which benefit from the current use of plastics. The Environment Secretary outlined his thoughts during an informal meeting. He says he wants to: Cut the total amount of plastic in circulation. Reduce the number of different plastics in use, because that will help recycling firms Improve the rate of recycling, which has been slipping recently. And make it easier for individuals to know what goes into the recycling bin and what goes into general rubbish. Reality Check: Are seafood lovers eating plastic? Recycling schemes often differ from one borough to the next, making it very confusing for households. Mr Gove said he was considering introducing common standards throughout local authorities to make recycling simpler. But Martin Tett, from the Local Government Association told BBC News that wouldn't work. He said: ""Common standards for recycling wouldn't be effective, as there is no one-size-fits-all solution to this problem."" ""A key component is reducing the amount of unrecyclable waste we produce in the first place, which is why it's essential that manufacturers and retailers work with us to achieve this. ""What we need is packaging that is easily recyclable - this would not only make waste disposal easier for our residents, but save considerable amounts of money and energy, whilst protecting our environment. Mr Gove agreed the UK must expand its capacity to recycle, especially in the light of China's decision to refuse to recycle British waste in future. In the short term, he said, the UK would look to other East Asian nations to recycle British waste. But he said in the longer term the nation must ""stop offshoring our dirt."" He says he's been spurred to action by David Attenborough's Blue Planet series, which highlighted the harm to marine life from plastic litter. Mr Gove says the rate of recycling needs to be improved Mr Gove has already been consulting with drinks firms on a deposit scheme to cut the amount of plastic bottles finding their way into rivers and the sea. Some environmentalists doubt that plastics manufacturers, retailers, drinks manufacturers and fast food outlets will volunteer to take the measures needed to reduce the use of plastics. Dr Dominic Hogg, from the Eunomia consultancy, said the plastics issue was huge, complex and urgent. He told BBC News the problem started with industry allowing pellets used to produce plastics to escape into the environment. Then, he said there are big problems with current recycling. ""We have a variety of collection and sorting systems,"" he said. ""Not all of which generate good quality plastics. The Chinese are about to close the border on us. We have a real problem. ""We're not recycling enough plastics. We're obsessed with convenience. Too much stuff is used to deliver a product which is soon discarded - often without any recycling. ""What we're throwing is increasingly being incinerated - and incinerators are not efficient generators of electrical energy."" Many nations are trying to tackle plastic litter. Kenya, for instance, is one of many African nations that have banned single use plastic bags. It is now aboutto clamp down on plastic bottles, too. Plastic waste is just one of the big issues in Mr Gove's in-tray. The Environment Secretary told me he also intended to unveil the government's long-delayed 25-year Environment Plan in the New Year. He acknowledged that recent Brexit negotiations had delayed his plans for an early reform of fishing and farm policy in the UK. He confessed that the Brexit deal to keep current EU policies during the transition period would make early changes extremely difficult. Mr Gove said he was working with the Department for International Development (DFID) to see how UK aid money could be used to help developing nations tackle the tide of plastic waste. This would be on the agenda for the next Commonwealth heads of governments meeting, he said. He said he also wanted to expand the UK's world-leading network of ocean protected zones round far-flung territories.

Building safety 'cuts corners' says reviewThe leader of a review into building regulations after Grenfell is 'shocked' by safety practices.1m2 minutes agoUK,"The Grenfell Tower fire claimed the lives of 71 people in June 2017 Building regulations are leaving room for shortcuts, the woman leading a review into fire safety after the Grenfell Tower blaze has said. In her interim report,external, Dame Judith Hackitt said she was ""shocked"" by some of the practices she had seen, calling for better enforcement to ""hold to account those who try to cut corners."" She said a ""cultural change"" was needed instead of ""doing things cheaply"". The government says it accepts all of the report's recommendations. The independent review follows the 14 June fire, which killed 71 people. A final report is expected in spring next year. Grenfell victims remembered at St Paul's Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Dame Judith's report said the fire in the west London block - in which many people also lost their homes - ""should not have happened in our country in the 21st century"". Her review is aimed at making sure similar events do not happen in the future, rather than investigating the specific circumstances at Grenfell. She said the whole system of fire safety regulation regarding complex and high-rise buildings was ""not fit for purpose"", and left room for those who wanted to take shortcuts to do so. She called for a whole new system of enforcement and regulation for high-rise and complex buildings. But she added this did not mean buildings were unsafe, with major building failures ""very rare"" and many people in the housing system doing the right thing. The six-month anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire was marked earlier this month with a silent candlelit march Key problems Dame Judith found included regulations that were too complex and unclear; a lack of clarity about roles in design, construction and maintenance and a lack of a clear system to help residents raise concerns. Interim recommendations included: An overhaul of the ""Approved Documents"" in building regulations An accreditation system to ensure competence for people working on the design, construction, inspection and maintenance of complex buildings are suitably qualified Better consultation with fire services when designing buildings Building developers to ensure formal handover process for any new high-rise residential building before occupation More done to make sure that fire safety information is passed to the person responsible for running the building once it has been constructed Fire risk assessments are carried out at least annually Desktop studies to approve changes to cladding should be used only where appropriate and with sufficient, relevant test evidence. The cladding on the Grenfell tower is thought to have contributed to the spread of the fire Dame Judith said a ""tremendous amount of work"" had been done by central government and the fire and rescue service since Grenfell to reassure residents. But she called for a culture change across the entire industry and those parts of government that oversee it. A national memorial service was also held at St Paul's Cathedral Although separate fromthe public inquiry into the tragedy, being headed by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the review will run in parallel and add to his inquiry where it can. In a statement to MPs, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid said the government agreed there was a need for a change in culture and a more effective system ""to encourage people to do the right thing and hold to account those who try to cut corners"". He added: ""We fully support this direction of travel that has been signalled in Dame Judith's report. ""Achieving cultural change will inevitably take time, but while Dame Judith explores these issues further, she has also identified a number of areas where we can make a start today."" He went on to discuss measures that the government has already taken. ""While Dame Judith continues her vital work, we are continuing to support wider work to make existing buildings safer,"" he said. ""In the past six months, we have overseen a comprehensive set of fire safety tests on cladding components and systems,"" he said, adding that fire services had now inspected every residential tower block thought to be at risk. But Labour said the recommendations should have been implemented after a fire at Lakanal House, south London, in 2009, which left six dead. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said ministers had to start acting on existing recommendations immediately, rather than waiting for the final Hackitt report. Lord Gary Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said the report ""reinforces our warnings about the complexity and confusion in the current system"". He said the government should take action straightaway to work with councils and the industry to take the process of reform forward.

UK suicide rates at 20-year low,"Suicide rates in the UK have seen the largest decrease in 20 years, official figures reveal. There were 3.6% fewer suicides registered in 2016 than in 2015 - a decrease by 223 deaths from 6,188, Office for National Statistics data shows. Rates fell for both men and women, although men still account for three-quarters of cases. Experts believe the drop shows suicide-prevention initiatives are helping. For deaths registered in 2016 in the UK: people aged 40 to 44 years had the highest suicide rate - 15.3 per 100,000 this age group also had the highest rate among males - 24.1 per 100,000 the age group with the highest rate for females was 50 to 54 years the English rate has fallen a significant amount, the Welsh and Northern Ireland rates have both fallen slightly, and the Scottish rate has risen a small amount Mental health problems are important influences, as well as alcohol and substance misuse. Relationship breakdown can also be a factor - suicide risk is high among divorced men. Bereavement and social loneliness can be contributors. From 1981 to 1990, men aged 75 and over had the highest age-specific suicide rate. Between 1981 and 2016, the male rate of suicide for this age group more than halved. The Samaritans says deprivation is another link. Men from the most disadvantaged backgrounds are 10 times more likely to die by suicide than those in more affluent areas. A spokeswoman said: ""There is still a lot of work to be done because suicide still kills three times more people than road traffic accidents. ""Samaritans is working hard with partners, including the NHS, other charities and local authorities, to bring these figures down further. ""Suicide is not inevitable, it's preventable and politicians, employers, health bodies and educators all have a role in identifying and supporting those most at risk."" Call the Samaritans on 116 123 (UK and Ireland), email jo@samaritans.org, or visit theSamaritans website,externalto find details of the nearest branch. Vicki Nash, Head of Policy and Campaigns at Mind, the mental health charity, said: ""It is encouraging to see that the number of suicides appears to be falling. Not all suicides are mental-health related but the majority are and we know from previous research that there has been particular progress when it comes to people in touch with mental health services. ""We need to ensure that these are the beginnings of much longer-term trends - we lose almost 6,000 lives a year to suicide and every one is a tragedy, so despite these positive findings it is clear that we still have a long way to go.""

Lebanon country profile,"With its high literacy rate and traditional mercantile culture, Lebanon has been an important commercial hub for the Middle East. It has also often been at the centre of Middle Eastern conflicts, despite its small size, because of its borders with Syria and Israel and its uniquely complex communal make-up. Shia Muslims, Sunni Muslims, Christians and Druze are the main population groups in a country that has been a refuge for the region's minorities for centuries. Read morecountry profiles,external- Profiles byBBC Monitoring,external Capital:Beirut Area:10,452 sq km Population:5.2 million Languages:Arabic, French Life expectancy:76 years (men) 80 years (women) President: vacant The post is currently vacant. After Michel Aoun left the presidency in 2022, prime minister Najib Mikati said he would not be assuming the powers of the presidency, as they would be delegated to the council of ministers as a whole, as per Lebanon's constitution, which does not allow for an interim president. Prime minister: Najib Mikati Najib Mikati, Lebanon's richest man, returned to head the government in September 2021, having served as prime minister twice before. His appointment ended months of political paralysis, as the country struggled with a collapsing economy and nearly two years of protests demanding wholesale political reform. Lebanon had been without a government since Hassan Diab resigned after a massive blast destroyed Beirut port and the surrounding area in August 2020. The media landscape is dominated by non-state outlets, including those affiliated with political groups and targeting sectarian communities. TV is the most popular medium, with domestic channels more important news sources than pan-Arab ones. Beirut is an important base for TV channels operated by, or supportive of, Iran. The state is a major player in the telecoms sector, but there is no large-scale filtering of online content. There was a 10% jump between 2022 and 2024 in the number of users accessing social media. Social media platforms used during anti-government protests in 2019 have shifted their focus to the war in Gaza and regional tensions. Readfull media profile Much of downtown Beirut has been rebuilt after being devastated during the civil war Some key dates in Lebanon's history: 1516-1918- Lebanon part of the Ottoman Empire. 1920- The League of Nations grants the mandate for Lebanon and Syria to France, which creates the State of Greater Lebanon out of the provinces of Mount Lebanon, north Lebanon, south Lebanon and the Bekaa. 1926- Lebanese Representative Council approves a constitution and the unified Lebanese Republic under the French mandate is declared. 1944- France agrees to transfer power to the Lebanese government. 1958- Faced with increasing opposition which develops into a civil war, President Camille Chamoune asks the US to send troops to preserve Lebanon's independence.

Depression at work: 'At my desk in tears',"Natalie says colleagues often don't know what to say ""I'd sit at my desk and not be able to stop the tears rolling down my face. ""A few people said, 'Are you all right, do you need to be here?' but no-one was really that interested."" For Natalie Hall, 36, the fear that she might lose her job or not be trusted in her day-to-day judgements was a barrier to talking openly to colleagues about her depression and anxiety disorder. But this may not be uncommon as a survey suggests mental health problems remain a taboo in the workplace. The poll of 2,025 UK workers by the charity Time to Change found they would rather talk to colleagues about sex or money worries than a mental health issue. When asked to select from a list the issues they felt they could talk openly about at work, 36% said they would open up about a physical health matter, 26% about money problems and 18% about sex - while just 13% selected mental health illness. However, 58% said they would encourage a colleague to open up to them, or someone else at work, if they noticed he or she was struggling with their mental health and 16% said they would raise the matter with a line manager. 'I lost my job because of my depression' 'My employer's support saved my life' For Natalie, an intelligence analyst for Northumbria Police, putting on a brave face about the state of her mental health seemed the logical thing to do. ""At work I tried to carry on because I didn't want to give up, I didn't want to be defeated and I was ashamed as well because it wasn't talked about. ""I was really worried that if I said, 'I've got depression and anxiety,' that would affect my career and my job prospects for the future. ""And, you know, would I lose my job? Would I be seen as incapable? That the judgements I make aren't rational any more, that my work wasn't trusted and that I'd be sidelined for things?"" Eventually Natalie's mental health deteriorated to such an extent that she sought medical help from a new doctor and was signed off sick. Now back in the office, thanks in part to a phased return to work and a supportive line manager, Natalie says colleagues just didn't know what to say. ""Don't get me wrong, I did have support and there were some supportive colleagues, but nobody really knows what to say and how to help. ""At that point I hadn't told anybody because I was still too ashamed to say it, I felt a massive failure and so I just retreated, I was no longer really bubbly and involved in the office, I very much kept my head down, stayed hidden behind a computer screen to just survive the day at work."" But she says small gestures can go a long way to help a colleague who's suffering with a mental health issue. ""It's simple things - 'I'll make you a cup of tea', 'Shall we go and have a little walk?' 'Shall we get out of the office and go for a coffee?' ""And it's about someone giving up a bit of their time, not saying, 'I can make it better,' but just being there and that's what makes the difference. ""Definitely, when I was on the sick, it was those little thinking-of-you cards and the bunch of flowers that arrived in the post - those were the things that I hung on to and kept going for. ""It doesn't have to be a big project or anything, it's just taking the time to say, 'Are you all right?' and not just walk away - it's taking the time out to actually sit down and speak to people. ""In the workplace, we spend so much time at work, but do we really know what's going on in each other's lives?"" 'I lost my job because of my depression' 'My employer's support saved my life' Time To Change Natalie's blog: Just another 5 minutes At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Three injured in Loch Lomond hotel fire,"This video can not be played Footage of the fire at Cameron House Two guests have died after fire broke out at the Cameron House Hotel beside Loch Lomond. More than 200 guests were evacuated from the luxury resort after the alarm was raised at about 06:40. Police said one person was pronounced dead at the scene while another died after being taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. A newly-married couple and their young son were taken to hospital for treatment and later discharged. Police Scotland said the hotel, near Balloch, had been extensively damaged. Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that two people had died A number of guests were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation. The three people taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow were members of the same family who were rescued by firefighters. Speaking to the media gathered at the hotel's entrance, David McGown of the Scottish Fire and Rescue said: ""Unfortunately, and tragically, this has resulted in two people losing their life as a result of the fire. ""The fire and rescue service's condolences go out to the people involved in this tragic incident and our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the two people who lost their lives this morning. ""The fire has caused extensive damage to the central section of the hotel. ""Our crews have been working tirelessly since 07:00. We have 14 fire appliances at its height tackling this fire and more than 70 firefighters. ""As you can imagine, as well as being an absolutely tragic incident where people have lost their lives, it is an extremely complicated incident and fire to contain and will continue to do so. ""We will continue to work with partners to bring this incident to a conclusion."" Ch Insp Donald Leitch from Police Scotland said work was ongoing to establish the cause of the fire. He said: ""Police Scotland were called to Cameron House Hotel where 200 people were evacuated from the hotel which has been partly damaged. ""One person was pronounced dead at the scene. Four were taken to hospital where one person tragically died."" A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal. Fourteen fire appliances were sent to the scene Firefighters used jets to tackle the flames and smoke Smoke rises over Loch Lomond from the fire, as seen from Balloch A guest at the hotel told BBC Radio Scotland how she initially thought the fire alarm was a drill. Ainsley Huxham said: ""As soon as we left our room - I just thought it was a fire alarm, just like a practise go. ""But when we left - five stairs down from our room - we saw a whole room full of smoke and flames. ""So we had to run back down the hall, chapped on everyone's doors and shouted 'fire!'."" Emergency services working at the scene of the fire watched by guests She added: ""We got out within five minutes of the fire brigade getting called. ""And by the time we had got outside, the whole field was full of people."" Staff who turned up for their shifts at the hotel during the morning were being stopped at the entrance. Much of the interior of the main central section of the hotel, thought to be the oldest part, was visibly blackened, with upper floor windows smashed to allow the firefighters' water jets access to the flames. The Salvation Army were in attendance to provide the emergency services with food and drink. One woman who works in the kitchen told the BBC news website she just heard about the fire as she was getting ready for work. She said she didn't believe the news until she came down and saw the smoke. ""It's a really lovely hotel,"" she said. ""I'm so sorry to see this."" Stewart King, general manager of the neighbouring Duck Bay Marina, said he had been down to the hotel and was shocked by the extent of the damage. ""It was very bad,"" he said. Guests were sheltered in Cameron House's Boathouse restaurant while the situation was ongoing. Cameron House is one of Scotland's most luxurious hotels, with views across Loch Lomond. The venue offers a romantic location for weddings, a championship standard course for golfers and five-star facilities for guests. The chef Martin Wishart has a Michelin-starred restaurant at the hotel. Cameron House is owned by US investment firm KSL Capital Partners, which was reported to have paid between Â£70m and Â£80m for the 132-room property in 2015. A statement on the hotel's website read: ""Due to an ongoing incident please be aware that Cameron House will remain closed to arriving guests for at least the next 72 hours. ""We would ask all guests and customers to remain patient as we work with the emergency services to establish the extent of the damage and ascertain when we will be able to re-open. ""More information will follow in due course."" Flags were being flown at half-mast at West Dunbartonshire Council buildings. Provost William Hendrie said: ""For something like this to happen so close to Christmas is just too painful to comprehend. ""I know the staff at Cameron House will also be devastated and our thoughts also go out to them."" Andy Roger, resort director at Cameron House, said the hotel was working closely with investigators to identify the cause of the fire. ""The safety and well-being of our guests, employees and neighbours is our first priority, and our deepest condolences are with the families of those affected. ""We are working closely with the authorities to determine the cause of the fire, and to provide support to our guests and the families of those affected."" Cameron House situated by Loch Lomond is one of Scotland's most prestigious hotels Under the ownership of the Smollett family, Cameron House was extended and refurbished a number of times. It was substantially refurbished in 1830 and underwent rebuilding work following a fire in 1865. The mansion house was sold by the Smolletts in 1986 and converted into a hotel. The five star Loch Lomond venue has 132 rooms and is surrounded by 100 acres of woodland. The hotel is a popular wedding venue and houses the Michelin starred Martin Wishart at Loch Lomond restaurant. In all, the resort has five restaurants, access to a spa and a championship golf course.

Steroid abuse 'raising risk for thousands',"Public health experts say the use of anabolic steroids is one the rise Tens of thousands of people may be at increased risk of dying early from heart attacks and strokes by misusing anabolic steroids, according to doctors. The British Cardiovascular Society gave the warning amid concern steroids are now being taken by hundreds of thousands of people. Public health experts say men in their teens and 20s are behind the rise. Steroids are legal to use but illegal to supply, unless you're a doctor. As well as heart attacks and strokes,NHS guidelines,externalshow people who misuse anabolic steroids also risk health problems like infertility and mood swings. Gareth Jenkins, 29, who lives just outside Cardiff says he's been using them for nearly five years. ""Everything that we do in life now carries the risk of heart attack, cancer whatever it is - so I'm going to get those risks anyway,"" he says. Watch Newsbeat's documentary Steroid Nation on iPlayer now Gareth says he doesn't smoke or drink - and that's why he feels it is ok to take steroids. ""It's still probably stupid from a medical point of view. But that's the way I choose to live my life."" Steroid user Gareth Jenkins underwent a series of tests to find out what damage, if any, he'd done to his heart Gareth agreed to be put through a series of health checks to see what, if any damage, he'd done to his body. The tests showed the wall of his heart had thickened and the results were ""at the very edge of normal"". Hearing what had happened to his heart concerned Gareth. ""I class myself as a sensible person. I don't want to push things to a point that's irreversible."" While he doesn't plan to stop taking steroids immediately, he says he will aim to come off them ""in the next one or two years"". One illegal supplier says many of his clients are young guys Anabolic steroids cause an imbalance of hormones which can damage many different organs, but in particular the heart. If you're found guilty of supplying them you can face a prison sentence of up to 14 years. But that hasn't stopped one man, who spoke to us on condition of anonymity, from dealing them. He told Newsbeat there's a ""very broad spectrum of people that use steroids"". ""It ranges from young guys at 18, 19 or 20 -  and they're just starting training and they're looking to bulk out for a summer holiday or just to attract the girls."" He says that's different to even just a few years ago - when most steroid users were in it for the long term, not just for a quick, cosmetic fix. ""These are the guys who are less aware.  So you do have to tell them about the risks,"" he says. And that change has been recognised at professional level too. ""We're seeing now a different population of steroid users, predominantly young men who are using purely for cosmetic purposes,"" says Jim McVeigh, one of the UK's leading experts on anabolic steroid misuse. He points to social media and advertising as being partly to blame. ""Whenever you see a man with his shirt off on TV, the chances are he'll have a quite a well defined physique,"" says Jim. ""This is something women have had to deal with for generations but this is quite a new thing for men."" If you've got any questions on this story check out theBBC Radio 1 Advice pages.

'Culture change' needed post-Grenfell,"The Grenfell Tower fire claimed the lives of 71 people in June 2017 Building regulations are leaving room for shortcuts, the woman leading a review into fire safety after the Grenfell Tower blaze has said. In her interim report,external, Dame Judith Hackitt said she was ""shocked"" by some of the practices she had seen, calling for better enforcement to ""hold to account those who try to cut corners."" She said a ""cultural change"" was needed instead of ""doing things cheaply"". The government says it accepts all of the report's recommendations. The independent review follows the 14 June fire, which killed 71 people. A final report is expected in spring next year. Grenfell victims remembered at St Paul's Visual guide to the Grenfell Tower fire Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Dame Judith's report said the fire in the west London block - in which many people also lost their homes - ""should not have happened in our country in the 21st century"". Her review is aimed at making sure similar events do not happen in the future, rather than investigating the specific circumstances at Grenfell. She said the whole system of fire safety regulation regarding complex and high-rise buildings was ""not fit for purpose"", and left room for those who wanted to take shortcuts to do so. She called for a whole new system of enforcement and regulation for high-rise and complex buildings. But she added this did not mean buildings were unsafe, with major building failures ""very rare"" and many people in the housing system doing the right thing. The six-month anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire was marked earlier this month with a silent candlelit march Key problems Dame Judith found included regulations that were too complex and unclear; a lack of clarity about roles in design, construction and maintenance and a lack of a clear system to help residents raise concerns. Interim recommendations included: An overhaul of the ""Approved Documents"" in building regulations An accreditation system to ensure competence for people working on the design, construction, inspection and maintenance of complex buildings are suitably qualified Better consultation with fire services when designing buildings Building developers to ensure formal handover process for any new high-rise residential building before occupation More done to make sure that fire safety information is passed to the person responsible for running the building once it has been constructed Fire risk assessments are carried out at least annually Desktop studies to approve changes to cladding should be used only where appropriate and with sufficient, relevant test evidence. The cladding on the Grenfell tower is thought to have contributed to the spread of the fire Dame Judith said a ""tremendous amount of work"" had been done by central government and the fire and rescue service since Grenfell to reassure residents. But she called for a culture change across the entire industry and those parts of government that oversee it. A national memorial service was also held at St Paul's Cathedral Although separate fromthe public inquiry into the tragedy, being headed by Sir Martin Moore-Bick, the review will run in parallel and add to his inquiry where it can. In a statement to MPs, Secretary of State for Communities and Local Government Sajid Javid said the government agreed there was a need for a change in culture and a more effective system ""to encourage people to do the right thing and hold to account those who try to cut corners"". He added: ""We fully support this direction of travel that has been signalled in Dame Judith's report. ""Achieving cultural change will inevitably take time, but while Dame Judith explores these issues further, she has also identified a number of areas where we can make a start today."" He went on to discuss measures that the government has already taken. ""While Dame Judith continues her vital work, we are continuing to support wider work to make existing buildings safer,"" he said. ""In the past six months, we have overseen a comprehensive set of fire safety tests on cladding components and systems,"" he said, adding that fire services had now inspected every residential tower block thought to be at risk. But Labour said the recommendations should have been implemented after a fire at Lakanal House, south London, in 2009, which left six dead. Shadow housing secretary John Healey said ministers had to start acting on existing recommendations immediately, rather than waiting for the final Hackitt report. Lord Gary Porter, chairman of the Local Government Association, said the report ""reinforces our warnings about the complexity and confusion in the current system"". He said the government should take action straightaway to work with councils and the industry to take the process of reform forward. Dame Judith is due appear in front of the Commons' local government committee to discuss the report.

First female Bishop of London appointed,"This video can not be played Right Reverend Sarah Mullally: ""For some the appointment of a bishop who is a woman may be difficult"" The Right Reverend Sarah Mullally has been named as the first female Bishop of London, becoming the most senior woman bishop appointed by the Church of England. She takes over the role from Dr Richard Chartres, who retired in February. Legislation to allow women bishops was formally adopted by the Church in 2014. The Churchconsecrated its first female bishop in 2015when the Rt Revd Libby Lane was made Bishop of Stockport. The latest appointment means the former NHS chief nurse, who iscurrently the Bishop of Crediton in Devon, will hold the third most senior position in the Church of England. Sarah Mullally is a former NHS chief nurse She became a priest in 2006, and has spent over 35 years in the NHS, including being chief nursing officer for England from 1999 to 2004. Bishop Sarah, 55, - who was made a dame in 2005 for services to nursing - will be the third woman to run a diocese, and will take a seat in the House of Lords. She said: ""Having lived and worked in London for over 32 years, the thought of returning here is about returning home. ""I am often asked what it has been like to have had two careers, first in the NHS and now in the Church. ""I prefer to think that I have always had one vocation: to follow Jesus Christ, to know him and to make him known, always seeking to live with compassion in the service of others, whether as a nurse, a priest, or a bishop. ""To be given the opportunity to do that now in this vibrant world-city is a wonderful privilege.""

You're hired! Who did Lord Sugar choose?,"Who could choose between Sarah Lynn and James White? The latest series of The Apprentice has reached a surprise climax. Lord Sugar has chosen both finalists to be his business partners, for the first time in the BBC show's history. The business mogul said he ""genuinely couldn't decide"" between sweet firm owner Sarah Lynn, 35, and James White, 26, who runs an IT recruitment company. As a result, both candidates receive a Â£250,000 business investment and 50/50 partnership with Lord Sugar, who called them ""fantastically skilled people"". ""This particular year, I'm going to double my investment,"" Lord Sugar told them. ""I'm going to start a business with both of you."" Usually, Lord Sugar gives Â£250,000 to just one winner. According to the BBC, this surprise double ""hiring"" does not constitute a format change. But some fans were unhappy with the conclusion and reacted strongly on Twitter. Allow Twitter content?

How long can The Apprentice keep going? Apprentice winner 'let Lord Sugar down' The final episode saw Lynn and White pitch their business plans to Lord Sugar and his panel of experts.

""Deciding on a winner was the most difficult decision I have had to make in all 13 series of The Apprentice to date,"" said Lord Sugar in a statement. Lord Sugar (centre) reached his decision after consulting Karren Brady and Claude Littner ""James and Sarah were extremely impressive and their proposed business plans were very different but equally strong. ""I genuinely couldn't decide between them, so after deliberating long and hard, I decided to stump up Â£500,000 and invest in them both."" Lynn said she felt ""shocked and amazed"" to be declared the joint victor alongside White, who said it was ""very, very humbling"" to be Lord Sugar's business partner.

Cameron House fire: Three taken to hospital,"This video can not be played Footage of the fire at Cameron House Two guests have died after fire broke out at the Cameron House Hotel beside Loch Lomond. More than 200 guests were evacuated from the luxury resort after the alarm was raised at about 06:40. Police said one person was pronounced dead at the scene while another died after being taken to the Royal Alexandra Hospital in Paisley. A newly-married couple and their young son were taken to hospital for treatment and later discharged. Police Scotland said the hotel, near Balloch, had been extensively damaged. Police and the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service confirmed that two people had died A number of guests were treated at the scene for smoke inhalation. The three people taken to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital in Glasgow were members of the same family who were rescued by firefighters. Speaking to the media gathered at the hotel's entrance, David McGown of the Scottish Fire and Rescue said: ""Unfortunately, and tragically, this has resulted in two people losing their life as a result of the fire. ""The fire and rescue service's condolences go out to the people involved in this tragic incident and our thoughts are very much with the family and friends of the two people who lost their lives this morning. ""The fire has caused extensive damage to the central section of the hotel. ""Our crews have been working tirelessly since 07:00. We have 14 fire appliances at its height tackling this fire and more than 70 firefighters. ""As you can imagine, as well as being an absolutely tragic incident where people have lost their lives, it is an extremely complicated incident and fire to contain and will continue to do so. ""We will continue to work with partners to bring this incident to a conclusion."" Ch Insp Donald Leitch from Police Scotland said work was ongoing to establish the cause of the fire. He said: ""Police Scotland were called to Cameron House Hotel where 200 people were evacuated from the hotel which has been partly damaged. ""One person was pronounced dead at the scene. Four were taken to hospital where one person tragically died."" A report will be submitted to the procurator fiscal. Fourteen fire appliances were sent to the scene Firefighters used jets to tackle the flames and smoke Smoke rises over Loch Lomond from the fire, as seen from Balloch A guest at the hotel told BBC Radio Scotland how she initially thought the fire alarm was a drill. Ainsley Huxham said: ""As soon as we left our room - I just thought it was a fire alarm, just like a practise go. ""But when we left - five stairs down from our room - we saw a whole room full of smoke and flames. ""So we had to run back down the hall, chapped on everyone's doors and shouted 'fire!'."" Emergency services working at the scene of the fire watched by guests She added: ""We got out within five minutes of the fire brigade getting called. ""And by the time we had got outside, the whole field was full of people."" Staff who turned up for their shifts at the hotel during the morning were being stopped at the entrance. Much of the interior of the main central section of the hotel, thought to be the oldest part, was visibly blackened, with upper floor windows smashed to allow the firefighters' water jets access to the flames. The Salvation Army were in attendance to provide the emergency services with food and drink. One woman who works in the kitchen told the BBC news website she just heard about the fire as she was getting ready for work. She said she didn't believe the news until she came down and saw the smoke. ""It's a really lovely hotel,"" she said. ""I'm so sorry to see this."" Stewart King, general manager of the neighbouring Duck Bay Marina, said he had been down to the hotel and was shocked by the extent of the damage. ""It was very bad,"" he said. Guests were sheltered in Cameron House's Boathouse restaurant while the situation was ongoing. Cameron House is one of Scotland's most luxurious hotels, with views across Loch Lomond. The venue offers a romantic location for weddings, a championship standard course for golfers and five-star facilities for guests. The chef Martin Wishart has a Michelin-starred restaurant at the hotel. Cameron House is owned by US investment firm KSL Capital Partners, which was reported to have paid between Â£70m and Â£80m for the 132-room property in 2015. A statement on the hotel's website read: ""Due to an ongoing incident please be aware that Cameron House will remain closed to arriving guests for at least the next 72 hours. ""We would ask all guests and customers to remain patient as we work with the emergency services to establish the extent of the damage and ascertain when we will be able to re-open. ""More information will follow in due course."" Flags were being flown at half-mast at West Dunbartonshire Council buildings. Provost William Hendrie said: ""For something like this to happen so close to Christmas is just too painful to comprehend. ""I know the staff at Cameron House will also be devastated and our thoughts also go out to them."" Andy Roger, resort director at Cameron House, said the hotel was working closely with investigators to identify the cause of the fire. ""The safety and well-being of our guests, employees and neighbours is our first priority, and our deepest condolences are with the families of those affected. ""We are working closely with the authorities to determine the cause of the fire, and to provide support to our guests and the families of those affected."" Cameron House situated by Loch Lomond is one of Scotland's most prestigious hotels Under the ownership of the Smollett family, Cameron House was extended and refurbished a number of times. It was substantially refurbished in 1830 and underwent rebuilding work following a fire in 1865. The mansion house was sold by the Smolletts in 1986 and converted into a hotel. The five star Loch Lomond venue has 132 rooms and is surrounded by 100 acres of woodland. The hotel is a popular wedding venue and houses the Michelin starred Martin Wishart at Loch Lomond restaurant. In all, the resort has five restaurants, access to a spa and a championship golf course.

Guests evacuated as fire engulfs Deeside hotel,"Dozens of people were evacuated from the hotel and surrounding properties An investigation has begun after a fire engulfed a Deeside hotel, prompting the evacuation of almost 50 people. The blaze destroyed the first floor, roof and most of the ground floor of the Gateway to Wales Hotel on Welsh Road near Queensferry in Flintshire. The alarm was raised at about 04:30 GMT and 60 firefighters worked to put the fire out by 12:00. Nobody was injured in the blaze. Roads and a nearby school were closed because of billowing smoke. North Wales fire service said all 47 guests and a member of staff had been accounted for. This video can not be played Stuart Millington, of the fire service, said guests were safe thanks to the smoke alarm Stuart Millington, senior operations manager at the fire service, said they all got to safety after the hotel's smoke alarms went off. ""Our fire investigators are speaking to local residents and to people in the building,"" he said. ""The building is quite badly damaged and therefore their ability to get in and take their investigation safely will take some time."" Twenty firefighters remained at the scene on Monday afternoon, damping down the building. The fire is causing significant smoke in the area Hotel guest Barbara from Heywood in Greater Manchester, who had been visiting her son to exchange Christmas presents, praised the night manager for carrying her disabled brother-in-law out of the burning hotel. ""By the time we got outside the whole roof was alight, "" she said. ""We're very, very lucky and thankfully it wasn't full. It had a lot of people in but it wasn't full. So everyone got out."" The Gateway to Wales Hotel - pictured before the fire - has about 40 bedrooms Stacey Roberts, 26, who was staying in the hotel with her six-month-old son and partner, said: ""The alarm stopped and then started again. ""No member of staff was seen, no sprinklers went off - if it wasn't for a gentleman shouting through the corridors 'fire, fire'... I dread to think. We're all traumatised."" Danny Lawton, who lives in a block of flats next to the hotel with his girlfriend and their baby, said he was woken at 05:00 by police banging on the door. ""When we went outside you couldn't tell it was a winter night as the heat coming off the fire was immense,"" he said. ""When we came outside the whole roof and top floor was on fire on the side facing our building."" The roof of the hotel has been destroyed Station Road and the exit slip road on the A494 eastbound carriageway at the A548 has reopened but traffic is reported to be slow in the area, while nearby Sealand Primary School was closed for the day. Councillor Christine Jones, who lives on Welsh Road, said the fire must have been ""dreadful"" and ""so frightening"" for guests. A Welsh Ambulance Service spokeswoman said it sent four ambulances, two rapid response vehicles, two duty officers and a hazardous area response team.

Trump denies he plans to fire Mueller,"The president issued the denial to reporters after returning to the White House on Sunday evening President Donald Trump has denied he is planning to fire special counsel Robert Mueller, who is investigating possible Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Tensions have been rising between the White House and Mr Mueller's probe. On Saturday a lawyer for Mr Trump's presidential transition group said thousands of emails had been unlawfully obtained by Mr Mueller's team. Responding to questions over the legal row, Mr Trump said it was ""not looking good"" and his people were ""very upset"". Why attacks on Robert Mueller are mounting ""I can't imagine there's anything on them, frankly, because, as we said, there's no collusion,"" he said, while returning from a weekend trip to Camp David. His administration has denied working with Russia in the 2016 election and Mr Trump has labelled the investigation ""a witch hunt"". The Former head of the FBI Robert Mueller has been heading up on the collusion probe Responding to a media question on the White House lawn on whether he was considering firing Mr Mueller amid his criticism, Mr Trump responded ""No, I'm not."" Several Democratic lawmakers had expressed concern, and on Friday the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, Adam Schiff, said he feared Republican members wanted to shut the probe down. Several former members of Mr Trump's campaign team are facing charges as part of the investigation. A lawyer working for the Trump for America (TFA) group, who helped Donald Trump's transition to the White House after his election, complained on Saturday after the group became aware Mr Mueller's investigation had obtained tens of thousands of their emails. Kory Langhofer sent a letter to US congressional committees claiming the records had been obtained ""unlawfully"". The TFA group had used the facilities, including email hosting, of a government agency, the General Services Administration (GSA), in the period between Donald Trump's election in November 2016 and inauguration in January. In his letter, Mr Langhofer, says GSA staff ""unlawfully produced TFA's private materials, including privileged communications"" to Mr Mueller's investigation team. The emails obtained reportedly involve 13 Trump transition officials, including former national security adviser Michael Flynn who pleaded guilty to making false statements to the FBI earlier this month. The GSA, he complains, ""did not own or control the records in question"" and maintains the constitutional rights of transition officials were violated. Read the letter in full,external A spokesperson for Mr Mueller said they had done nothing wrong. ""When we have obtained emails in the course of our ongoing criminal investigation, we have secured either the account owner's consent or appropriate criminal process,"" Peter Carr said. GSA Deputy Counsel Lenny Loewentritt has denied another of Mr Langhofer's accusations, that the GSA gave assurances that requests for Trump transition records would go through the group's lawyers. He told BuzzFeed that the transition group knew materials would have to be provided to law enforcement ""therefore, no expectation of privacy can be assumed"".,external Democratic Representative Eric Swalwell tweeted that the accusations were ""another attempt to discredit Mueller as his #TrumpRussia probe tightens"". US intelligence agencies believe Moscow tried to tip the presidential election in favour of Mr Trump - a charge denied by both Russia and the US president. Mr Trump has labelled Mr Mueller's investigation a ""witch hunt""while other Republicans accuse it of bias. Earlier this month, Mr Flynn became the most senior Trump official to be charged as part of the inquiry after admitting making false statements to the FBI about meetings with Russia's ambassador. He has confirmed he is now co-operating with the investigation. This video can not be played President Trump renews attack on 'disgraceful' FBI Another ex-aide, George Papadopoulos, has also pleaded guilty to making false statements to FBI agents. In October, Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and his business associate Rick Gates were accused of conspiring to defraud the US in dealings with Ukraine. Both deny the charges, which centre on relations with a former Ukrainian president who was very close to Russia. President Trump's private lawyers are expected to meet Mr Mueller and members of his team next week to discuss the next phases of the inquiry, US media report.

Thousands stranded by airport power cut,"This video can not be played Passengers reacted with delight when the lights came back on Passengers at the world's busiest airport faced a second day of disruption on Monday after a power cut led to hundreds of cancellations. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport lost power on Sunday, affecting tens of thousands of people. Passengers were left in darkened terminals or on board planes. Power was restored overnight and a handful of passenger flights resumed just after 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Monday. Hundreds of other flights, however, were cancelled. The airport is the world's busiest, handling more than 250,000 passengers and almost 2,500 flights every day. But during its first hour of operation on Monday morning, fewer than a dozen commercial flights departed. A number of cargo flights had operated during the partial shutdown. Many hundreds of flights have been cancelled Thousands remain stranded in the airport awaiting rescheduled flights. In a statement, the airport said it had distributed more than 5,000 meals to waiting passengers. Security processing began at about 03:30 local time, it said, but those with tickets dated Sunday would need to reprint them to pass through checkpoints. The airport advised passengers to check the status of their particular flight directly with their airline. In a statement, the airport confirmed it had suffered a power cut shortly after 13:00 on Sunday. Many flights scheduled to arrive from other airports were diverted elsewhere, or held at their departure airport. Georgia Power, which supplies the airport's electricity, said it believed a fire at an underground electrical facility had caused the power cut. Officials said a piece of its switchgear could have failed and started the fire, causing cable damage. Power was fully restored to the airport around midnight on Sunday. Allow Instagram content?

Atlanta's mayor confirmed the fire's cause was under investigation, and apologised to the thousands affected. A number of major airlines, including United, Southwest and American Airlines, completely suspended their operations on Sunday. Each had at least some flights scheduled to depart Monday. Images shared on social media showed passengers waiting in darkness. Some reported being stuck on board aircraft for six hours. One passenger, Jannifer Lee, was travelling to Minnesota from Florida with her 10-year-old pet rescue cat Penny. Her first flight was stuck for almost four hours at the gate. Ms Lee and her cat spent four hours stuck at the gate on her connecting flight from Florida ""I was hoping to have a really smooth flight, especially with a cat,"" she told the BBC. ""I've only ever flown with her for two or three hours before, not a 12-hour journey! I guess animals can be a lot more resilient than people."" She and thousands of others were left stranded without information from airlines about onward travel. ""There was a lot of confusion on the flight, because the national news knew more about the situation than we did,"" Ms Lee said. Another passenger, Naomi Harm, was stranded on the tarmac on a Delta flight from Sacramento, California. She told the BBC that airline staff had kept the passengers in good spirits by communicating regularly and handing out any food and drinks they had available. She said one passenger seated close to her had been escorted down to the aircraft's cargo area to give insulin to his diabetic pet dog in the hold by an air marshal. After almost four hours she was guided out in darkness after portable steps were found for them to disembark. ""Inside the terminal there were thousands all over, children crying,""  she said. ""The air conditioning wasn't working and it was very hot inside."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Murder team to probe billionaire deaths,"Honey and Barry Sherman were renowned for their charity fundraising Police in Toronto have confirmed that their homicide unit has taken over the investigation into the death of a Canadian billionaire and his wife. Police are treating the deaths of Barry Sherman, 75, and his wife Honey, whose bodies were found in their Toronto home on Friday, as ""suspicious"". An autopsy revealed both died from ligature neck compression, or strangulation with material. Reports the case was being investigated as a murder-suicide angered the family. A brief police statement on Sunday evening only confirmed the autopsy results,external, and stated that Toronto Police Service Homicide had taken the lead in the suspicious death investigation. Canadian media had earlier cited police sources for the murder-suicide theory, but a family statement said no-one close to the couple believed this. ""Our parents shared an enthusiasm for life and commitment to their family and community totally inconsistent with the rumours regrettably circulated in the media as to the circumstances surrounding their deaths,"" it read. ""We are shocked and think it's irresponsible that police sources have reportedly advised the media of a theory which neither their family, their friends nor their colleagues believe to be true."" The Shermans were found dead at their home in Toronto The couple's bodies were discovered by their estate agent, who had been trying to sell the property. There was no sign of forced entry. A Toronto police source told Canadian media that the bodies were found near the house's basement pool. Earlier police had said they were not looking for any suspects in the case. Several Canadian newspapers say they were told investigators were working on the assumption that Mr Sherman had killed his wife before killing himself. Tributes have meanwhile been pouring in for the pair, with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeting ""condolences to their family & friends, and to everyone touched by their vision & spirit"". A service for the couple is planned for Thursday morning. One of Canada's richest men, Mr Sherman was the founder and chairman of pharmaceutical giant Apotex, which sells generic medicines around the world. On Sunday the firm's website paid tribute to Mr Sherman. Mr Sherman founded the company in 1974 A gifted student, Mr Sherman entered the trade through his uncle's Empire Laboratories, working for him while still at university before buying the company when his uncle died. He went on to sell Empire, creating Apotex, the company that made him a billionaire and which now employs more than 10,000 people. But he became embroiled in a family dispute, with his uncle's children seeking a stake in Apotex, arguing they had been cheated. A judge threw out their claim earlier this year. He also faced an investigation as to whether he had improperly held a fundraiser for Justin Trudeau before he became prime minister. Mrs Sherman was a board member for several hospitals, charities and Jewish organisations. The couple had four children and have given millions to charity.

'Brexit cabinet' to discuss EU end deal,"Theresa May has condemned abuse of MPs following last week's Brexit vote. The prime minister said despite ""strongly held views"" on both sides of the Commons there was no place for threats of violence and intimidation. Several Conservative MPs have received abusive messages and tweets because of their views on Brexit. Speaker John Bercow said MPs were public servants doing what they thought to be right and were ""never mutineers, traitors nor enemies of the people"". Two of the MPs who rebelled against the government last week, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, said they had contacted the police about threats they received. Parliament Live: Rolling updates What next for Brexit talks? MP blames death threats on newspaper Brexit: All you need to know Ms Soubry suggested dossiers of material she had handed to the Speaker showed a direct link between newspaper headlines attacking her views and actions on Brexit and threats of violence against herself. ""This is serious stuff,"" she said. ""We have to call it out...I believe in freedom of the press but everyone has a responsibility not to incite abuse and death threats."" This video can not be played MPs are 'never mutineers nor traitors' As she ended her statement on last week's EU summit, Mrs May said it was right to debate Brexit with ""passion and conviction"". ""But there can never be a place for the threats of violence and intimidation against some members that we have seen in recent days,"" she said. ""Our politics must be better than that."" In a Commons statement shortly afterwards, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said the ""bullying and demeaning"" actions of a small minority of people was a reminder there was a ""dark, unpleasant underbelly of society"". While she said she personally did not check her Twitter timeline any more, she said young people who ""lived on"" social media must be able to continue to do so safely. Responding for Labour, shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said there was a case for ""punitive fines"" for social media firms which do not promptly act on abusive material, including rape and death threats. The Daily Mail, which was criticised for publishing the photos of the 11 Tory MPs who voted against the government last week under the headline ""Proud of Yourselves?"", said its journalists also received violent abuse on social media and it was committed to ""tackling this menace"". ""No one has been more outspoken than the Daily Mail in condemning the viciousness of social media, and in particular the threats and abuse directed at politicians of all parties,"" a spokesman said. ""What must never happen is that it is used as an excuse to prevent proper and trenchant debate on the great political issues of the day, including Brexit."" In her statement, Mrs May also said the agreement secured at the summit to move talks on to the UK and EU's future relationship was ""an important step in delivering the smooth and orderly Brexit people voted for"". The prime minister also insisted the UK could secure a ""bespoke"" trade deal with the EU after Brexit despite the EU's chief negotiator suggesting this cannot happen. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn said the agreement on what had been negotiated so far had been ""cobbled together"" with a ""vagueness"" that ""underlines the sharp divisions within the cabinet"". The UK voted to leave the European Union in June 2016 and Brexit is due to happen at 23:00 GMT on 29 March, 2019. Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Amber Rudd have been on opposite sides of the EU debate Mrs May's statement to MPs came after she and her senior ministers formally discussed for the first time what the UK's long-term relationship with the EU should be. Until now the two negotiating teams have only been discussing ""divorce"" issues like how much money the UK owes. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said there was a ""clear divide"" between ministers, with some like Chancellor Philip Hammond and Home Secretary Amber Rudd calling for the UK to stick closely to the EU's single market to preserve access for British firms. On the other side others, like Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson and Michael Gove, want more divergence so the UK has more freedom to strike its own trade deals with other countries. After the UK leaves the EU in March 2019, but before the final ""end state"" is reached, the government wants a temporary ""implementation period"" of about two years. This is what negotiations are expected to focus on in the coming weeks. Mrs May told MPs she wants ""access to one another's markets"" to continue ""as now"" during this period. The UK will also negotiate, and ""where possible"" sign, trade deals, which would kick in after the end of the implementation period, she said. She also said that during this period the UK will register people arriving from the EU to prepare for the new border controls promised after Brexit. The EU's negotiating position makes clear that it expects the UK to observe all of its rules - including on freedom of movement - and accept the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during the implementation, or transition, period. Group calls for a 'shared market' with EU May: I won't be derailed on Brexit On Monday there was a warning from the EU side that whether a transitional arrangement will happen at all is not guaranteed. Mr Barnier's senior adviser Stefaan De Rynck said the EU hoped for a ""withdrawal treaty"" to be drawn up by October 2018, giving time for it to be agreed by politicians. He added: ""In that withdrawal treaty there could be a transitional arrangement, transition period, implementation period, which the prime minister refers to. ""That is not a given today, let's be very clear about that."" Describing Brexit as a ""lose-lose"" scenario, he added: ""For us, I don't think we will ever label Brexit a success. It's a mutual weakening, I think, of two parties."" But former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith, a key Leave campaigner, said the UK should be looking beyond the EU for trading relationships in the future. ""It's not a case of less trade, it's a case of a different type of trade, and British business will have to learn, as they do, to get by in a different world,"" he said.

Guidelines for Brexit negotiations,"The European Council has said that Brexit talks can enter the second phase following last week's agreement. As a result it haspublished its guidelines,externalfor the next stage of talks. Here are some of the key phrases from that document. Don't forget that there are plenty of crucial details that still need to be resolved before negotiations on a withdrawal agreement come to an end. That means the financial settlement, citizens' rights and of course, the Irish border. Sufficient progress is not the end of the story, but the text also makes it clear that there will be a concerted effort to lock in what has been agreed so far - and that if the EU detects any reluctance or backsliding from the UK then that will have a negative effect on discussions about the future. Theresa May has already agreed that a transition of about two years will take place under existing EU rules and regulations, but the EU's text makes crystal clear what it believes that means. The UK will have to accept all EU law (that's what the acquis means) including new laws passed during the transition itself. But it will no longer have a seat at the table when those laws are made. To put it brutally - the UK will, for a while, become a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker. Both sides talk of a strictly time-limited transition period, so there doesn't appear to be much appetite at the moment for extending it. Quite what happens if a future trade deal isn't ready by the end of the transition, a scenario many experts think is quite possible, will have to be debated in the future. During the transition, the UK will have to accept the full jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and all four freedoms - including the freedom of movement of people. The EU says the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union during a transition, while the UK insists that it will leave both on Brexit day. This could become a semantic argument, because by accepting all rules and regulations - in other words, the status quo - the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union whether it likes it or not. The British government has suggested that some things - like dispute resolution mechanisms - could change during the transition as agreement is made on future co-operation. But there's little appetite in the EU for that - in its view, you're either in or you're out. The EU 27 stress that they want a close partnership with the UK in the future, but here they are setting out the limits of what they could mean. The further away the UK wants to be from the rules and regulations of the single market the less access it will have - there is no such thing as partial membership. This gets us back to the unresolved debate about what ""full alignment"" at the Irish border really means in practice. The phrase ""preserve a level playing field"" is important too. The EU is anxious to ensure that the UK doesn't try to undercut the EU in any way by having looser regulations in certain key areas, and, if it does, then there will be consequences. EU negotiators won't have the authority to start discussions with the UK on future relations (including trade and also things like security and foreign policy) until another set of guidelines is adopted in March 2018. That gives the two sides not much more than six months to agree the text of a broad political declaration on the outlines of the future relationship. The EU hopes to get that finalised by October 2018, but it emphasises that formal trade negotiations can only begin after the UK has left the EU. Informal contacts on what the future might look like are probably taking place already, but the EU is still waiting for greater clarity from London about what exactly the UK government hopes to achieve in the long term. The UK is trying to be as ambitious as possible about what can be done before Brexit actually happens. The EU, though, emphasises that trade talks will have to continue long after the UK has left.

Steroid abuse 'raising risk for thousands'Doctors warn that misuse of anabolic steroids may lead to greater risk of heart attacks and strokes.,"Public health experts say the use of anabolic steroids is one the rise Tens of thousands of people may be at increased risk of dying early from heart attacks and strokes by misusing anabolic steroids, according to doctors. The British Cardiovascular Society gave the warning amid concern steroids are now being taken by hundreds of thousands of people. Public health experts say men in their teens and 20s are behind the rise. Steroids are legal to use but illegal to supply, unless you're a doctor. As well as heart attacks and strokes,NHS guidelines,externalshow people who misuse anabolic steroids also risk health problems like infertility and mood swings. Gareth Jenkins, 29, who lives just outside Cardiff says he's been using them for nearly five years. ""Everything that we do in life now carries the risk of heart attack, cancer whatever it is - so I'm going to get those risks anyway,"" he says. Watch Newsbeat's documentary Steroid Nation on iPlayer now Gareth says he doesn't smoke or drink - and that's why he feels it is ok to take steroids. ""It's still probably stupid from a medical point of view. But that's the way I choose to live my life."" Steroid user Gareth Jenkins underwent a series of tests to find out what damage, if any, he'd done to his heart Gareth agreed to be put through a series of health checks to see what, if any damage, he'd done to his body. The tests showed the wall of his heart had thickened and the results were ""at the very edge of normal"". Hearing what had happened to his heart concerned Gareth. ""I class myself as a sensible person. I don't want to push things to a point that's irreversible."" While he doesn't plan to stop taking steroids immediately, he says he will aim to come off them ""in the next one or two years"". One illegal supplier says many of his clients are young guys Anabolic steroids cause an imbalance of hormones which can damage many different organs, but in particular the heart. If you're found guilty of supplying them you can face a prison sentence of up to 14 years. But that hasn't stopped one man, who spoke to us on condition of anonymity, from dealing them. He told Newsbeat there's a ""very broad spectrum of people that use steroids"". ""It ranges from young guys at 18, 19 or 20 -  and they're just starting training and they're looking to bulk out for a summer holiday or just to attract the girls."" He says that's different to even just a few years ago - when most steroid users were in it for the long term, not just for a quick, cosmetic fix. ""These are the guys who are less aware.  So you do have to tell them about the risks,"" he says. And that change has been recognised at professional level too. ""We're seeing now a different population of steroid users, predominantly young men who are using purely for cosmetic purposes,"" says Jim McVeigh, one of the UK's leading experts on anabolic steroid misuse. He points to social media and advertising as being partly to blame. ""Whenever you see a man with his shirt off on TV, the chances are he'll have a quite a well defined physique,"" says Jim. ""This is something women have had to deal with for generations but this is quite a new thing for men."" If you've got any questions on this story check out theBBC Radio 1 Advice pages.

Call to tackle 'poor mobile services',"The head of the National Infrastructure Commission has called for urgent action to tackle poor mobile phone coverage. Lord Adonis has written to the telecoms regulator Ofcom urging it to take action to deal with the issue. It follows a report that one million homes have poor broadband and large parts of the UK have no 4G coverage. On FridayOfcom said calls and text messages could not be sent on all four mobile phone networks in 30% of the entire UK landmass,external. It is not the first time Lord Adonis has criticised the state of the UK's mobile and broadband services. In October he launched a public consultation,externalon the quality of the state of UK infrastructure generally, but singled out mobile services as an area needing urgent attention. Now, in his letter, Lord Adonis says that Ofcom and the government need to ""put all options on the table"" to tackle coverage black spots. These should include possible legal and regulatory changes, he said. The chairman of the National Infrastructure Commission said that it was a concern that four out of five rural homes did not have any 4G service indoors. ""In an age when access to a mobile signal is regarded as a must-have, it is deplorable that even in areas previously considered to have strong coverage, operators are still delivering such poor services that customers can struggle to make a quick phone call,"" he said. ""It demonstrates the need for urgent and radical action to tackle this issue immediately, ahead of new mobile spectrum being auctioned and 5G technology being rolled out,"" he said. The former Labour transport secretary said significantly higher signal strengths were required to improve customer service and mobile phone companies should share masts where appropriate. The government minister overseeing the sector agreed that industry must do more. Matt Hancock, minister for digital, said there was a ""clear need"" for rapid improvements to mobile coverage. ""We've recently removed outdated restrictions, giving mobile operators more freedom to improve their networks including hard-to-reach rural areas,"" he said. ""But industry needs to play its part too through continued investment and improvement in their networks, making sure that customers are not paying for services they don't receive."" Ofcom said it agreed that mobile coverage should urgently improve and it was setting new rules for operators' licences.

CIA helped stop Russia terror attackVladimir Putin phoned Donald Trump to thank him for the information provided.,"The alleged plot targeted St Petersburg's Kazan Cathedral Information provided by the CIA helped Russian security services foil an attack on St Petersburg's Kazan cathedral, US and Russian leaders say. President Vladimir Putin phoned Donald Trump to thank him for the information, the White House and Kremlin confirmed. The attack was allegedly planned to take place on Saturday, Russia says. A White House statement said ""terrorists"" were captured prior to an attack ""that could have killed large numbers of people"". Russia's FSB security service said in a statement on Friday that it had detained seven members of a cell of Islamic State supporters and seized a significant amount of explosives, weapons and extremist literature. The cell was planning to carry out a suicide attack at a religious institution and kill citizens on Saturday,the FSB statement said (in Russian),external. The group was preparing explosions targeting the cathedral and other public places in Russia's second city, the Kremlin statement said on Sunday. Mr Putin told Mr Trump that Russia's special services would hand over information on terror threats to their US counterparts, it added. Mr Putin had asked the US president to pass on his thanks to the CIA director and the operatives involved, both countries said. US intelligence agencies, including the CIA, believe that Russia tried to sway last year's US presidential election in favour of Mr Trump - claims rejected by the Republican. A special counsel is investigating whether anyone from the Trump campaign colluded. The two leaders most recently met at a summit in Vietnam last month While Mr Trump categorically denies colluding with Russia,he has talked about the importance of working together ""constructively"". Sunday's conversation between the two presidents marks the second time the two men have spoken in a week. On Thursday they discussed North Korea,externaland Mr Trump thanked Mr Putin ""for acknowledging America's strong economic performance"" in his annual press conference, according to the White House. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Trump Russia scandal 'harms US' - Putin The White House said that the two leaders agreed in Sunday's phone call that the co-operation was ""an example of the positive things that can occur when our countries work together"". An explosion on St Petersburg's metro system in April killed at least 13 peopleand is thought to be linked to jihadists. Returning militants from Syria pose a real threat to Russia, the head of the FSB was quoted as saying on Tuesday. Security services had already prevented 18 terrorist attacks in 2017, Alexander Bortnikov said in comments reported by Itar-Tass news agency.

On Sunday the firm's website paid tribute to Mr Sherman. Mr Sherman founded the company in 1974 A gifted student, Mr Sherman entered the trade through his uncle's Empire Laboratories, working for him while still at university before buying the company when his uncle died. He went on to sell Empire, creating Apotex, the company that made him a billionaire and which now employs more than 10,000 people. But he became embroiled in a family dispute, with his uncle's children seeking a stake in Apotex, arguing they had been cheated. A judge threw out their claim earlier this year. He also faced an investigation as to whether he had improperly held a fundraiser for Justin Trudeau before he became prime minister. Mrs Sherman was a board member for several hospitals, charities and Jewish organisations. The couple had four children and have given millions to charity.

Lebanon murder probe as Briton found dead,"Police in Lebanon have arrested an Uber driver in connection with the murder of a British woman in Beirut. The body of Rebecca Dykes, who worked at the British Embassy in the city, was found by a motorway on Saturday. The arrested man was 35 and has served several prison sentences, a senior Lebanese security source told the BBC. Ms Dykes had been sexually assaulted and strangled, and the man is expected to be charged with rape and murder later this week, police sources said. Her family said in a statement: ""We are devastated by the loss of our beloved Rebecca. We are doing all we can to understand what happened."" Ms Dykes, who is believed to have been 30, had been working in Beirut as the programme and policy manager for the Department for International Development since January 2017. Lebanon country profile It is thought she spent Friday evening at a going-away party for a colleague in the popular Gemmayzeh district of Beirut. After leaving the bar at about midnight it appears she was abducted. Her body was found close to a motorway on the outskirts of the city. The body of Rebecca Dykes was found near a main road outisde Beirut The Foreign Office said it was in contact with the Lebanese authorities and confirmed an arrest had been made. The suspect was arrested in the early hours of Monday morning after police reportedly traced his car on traffic management CCTV. An official told the Reuters and AFP news agencies the preliminary investigation had showed Ms Dykes's killing ""was not politically motivated"". By Martin Patience, BBC Middle East correspondent, Beirut The Gemmayzeh district of Beirut where Rebecca Dykes was last seen alive is well-known for having some of the city's best and most expensive bars and restaurants. There is normally a relaxed atmosphere. It is a neighbourhood where foreign aid workers, diplomats and journalists mingle with wealthy Lebanese often into the early hours of the morning. Despite the chaos seen elsewhere in the region, Beirut in recent years has been regarded as relatively safe.  That is why this murder has left the international community so shocked. After a late night out, many people would previously have thought nothing of catching one of the cabs that ply the streets, or calling for an Uber. For a short while, anyway, that is likely to change. People will be more careful about how they get home.  Beirut may be relatively safe but - as in any big city across the world - this murder is a reminder of the dangers. Josie Ensor, the Daily Telegraph's correspondent in Beirut, says the case has left foreign residents in the city unsettled. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, she said Beirut was a ""very tight-knit community, so when something happens to one person, it feels quite close"". Ms Ensor, who was due to attend the same party on Friday evening, added Ms Dykes ""had just landed on her feet in Beirut and was starting to make friends and getting to know the city"". Hugo Shorter, the British Ambassador to Lebanon, said the whole embassy was ""deeply shocked"" and ""saddened"" by the news. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tributes were paid to Ms Dykes in the House of Lords on Monday. Former Conservative MP Lady McIntosh said: ""The loss of Rebecca Dykes in these circumstances is felt very deeply. ""And can we pay tribute to the work that she and the all Dfid team do, often in very dangerous circumstances, particularly at this time of year, for humanitarian purposes?"" The International Development Minister Lord Bates added: ""It's obviously a very distressing time, particularly for Becky's family, but also for the people who worked with her. ""It reminds us of the sacrifice which is made by over 1,200 Dfid personnel who work around the world, often in the most difficult and dangerous of environments."" A Dfid spokesman said: ""Our thoughts are with Becky's family and friends at this very upsetting time. ""There is now a police investigation and the Foreign Office is providing consular support to Becky's family and working with the local authoritiesâ."" Rebecca Dykes had been working in Beirut since January 2017 Prior to her posting in Beirut, Ms Dykes worked with the Foreign Office as a policy manager for its Libya team and as an Iraq research analyst. According to her LinkedIn profile, she studied anthropology at the University of Manchester, and had a master's in International Security and Global Governance from Birkbeck, University of London. She was a former pupil of Malvern Girls' College and Rugby School, and had also taught English at a Chinese international school. Ms Dykes had reportedly been due to fly back to the UK for Christmas. She says on social media that she is from London.

Where next for Brexit talks?,"If nothing is agreed until everything is agreed, then it is safe to say there is a long way to go. Phase one of the Brexit negotiations may be coming to an end, but phase two promises to be even more difficult. ""I very much welcome the prospect of moving ahead to the next phase,"" Theresa May said on Friday, ""to talk about trade and security and to discuss the positive and ambitious future relationship that is in all our interests."" Trade talks, I hear you cry? Not quite yet. For starters, negotiations on the divorce issues that we have learnt so much about have yet to be finalised. There are plenty of technical details that still need to be clarified, in parallel with any discussions about the future. Reality Check: Theresa May's deal with Brussels Listen: Brexitcast - there's a deal! Full text of the EU-UK statement,external In any case, the immediate priority will be to try to reach agreement on a transition period - for about two years after Brexit - in order to offer business a little more certainty, and everyone else a little more time. But there appear to be conflicting ideas about how any transition would work in practice. The Prime Minister has already accepted that existing EU rules and regulations would continue to apply. But she has also insisted that the UK will leave the single market and the customs union before a transition begins, on the day Brexit actually happens. The European Council's draft negotiating guidelines, due to be approved next week, see things rather differently. ""As you know,"" European Council President Donald Tusk said on Friday, ""the UK has asked for a transition of about two years, while remaining part of the single market and customs union."" Mr Tusk also emphasised that applying existing rules and regulations during a transition would not only mean the UK respecting the whole of EU law; the UK would also, he said, have to accept new laws without having any say in implementing them. In a further sign of trouble ahead, the European Council expects that the UK would continue to respect the jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice during a transition, without having a British judge sitting on the court. None of this will, to put it mildly, go down well with Brexiteers at Westminster. And while this week has shown that compromise can be found, even in the most difficult of circumstances, there are some issues which cannot be solved by kicking the can down the road. Another big challenge during a transition period will be the fate of hundreds of agreements with third countries that apply to the UK at the moment precisely because it is a member of the European Union. These include free trade deals as well as numerous agreements on all types of regulatory co-operation. When the UK leaves the EU it will no longer be a legal part of any of these agreements - there is no way to roll them over automatically, and time to modify any of them to include the UK is already running extremely short. That's more than enough to be sorted out before we even start thinking about the outlines of a future relationship with the EU - on trade, security, foreign policy and other issues. The UK government wants to move on to start talking about trade Additional EU guidelines on the future relationship won't be published until next year anyway, and that means formal discussion of these issues may not begin for several months. Even then, the EU will not see them as proper trade talks. Internal EU documents talk of ""preliminary and preparatory discussions with the UK on a framework for the future relationship"" with the aim of agreeing a political declaration between the two sides by October 2018. A broad political discussion of that kind is a world away from a legal process leading to agreement on a new treaty. In the EU's legalistic world view, formal talks can only begin after Brexit, when the UK itself becomes a third country. ""Political agreements, with highfalutin aspirational guff, are one thing,"" said the former UK Permanent Representative to the EU, Ivan Rogers, in a recent lecture. ""Legally binding agreements, treaty changes and trade deal texts are another."" The UK government will hope to make progress more quickly, but it has yet to decide itself what kind of Brexit, and what kind of future relationship, it really wants. The cabinet is split between those who want to stay as close as possible to the EU's single market and all the regulations that implies, and those who argue that moving away from EU rules, and giving the UK the ability to strike out on its own, was one of the main aims of Brexit. Until that internal discussion produces a little more clarity, the EU will continue to proceed with caution. This has been a good week for the Brexit negotiations, real progress has been made. But when it comes to complexity, you ain't seen nothing yet.

World's busiest airport suffers power cut,"This video can not be played Passengers reacted with delight when the lights came back on Passengers at the world's busiest airport faced a second day of disruption on Monday after a power cut led to hundreds of cancellations. Atlanta's Hartsfield-Jackson airport lost power on Sunday, affecting tens of thousands of people. Passengers were left in darkened terminals or on board planes. Power was restored overnight and a handful of passenger flights resumed just after 06:00 local time (11:00 GMT) on Monday. Hundreds of other flights, however, were cancelled. The airport is the world's busiest, handling more than 250,000 passengers and almost 2,500 flights every day. But during its first hour of operation on Monday morning, fewer than a dozen commercial flights departed. A number of cargo flights had operated during the partial shutdown. Many hundreds of flights have been cancelled Thousands remain stranded in the airport awaiting rescheduled flights. In a statement, the airport said it had distributed more than 5,000 meals to waiting passengers. Security processing began at about 03:30 local time, it said, but those with tickets dated Sunday would need to reprint them to pass through checkpoints. The airport advised passengers to check the status of their particular flight directly with their airline. In a statement, the airport confirmed it had suffered a power cut shortly after 13:00 on Sunday. Many flights scheduled to arrive from other airports were diverted elsewhere, or held at their departure airport. Georgia Power, which supplies the airport's electricity, said it believed a fire at an underground electrical facility had caused the power cut. Officials said a piece of its switchgear could have failed and started the fire, causing cable damage. Power was fully restored to the airport around midnight on Sunday. Allow Instagram content?

Atlanta's mayor confirmed the fire's cause was under investigation, and apologised to the thousands affected. A number of major airlines, including United, Southwest and American Airlines, completely suspended their operations on Sunday. Each had at least some flights scheduled to depart Monday. Images shared on social media showed passengers waiting in darkness. Some reported being stuck on board aircraft for six hours. One passenger, Jannifer Lee, was travelling to Minnesota from Florida with her 10-year-old pet rescue cat Penny. Her first flight was stuck for almost four hours at the gate. Ms Lee and her cat spent four hours stuck at the gate on her connecting flight from Florida ""I was hoping to have a really smooth flight, especially with a cat,"" she told the BBC. ""I've only ever flown with her for two or three hours before, not a 12-hour journey! I guess animals can be a lot more resilient than people."" She and thousands of others were left stranded without information from airlines about onward travel. ""There was a lot of confusion on the flight, because the national news knew more about the situation than we did,"" Ms Lee said. Another passenger, Naomi Harm, was stranded on the tarmac on a Delta flight from Sacramento, California. She told the BBC that airline staff had kept the passengers in good spirits by communicating regularly and handing out any food and drinks they had available. She said one passenger seated close to her had been escorted down to the aircraft's cargo area to give insulin to his diabetic pet dog in the hold by an air marshal. After almost four hours she was guided out in darkness after portable steps were found for them to disembark. ""Inside the terminal there were thousands all over, children crying,""  she said. ""The air conditioning wasn't working and it was very hot inside."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Conservative elected Chilean president,"SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era will serve as president for the second time A conservative billionaire and former president, SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era, has won Chile's presidential election run-off. Left-winger Alejandro Guillier conceded and congratulated his opponent on his win and his return to the presidency after a four-year gap. With nearly all votes counted, Mr PiÃ±era polled more than 54%. It is a clear move to the right for the country, which is currently led by socialist President Michelle Bachelet. She had backed Mr Guillier. About 14 million were eligible to vote in the ballot, including, for the first time, Chileans living abroad. However, voter turnout was low, at 48.5%.  It had been thought that a high turnout would favour Mr Guillier. Chile's billionaire economist returns Chile country profile Mr PiÃ±era called for unity after his victory: ""Chile needs agreements more than confrontations,"" he said. ""The paths of the future unite us. Sometimes the stories of the past separate us."" Reaching out to his opponent, Mr PiÃ±era added: ""I want to talk to him about the points we agree about."" Mr Guillier recognised his ""harsh defeat"" in the election while congratulating his opponent Billionaire businessman Mr PiÃ±era won the first round of votes by a large margin, when the number of candidates reduced from eight to two for a final run-off. He has already governed the country from 2010 to 2014, when he ended two decades of uninterrupted centre-left rule.  But the former president and his Chile Vamos coalition had only a slim lead in the most recent opinion polls before Sunday's election vote. He had the support of the business community, promising to lower taxes to get the economy growing again. During his campaign, he promised to rein in the reforms brought in by President Bachelet, while his opponent Mr Guillier, on the other hand, campaigned on the back of her legacy. While President Bachelet's progressive agenda has won plaudits abroad, her popularity plummeted during her second term, due in part to a 2015 corruption scandal involving her daughter-in-law. This year, however, the president overcame conservative opposition to successfully ease Chile's strict anti-abortion laws. Conservative critics say Ms Bachelet pushed her reforms too far. She was unable to seek re-election under the country's constitution. As votes closed, projections indicated a victory for Mr PiÃ±era, causing celebration among his supporters Mr Guillier represents six parties in a left-wing coalition. He beat former president Ricardo Lagos for the Socialist Party nomination in April 2017, promising to continue Ms Bachulet's reforms. A decade ago, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela were all governed by left-wing leaders. But in recent years, conservatives have come to power in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, and Venezuela's ""Bolivarian Revolution"" has come under severe pressure with anti-government protesters taking to the streets for months. The win by Mr PiÃ±era further consolidates that trend.

CIA helped stop Russia terror attack,"The alleged plot targeted St Petersburg's Kazan Cathedral Information provided by the CIA helped Russian security services foil an attack on St Petersburg's Kazan cathedral, US and Russian leaders say. President Vladimir Putin phoned Donald Trump to thank him for the information, the White House and Kremlin confirmed. The attack was allegedly planned to take place on Saturday, Russia says. A White House statement said ""terrorists"" were captured prior to an attack ""that could have killed large numbers of people"". Russia's FSB security service said in a statement on Friday that it had detained seven members of a cell of Islamic State supporters and seized a significant amount of explosives, weapons and extremist literature. The cell was planning to carry out a suicide attack at a religious institution and kill citizens on Saturday,the FSB statement said (in Russian),external. The group was preparing explosions targeting the cathedral and other public places in Russia's second city, the Kremlin statement said on Sunday. Mr Putin told Mr Trump that Russia's special services would hand over information on terror threats to their US counterparts, it added. Mr Putin had asked the US president to pass on his thanks to the CIA director and the operatives involved, both countries said. US intelligence agencies, including the CIA, believe that Russia tried to sway last year's US presidential election in favour of Mr Trump - claims rejected by the Republican. A special counsel is investigating whether anyone from the Trump campaign colluded. The two leaders most recently met at a summit in Vietnam last month While Mr Trump categorically denies colluding with Russia,he has talked about the importance of working together ""constructively"". Sunday's conversation between the two presidents marks the second time the two men have spoken in a week. On Thursday they discussed North Korea,externaland Mr Trump thanked Mr Putin ""for acknowledging America's strong economic performance"" in his annual press conference, according to the White House. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Trump Russia scandal 'harms US' - Putin The White House said that the two leaders agreed in Sunday's phone call that the co-operation was ""an example of the positive things that can occur when our countries work together"". An explosion on St Petersburg's metro system in April killed at least 13 peopleand is thought to be linked to jihadists. Returning militants from Syria pose a real threat to Russia, the head of the FSB was quoted as saying on Tuesday.

Unions in other countries had already halted action, but Impact said Irish pilots wanted more clarification. In a statement on Sunday, the union said: ""Impact has this evening suspended a planned one-day strike of Ryanair pilots next Wednesday after company management agreed to recognise the union as the representative of Irish-based pilots.

She had backed Mr Guillier. About 14 million were eligible to vote in the ballot, including, for the first time, Chileans living abroad. However, voter turnout was low, at 48.5%.  It had been thought that a high turnout would favour Mr Guillier. Chile's billionaire economist returns Chile country profile Mr PiÃ±era called for unity after his victory: ""Chile needs agreements more than confrontations,"" he said. ""The paths of the future unite us. Sometimes the stories of the past separate us."" Reaching out to his opponent, Mr PiÃ±era added: ""I want to talk to him about the points we agree about."" Mr Guillier recognised his ""harsh defeat"" in the election while congratulating his opponent Billionaire businessman Mr PiÃ±era won the first round of votes by a large margin, when the number of candidates reduced from eight to two for a final run-off. He has already governed the country from 2010 to 2014, when he ended two decades of uninterrupted centre-left rule.  But the former president and his Chile Vamos coalition had only a slim lead in the most recent opinion polls before Sunday's election vote. He had the support of the business community, promising to lower taxes to get the economy growing again. During his campaign, he promised to rein in the reforms brought in by President Bachelet, while his opponent Mr Guillier, on the other hand, campaigned on the back of her legacy. While President Bachelet's progressive agenda has won plaudits abroad, her popularity plummeted during her second term, due in part to a 2015 corruption scandal involving her daughter-in-law. This year, however, the president overcame conservative opposition to successfully ease Chile's strict anti-abortion laws. Conservative critics say Ms Bachelet pushed her reforms too far. She was unable to seek re-election under the country's constitution. As votes closed, projections indicated a victory for Mr PiÃ±era, causing celebration among his supporters Mr Guillier represents six parties in a left-wing coalition. He beat former president Ricardo Lagos for the Socialist Party nomination in April 2017, promising to continue Ms Bachulet's reforms. A decade ago, Argentina, Bolivia, Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Ecuador, Honduras, Nicaragua, Uruguay and Venezuela were all governed by left-wing leaders. But in recent years, conservatives have come to power in Argentina, Brazil and Paraguay, and Venezuela's ""Bolivarian Revolution"" has come under severe pressure with anti-government protesters taking to the streets for months. The win by Mr PiÃ±era further consolidates that trend.

The 'completely childish' man hanged for murder,"He was one of the last two men hanged in Britain. A habitual liar convicted of murdering a man who had been his friend, and perhaps his lover. But according to a leading criminal lawyer, who has viewed documents uncovered by the BBC, he was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. Medical reports released to the National Archives this summer show that Gwynne Owen Evans, who was hanged in 1964 at the age of 24, had serious psychological problems. But his defence team made no attempt to enter a plea of diminished responsibility - a plea that, if accepted would have saved his life. Just after three o'clock in the morning, on Tuesday 7 April 1964, Mr and Mrs Fawcett, an elderly couple living in the village of Seaton, Cumbria, were awakened by a series of thuds, a shrill scream, and then more bumps coming from the adjoining house. Mr Fawcett got up, and as he was getting dressed he saw the lights in the house being switched on, upstairs and down. Then he heard a car driving away towards the village centre. He looked out, but it was going too fast for him to make out the number plate or any other details. He called a neighbour, Walter Lister, who walked over to the house and knocked on the door. When no-one answered, he called the police. By 03:25 a group of officers, led by Sgt Park, had entered the house They found the occupant, John West, lying dead at the foot of the stairs, on his back and naked from the waist down. A single 53-year-old man who worked as a driver for a local laundry, West was in a pool of blood, his head covered with cuts. More blood was spattered on the walls, down the side of the stairs, and on the banister. On the floor near the body was a home-made cosh - a piece of rubber tube with a short piece of steel tube at one end, and putty at the other. Searching upstairs, police found a lightweight raincoat folded on a chair in West's bedroom. In the pocket was a lifesaving medallion inscribed ""G O Evans"", and a piece of paper with the name Norma O'Brien written on it, next to an address in Liverpool. That tied Gwynne Evans to the murder. When police interviewed the 17-year-old O'Brien in Liverpool the next day, she remembered meeting Evans and seeing his medal while visiting her brother-in-law, a soldier at Fulwood Barracks in Preston, four months earlier. Evans had then been in the Army too, but had been discharged shortly afterwards. Police learned that Evans was one of the dead man's friends. The year before he'd been seen chauffeuring him around the neighbourhood, which suggested they were close: West was very particular about his car and hardly anyone else was allowed to drive it. They also quickly discovered that Evans was a local boy - his parents lived in Workington, just down the road from Seaton - and that until recently his name had been John Walby. He'd changed it in a third attempt to join the Army, having been kicked out twice under his original name. From Evans's parents police had obtained his current address, a small terraced house in Preston, 100 miles (160km) away. He was living there with Peter Allen, 21, Allen's wife and two young children. At the house, though, police found and arrested only Allen. Evans was out with Allen's wife, Mary, in Manchester. When the police tracked them down, Evans had in his pocket a wristwatch that had belonged to West, and Mary had a bloodstained shirt in her basket. It belonged to her husband. Listen to Sanchia Berg's report for theToday programmeon BBC Radio 4, on Monday 18 December Orcatch up later on the BBC iPlayer According to police records, Gwynne Evans quickly volunteered information about the murder - putting all the blame on Allen. He and Allen had stolen a car to drive up to Seaton to borrow money, he said, as West was an old friend who'd offered to help him in the past. Both Allen and Evans were hard up, with fines and bills to pay. Allen's wife and children came along for the drive too, and waited, asleep, outside in the car. Evans went in first, by his account, and he told police he just had a chat with West, whom he called Jack. ""I had some tea and a cheese bun and as we were talking there was a knock at the door. I honestly didn't know who it was, anyway Jack went to the door and I heard some banging. I went into the hall and I saw Peter hitting Jack with something that looked like a pipe... There was a lot of blood and I shouted to Peter, 'For Christ's sake stop it!'"" Evans insisted he hadn't hit Jack  himself. ""Peter did the thumping,"" he said. Evans told police  the two men had stolen bank books from West's home, and managed to withdraw Â£10 cash from his accounts. He said he knew the police had found his coat, with the medallion and keys in the pocket. ""If I wanted, I could have said that my coat had been stolen and my keys were in it and no judge in the country would convict me. But I am glad I have got it off my chest,"" he said. An odd thing to say, but as further questioning would show, characteristic of Evans. That evening, in Preston, Peter Allen was interviewed. Initially, he claimed ignorance of the murder. ""You can get a stack of Bibles in here and I'll stand on them and swear I know nothing about it,"" he told Det Supt Roberts, who was leading the investigation. But just a few minutes later,  according to the police notes, Allen struck the desk with his fist, buried his head in his arm and said, ""All right. I'll tell you. I'd like to tell the whole flipping world about it."" He said it started out as an innocent robbery. Sandy, as he called Evans, was to go in first, and let Allen in. But as Evans opened the front door West came out of his bedroom, and saw him. So Allen hit the older man with his fists. Then, Allen claimed, Evans gave him ""the bar"" and he set upon West with that too. Later, he revised his statement to say that Evans had also beaten West. That evening, at a quarter to midnight, the detective superintendent interviewed Gwynne Evans. First, he asked if that was his real name. The reply was surprising. ""No, I adopted it after I found out I was born in Innsbruck in 1940 and that both my parents were German,"" Evans said. This was not true. The post-mortem showed West hadn't only been hit around the head, with a cosh - he'd also been stabbed through the heart. Initially, neither man said anything about that, but according to the police report Evans - unprompted - said: ""I don't know anything about a knife. I don't have to use a knife to kill a man. I'm an expert at judo and karate. I never hit Jack- it was Peter that did all the hitting."" He wasn't a karate expert either. Police found Allen's account more credible. It tallied with the crime scene. Allen said Evans had opened the door for him, and West had unexpectedly come out of his bedroom upstairs. Evans, by contrast, claimed both he and West had been downstairs. Police thought it unlikely West would have answered the door without any trousers on, his false teeth were found on the landing at the top of the stairs, and there was blood on the wall by the staircase. Just after midnight, police interviewed Allen's wife, Mary. She said Evans had gone in first, and had come out about two hours later to get Allen. Then the two men had run out. When she asked them what had happened they said West had punched Peter - who'd punched back. Evans, she said, had told her he'd joined in. The two men appeared in the magistrates' court a few hours later, on Thursday 9 April. Mary Allen then revised her evidence, telling police Evans had stopped the car on the drive back to Preston and she'd seen him throw something away. That afternoon, she showed officers the spot, on the road between Workington and Windermere. A police dog easily found a bloodstained knife. And after reading a local newspaper report of the court hearing, Mary Allen remembered something else. She told police that when they'd all returned to Preston, early on Tuesday morning, Evans had said ""he never expected it to go in below the alarm clock"". She now realised, she said, that he was referring to the stab wound to the heart. After his appearance in court, Gwynne Evans was remanded in custody at Durham prison, where he was seen by the senior medical officer, P J Waddington. There was no evidence of medical disorder, he wrote. Evans was ""correctly orientated"". In other words, ""He knew where he was and he was fully aware of the reasons for his arrest and his committal to prison."" Waddington described Evans as being ""of spare physique"", just over 5ft 9in tall, with no physical ailments except flat feet and some small cuts on his face, possibly from picking pimples. In another report the following month, he noted that from a very young age Evans had experienced psychological problems. As a boy he'd been referred to a child guidance clinic (elsewhere identified as Dovenby mental hospital) because he was ""untrustworthy, lacked moral sense, was untruthful, and inclined to steal"". Evans confused truth with fantasy. ""Evans believes that he was born in Innsbruck and his reasons for doing so are quite absurdâ¦"" the doctor wrote. He said he was married to a German girl, and had two children - which also seemed entirely invented. Evans claimed too that he'd been employed by Securicor for a year, and there become an expert in judo. In fact he'd only worked there for a week; he left as soon as his references had been checked, presumably because they were unsatisfactory. He lied constantly. The doctor said these were for the most part ""prestige lies"" to enhance his standing. On four occasions he joined the services, only to be medically discharged. Evans had enlisted at 17 in the Border Regiment, where his fabrications led to him being sent for a psychiatric assessment. ""This soldier was sent to me by his training wing officer,"" wrote one doctor, ""on account of his frequent telling of big lies which he apparently believed himself."" His first expulsion followed four months later. In less than a year, he signed up for another regiment, the Royal Inniskilling Fusiliers - but here too, his lies brought about his downfall. Within three months he was before a medical board which recommended discharge on the grounds of ""personality inadequacy"". His commanding officer remarked: ""He is a failure. He cannot make friends because of feeling superior and telling complete fairy tales all the time."" The following year he joined the Royal Air Force, but was quickly discharged on the grounds of ""nervous instability"". In 1963, he signed up for the Army again, under the name of Evans, but was soon found out, and discharged for the final time. Waddington, the medical officer at Durham Prison, acknowledged Evans's ""abnormal personality"" and thought most doctors would consider him an individual with a ""psychopathic personality, using this term in the broadest sense"". But he didn't believe this amounted to an ""abnormality of mind"" that wouldsubstantiallyimpair his ""mental responsibility for his acts and omissions"" - the legal definition of diminished responsibility under the 1957 Homicide Act. Evans's own lawyers commissioned Dr G F Duggan Keen, an experienced consultant psychiatrist, to examine him. He noted that Evans had been employed in 32 jobs, by his own account, from the age of 15, excluding the spells in the Army and RAF. Many had just lasted a few weeks, due he thought, to Evans's problems forming relationships, and excessive drinking. After four meetings with Evans, he said there was ""absolutely no doubt in my mind that this man is a psychopathic personality"". But he could not identify a condition or disease. He said Evans was not ""subnormal"", nor schizophrenic, nor epileptic. He too concluded that Evans's mental responsibility was not ""substantially impaired"". Neither Waddington nor Duggan Keen explained why they came to that conclusion, and this surprises Dr Tim McInerney, a consultant forensic psychiatrist at the Bethlem Royal hospital in South London, who often gives expert assessments in murder cases. ""If, as an expert now, giving advice to the courts or to a jury as to why I don't support diminished [responsibility] I would have to explain very clearly why I reached that position,"" he says. The psychiatric reports are cursory by modern standards, running to just a few pages. Though McInerny says that was the style at the time, John Cooper QC, an experienced defence barrister and professor of law, says their brevity strikes him as a cause for concern. ""For those reports to be relied upon without them being tested, without further questions being asked of them, without further experts being used, as far as I'm concerned, is quite startling. And I would say quite startling not just to the modern eye but also at the time."" But these psychiatric judgements would play an important role in the events that led to Gwynne Evans's conviction - and his hanging. Evans and Allen went on trial at Manchester Crown Court on 29 June 1964.  The prosecution expected Evans to plead diminished responsibility. They had lined up their own psychiatrist, Dr Begg, who had met Evans twice. Like the other doctors, he said Evans was a ""grossly psychopathic personality"", and that responsibility for his actions was impaired - but, again, not substantially. However, the following day, without explanation, Evans's lawyers decided to drop the diminished responsibility plea. The note on the Director of Public Prosecutions file reads simply: ""Def advise Dim Res not being raised. Dr Begg informed."" Each man blamed the other for the murder. The evidence against Allen was much stronger - he admitted beating West and his clothes had been soaked in blood. There was no blood on Evans. There was, admittedly, evidence incriminating Evans from Allen's wife - but she would have had good reason to try to shift the blame. Evans said he'd been friendly with West, who ""was like a father to me"", and that he would never have hurt him. The murdered man, John West However, both agreed they'd been ready to rob West. And unsurprisingly, Evans lied in court - and was shown to be lying. Allen's barrister undermined Evans further by suggesting he'd had sex with West just before the murder, something Evans vehemently denied, but which was supported by medical evidence. At the time homosexuality was illegal, and it's likely this would have lowered the jury's opinion of Evans even further. The trial ran until 6 July. The prosecution argued that the men were acting ""in concert"" and it did not matter who delivered the fatal blow. Without much deliberation the jury found both guilty of capital murder - that is, murder and robbery. This doesn't surprise John Cooper QC. ""Without diminished responsibility, on my reading of these papers, the verdict of guilty was all but inevitable,"" he says. A successful plea of diminished responsibility, on the other hand, would have saved Evans's life. Evans's mother, Hannah Walby, wrote to him in clumsy round handwriting on blue notepaper: ""Please don't give up hope yet.""  The verdict had been a great shock to her, she continued, and to his brothers and sister. ""All is being done possible, you may get a reprieve."" At his appeal, heard at the High Court in July, Evans's lawyers also made no attempt to argue that he was not fully responsible for his actions. Instead his barrister, Guthrie Jones QC, sought to challenge Mary Allen's evidence, on the basis that she was Allen's wife. However, the judge had flagged this up to the jury at the trial, warning them that she was not an impartial witness - so the appeal was dismissed. The only avenue left was a reprieve. On 24 July Evans's solicitor, John Marsham of Midland Bank Chambers in Whitehaven, Cumbria, wrote to the Home Secretary, Henry Brooke. He pointed out that three doctors agreed Evans suffered mental impairment. He referred to a statement - not presented in court - from the father of a girl Evans had been seeing, a Mr Hampton. He'd put an end to their relationship because he had been so concerned about Evans's immaturity. He was ""completely childish in everything he did"" wrote the lawyer, ""he would make toys that a child would make and play with them for hours before pulling them to pieces."" Marsham added that Evans had been shown in court to be a liar, which made his conviction ""inevitable"". ""Even in the witness box he could not refrain from telling stupid and unnecessary lies"" - a story about being chased by a police car, for example. The letter was dismissed by the Home Office. Officials did nonetheless commission a final medical assessment. Three psychiatrists, Dr Pickering, Dr Mather and Prof Anderson, visited him in prison, on 27 and 28 July. ""He was a pallid slightly built young man, clearly tense, tremulous, with knitted brows throughout the interview,"" they wrote. He admitted being a habitual liar, and even lying to the doctors themselves. Prison staff also reported that he lied often, to boost his self-confidence. The governor thought him a ""happy-go-lucky extrovert liking to stand high in people's favour"". No staff thought him insane, as ""no sign of fits or transient losses or changes of consciousness were observed"". The news that there would be no reprieve reached Evans's family. On 3 August, Mrs Walby sent a letter to the Home Secretary. ""I write to you on behalf of my son who is under sentence of Death at Manchester Prison,"" she wrote. She said Evans had never been in serious trouble before he met ""this Preston couple"". He had been brought up in the church, a member of the choir and the Boy Scouts, she explained. She pointed out he had been friends with West for five years, often staying overnight at his house. ""My son is mentally impaired and I had him under a mental doctor at the age of 8 years but he is not a wicked boy,"" she pleaded. ""Please may God guide you to make a mercyful judgement. I remain, yours respectfully Mrs H Walby."" It had no effect. Three days later, on 6 August the Home Secretary wrote in red ink on the file: ""I regret I can find no mitigating circumstances such as would justify a reprieve in either case. The law must take its course."" The two men were hanged, in different prisons, at the same time: 08:00 on 13 August. I came across Evans's medical reports by chance, while checking newly released files at the National Archives earlier this year. I then showed them to John Cooper QC and Dr Tim McInerney. Cooper has no hesitation in saying that Evans was the victim of a miscarriage of justice. ""Evans was a vulnerable individual,"" he says. ""And that vulnerable individual was sent into court, into trial without the proper defence put forward for the jury to consider."" The proper defence, in his view, would have been a plea of diminished responsibility. And this plea, he argues, would have had a far greater chance of success if there had been a more thorough psychiatric examination. The 1957 Homicide Act led to a sharp drop in the number of hangings for two reasons. One was that murder became punishable by death only when combined with other offences. This did not help Evans and Allen, because they were charged with robbery as well as murder. The other reason was the new defence of diminished responsibility. It allowed many to escape the noose, and might have saved Evans. Tim McInerney has seen one case from 1963, a double murder, where the killer - with a similar psychiatric profile to Evans - escaped trial entirely, being sent instead to a special hospital. Doctors operate on the principle of ""do least harm"", he says. So he wonders what went through the minds of the doctors who examined Evans - knowing that if they didn't support diminished responsibility, he'd be hanged. John Cooper also points out that in the last years of the death penalty, ""it was in essence a postcode lottery - depending on which prison you were in, as to whether you survived"". This ""adds to the macabre nature of the last few months of the death penalty"", in his view. In 1964, Allen and Evans were the only people hanged in the UK. There were only two hangings the year before, as well. And less than a year after the two young men were executed, capital punishment was suspended in Great Britain. Parliament voted to make the suspension permanent in 1969. Pictures courtesy of the National Archives. Peter Allen and Gwynne Evans images copyright Mirrorpix.
