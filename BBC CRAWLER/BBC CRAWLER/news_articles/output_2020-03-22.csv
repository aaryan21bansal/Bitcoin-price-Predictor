"Major medical goods shortage in 10 days, NYC warns","The city's mayor, Bill de Blasio, warned that ""people will die who could have lived otherwise"" The coronavirus outbreak in New York will get worse, with damage accelerated by shortages of key medical supplies, the city's mayor has said. ""We're about 10 days away from seeing widespread shortages,"" Bill de Blasio said on Sunday. ""If we don't get more ventilators people will die."" New York state has become the epicentre of the outbreak in the US and accounts for almost half of the country's cases. There are now 31,057 confirmed cases nationwide, with 390 deaths. On Sunday, the state's Governor Andrew Cuomo said 15,168 people had tested positive for the virus, an increase of more than 4,000 from the previous day. ""All Americans deserve the blunt truth,"" Mr de Blasio told NBC News. ""It's only getting worse, and in fact April and May are going to be a lot worse."" New York now accounts for roughly 5% of Covid-19 cases worldwide. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash On Friday, President Donald Trump approved a major disaster declaration for the state which gave it access to billions of dollars of federal aid. However, Mr de Blasio has continued to criticise the administration for what he views as an inadequate response. ""I cannot be blunt enough: if the president doesn't act, people will die who could have lived otherwise,"" he said. ""This is going to be the greatest crisis, domestically, since the Great Depression,"" he added, referring to the economic crisis of the 1930s. Speaking at a news conference at the White House on Sunday, Mr Trump said he had also approved a major disaster declaration for Washington state and would approve a similar measure for California. ""This is a challenging time for all Americans. We're enduring a great national trial,"" he said. President Trump also said a number of medical supplies were being sent to locations nationwide, as well as emergency medical stations for New York, Washington and California, the worst-hit states. This video can not be played 60 days of coronavirus in the US - in 60 seconds Doctors across New York have reported depleted medical supplies and a lack of protective gear for healthcare workers on the frontlines of the outbreak. Warnings of such shortages have reverberated across the country as other state governors have pleaded with the federal government to make more supplies available. In California, officials instructed hospitals to restrict coronavirus testing. Meanwhile, a hospital in Washington state - once the centre of the US outbreak - said it could run out of ventilators by April. And on Sunday, Illinois Governor JB Pritzker said states were ""competing against each other"" for virus supplies. ""We need millions of masks and hundreds of thousands of gowns and gloves,"" he said. ""We're getting just a fraction of that. So, we're out on the open market competing for these items that we so badly need."" An almost $1.4 trillion (Â£1.2 trillion) emergency stimulus bill intended to blunt the punishing economic impact of the pandemic failed to pass the US Senate on Sunday. The bill got 47 votes, falling short of the 60 needed in the 100-member chamber. Democrats raised objections to the bill with Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer saying it had ""many, many problems"". Democrats accused Republicans of wanting to bail out big businesses.

At least 23 killed in Colombia prison riot,"Prisons across the country had been holding protests against poor health services and overcrowding At least 23 people have died in one of BogotÃ¡'s largest jails after what the authorities are calling a mass breakout attempt amid rising tensions over coronavirus. Colombia's Justice Minister Margarita Cabello said 83 inmates were injured during a riot at La Modelo prison. Inmates at prisons across the country held protests on Sunday against overcrowding and poor health services during the coronavirus outbreak. The justice ministry is investigating. Ms Cabello said 32 prisoners and seven guards were in hospital. Two guards are in a critical condition. She said the violence was a coordinated plan with disturbances reported across 13 of the country's prisons. More than 23 people were killed and 83 inmates were injured at La Modelo prison Denying claims of unsanitary conditions amid fears of a coronavirus breakout, she said: ""There is not any sanitary problem that would have caused this plan and these riots. ""There is not one infection nor any prisoner or custodial or administrative staffer who has coronavirus."" She said prisoners had run amok and some would be charged with attempted murder, and damage to property. A large number of relatives gathered outside the gates of La Modelo prison to await news of their loved ones. They said they had heard of shots being fired after the security forces arrived.

STRESS:How to protect your mental health LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak Primark stores across the US, France, Spain and Italy have already shut their doors to try to contain the spread of the virus. In response to falling demand, the firm has now stopped placing any orders for clothes to be made in the future. It also has a large amount of stock in stores, warehouses and in transit that has already been paid for. Mr Marchant said that Primark had been left with ""no option but to take this action"". He added: ""This is profoundly upsetting for me personally and for all of the team... We recognise and are deeply saddened that this will have an effect throughout our entire supply chain."" Primark does not have an online sales operation, so it orders and sells vast quantities of clothing through its network of brick-and-mortar shops. Mr Marchant called for other countries to support businesses ""in the same way that the UK and many European governments are doing."" The UK government said this week it will pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic, in a move aimed at protecting people's jobs. It will pay 80% of salary for staff who are kept on by their employer, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. Many retail and hospitality firms have warned the pandemic could see them collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is put on hold. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said that shops continue to follow government advice. ""Stores are reviewing Public Health England advice daily to decide what is best to do for their customers, staff and local communities."" He said that although ""retailers in non-food areas have seen an unparalleled drop in footfall"", others such as supermarkets have seen continued strong demand.

We'll be back on Monday to bring you the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Goodnight. This was the scene in Tesco Llansamlet store in Swansea this morning when NHS workers were allowed in early to do their shopping. All McDonald's restaurants across the UK and Ireland will close by 19:00 GMT on Monday 23 March. The fast food giant said the decision was ""not taken lightly"" and was made ""with the well-being and safety of our employees in mind, as well as in the best interests of our customers"". Cardiff Council is shutting a car park to the public to provide spaces for doctors, nurses and other NHS staff.

In Ceredigion, the council has thanked the caravan and campsites which have closed following a ""high influx"" of visitors to the area. In a statement, it said: ""We
are aware that this will be a difficult decision for business owners. ""However,
itâs the right decision given that people staying at home in their own areas
will help reduce the spread of the virus and save lives."" We heard on Saturday from the leader of Anglesey council, who asked vistors to stay away during the coronavirus outbreak. Now the council says it's closing car parks, nature reserves and country parks on the island. The economic development member Carwyn Jones said: ""These are tough measures but it's essential we take them. ""We must act and stop visitors coming to the island with immediate effect."" he said. ""I am also urging local tourism and hospitality providers to close their premises to prevent the spread of coronavirus and help protect public health."" We've been talking about social distancing, so here's a reminder of what that means from the BBC's health reporter Laura Foster. This video can not be played Coronavirus UK: What is social distancing? From tomorrow until the end of April, Transport for Wales has announced there will be free travel for NHS workers. A spokesman added: âWe are doing
  all we can to keep vital services running, so that emergency service staff
  who are using our trains and key workers are to travel in safety with
  confidence.â A Welsh Government campaign on how to help people who are staying at home because of coronavirus has been launched. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: âIâve seen so many good things happening, from online choir groups to grocery deliveries, as people across Wales go out of their way to help others with their everyday needs. âCommunities have pulled together to support neighbours in this time of need. Today, weâre asking others to follow the shining example by doing their bit if theyâre able to.â Earlier, First Minister Mark Drakeford said that letters are being sent to 70,000 of Wales' ""most vulnerable people""advising them to stay indoors for 12 to 16 weeks. In his press briefing Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that such ""shielding"" measures - which will apply to around 1.5 million vulnerable people in England - will do more than many other measures to reduce the number of coronavirus cases in the UK. Onsocial distancing, Mr Johnson said that, while he wants people to enjoy outdoor spaces, people must follow the advice. ""Don't think that fresh air in itself provides some sort of immunity,"" he says. Homemade signs have been popping up across various parts of Wales. Here's one from Cemmaes Road in Powys.

He also encouraged people to stay at home and save lives. So what should you do if you go for a walk in a park and it is crowded? Prof Robert Dingwall, a sociologist from Nottingham Trent University who is advising the UK government, said problems occur when people cannot maintain the recommended two metre (6ft) separation. He says: ""If that is the case, then it probably is better to go home and pick a quieter time or a quieter location."" Dr Robin Thompson, an epidemiologist at Oxford University, added: ""The key thing is to exercise while minimising contacts. ""There are many walks all across the UK - so, where possible, individuals can research walks without main attractions such as viewpoints or other areas that represent likely gathering points for groups of people."" ""Local footpaths are likely to be less crowded than walks through major parks. And we can all try and maintain at least two metres distance between ourselves and others while out exercising.""

Five reasons to find hope,"Many across India clapped from their balconies on Sunday as a mark of respect for medical staff We appreciate that these are dark times for people around the world, as the coronavirus continues to spread. Numbers of infections and fatalities are rising, cities and even countries are shutting and many people are being forced into isolation. But amid all the worrying news, there have also been reasons to find hope. As countries go into lockdown over the virus, there have been significant drops in pollution levels. Both China and northern Italy have recorded major falls in nitrogen dioxide - a serious air pollutant and powerful warming chemical - amid reduced industrial activity and car journeys. Researchers in New York also told the BBC that early results showed carbon monoxide, mainly from cars, had been reduced by nearly 50% compared with last year. And with airlines cancelling flights en masse and millions working from home, countries around the world are expected to follow this downward path. You can read more about the drops in pollution levels here. On a similar note, residents of Venice have noticed a vast improvement in the water quality of the famous canals running through the city. The streets of the popular tourist destination in northern Italy have emptied amid the outbreak leading to a drastic drop in water traffic, which has allowed sediment to settle. The usually murky water has gone so clear that fish can even be seen. This video can not be played The cruise ship cancellations have led to cleaner canals in Venice There are plenty of stories of panic buying and fights over toilet roll and tins, but the virus has also spurred acts of kindness around the world. Two New Yorkers amassed 1,300 volunteers in 72 hours to deliver groceries and medicine to elderly and vulnerable people in the city. Facebook said hundreds of thousands of people in the UK had joined local support groups set up for the virus, while similar groups have been formed in Canada,sparking a trend there known as ""caremongering"". Supermarkets in Australia are among those to create a special ""elderly hour"" so older shoppers and those with disabilities have a chance to shop in peace. This video can not be played Australia's elderly shoppers now have a special supermarket shopping hour People have also donated money, shared recipe and exercise ideas, sent uplifting messages to self-isolating elderly people and transformed businesses into food distribution centres. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? NEW MEASURES:What is the UK advice? TRAVEL PLANS:What are your rights? Between a hectic work and home life it is often easy to feel disconnected from those around you. As the virus affects us all, it has brought many communities around the world closer together. In Italy, where a countrywide lockdown is in place, people have joined together on their balconies for morale-boosting songs. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Italians sing from their windows to boost morale A fitness instructor in southern Spain led an exercise class from a low roof in the middle of an apartment complex, which residents in isolation joined from their balconies. Many people have used the opportunity to reconnect with friends and loved ones over phone or video calls, while groups of friends have organised virtual clubbing or pub sessions using mobile apps (including those of us in the BBC who are working from home). The virus has also highlighted the importance of health workers and other people working in key services. Thousands of Europeans have taken to their balconies and windows to applaud the doctors and nurses fighting the virus, while medical students in London have volunteered to help healthcare professionals with childcare and household chores. With millions of people now stuck in isolation, many are using the opportunity to get creative. Social media users have shared details of their new hobbies, including reading, baking, knitting and painting. The DC Public Library in Washington is among those hosting a virtual book club, while Italian Michelin-starred chef Massimo Bottura has launched an Instagram series called Kitchen Quarantine, teaching basic recipes to aspiring foodies who are stuck at home. This video can not be played Facebook group helps parents and their kids during coronavirus lockdown An art teacher in the US state of Tennessee has been live-streaming classes for children who are out of school, inspiring them to get creative at home. And while many public spaces have been shut, art fans have been making the most of virtual tours offered by the world's biggest galleries, observing the famous paintings of the Louvre in Paris and the classic sculptures of the Vatican museum from their living rooms. Australia's Sydney Observatory offered a tour of the night sky for people stuck at home. Allow Facebook content? This article contains content provided by Facebook.

The rise of 48 deaths since Saturday includes 37 in England, seven in Wales, three in Scotland and another in Northern Ireland. The number of UK cases also rose to 5,683. The NHS said all those who died in England in the past day were in vulnerable groups including with underlying health issues. What we don't know about coronavirus deaths It comes as the NHS in England has identified 1.5 million of the most at-risk people who should now stay at home for 12 weeks. The PM told those people to ""shield"" themselves, adding it ""will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life"". Speaking at Downing Street's daily news conference, Mr Johnson told people going to parks they ""have to do that responsibly"". It comes after pictures showed people across parts of the UK visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers over the weekend. Snowdonia National Park said the area""experienced its busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" on Saturday, with other beaches and mountain summits busy. Clapham Common in London was among the parks across the UK busy over the weekend Crowds have also been heading for the coast, including to Barry Island ""Don't think fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity,"" Mr Johnson said, adding that even if people think they are invulnerable, ""there are plenty of people you could infect"". ""Take this advice seriously, follow it, because it's absolutely crucial."" ""My message is you've got to do this in line with the advice, you've got to follow the social distancing rule - keep 2m apart."" Asked whether stricter measures could be introduced, Mr Johnson added: ""I don't think you need to use your imagination very much to see where we might have to go, and we will think about this very, very actively in the next 24 hours. ""It's so important that that pleasure and that ability is preserved but it can only really be preserved if everybody acts responsibly and conforms with those principles of staying apart from one another and social distancing. ""If we can't do that then, yup, I'm afraid we're going to have to bring forward tougher measures."" Some parkshave already announcedthey will be closing. Essex County Council will close all its country parks from 20:00 GMT, while earlier Richmond Park in London closed to traffic on Sunday, although those on foot and cyclists were still allowed. Alsoshutting are all McDonald's restaurants,externalin the UK, which will all be closed by 19:00 GMT on Monday.

""Life should not feel normal,"" she said, and if it did you should ask ""if you are doing the right things"". Speaking at the Downing Street briefing, England's deputy chief medical adviser Dr Jenny Harries said around 12% of adult critical care beds in hospitals in England are currently occupied by patients with the virus. That number is expected to rise drastically, she added. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate?

Primark UK stores closing 'until further notice'The fashion chain says it wants to protect the health of employees and customers.Business,"Primark's 189 UK stores have closed ""until further notice"", as demand drops due to social-distancing during the coronavirus pandemic. It has already shut stores elsewhere and said itwanted to protect the health of employees and customers.,external The fashion chain's boss, Paul Marchant, said it faced ""unprecedented, and frankly unimaginable times"". Other High Street retailers, such as John Lewis and Timpson, have already announced closures amid the pandemic. A Primark spokesperson said that any staff affected by store closures would receive full pay for their contracted hours for 14 days. Meanwhile the John Lewis department store chain will close all of its 50 shops temporarily from Monday for the first time in its 155-year history. The online site will still be available, while the group's 338 Waitrose stores will stay open to dealwith a spike in demand for groceries. More than 2,000 John Lewis workers are already working across Waitrose.

In response to falling demand, the firm has now stopped placing any orders for clothes to be made in the future. It also has a large amount of stock in stores, warehouses and in transit that has already been paid for. Mr Marchant said that Primark had been left with ""no option but to take this action"". He added: ""This is profoundly upsetting for me personally and for all of the team... We recognise and are deeply saddened that this will have an effect throughout our entire supply chain."" Primark does not have an online sales operation, so it orders and sells vast quantities of clothing through its network of brick-and-mortar shops. Mr Marchant called for other countries to support businesses ""in the same way that the UK and many European governments are doing."" The UK government said this week it will pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic, in a move aimed at protecting people's jobs. It will pay 80% of salary for staff who are kept on by their employer, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. Many retail and hospitality firms have warned the pandemic could see them collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is put on hold. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said that shops continue to follow government advice. ""Stores are reviewing Public Health England advice daily to decide what is best to do for their customers, staff and local communities."" He said that although ""retailers in non-food areas have seen an unparalleled drop in footfall"", others such as supermarkets have seen continued strong demand.

"Australia announces nationwide shutdownAll states and territories will close pubs, cafes and restaurants as virus cases surge beyond 1,300.","Bondi Beach was closed after large crowds flouted social distancing advice Australia is shutting down non-essential services as coronavirus cases rise rapidly in the country. Pubs, clubs, gyms, cinemas and places of worship will be shut from midday on Monday, while restaurants and cafes will have to switch to takeaway only. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the restrictions after a national cabinet meeting. The number of cases in Australia has risen sharply in recent days, reaching 1,315. New South Wales (NSW), home to Sydney, is the worst-affected state with 533 confirmed cases. Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, has 296 cases, while Queensland has 259. The new restrictions will see many businesses close but supermarkets, petrol stations, pharmacies and home delivery services will continue running. The prime minister said he wanted to keep schools open but parents would be able to keep their children at home if they wished to do so. ""I don't want to see our children lose an entire year of their education,"" he said. Some states, including Victoria, have signalled that they want to close schools. A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? AVOIDING CONTACT:Should I self-isolate? STRESS:How to protect your mental health THE FUTURE:When will the coronavirus outbreak end? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Seven people have died across Australia so far from Covid-19. The new measures come after large crowds gathered on Sydney's beaches including Bondi on Saturday, flouting social distancing advice. Mr Morrison said that the federal and state governments had decided to act because Australians were not obeying guidelines. But he added: ""We are not putting in place lockdowns that put people in and confine them to their homes. ""That is not a measure that has been contemplated at this point."" Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said people, especially the young, had to realise that they needed to live ""very differently"" and stop going out in order to control the virus. In other developments: The prime minister announced new stimulus measures to boost the economy South Australia, Western Australia and the Northern Territory will close their borders from Tuesday. Under the new rules, anyone arriving will be forced to self-isolate for 14 days Tasmania, an island state, has already imposed similar travel restrictions The Australian Football League suspended its 2020 season, with no fixtures until at least 31 May. The women's league has also been halted In contrast, the National Rugby League says it will carry on with matches as planned by BBC News reporter Frances Mao, in Sydney Just hours after the impending shutdown was announced, I walked through an inner Sydney neighbourhood. It was a balmy Sunday evening and people were out at bars and restaurants perhaps unaware that this would be their last drink outside their homes for a while. The measures are likely to hit Australians hard, and shock many out of the lethargy they've felt towards social distancing. State restrictions had already ramped up this past week, as the case numbers doubled every few days. However, many Australians haven't been paying attention to the statistics. Instead, discussion has often centred around disruption to daily life - the inconvenience and tedium of working from home; the panic buying at supermarkets. While some - closely attuned to the crisis in the US and Europe - have been vigilantly isolating, others have been resistant to the message ""stay at home"". It's why a blast of late summer heat on Friday drew so many out to Bondi Beach - the social isolation mantra hasn't sunk in yet. There's been little public education campaigning, and the constantly changing messaging from the government hasn't helped. It was only 10 days ago that the prime minister blithely said he'd still attend a rugby game, minutes after banning large gatherings outside. He later changed his decision. Australia had fewer than 200 cases then, it now has over 1,300. The prime minister earlier on Sunday announced a second stimulus package worth A$66bn, meaning the total financial package offered by the government and Reserve Bank now amounts to A$189bn (Â£94bn, $109bn). Mr Morrison said financial support would be offered to those most vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The measures include doubling income support for those on Jobseeker's allowance while waiving asset tests and waiting periods. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Police clamp down on crowds in Bondi Beach Grants of up to A$100,000 will be made available for small and medium-sized businesses. Individuals affected by the coronavirus will be able to access up to A$10,000 of their pension during 2019 and 2020. They will be able to take a further A$10,000 the following year. Australian airlines and airports will meanwhile be provided with up to A$715 million in support. Mr Morrison stressed that the measures cover the next six months. ""This is not a quick fix,"" he said. ""This will not be my last visit to the podium. There will be more packages and more support."" Singapore has announced it will ban all short-term visitors under new coronavirus measures. Short-term visitors are also banned from transiting through Singapore. Only work pass holders employed in essential services such as healthcare and transport will be allowed to enter the country, along with their dependents. The city state confirmed on Saturday that two people had died from Covid-19, the first virus related deaths in Singapore. China reported 46 new cases, all but one brought in from other countries. The one domestic case was linked to a previous imported case, according to local authorities. South Korea reported 98 new cases on Sunday. The figure suggests a downward trend in new cases.

"Take social distancing advice seriously, says PMBoris Johnson says the advice to stop the spread of coronavirus is ""absolutely crucial"".UK","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Even if you think you're personally invulnerable there are people you can infect"" Boris Johnson has warned ""tougher measures"" could be introduced if people do not take the government's coronavirus advice seriously. The PM thanked people for making sacrifices but said people must follow social distancing guidance. ""If you don't do it responsibly... we will have to bring forward further measures,"" he said. It comes as the number of UK deaths reached 281, including a person aged 18 with an underlying health condition. They are thought to be the youngest person with the virus to have died in the UK so far. The rise of 48 deaths since Saturday includes 37 in England, seven in Wales, three in Scotland and another in Northern Ireland. The number of UK cases also rose to 5,683. The NHS said all those who died in England in the past day were in vulnerable groups including with underlying health issues. What we don't know about coronavirus deaths It comes as the NHS in England has identified 1.5 million of the most at-risk people who should now stay at home for 12 weeks. The PM told those people to ""shield"" themselves, adding it ""will do more than any other single measure that we are setting out to save life"". Speaking at Downing Street's daily news conference, Mr Johnson told people going to parks they ""have to do that responsibly"". It comes after pictures showed people across parts of the UK visiting parks and open spaces in large numbers over the weekend. Snowdonia National Park said the area""experienced its busiest ever visitor day in living memory"" on Saturday, with other beaches and mountain summits busy. Clapham Common in London was among the parks across the UK busy over the weekend Crowds have also been heading for the coast, including to Barry Island ""Don't think fresh air in itself automatically provides some immunity,"" Mr Johnson said, adding that even if people think they are invulnerable, ""there are plenty of people you could infect"". ""Take this advice seriously, follow it, because it's absolutely crucial."" ""My message is you've got to do this in line with the advice, you've got to follow the social distancing rule - keep 2m apart."" Asked whether stricter measures could be introduced, Mr Johnson added: ""I don't think you need to use your imagination very much to see where we might have to go, and we will think about this very, very actively in the next 24 hours. ""It's so important that that pleasure and that ability is preserved but it can only really be preserved if everybody acts responsibly and conforms with those principles of staying apart from one another and social distancing. ""If we can't do that then, yup, I'm afraid we're going to have to bring forward tougher measures."" Some parkshave already announcedthey will be closing. Essex County Council will close all its country parks from 20:00 GMT, while earlier Richmond Park in London closed to traffic on Sunday, although those on foot and cyclists were still allowed.

We're pausing our live coverage for now, but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website. Here's the latest: All McDonalds restaurants across the UK and Ireland will close by 19:00 GMT on Monday 23 March. The fast food giant said the decision was ""not taken lightly"" and was made ""with the well-being and safety of our employees in mind, as well as in the best interests of our customers"". In a post on Twitter,external, they thanked their ""brilliant employees for their hard work"" and said the restaurants would re-open ""as soon as it is safe"". Coronavirus is now affecting more than 160 countries and has claimed more than 13,700 lives. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) it took more than three months to reach the first 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide, but only 12 days to reach the next 100,000. Our Visual and Data Journalism team has createda series of maps and charts to help you understand what is going on.  The EU has decided to create a stockpile of medical equipment such as masks and ventilators to help those member countries who are struggling to secure supplies in the battle against coronavirus. The European Commission said it would finance 90% of the stockpile, which will distributed to countries that need most. The announcement comes amid criticism that the EU is not doing enough to support the many states dealing with a rising death toll from Covid-19. In addition, the EU continues
to help members bring back their citizens who are stranded
abroad because of the outbreak. Up to 75% of the cost of repatriation is covered by the EU, providing the flight repatriates citizens of more than one member state.  They're terms we weren't using even just 10 days ago. But now social distancing and self-isolation form part of the response to the coronavirus - and they apply to everyone to different degrees. Social distancing,externalis important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. Self-isolating meansstaying at home,externaland not leaving it, other than for exercise. Don't go to work, school or public areas during this time. Read more here. Youâve probably heard by now that Italy has been hit hard by the virus. Itâs now at the epicentre of the outbreak, and the country's president has urged other countries to learn from its struggle to slow the spread of Covid-19. The number of recorded deaths there recently overtook those in China, where the virus originated last year. Italy reported 651 coronavirus deaths on Sunday and saw its toll for the past month reach 5,476, the highest in the world. So why has Italy been so badly affected? A number of possible reasons have been mooted. Some studies point to the large number of elderly people in the worst affected regions, such as Lombardy in the north. Italy also has the oldest population in the world after Japan with some 23% of people there over the age of 65. This matters because the virus is especially dangerous for older people. The vast majority of Italy's fatal cases involved elderly people with at least one pre-existing condition, officials say. The average age of the first 3,200 people who died was 78.5. Experts also say a large proportion of 18-34s live at home with these older people, which increases the risk of the virus spreading. Another factor that may help explain Italy's crisis is the length of time the virus has been active. Some health officials believe it arrived in Italy long before the first case was officially confirmed in late February. It likely spread undetected through northern Italy, possibly for several weeks. The death toll from coronavirus in France has increased to 674, after another 112 people were confirmed to have died over the past 24 hours. ""The virus kills and it is continuing to kill,"" said health official Jerome Salomon on Sunday. A total of 16,018 cases have been recorded in France, but the figure is widely believed to be an ""underestimate"", Mr Salomon warned. France has been in lockdown since Tuesday, with only essential trips outside permitted. Mr Salomon urged the people to show ""patience"".  Opera singer Placido Domingo has tested positive for coronavirus. The 79-year-old Spanish tenorwrote on his Facebook page,externalthat he was in self-isolation with his family, but remained ""in good health"". ""I experienced fever and cough symptoms therefore deciding to get tested and the result came back positive,"" He urged his followers to wash their hands frequently and keep their distance from one another. ""Together we can fight this virus and stop the current worldwide crisis,"" he continued. The opera star recentlyresigned as general manager of the Los Angeles Operafollowing allegations of sexual harassment. He has since publicly apologised to his accusers. Spain is struggling to contain Europe's second worst
outbreak of the coronavirus after Italy, with over 28,000 cases  The latest figures for coronavirus-related deaths in England included a person as young as 18, the NHS says. In total 37 people with the virus died today in England, all in vulnerable groups including with underlying conditions. There were another seven in Wales, three in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo chastised New York City residents for defying official health guidance and continuing to socialise in large groups. ""Itâs a mistake. Itâs insensitive. Itâs arrogant. Itâs self-destructive,"" Mr Cuomo said on Sunday. ""This is not a joke, and I am not kidding,"" adding that he shared New Yorkersâ frustration at having to stay inside. ""Iâm even getting annoyed with the dog."" Mr Cuomo has cancelled all non-critical surgeries in the state as cases across New York continue to soar. There are at least 15,168 confirmed cases - a jump of 4,812 since Saturday - and 114 deaths, Mr Cuomo said. At least 38 of New York Cityâs over 9,000 cases are those inside prisons, including 21 inmates. Activists have urged early releases to lower population densities within the facilities. Already, prisons in Los Angeles and Ohio have allowed for hundreds of early releases and New Yorkâs mayor has said the city will look to release âvulnerableâ inmates. US Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for the virus, his office has announced. The Republican from Kentucky is the first member of the upper chamber of Congress to announce he has Covid-19. Several members of the House of Representatives have already tested positive for the virus. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, and Utah Democrat Ben McAdams announced they were in self-quarantine earlier this week. The latest UK government news conference on its coronavirus
response has come to an end. Hereâs what happened: Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent It was a pretty stark warning - and a question everyone wants to know. If people aren't following the advice, what will the government do? It is very clear from the prime minister that he is actively considering further measures. We have seen in other countries people are being told not to leave their houses. But Boris Johnson said he does not want to impose such restrictions. He says he is very, very concerned with people's mental and physical health if they cannot leave the house. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in quarantine after meeting a doctor on Friday who has since tested positive for the virus, her spokesman said. She was told about the contact after a press conference on Sunday in which she announced further measures to try to curb the spread of coronavirus. Her government banned meetings of more than two people outside work and home for two weeks. Angela Merkel announced the new measures on TV on Sunday More on the new restrictions imposed by the German government moments ago, banning gatherings of more than two people outside work and home. ""Our behaviour is the most effective way"" of slowing the rate of infection, Chancellor Angela Merkel said of the nationwide measures. Some exceptions will be allowed, including for people living under the same roof and going out together for fresh air. The government has also ordered hairdressers and beauty, massage and
tattoo parlours to close and restaurants will only be allowed to offer takeaway services. The country had already closed schools and other non-essential shops. Asked again about enforcing a lockdown, Mr Johnson says the effect of such measures in Europe is not yet known. ""The answer is always to be guided by the science,"" he says. ""You've got to impose these interventions... at the moment they can have the maximum effect."" He says the introduction of curfews and prohibitions on movement must only come ""at the right moment"". Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries also warns against a ""direct comparison"" between virus case rates in Italy and the UK, saying this should be done with ""caution"". She says that the case fatality rate is around 10% in Italy, as opposed to 4% in the UK - but it depends how cases are counted. She says there are differences in testing, with more serious cases being tested in the UK, for example. She adds that they feel the eventual mortality rate for the virus will be around 1%. Asked what the ""further measures"" relating to social distancing are and when they might be implemented, Mr Johnson says people ""do not need to use their imagination to see where the government may have to go"". He mentions the kind of measures seen elsewhere. In Europe, governments have implemented lockdowns and restrictions on movement. ""I don't want to do that, I have tried to explain the public health benefits [from] the sense that you can go out,"" Mr Johnson says. He says the ability to go out can only be preserved if people act responsibly. ""If we can't do that I am afraid we are going to need to bring forward tougher measures."" Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick says the vulnerable who will be shielding for 12 weeks will get a phone number to ring if they need support with getting food or medicine. He says he hopes that food parcels will be arriving towards the end of next week, and will become a ""more sophisticated product"" over time. Boris Johnson is also challenged about a perceived clash of advice on playgrounds, and asked about how practical it is to keep children two metres apart. In reply, the prime minister says the scientific advice is that the health value of keeping parks open outweighs closing them. However he repeats his threat that the government will look at ""further measures"" if people don't behave ""responsibly"". Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says it has been a ""hugely complex task"" to determine and contact those who will be advised to shield themselves for 12 weeks. She says they are being careful, and thus may ""slightly over-estimate"" the number of people in this category - which has been estimated at 1.5m. She pledges that people's individual conditions will also be factored in however when determining whether they need to be shielded. Â© 2025 BBC.

James Daunt, the boss of Waterstones, had said that his bookshops provided an ""important social resource"" and would stay open until forced to close. However, late on Sunday the chain announced that it would be temporarily shutting all of its outlets by the close of trade on Monday. As many UK firms warn of the impact of the pandemic, the City watchdog has asked them not to publish preliminary financial statements that were due in the next few days.

In response to falling demand, the firm has now stopped placing any orders for clothes to be made in the future. It also has a large amount of stock in stores, warehouses and in transit that has already been paid for. Mr Marchant said that Primark had been left with ""no option but to take this action"". He added: ""This is profoundly upsetting for me personally and for all of the team... We recognise and are deeply saddened that this will have an effect throughout our entire supply chain."" Primark does not have an online sales operation, so it orders and sells vast quantities of clothing through its network of brick-and-mortar shops. Mr Marchant called for other countries to support businesses ""in the same way that the UK and many European governments are doing."" The UK government said this week it will pay the wages of employees unable to work due to the coronavirus pandemic, in a move aimed at protecting people's jobs. It will pay 80% of salary for staff who are kept on by their employer, covering wages of up to Â£2,500 a month. Many retail and hospitality firms have warned the pandemic could see them collapse, wiping out thousands of jobs, as life in the UK is put on hold. Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said that shops continue to follow government advice. ""Stores are reviewing Public Health England advice daily to decide what is best to do for their customers, staff and local communities."" He said that although ""retailers in non-food areas have seen an unparalleled drop in footfall"", others such as supermarkets have seen continued strong demand.

Australia's biggest cities to shut down,"Bondi Beach was closed after large crowds flouted social distancing advice Australia is shutting down non-essential services as coronavirus cases rise rapidly in the country. Pubs, clubs, gyms, cinemas and places of worship will be shut from midday on Monday, while restaurants and cafes will have to switch to takeaway only. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the restrictions after a national cabinet meeting. The number of cases in Australia has risen sharply in recent days, reaching 1,315. New South Wales (NSW), home to Sydney, is the worst-affected state with 533 confirmed cases. Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, has 296 cases, while Queensland has 259. The new restrictions will see many businesses close but supermarkets, petrol stations, pharmacies and home delivery services will continue running. The prime minister said he wanted to keep schools open but parents would be able to keep their children at home if they wished to do so. ""I don't want to see our children lose an entire year of their education,"" he said. Some states, including Victoria, have signalled that they want to close schools.

MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Seven people have died across Australia so far from Covid-19. The new measures come after large crowds gathered on Sydney's beaches including Bondi on Saturday, flouting social distancing advice. Mr Morrison said that the federal and state governments had decided to act because Australians were not obeying guidelines. But he added: ""We are not putting in place lockdowns that put people in and confine them to their homes. ""That is not a measure that has been contemplated at this point."" Chief Medical Officer Brendan Murphy said people, especially the young, had to realise that they needed to live ""very differently"" and stop going out in order to control the virus.

The measures are likely to hit Australians hard, and shock many out of the lethargy they've felt towards social distancing. State restrictions had already ramped up this past week, as the case numbers doubled every few days. However, many Australians haven't been paying attention to the statistics. Instead, discussion has often centred around disruption to daily life - the inconvenience and tedium of working from home; the panic buying at supermarkets. While some - closely attuned to the crisis in the US and Europe - have been vigilantly isolating, others have been resistant to the message ""stay at home"". It's why a blast of late summer heat on Friday drew so many out to Bondi Beach - the social isolation mantra hasn't sunk in yet. There's been little public education campaigning, and the constantly changing messaging from the government hasn't helped. It was only 10 days ago that the prime minister blithely said he'd still attend a rugby game, minutes after banning large gatherings outside. He later changed his decision. Australia had fewer than 200 cases then, it now has over 1,300. The prime minister earlier on Sunday announced a second stimulus package worth A$66bn, meaning the total financial package offered by the government and Reserve Bank now amounts to A$189bn (Â£94bn, $109bn). Mr Morrison said financial support would be offered to those most vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus crisis.

We're pausing our live coverage for now, but we'll continue to bring you updates across the BBC News website. Here's the latest: All McDonalds restaurants across the UK and Ireland will close by 19:00 GMT on Monday 23 March. The fast food giant said the decision was ""not taken lightly"" and was made ""with the well-being and safety of our employees in mind, as well as in the best interests of our customers"". In a post on Twitter,external, they thanked their ""brilliant employees for their hard work"" and said the restaurants would re-open ""as soon as it is safe"". Coronavirus is now affecting more than 160 countries and has claimed more than 13,700 lives. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO) it took more than three months to reach the first 100,000 confirmed cases worldwide, but only 12 days to reach the next 100,000. Our Visual and Data Journalism team has createda series of maps and charts to help you understand what is going on.  The EU has decided to create a stockpile of medical equipment such as masks and ventilators to help those member countries who are struggling to secure supplies in the battle against coronavirus. The European Commission said it would finance 90% of the stockpile, which will distributed to countries that need most. The announcement comes amid criticism that the EU is not doing enough to support the many states dealing with a rising death toll from Covid-19. In addition, the EU continues
to help members bring back their citizens who are stranded
abroad because of the outbreak. Up to 75% of the cost of repatriation is covered by the EU, providing the flight repatriates citizens of more than one member state.  They're terms we weren't using even just 10 days ago. But now social distancing and self-isolation form part of the response to the coronavirus - and they apply to everyone to different degrees. Social distancing,externalis important because coronavirus spreads when an infected person coughs small droplets - packed with the virus - into the air. These can be breathed in, or cause an infection if you touch a surface they have landed on, then your eyes, nose or mouth. Self-isolating meansstaying at home,externaland not leaving it, other than for exercise. Don't go to work, school or public areas during this time. Read more here. Youâve probably heard by now that Italy has been hit hard by the virus. Itâs now at the epicentre of the outbreak, and the country's president has urged other countries to learn from its struggle to slow the spread of Covid-19. The number of recorded deaths there recently overtook those in China, where the virus originated last year. Italy reported 651 coronavirus deaths on Sunday and saw its toll for the past month reach 5,476, the highest in the world. So why has Italy been so badly affected? A number of possible reasons have been mooted. Some studies point to the large number of elderly people in the worst affected regions, such as Lombardy in the north. Italy also has the oldest population in the world after Japan with some 23% of people there over the age of 65. This matters because the virus is especially dangerous for older people. The vast majority of Italy's fatal cases involved elderly people with at least one pre-existing condition, officials say. The average age of the first 3,200 people who died was 78.5. Experts also say a large proportion of 18-34s live at home with these older people, which increases the risk of the virus spreading. Another factor that may help explain Italy's crisis is the length of time the virus has been active. Some health officials believe it arrived in Italy long before the first case was officially confirmed in late February. It likely spread undetected through northern Italy, possibly for several weeks. The death toll from coronavirus in France has increased to 674, after another 112 people were confirmed to have died over the past 24 hours. ""The virus kills and it is continuing to kill,"" said health official Jerome Salomon on Sunday. A total of 16,018 cases have been recorded in France, but the figure is widely believed to be an ""underestimate"", Mr Salomon warned. France has been in lockdown since Tuesday, with only essential trips outside permitted. Mr Salomon urged the people to show ""patience"".  Opera singer Placido Domingo has tested positive for coronavirus. The 79-year-old Spanish tenorwrote on his Facebook page,externalthat he was in self-isolation with his family, but remained ""in good health"". ""I experienced fever and cough symptoms therefore deciding to get tested and the result came back positive,"" He urged his followers to wash their hands frequently and keep their distance from one another. ""Together we can fight this virus and stop the current worldwide crisis,"" he continued. The opera star recentlyresigned as general manager of the Los Angeles Operafollowing allegations of sexual harassment. He has since publicly apologised to his accusers. Spain is struggling to contain Europe's second worst
outbreak of the coronavirus after Italy, with over 28,000 cases  The latest figures for coronavirus-related deaths in England included a person as young as 18, the NHS says. In total 37 people with the virus died today in England, all in vulnerable groups including with underlying conditions. There were another seven in Wales, three in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo chastised New York City residents for defying official health guidance and continuing to socialise in large groups. ""Itâs a mistake. Itâs insensitive. Itâs arrogant. Itâs self-destructive,"" Mr Cuomo said on Sunday. ""This is not a joke, and I am not kidding,"" adding that he shared New Yorkersâ frustration at having to stay inside. ""Iâm even getting annoyed with the dog."" Mr Cuomo has cancelled all non-critical surgeries in the state as cases across New York continue to soar. There are at least 15,168 confirmed cases - a jump of 4,812 since Saturday - and 114 deaths, Mr Cuomo said. At least 38 of New York Cityâs over 9,000 cases are those inside prisons, including 21 inmates. Activists have urged early releases to lower population densities within the facilities. Already, prisons in Los Angeles and Ohio have allowed for hundreds of early releases and New Yorkâs mayor has said the city will look to release âvulnerableâ inmates. US Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for the virus, his office has announced. The Republican from Kentucky is the first member of the upper chamber of Congress to announce he has Covid-19. Several members of the House of Representatives have already tested positive for the virus. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, and Utah Democrat Ben McAdams announced they were in self-quarantine earlier this week. The latest UK government news conference on its coronavirus
response has come to an end. Hereâs what happened: Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent It was a pretty stark warning - and a question everyone wants to know. If people aren't following the advice, what will the government do? It is very clear from the prime minister that he is actively considering further measures. We have seen in other countries people are being told not to leave their houses. But Boris Johnson said he does not want to impose such restrictions. He says he is very, very concerned with people's mental and physical health if they cannot leave the house. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in quarantine after meeting a doctor on Friday who has since tested positive for the virus, her spokesman said. She was told about the contact after a press conference on Sunday in which she announced further measures to try to curb the spread of coronavirus. Her government banned meetings of more than two people outside work and home for two weeks. Angela Merkel announced the new measures on TV on Sunday More on the new restrictions imposed by the German government moments ago, banning gatherings of more than two people outside work and home. ""Our behaviour is the most effective way"" of slowing the rate of infection, Chancellor Angela Merkel said of the nationwide measures. Some exceptions will be allowed, including for people living under the same roof and going out together for fresh air. The government has also ordered hairdressers and beauty, massage and
tattoo parlours to close and restaurants will only be allowed to offer takeaway services. The country had already closed schools and other non-essential shops. Asked again about enforcing a lockdown, Mr Johnson says the effect of such measures in Europe is not yet known. ""The answer is always to be guided by the science,"" he says. ""You've got to impose these interventions... at the moment they can have the maximum effect."" He says the introduction of curfews and prohibitions on movement must only come ""at the right moment"". Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries also warns against a ""direct comparison"" between virus case rates in Italy and the UK, saying this should be done with ""caution"". She says that the case fatality rate is around 10% in Italy, as opposed to 4% in the UK - but it depends how cases are counted. She says there are differences in testing, with more serious cases being tested in the UK, for example. She adds that they feel the eventual mortality rate for the virus will be around 1%. Asked what the ""further measures"" relating to social distancing are and when they might be implemented, Mr Johnson says people ""do not need to use their imagination to see where the government may have to go"". He mentions the kind of measures seen elsewhere. In Europe, governments have implemented lockdowns and restrictions on movement. ""I don't want to do that, I have tried to explain the public health benefits [from] the sense that you can go out,"" Mr Johnson says. He says the ability to go out can only be preserved if people act responsibly. ""If we can't do that I am afraid we are going to need to bring forward tougher measures."" Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick says the vulnerable who will be shielding for 12 weeks will get a phone number to ring if they need support with getting food or medicine. He says he hopes that food parcels will be arriving towards the end of next week, and will become a ""more sophisticated product"" over time. Boris Johnson is also challenged about a perceived clash of advice on playgrounds, and asked about how practical it is to keep children two metres apart. In reply, the prime minister says the scientific advice is that the health value of keeping parks open outweighs closing them. However he repeats his threat that the government will look at ""further measures"" if people don't behave ""responsibly"". Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says it has been a ""hugely complex task"" to determine and contact those who will be advised to shield themselves for 12 weeks. She says they are being careful, and thus may ""slightly over-estimate"" the number of people in this category - which has been estimated at 1.5m. She pledges that people's individual conditions will also be factored in however when determining whether they need to be shielded. Â© 2025 BBC.

A number of possible reasons have been mooted. Some studies point to the large number of elderly people in the worst affected regions, such as Lombardy in the north. Italy also has the oldest population in the world after Japan with some 23% of people there over the age of 65. This matters because the virus is especially dangerous for older people. The vast majority of Italy's fatal cases involved elderly people with at least one pre-existing condition, officials say. The average age of the first 3,200 people who died was 78.5. Experts also say a large proportion of 18-34s live at home with these older people, which increases the risk of the virus spreading. Another factor that may help explain Italy's crisis is the length of time the virus has been active. Some health officials believe it arrived in Italy long before the first case was officially confirmed in late February. It likely spread undetected through northern Italy, possibly for several weeks. The death toll from coronavirus in France has increased to 674, after another 112 people were confirmed to have died over the past 24 hours. ""The virus kills and it is continuing to kill,"" said health official Jerome Salomon on Sunday. A total of 16,018 cases have been recorded in France, but the figure is widely believed to be an ""underestimate"", Mr Salomon warned. France has been in lockdown since Tuesday, with only essential trips outside permitted. Mr Salomon urged the people to show ""patience"".  Opera singer Placido Domingo has tested positive for coronavirus. The 79-year-old Spanish tenorwrote on his Facebook page,externalthat he was in self-isolation with his family, but remained ""in good health"". ""I experienced fever and cough symptoms therefore deciding to get tested and the result came back positive,"" He urged his followers to wash their hands frequently and keep their distance from one another. ""Together we can fight this virus and stop the current worldwide crisis,"" he continued. The opera star recentlyresigned as general manager of the Los Angeles Operafollowing allegations of sexual harassment. He has since publicly apologised to his accusers. Spain is struggling to contain Europe's second worst
outbreak of the coronavirus after Italy, with over 28,000 cases  The latest figures for coronavirus-related deaths in England included a person as young as 18, the NHS says. In total 37 people with the virus died today in England, all in vulnerable groups including with underlying conditions. There were another seven in Wales, three in Scotland and one in Northern Ireland. New York Governor Andrew Cuomo chastised New York City residents for defying official health guidance and continuing to socialise in large groups. ""Itâs a mistake. Itâs insensitive. Itâs arrogant. Itâs self-destructive,"" Mr Cuomo said on Sunday. ""This is not a joke, and I am not kidding,"" adding that he shared New Yorkersâ frustration at having to stay inside. ""Iâm even getting annoyed with the dog."" Mr Cuomo has cancelled all non-critical surgeries in the state as cases across New York continue to soar. There are at least 15,168 confirmed cases - a jump of 4,812 since Saturday - and 114 deaths, Mr Cuomo said. At least 38 of New York Cityâs over 9,000 cases are those inside prisons, including 21 inmates. Activists have urged early releases to lower population densities within the facilities. Already, prisons in Los Angeles and Ohio have allowed for hundreds of early releases and New Yorkâs mayor has said the city will look to release âvulnerableâ inmates. US Senator Rand Paul has tested positive for the virus, his office has announced. The Republican from Kentucky is the first member of the upper chamber of Congress to announce he has Covid-19. Several members of the House of Representatives have already tested positive for the virus. Mario Diaz-Balart, a Florida Republican, and Utah Democrat Ben McAdams announced they were in self-quarantine earlier this week. The latest UK government news conference on its coronavirus
response has come to an end. Hereâs what happened: Vicki YoungChief Political Correspondent It was a pretty stark warning - and a question everyone wants to know. If people aren't following the advice, what will the government do? It is very clear from the prime minister that he is actively considering further measures. We have seen in other countries people are being told not to leave their houses. But Boris Johnson said he does not want to impose such restrictions. He says he is very, very concerned with people's mental and physical health if they cannot leave the house. German Chancellor Angela Merkel is in quarantine after meeting a doctor on Friday who has since tested positive for the virus, her spokesman said. She was told about the contact after a press conference on Sunday in which she announced further measures to try to curb the spread of coronavirus. Her government banned meetings of more than two people outside work and home for two weeks. Angela Merkel announced the new measures on TV on Sunday More on the new restrictions imposed by the German government moments ago, banning gatherings of more than two people outside work and home. ""Our behaviour is the most effective way"" of slowing the rate of infection, Chancellor Angela Merkel said of the nationwide measures. Some exceptions will be allowed, including for people living under the same roof and going out together for fresh air. The government has also ordered hairdressers and beauty, massage and
tattoo parlours to close and restaurants will only be allowed to offer takeaway services. The country had already closed schools and other non-essential shops. Asked again about enforcing a lockdown, Mr Johnson says the effect of such measures in Europe is not yet known. ""The answer is always to be guided by the science,"" he says. ""You've got to impose these interventions... at the moment they can have the maximum effect."" He says the introduction of curfews and prohibitions on movement must only come ""at the right moment"". Deputy Chief Medical Officer for England Dr Jenny Harries also warns against a ""direct comparison"" between virus case rates in Italy and the UK, saying this should be done with ""caution"". She says that the case fatality rate is around 10% in Italy, as opposed to 4% in the UK - but it depends how cases are counted. She says there are differences in testing, with more serious cases being tested in the UK, for example. She adds that they feel the eventual mortality rate for the virus will be around 1%. Asked what the ""further measures"" relating to social distancing are and when they might be implemented, Mr Johnson says people ""do not need to use their imagination to see where the government may have to go"". He mentions the kind of measures seen elsewhere. In Europe, governments have implemented lockdowns and restrictions on movement. ""I don't want to do that, I have tried to explain the public health benefits [from] the sense that you can go out,"" Mr Johnson says. He says the ability to go out can only be preserved if people act responsibly. ""If we can't do that I am afraid we are going to need to bring forward tougher measures."" Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick says the vulnerable who will be shielding for 12 weeks will get a phone number to ring if they need support with getting food or medicine. He says he hopes that food parcels will be arriving towards the end of next week, and will become a ""more sophisticated product"" over time. Boris Johnson is also challenged about a perceived clash of advice on playgrounds, and asked about how practical it is to keep children two metres apart. In reply, the prime minister says the scientific advice is that the health value of keeping parks open outweighs closing them. However he repeats his threat that the government will look at ""further measures"" if people don't behave ""responsibly"". Dr Jenny Harries, deputy chief medical officer for England, says it has been a ""hugely complex task"" to determine and contact those who will be advised to shield themselves for 12 weeks. She says they are being careful, and thus may ""slightly over-estimate"" the number of people in this category - which has been estimated at 1.5m. She pledges that people's individual conditions will also be factored in however when determining whether they need to be shielded. Â© 2025 BBC.

Self-isolation: 'How I'm coping with it',"If you're now either working from home and socially isolating or quarantining after showing possible coronavirus symptoms, it's likely you're coming to terms with how much spare time you suddenly have. Earlier this week, the governmentadvised against going outfor ""non-essential"" reasons, and many schools and businesses across the UK have now closed. This has left tens of thousands of us stuck inside our homes for large chunks of time - needing more than a boxset binge and the odd four-way video chat to see us through. Coronavirus: What are social distancing and self-isolation? Radio 1 Newsbeat spoke to people in this situation to see how they're dealing with all this enforced alone time. While some are learning new skills,  making good on existing life goals and starting new creative projects - others are finding it harder to adapt to such drastic changes to their daily lives. ""I've taken up a new hobby that I never thought about trying before - cross-stitching and embroidery."" Maddy Bateson, 21, is self-isolating in her student house in Salford. Before deciding to focus on embroidery, she watched a fair bit of TV and played The Sims but soon grew bored of her more usual pastimes. ""I'm not very good yet but doing something different takes my mind off things. Instead of just watching TV, I put some music on and embroider a little flower on my jeans."" Maddy's top tip for not allowing the isolation to overwhelm you is to stay in touch with  family through voice notes. ""It's nice to hear someone's voice - not everyone wants to pick up the phone and ring all the time so short voice notes can really help."" She's also been video chatting with her mates but says she's learning to enjoy the silence too. ""It's been nice to get a bit of time away from my phone and having to be in constant contact with people. Now, I can just chill by myself and spend a few hours cross-stitching."" Joe Flinders finds writing lists helps Joe Flinders, 26, has been working remotely from his home in Manchester and social distancing for several days. ""I'm not someone that does great in my own company - I'm quite an extrovert,"" he says. His usual routine sees him out and about either at the gym or hanging out with mates. He found the best way to adjust to his new reality was by writing a big list of plans like clearing out his wardrobe and relearning the piano. ""I'm going to do a nutrition course too over several weeks. It will keep me busy and also educate me."" On top of all that, he's going to start helping his younger sister, whose GCSE's have been cancelled, keep up with her schoolwork. ""She's got lot of revision materials, so to help her and keep us all busy, I'm going to quiz her on bits of her different subjects."" He advises those struggling with the initial impact of self-isolation to find ""small things that give you joy throughout the day"". EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? CONTAINMENT:What it means to self-isolate HEALTH MYTHS:The fake advice you should ignore MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Charlotte, 26, was working in a bar until the coronavirus crisis struck. Now, she's at home - practising social distancing as much as possible. To stave off the boredom she started sewing. ""It's funny because when I was 14, or 15, I did a sewing class and I was, like, I will never use that!"" Now, she's started a fashion project inspired by the face masks that have become synonymous with the virus worldwide. ""On the streets and on the bus, I started seeing so many people wearing these blue and white masks. And I just thought - why not try and make a prettier version to put some light into this awful situation?"" Charlotte is clear her face masks don't offer medical protection Theofficial advice on face masksis that they are not an effective way of protecting yourself from Covid-19, and they could even create a false sense of security. Charlotte is clear that her masks are intended as a fashion accessory only. ""People on social media ask me about this and I make it very clear that none of these masks protect against the virus,"" she says. ""For me, it's just a way of keeping my body and my mind busy - it can be scary when you think too much about the virus."" After posting, her designs on Instagram she was surprised by how much positive feedback she got. ""Being able to be creative really helps with my wellbeing,"" she says. ""For me, it's a form of self-care and a great way to use my time at home."" But, others have found it harder to adapt to life indoors. Joe Wilmot is a student, living in a shared house in Manchester. He's been self-isolating for almost a week. Although, he is able to access to his university work easily from home, he's struggling to adjust to staying indoors. ""Apart from having the balcony doors open, I don't think I've really felt fresh air for days. And because I've been cleaning non-stop, my flat smells of chemicals."" At first, he thought about taking up a new hobby like knitting, but then realised he would need to stop isolating to go and buy the wool and needles. Joe recommends turning off the news at times Instead, he's discovered new things about himself. ""It turns out, I'm skilled at staying horizontal in bed for about 12 hours a day, which is something that even as a student I didn't know I could do. ""So, I've just stayed in bed binge-watching TV shows. At first, I was watching the news constantly too but now I'm getting to the point where I want to distract myself from things going on outside."" If you do end up turning to TV for solace, Joe recommends finding shows that make you laugh. ""Re-watching comedy shows like The Thick of It can really boost your mood and stop you thinking about the fact you can't go anywhere."" Too offset all the time he's been spending in bed, Joe has also been copying workouts from social media. ""I follow this guy called Alex on Instagram who puts on lycra and does exercises in his living room. So I've been putting my shorts on and following his routines - and that, to be honest, is what is getting me through this crisis."" What are the social distancing rules?

We'll be back on Monday to bring you the latest developments in the coronavirus pandemic. Goodnight. This was the scene in Tesco Llansamlet store in Swansea this morning when NHS workers were allowed in early to do their shopping. All McDonald's restaurants across the UK and Ireland will close by 19:00 GMT on Monday 23 March. The fast food giant said the decision was ""not taken lightly"" and was made ""with the well-being and safety of our employees in mind, as well as in the best interests of our customers"". Cardiff Council is shutting a car park to the public to provide spaces for doctors, nurses and other NHS staff. Signs are going up in Heath Park saying the spaces can only be used by  staff at the nearby University Hospital of Wales. Council leader Huw Thomas said: âThese are unprecedented times and we want to do everything we can to help our colleagues in the NHS. ""We hope this will make things just a little easier for NHS staff who are doing a remarkable job trying to keep us all safe from this virus.â The Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) has called on Boris Johnson to quickly deliver his new support measures for the 5,000,000 self-employed people around the UK. FSB national chairman Mike Cherry said: âThese
are people who have worked hard to build up their businesses, paid their taxes
and helped the economy to grow. ""They now face a crunch point, with many unable
to operate â leaving them without money, but with bills still stacking up. âWe
have been strongly urging the government not to allow the self-employed to be
left high and dry, and it is welcome to hear the that the Prime Minister is
listening and offering new hope. ""This must now be turned urgently into
practical and easily accessible support. Time is now running out.""

In Ceredigion, the council has thanked the caravan and campsites which have closed following a ""high influx"" of visitors to the area. In a statement, it said: ""We
are aware that this will be a difficult decision for business owners. ""However,
itâs the right decision given that people staying at home in their own areas
will help reduce the spread of the virus and save lives."" We heard on Saturday from the leader of Anglesey council, who asked vistors to stay away during the coronavirus outbreak. Now the council says it's closing car parks, nature reserves and country parks on the island. The economic development member Carwyn Jones said: ""These are tough measures but it's essential we take them. ""We must act and stop visitors coming to the island with immediate effect."" he said. ""I am also urging local tourism and hospitality providers to close their premises to prevent the spread of coronavirus and help protect public health."" We've been talking about social distancing, so here's a reminder of what that means from the BBC's health reporter Laura Foster. This video can not be played Coronavirus UK: What is social distancing? From tomorrow until the end of April, Transport for Wales has announced there will be free travel for NHS workers. A spokesman added: âWe are doing
  all we can to keep vital services running, so that emergency service staff
  who are using our trains and key workers are to travel in safety with
  confidence.â A Welsh Government campaign on how to help people who are staying at home because of coronavirus has been launched. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: âIâve seen so many good things happening, from online choir groups to grocery deliveries, as people across Wales go out of their way to help others with their everyday needs. âCommunities have pulled together to support neighbours in this time of need. Today, weâre asking others to follow the shining example by doing their bit if theyâre able to.â Earlier, First Minister Mark Drakeford said that letters are being sent to 70,000 of Wales' ""most vulnerable people""advising them to stay indoors for 12 to 16 weeks. In his press briefing Prime Minister Boris Johnson said that such ""shielding"" measures - which will apply to around 1.5 million vulnerable people in England - will do more than many other measures to reduce the number of coronavirus cases in the UK. Onsocial distancing, Mr Johnson said that, while he wants people to enjoy outdoor spaces, people must follow the advice. ""Don't think that fresh air in itself provides some sort of immunity,"" he says. Homemade signs have been popping up across various parts of Wales. Here's one from Cemmaes Road in Powys.

He also encouraged people to stay at home and save lives. So what should you do if you go for a walk in a park and it is crowded? Prof Robert Dingwall, a sociologist from Nottingham Trent University who is advising the UK government, said problems occur when people cannot maintain the recommended two metre (6ft) separation. He says: ""If that is the case, then it probably is better to go home and pick a quieter time or a quieter location."" Dr Robin Thompson, an epidemiologist at Oxford University, added: ""The key thing is to exercise while minimising contacts. ""There are many walks all across the UK - so, where possible, individuals can research walks without main attractions such as viewpoints or other areas that represent likely gathering points for groups of people."" ""Local footpaths are likely to be less crowded than walks through major parks. And we can all try and maintain at least two metres distance between ourselves and others while out exercising.""

Coronavirus to shut India's busiest rail network,"Many passengers have been wearing masks while travelling on the network One of the world's busiest urban rail systems will be shut down for ordinary commuters from Monday morning to prevent the spread of coronavirus infection in Mumbai, one of India's most populous cities. Only government workers in ""essential services"" will be allowed to travel on a truncated service. This was waiting to happen. Consider this. Eight million people take Mumbai's crowded suburban train network every day. Packed to nearly three times its capacity, this is one of the busiest railway systems in the world. The 459km (285-mile) network is the lifeline of India's financial and entertainment capital, accounting for nearly 80% ofallcommuting trips in the populous western city. The suburban trains ""cover almost the distance up to [the] moon in one week,"" the network's website says. The 66-year-old network carries 60,000 passengers per km per day, the highest among all the leading commuter rail systems in the world, say officials. The coaches are sturdy enough to carry a ""super dense crush load"", a phrase coined by the railways to describe the intense crowding on Mumbai's trains. This means that a nine-car train designed for 1,800 standing passengers will often carry up to 7,000 passengers, according to Monisha Rajesh, author of Around India in 80 Trains. ""Mumbai's local trains were certainly not for the fainthearted,"" she wrote. Mumbai's suburban train network carries eight million passengers every day Now consider this. The western state of Maharashtra, of which Mumbai is the capital, has confirmed more than 60 coronavirus infections, the highest in India so far. Scores of long distance trains out of the city have been cancelled, but the suburban network has continued to rumble on, raising fears of the mass spread of the virus on these packed trains. The crowded service was an easy target of a terror attack in 2006 when serial blasts ripped though a number of trains. At least 180 people were killed and more than 800 injured - the high casualty figure was attributed to overcrowding. Indian cities go eerily quiet as virus cases rise What India can learn from 1918 flu to fight Covid-19 Is India prepared for a coronavirus outbreak? It is intuitively obvious thatthere's a link between commuting with a lot of people and catching respiratory diseases. During the 1918 Spanish flu pandemic, which killed some 18 million Indians, the railways ""played a prominent part [in aiding the spread of the disease] as was inevitable,"" according to an official report. ""From ports and landing places the local transport networks, particularly the railways, carried the virus from large cities to the smallest, remotest settlements,"" said a report on the spread of the flu in Britain in 1918-1919. So should one of the world's busiest rail networks be shut down to stop a possible spread of the virus in a city that many fear could turn into a coronavirus hotspot? Officials say ridership on the trains has dropped by 17% after the coronavirus scare Economists like Shruti Rajagopalan believe so. ""India is conducting the fewest tests per million at the moment. If the virus is truly within the community,  then given these two issues, the Mumbai outbreak cannot be contained and people will die without healthcare. ""Mumbai trains are the fastest and surest way to spread the virus (if it is within the community) to the densest parts of the city,"" she told me. There is enough precedent: China stopped trains, ferries, planes and buses from leaving the city of Wuhan; and on Thursday, London officials announced that up to40 stations on the London Underground network are to be shutas the city attempts to contain the outbreak. Others are not so sure about linking the spread of a pandemic to public transport systems.One study,externaldoes not support the effectiveness of suspending mass urban transport systems to reduce or slow down a pandemic because, ""whatever the relevance of public transport is to individual-level risk, household exposure most likely poses a greater threat"". ""I have not seen any data on the relative risk of public transportation compared with [dense places like] workplaces or schools,"" Timothy Brewer, a professor of epidemiology at the University of California Los Angeles toldVox.com,external. He said data from China suggested that ""household contact was an important means of transmission outside of Wuhan, suggesting that prolonged contact [with a sick person] increases the risk of transmission"". ""If correct, then the time spent commuting and the density of people commuting could be important factors in assessing if public transportation is a risk factor for the disease's transmission."" Trains on the network are being scrubbed clean to avoid the spread of infection Shivaji Sutar, a senior communications officer of the railways, told me that the network was running an aggressive campaign to ease the rush: awareness announcements, posters and videos containing virus information. They were also monitoring crowds, scrubbing the trains, taking the temperature of willing passengers and embarking on a drive against public spitting, he said. A combination of awareness and panic has already led to a 27% drop in traffic on the network. But millions of people continue to take the train to work and home every day. ""This is more because of fear than anything else. Most of us have to take the network because we have to come to work. There is still no government directive to all companies to work from home. And apart from passengers wearing masks, I haven't seen any other precautions being taken,"" Rekha Hodge, who has been using the network for three decades, told me. That is bad news.

Australian PM warns of lockdowns to tackle coronavirus,"Bondi Beach was closed after large crowds flouted social distancing advice Australia is shutting down non-essential services as coronavirus cases rise rapidly in the country. Pubs, clubs, gyms, cinemas and places of worship will be shut from midday on Monday, while restaurants and cafes will have to switch to takeaway only. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the restrictions after a national cabinet meeting. The number of cases in Australia has risen sharply in recent days, reaching 1,315. New South Wales (NSW), home to Sydney, is the worst-affected state with 533 confirmed cases. Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, has 296 cases, while Queensland has 259. The new restrictions will see many businesses close but supermarkets, petrol stations, pharmacies and home delivery services will continue running. The prime minister said he wanted to keep schools open but parents would be able to keep their children at home if they wished to do so.

MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash Seven people have died across Australia so far from Covid-19. The new measures come after large crowds gathered on Sydney's beaches including Bondi on Saturday, flouting social distancing advice.

But he added: ""We are not putting in place lockdowns that put people in and confine them to their homes. ""That is not a measure that has been contemplated at this point.""

It was a balmy Sunday evening and people were out at bars and restaurants perhaps unaware that this would be their last drink outside their homes for a while. The measures are likely to hit Australians hard, and shock many out of the lethargy they've felt towards social distancing. State restrictions had already ramped up this past week, as the case numbers doubled every few days. However, many Australians haven't been paying attention to the statistics. Instead, discussion has often centred around disruption to daily life - the inconvenience and tedium of working from home; the panic buying at supermarkets. While some - closely attuned to the crisis in the US and Europe - have been vigilantly isolating, others have been resistant to the message ""stay at home"". It's why a blast of late summer heat on Friday drew so many out to Bondi Beach - the social isolation mantra hasn't sunk in yet. There's been little public education campaigning, and the constantly changing messaging from the government hasn't helped. It was only 10 days ago that the prime minister blithely said he'd still attend a rugby game, minutes after banning large gatherings outside. He later changed his decision. Australia had fewer than 200 cases then, it now has over 1,300. The prime minister earlier on Sunday announced a second stimulus package worth A$66bn, meaning the total financial package offered by the government and Reserve Bank now amounts to A$189bn (Â£94bn, $109bn). Mr Morrison said financial support would be offered to those most vulnerable to the effects of the coronavirus crisis. The measures include doubling income support for those on Jobseeker's allowance while waiving asset tests and waiting periods.

In a video address,external, First and Deputy First Ministers Arlene Foster and Michelle O'Neill said this year's celebrations would have to be very different. ""Everyone loves their mummy. I know that I do,"" said Ms O'Neill. ""And on Mother's Day, we normally make a big effort to spoil them and spend time with them. ""This year we are asking you not to put your mummy or anyone else's mummy at risk. Please maintain the social distancing the Public Health Agency have asked you to do."" Ms Cullen was speaking after a two-hour meeting with Ms O'Neill at the Royal College of Nursing's NI HQ in south Belfast. The nurse also said proper safety equipment and masks for staff were needed urgently. Ms O'Neill echoed the remarks on testing and equipment.

Australian PM warns of lockdowns to tackle coronavirusScott Morrison said people must take social distancing seriously after crowds flocked to Bondi Beach.Australia,"Bondi Beach was closed after large crowds flouted social distancing advice Australia is shutting down non-essential services as coronavirus cases rise rapidly in the country. Pubs, clubs, gyms, cinemas and places of worship will be shut from midday on Monday, while restaurants and cafes will have to switch to takeaway only. Prime Minister Scott Morrison announced the restrictions after a national cabinet meeting. The number of cases in Australia has risen sharply in recent days, reaching 1,315. New South Wales (NSW), home to Sydney, is the worst-affected state with 533 confirmed cases. Victoria, of which Melbourne is the capital, has 296 cases, while Queensland has 259. The new restrictions will see many businesses close but supermarkets, petrol stations, pharmacies and home delivery services will continue running. The prime minister said he wanted to keep schools open but parents would be able to keep their children at home if they wished to do so. ""I don't want to see our children lose an entire year of their education,"" he said. Some states, including Victoria, have signalled that they want to close schools.

'Don't forget those without access to technology',"Video calls may be an important way of keeping in touch in coming weeks From fitness classes to singing lessons, online pubs to yoga, social interaction has gone digital with the coronavirus pandemic. But a charity has warned thousands of people risk being left isolated and forgotten if they struggle to keep up. Nearly a fifth of the UK population is estimated to have no access to a smartphone or laptop. The Campaign to End Loneliness says older people and those with impairments are particularly at risk of isolation. It fears this ""digital divide"" will leave many without meaningful or regular interaction as they are forced to limit face-to-face interaction to try and slow the spread of Covid-19. ""The assumption that we've all got smartphone and we've all got laptops is just not true and that can leave behind a lot of older people,"" said Daniel Pattison from the campaign. ""There's 79% of us using smartphones but that leaves a massive proportion of adults in the UK without access to WhatsApp and Twitter and all those things that younger people rely on to keep in touch."" Some elderly users may have felt pressured to adopt the technology ""This is going to be a really challenging time for a lot of people."" ""A lot of us are going to go without face-to-face contact that is really important to us."" Coronavirus has seen a steep rise in the number of social activities being taken online, many for the first time ever. EASY STEPS:How to keep safe A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms?

""We've got a team of trainers here that are coming up with ideas to keep people active, it is a tough time at the moment, but what we are definitely doing is giving content to people who are self isolating."" Singing lessons, yoga classes and book shops are also among groups who have taken to using video conferencing to engage with customers and, in many cases, keep their business going. Some too have turned their love of visiting the local into a digital experience. David Chriswick from Swansea has formed a digital pub from his living room in his new home in Chicago, USA. This video can not be played David Chriswick from Swansea has his own online pub from his new home in Chicago With quiz nights, live music and stand up comedy - all via the medium of video conferencing from the performers home - people have been brought together from across the world, united by a need for social interaction.
