Kim Jong-un accused of begging for war,"This video can not be played US ambassador Nikki Haley: ""Kim Jong-un is begging for war"" North Korean leader Kim Jong-un is ""begging for war"" with his latest and most powerful nuclear bomb test, the US envoy to the United Nations has said. Nikki Haley told an emergency meeting of the Security Council in New York that the US did not want a war but its patience was ""not unlimited"". The US will table a new UN resolution shortly to toughen sanctions. However, Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday called sanctions ""useless, ineffective and exhausted"". China, the North's main ally, has called for a return to negotiations and Switzerland has offered to mediate. Meanwhile South Korea's navy carried out live-fire naval drills on Tuesday, warning that if the North provoked them ""we will immediately hit back and bury them at sea"", reportedYonhap news agency.,external It comes a day after the South's military simulated a missile attack on the North's nuclear test site. What do we know about N Korea's nuclear site? How do you defend against North Korea? How should Trump handle North Korea? Reports suggest the North is preparing new test missile launches. On Sunday, it tested a bomb underground, which was thought to have a power range from 50 kilotonnes to 120 kilotonnes. A 50kt device would be about three times the size of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. In other developments: German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would press for tougher EU sanctions on North Korea, agreeing with US President Donald Trump by phone on the need for stricter measures Japan is planning, in the event of war, for a mass evacuation of nearly 60,000 Japanese citizens currently living in or visiting South Korea,Nikkei Asian Review reports,external Ms Haley argued that only the strongest sanctions would enable the problem to be resolved through diplomacy. Recent photos show North Korean leader Kim Jong-un (centre) inspecting a bomb ""War is never something the United States wants,"" she said. ""We don't want it now but our country's patience is not unlimited."" China's envoy to the UN, Liu Jieyi, reiterated a call for all sides to return to negotiations. ""The peninsula issue must be resolved peacefully,"" he said. ""China will never allow chaos and war on the peninsula."" Speaking in Berne, Swiss President Doris Leuthard pointed to her country and Sweden's long record in neutral and discreet diplomacy. ""I think it really is time for dialogue,"" she said. ""We are ready to offer our role for good services as a mediator. I think in the upcoming weeks a lot will depend on how the US and China can have an influence in this crisis."" By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent China is key but it is a conflicted party. On the one hand it does not want to see a nuclear-armed North Korea and it has made its view clear to Pyongyang on many occasions. However, it does not want to see the North Korean regime swept away. This would result in millions of refugees flooding into China and would probably result in a unified Korea very much in the US orbit. This is seen in Beijing as worse than having a difficult nuclear neighbour. If China were to take the view that the coincidence of a rapidly advancing North Korean nuclear programme and the uncertainties of the Trump administration's diplomatic capabilities means that there is a very real risk of misunderstanding and catastrophe, then maybe it might bring much greater pressure to bear on Pyongyang. North Korea is a very isolated country and China is both its major ally and economic prop. There is a lot more that China can do. North Korea's recent testing has been as much an embarrassment to China as it has angered the US. But the Chinese have a difficult diplomatic calculation to make. Read Jonathan's analysis in full Last month,the Security Council voted unanimously to ban North Korean exports and limit investmentsin the country. Ms Haley did not spell out what additional measures might be taken but diplomats have suggested an oil embargo would have a crippling effect. There could also be a ban on the North's national airline, curbs on North Koreans working abroad, and asset freezes and travel bans on officials. On Tuesday, South Korean Foreign Minister Kang Kyung-wha said after a conversation with her Chinese counterpart that she believed Beijing ""could be open to more sanctions"". But Mr Putin, speaking at a summit in China, said sanctions were ""useless"" as they would never force North Korea to give up its nuclear weapons. He also condemned what he called the ramping up of ""military hysteria"", saying it could lead to ""global catastrophe"". He said: ""We need to promote international law and dialogue. There is no alternative to a diplomatic solution."" It was North Korea's sixth nuclear test to date. The US Geological Survey recorded a resulting tremor at 6.3 magnitude.

Kim inspects 'nuclear warhead': A picture decoded 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues China mutes discussion of North Korea bomb South Korea said it was now presumed that the North had reduced its nuclear warhead in size to below 500kg, and would be able to attach one to an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). But analysts have said the North's claims about miniaturisation should be treated with considerable caution. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? Earlier on Monday, a South Korean defence ministry official said there were signs of ""possibly more ballistic missile launches"", including an ICBM. What's at North Korea's nuclear site? Can we work out the power of the tested bomb? Monday's drills simulated the targeting of the Punggye-ri nuclear site in Kilju County, where North Korea carried out its bomb test. Missiles were fired from the ground and rockets from fighter jets. This video can not be played South Korea carries out live-fire drills in response to the nuclear test Seoul has said there will be more live-fire drills this month, as well as a naval battle group training exercise and a joint anti-submarine warfare exercise with the US. South Korea and the US have also agreed after talks to scrap a warhead weight limit on the South's missiles, which are currently capped at 500kg (1,100lb). The defence ministry in Seoul also told parliament the US would seek to deploy a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to seas off the Korean peninsula. Four more launchers of theUS Thaad (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence) missile defence system- strongly opposed by China and Russia - would also be deployed to join two already at a site in Seongju, south of Seoul.

Bell Pottinger expelled from trade body,"James Henderson has resigned as chief executive of Bell Pottinger Bell Pottinger has been expelled from the UK public relations trade body for its work on a controversial contract in South Africa. It is the first time that the Public Relations and Communications Association (PRCA) has ejected a PR firm as prominent as Bell Pottinger. PRCA director-general Francis Ingham said it was ""highly questionable"" whether the firm would survive. Bell Pottinger said it ""accepts that there are lessons need to be learned"". The PR firm's work on a campaign for Oakbay Capital, a South African company owned by the wealthy Gupta family, had ""incited racial hatred"" and was ""absolutely unthinkable"", Mr Ingham said. He expected more clients to abandon Bell Pottinger following the sanction. South Africa's opposition Democratic Alliance complained to the PRCA, accusing Bell Pottinger of a ""hateful and divisive campaign to divide South Africa along the lines of race"". Listen: Bell Pottinger's role in South African politics The campaign emphasised the power of white-owned businesses and used the #WhiteMonopolyCapital hashtag. South African President Jacob Zuma has faced corruption allegations and suspicion over his ties with the Guptas. Mr Zuma and the Guptas have consistently denied all allegations. South African President Jacob Zuma is attending a BRICS summit in China this week Chief executive James Henderson resignedahead of the five-year expulsion from the PRCA. His departure was ""necessary, but not sufficient"", Mr Ingham said. ""Bell Pottinger has brought the PR and communications industry into disrepute with its actions, and it has received the harshest possible sanctions,"" he added. The firm was found to have breached two clauses of the PRCA's professional charter and two clauses of its public affairs and lobbying code of conduct. The law firm Herbert Smith Freehills was commissioned by Bell Pottinger to conduct an internal review following the Oakbay controversy. Its review, released on Monday,criticised the PR firm's senior management: ""Bell Pottinger senior management should have known that the campaign was at risk of causing offence, including on grounds of race. ""In such circumstances, BP ought to have exercised extreme care and should have closely scrutinised the creation of content for the campaign. This does not appear to have happened."" Herbert Smith also found that certain material created by Bell Pottinger for the economic emancipation campaign ""was negative or targeted towards wealthy white South African individuals or corporates and/or was potentially racially divisive and/or potentially offensive and was created in breach of relevant ethical principles"". PR firm failed in 'race hate' campaign Will 'the Zuptas' fall in South Africa? This video can not be played Bell Pottinger's founder, Lord Bell, tells Newsnight the PR firm is unlikely to survive In a statement Bell Pottinger said it ""acknowledges the PRCA ruling, accepts that there are lessons to be learned but disputes the basis on which the ruling was made"". It added: ""The overwhelming majority of our partners and employees played no part in the Oakbay Capital account and have not been accused of breaching the PRCA code. Many of them will now consider applying for individual membership. ""With the Herbert Smith Freehills findings made publicly available and the PRCA ruling published, the business can refocus on delivering outstanding work for our clients and looking after our people."" Bell Pottinger has already lost clients over the affair, including luxury goods company Richemont and investment firm Investec. The further reputational damage could see other clients sever their ties. On Tuesday, Labour peer Peter Hain was due to table questions in the House of Lords asking if Bell Pottinger's actions contravened any UK trade policies. The PR firm, founded by Lord Tim Bell, was closely associated with Margaret Thatcher and the Conservative Party in the 1980s. Speaking on Newsnight on Monday, Lord Bell, who resigned from Bell Pottinger last year, said the PRCA report marked a ""disappointing"" day for the company. He stood down, he told Newsnight, because it had been wrong to take on the Oakbay account. Lord Bell denied accusations he played a role in securing the business. Bell Pottinger has gone on to accept contracts from many controversial clients, including former South African president FW de Klerk, when he opposed Nelson Mandela; Asma al-Assad, the wife of Syrian president Bashir al-Assad; arms manufacturer BAE Systems; and the South African athlete Oscar Pistorius after he was charged with murder.

Barnier seeks to clarify Brexit remarks,"The EU's chief negotiator met Ireland's foreign minister on Monday Michel Barnier has clarified remarks he is reported to have made about Brexit. The EU negotiator was quoted as saying he saw the process as an opportunity to ""teach"" the British people and others what leaving the single market means. Mr Barnier said he actually told a meeting it ""was an occasion of great explanation for everyone in the EU"". The BBC understands he was talking in Italy about explaining the benefits of the single market to a broad European audience, not just specifically the UK. The latest round of negotiations over the UK's exit from the EU concluded last week, with the two sides due to officially meet again later this month. Mark Mardell: Lakeside lesson on leaving the EU UK 'looking to intensify Brexit talks' Brexit: All you need to know The UK, which is keen to move on from issues directly related to its withdrawal to talk about its future relationship with the EU, has said it would like to ""intensify"" the pace of talks, with Downing Street saying it is open to holding negotiations on a rolling basis. There has been unconfirmed speculation that Prime Minister Theresa May is to make a major speech on Brexit later this month in the run-up to the Conservative Party conference. Speaking at a conference in Italy on Saturday, Mr Barnier said he did not want to punish the UK for voting to leave the EU in last year's referendum. But he reportedly warned that ""there are extremely serious consequences of leaving the single market and it hasn't been explained to the British people"". ""We intend to teach peopleâ¦ what leaving the single market means,"" he reportedly told the Ambrosetti forum. Responding to the remarks, a No 10 spokesman said ""the British people have heard those arguments."" Mr Barnier tweeted on Monday that what he had said was that Brexit was an ""occasion to explain single market benefits in all countries, including my own"". He added ""we do not want to ""educate"" or ""teach lessons"". The former French minister, who met the Irish Republic's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney for talks on Monday, later reiterated these comments when speaking to a BBC reporter outside the European Parliament. Amid growing tensions between the two sides about the progress of talks and the priority given to different issues, a senior EU official has said talks about the UK's financial obligations after Brexit are going backwards. Gunther Oettinger, the European Commissioner responsible for the EU budget, said ""the Brits have to accept that their obligations are going beyond March 2019"". ""In July we had been thinking 'yes, they are on the way to accept it'. Now in the last few days they are coming back,"" he told a technology conference in Brussels. BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said Mr Oettinger had told him he believed that progress made on the issue in the July round of talks had been reversed during last week's session. A source at the Department for Exiting the EU said it did not recognise this description and that there had been a robust debate about money. Last week British officials gave a three-hour long presentation on the legal basis of the EU's request for a Brexit financial settlement.

Nine things you didn't know were invented by women,"Asked to name important inventors and you might start with Thomas Edison, Alexander Graham Bell or Leonardo da Vinci. But what about Mary Anderson? Or Ann Tsukamoto? You might not know their names, but they are just two of the female inventors behind everyday objects and scientific innovations. BBC 100 Women, the season featuring stories of inspiring and influential women, is taking on a new challenge. This year, women from around the world will be asked to come up with innovations to tackle some of the biggest problems they face. Scroll down for more information about 100 Women - and, for more inspiration, here are nine inventions we wouldn't have, if it weren't for ground-breaking women. After joining the US Navy during the Second World War, Rear Admiral Grace Hopper was assigned to work on a new computer, called the Mark 1. It wasn't long before she was at the forefront of computer programming in the 1950s. She wasbehind the compiler, which could translate instructions into code that computers can read, making programming quicker and ultimately revolutionising how computers worked. Hopper also helped popularised the term ""de-bugging"" that we still use on computers programmes today, after a moth was removed from inside her machine. ""Amazing Grace"", as she was known, continued working with computers until she retired from the navy as its oldest serving officer, aged 79. Dr Shirley Ann Jackson is an American theoretical physicist, whose research from the 1970s is responsible for caller ID and call waiting. Her breakthroughs in telecommunications have also enabled others to invent the portable fax, fibre optic cables and solar cells. She is the first African-American woman to gain a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the first African-American woman to lead a top-ranked research university. On a winter's day of 1903, Mary Anderson was visiting New York City when she noticed that her driver was forced to open his window, just to the clear the snow from his windscreen. Every time the window was open, the passengers in the car got colder. Anderson started drawing her solution of a rubber blade that could be moved from inside the car, and in 1903 was awarded a patent for her device. But the invention proved unsuccessful with car companies, who believed it would distract drivers. Anderson never profited from her invention, even when the wipers later became standard on cars. It might not have the catchiest name on this list, but the long cycle-life nickel-hydrogen battery has helped power the International Space Station, so it's pretty important. Olga D Gonzalez-Sanabria, who is originally from Puerto Rico, developed technology which helped create these batteries in the 1980s and is now director of engineering at Nasa's Glenn Research Centre. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year. In 2017, we're challenging them to tackle four of the biggest problems facing women today - the glass ceiling, female illiteracy, harassment in public spaces and sexism in sport. With your help, they'll be coming up with real-life solutions and we want you to get involved with your ideas. Find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,externaland use #100Women A frequent entertainer, Cochrane wanted a machine that would wash her dishes faster than her servants, and be less likely to break them. Her machine, which involved a motor turning a wheel inside a copper boiler, was the first automatic dishwasher to use water pressure. Cochrane's alcoholic husband had left her with masses of debt after his death and this motivated her to patent her invention in 1886 and open her own production factory. A nurse, who was often home alone, Marie Van Brittan Brown came up with an idea that would make her feel safer. Together with her husband Albert, Van Brittan Brown developed the first home security system in response to the rising crime rates and slow police responses of the 1960s. The device was complicated, with a camera powered by a motor which moved up and down the door to look through a peephole. A monitor in her bedroom also came equipped with an alarm button. Her patent was awarded in 1991 and since then Tsukamoto's work has led to great advancements in understanding the blood systems of cancer patients, which could lead to a cure for the disease. Tsukamoto is currently conducting further research into stem cell growth and is the co-patentee on more than seven other inventions. This chemist invented the lightweight fibre used in bullet-proof vests and body armour. Since her discovery in 1965, the material, which is five times stronger than steel, has saved lives and is used by millions every day. It's found in products ranging from household gloves and mobiles phones to aeroplanes and suspension bridges. A man named Charles Darrow is often credited with creating the most popular board game in history, but the rules were in fact invented by Elizabeth Magie. Magie wanted todemonstrate the problems with capitalismwith an innovative game in which players traded fake money and property. Her design, which she patented in 1904, was called The Landlord's Game. The game of Monopoly that we know today was published in 1935 by the Parker Brothers, who discovered that Darrow was not the sole creator and had, for just $500 (Â£385), bought Magie's patent and, well, monopolised the game.

Football's best-connected hidden 'player',"Barcelona were crowned International Champions Cup winners after defeating Real Madrid US soccer promoter Charlie Stillitano has been called many things in the past 18 months or so - with ""power broker"" and ""mogul"" among the more flattering descriptions of the ebullient New Yorker. On the downside, for his apparent suggestion that a European super league might be an idea worth talking about, he has been called ""a poster boy for greed"" and even ""a corporate goblin"". Stillitano is the executive chairman of Relevant Sports, which organises the International Champions Cup, an annual summer tournament held mainly across the US - although other countries also host matches - featuring the world's top football clubs. But it was for organising a meeting of executives from Manchester United, Manchester City, Liverpool, Arsenal and Chelsea - where they discussed the possibility of restructuring the Uefa Champions League - that he found himself in the firing line. How pre-season has become a money spinner Man Utd boss against a European super league ""It was not our [Relevant's] intention to be a stalking horse for the creation of a European Super League, that was never the intention,"" he tells me. ""I would never advocate a closed-shop Champions League or any closed European league. I know it sounds cliched but I was misquoted, or rather I was asked a question about whether closed leagues can ever work. Stillitano has been a football fan since his childhood days in the 1960s ""And in some circumstances they can - look at NFL American football, one of the most successful leagues in the world. But I know that closed leagues are anathema in Europe."" The 57-year-old says discussions about the format of European football first emerged because clubs came to him and asked if the Champions Cup could become more than just a pre-season event, and be put on a more official footing. Stillitano says he got sucked into a Champions League controversy inadvertently ""So things were coming about more as a reaction to teams approaching us,"" he says. ""We caused a stir unintentionally. And clubs are still coming up to us. ""Anyway, the big European clubs ended up cutting new commercial and sporting deals, including the changes at Uefa with the Champions League,"" he adds, referring to the deal where bigger nations such as England are guaranteed more places. Stillitano's partner in the International Champions Cup is US billionaire and Miami Dolphins American football team owner, Stephen Ross. Indeed, he says it is Ross's lack of a traditional soccer background that has enabled him to put together some of the bigger Champions Cup matches. Miami Dolphins owner Stephen Ross has helped bankroll the International Champions Cup ""We brokered the biggest game, the Real Madrid v Barcelona Clasico, in Miami this summer,"" he says. ""Steve Ross has the advantage of not being a massive soccer follower, so he just said 'let's get it' without even considering it might not be possible. ""From the beginning Mr Ross and his business partner Matt Higgins could see there was something out there, a huge untapped soccer market. Five English clubs took part in the 2017 event ""The Champions Cup sits in a nice pre-season niche. It gives us the opportunity to own the month of pre-season, and build a viable business. ""We get to show the best players in the world, and they are able to perform in a relaxed atmosphere without the the pressure of a regular season game.  It allows the teams to build for their seasons."" The tournament has just completed its fifth year, with Ross investing roughly $100m over the period since 2013. ""We are making money out of it, we have turned the financial corner, I think the investment has paid off,"" says Stillitano. Stillitano says the Champions Cup is creating a new generation of US soccer fans ""I know it is not a Champions League or regular season games. But the fans love it and lots of cities and clubs would live to have Champions Cup games to host. ""We are helping to cultivate the new US soccer fan. The biggest crowd ever for a Manchester United v Real Madrid game was in America this summer. Clearly we have something that has caught the imagination of the US sporting public."" Stillitano's favourite player is Gianni Rivera of AC Milan (extreme left, back row) Son of Italian parents from Calabria Grew up watching Italian and German football on cable TV AC Milan fan, favourite player was 1970s star Gianni Rivera First English game: Leicester City v Aston Villa in March 1976 Director of Giants Stadium at the 1994 World Cup In 1996 became general manager of MLS team New York/New Jersey MetroStars (later Red Bulls) Set up Champions World series of games in the US featuring major European teams in the 2000s Friends with Sir Alex Ferguson and Jose Mourinho Stillitano says the next step is to make the event more of an entertainment property. ""We saw it for the first time in Miami with the Clasico,"" he says.  ""We had legends games, concerts, activities for kids. That is something we want to expand, make it a fun day out, not just the match. The NFL Super Bowl is currently the only event that gets that mix right. Singapore hosted three Champions Cup games this summer, including Chelsea v Inter Milan ""The next part is also to attract more cities to take part - Singapore is a good example of a city that has come on board with us."" Games have also been held in England, Italy, Spain, Canada, Mexico and China; Mr Stillitano says there is interest in Argentina, Brazil, the Middle East, and South Africa. ""It is good for the economies of host cities,"" he says. ""Three quarters of the people who came to the Miami Clasico were from out of state. And there were 70,000 at the game, and 40,000 at the training sessions."" Fifa took over the former Intercontinental Cup/Toyota Cup So, does this growth signal that the Champions Cup is indeed ripe for becoming a part of the official football calendar? ""Different people own different football spaces... but things change,"" he says. ""Look at how Fifa decided they wanted to take over the old Intercontinental Cup, and moved in on it. ""However, are we going to morph into something more official? I don't think so."" Two-tier system And on the subject of competitions morphing into something else, Stillitano has a final riposte for those who accused him of trying to set up a closed-shop European league. ""I think we are already in danger of creating a closed league, through financial fair play,"" he says, referring to Uefa rules which generally mean clubs can only spend what they make, and break even. PSG are emerging as one of clutch of super-wealthy European teams ""It means there are five, six, clubs that are wealthy enough to dominate the Champions League over the next 20 years - the likes of Paris Saint Germain, Manchester City, Barcelona, Real Madrid, Bayern Munich. ""A Celtic or Ajax will never win the cup again, while the likes of AC Milan, Atletico Madrid, Juventus, and other historic big names are condemned to almost second tier status."" He laughs: ""But I am the one who got all the trouble and criticism!""

Merkel holds ground in election debate,"Media polls after the broadcast put Angela Merkel ahead in the run up to the 24 September vote This was supposed to be the highlight of a lacklustre election campaign. For months German Chancellor Angela Merkel's conservatives have enjoyed a significant lead over their nearest rival - and current coalition partner. The TV stations prepared their viewers for an impassioned, furious debate. But those hoping for rhetorical bloody noses were disappointed. As were the viewers hoping that Martin Schulz, who is unlikely to take Mrs Merkel's crown, might at least taste victory on national TV. Angela Merkel has been in the job for 12 years, and it showed. The chancellor is not known for her skilful oratory and she doesn't relish this kind of public debate. Nevertheless, Mrs Merkel appeared relaxed, credible and experienced, effortlessly parrying her opponent's attacks. It was her best debate performance, according to the German news site Spiegel online. Which doesn't say much, given that she lost the first three. But then Martin Schulz was always going to struggle to land a blow. It is tricky, for example, to attack Mrs Merkel's refugee policy when you are on record as having said that the faith in Europe that each migrant brought with them is worth more than gold. This video can not be played Germany's election: What you need to know During the election campaign, Mr Schulz has focused on social justice; a subject to which he returned on Sunday night. He spoke about unemployment, poverty. Mrs Merkel batted both away. Five million people were unemployed when she began her first term - the figure is now at two and a half million. As for poverty, Mr Schulz's own party was responsible for the Harz IV welfare reforms that shape German social policy today. Under Mr Schulz's leadership, the social democrats are promising tax cuts. But Mrs Merkel's conservatives, who have a habit of stealing the best bits of a rival campaign, are offering similar breaks. Martin Schulz stakes anti-populist bid Angela Merkel: Germany's shrewd survivor Which left foreign policy. Mr Schulz was on bullish form. Donald Trump, he said, had brought the world to the brink of disaster several times with his tweets. It was time the world sought a solution to the North Korea crisis without President Trump, he said. And, as for Turkey, were he the German chancellor he would call off EU accession talks. Mr Schulz challenged Mrs Merkel to do just that. Mrs Merkel - who has never wanted Turkey to become an EU member - said she had ruled out that course of action for now. Nevertheless, she said, she would speak with other EU leaders to see whether they could develop a common position on ending the talks. Dramatic language, but Mrs Merkel could draw on years of crisis management. Her rather more measured language and approach appears to have appealed to viewers. Polls suggest they found her more believable and convincing. Before the TV duel, Mr Schulz said that he was confident his performance would sway undecided voters and create momentum. It is unlikely to be in the direction he intended.

A lakeside lesson on leaving the EU,"It's a pretty place for some very hard talking by the EU's man in charge of Brexit talks. The stately hotel the Villa d'Este, on the shores of magnificent Lake Como replete with baroque chandeliers, statues of nymphs and marble columns is not a hard sell. No wonder former prime ministers, current ministers, US senators and European commissioners are happy to mingle under the watchful eye of the dozens of varieties of Italian police, some complete with sabres and tall plumed hats, at this high powered forum of the Italian think tank Ambrosetti - The European House. They are the European elite - and feel their project is in remission. Over the weekend there's been torrential rain and thunder but now Lake Como's waters are only slightly choppy - a timely European metaphor. This time last year, the subject for discussion here was the possibility of the disintegration of the EU. Brexit and Trump were feared as harbingers of nationalists taking power across Europe. It didn't happen in the Netherlands. Then it didn't happen in France. Now they are sure it won't happen in Germany this autumn and fairly confident it won't happen next spring in Italy either. The mood could be best summed us as 'phew!' Perhaps the tone was set by one prominent guest who, in a voice full of passion, spoke of the EU as the greatest experiment in history - a club which ensured peace and prosperity. His voice rising, with an orator's power, he said he was born in the 1970s and had known only peace. But his father was a child of the 1930s - he remembered war, remembered American soldiers bringing the new tastes of freedom and chocolate to a ravaged continent. His grandfather too had known war, and his great-grandfather, and his great-great-grand father. That was why now he said Europe was a synonym for peace. Barnier vows to 'educate' UK over Brexit PM appeals to backbench Tories over repeal bill In this telling of the story the UK had only a bit part, hardly mentioned except as one of the issues still haunting the Continent: the refugee crisis, the legacy of economic crisis, terrorism and Brexit. This view from the lakeside goes a long way to explain the position of the conference's star turn, the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier. His purpose at the conference was, seemingly, not to rile British politicians or throw some red meat to the British press, but instead to start building a solid foundation for the EU for life after Brexit, to put the past behind it, to make it a singular earthquake not the remaking of an entire landscape. His opening statement was not the most newsworthy but central to his purpose. He said his first principle was that the future of Europe is more important than Brexit. Far more important. Michel Barnier said he wanted to teach the British people and others what leaving the EU means Indeed that appears to be the view of most EU leaders, that Britain - having made a rather strange decision - must go now and try not to slam the door. Although the EU is often portrayed in the UK as a monolith run by faceless bureaucrats,  actually policy is usually a fudge between the competing interests of left and right, West and East, small and large, North and South and so on. The unity over Brexit is fairly remarkable and Mr Barnier will hold tight to his mandate to make sure it does not shatter. He's also well aware that while French and Dutch voters didn't go the whole hog, the hard right strengthened its position and those very critical of the EU consensus are in power in Poland and Hungary. He said that any adverse impact on the UK is not a punishment in itself but a logical consequence of decisions made by the British voters and subsequently by the British government, and he intends to educate people about that. This position has two parts. One, being out of the EU cannot be as good as being in the club. And secondly, the separate choice to leave the single market has even more consequences. On free trade, Mr Barnier said the 60 or so such deals negotiated by the EU in the past were a result of a slow process of countries converging, coming together, with the EU. Some in the UK argue that means a free trade deal for us should be easy - as we have been converged for decades.  Mr Barnier said that is not the point - the UK has deliberately chosen now to diverge after 40 years together and the EU needs to know how wide the new gap will get. Does it imply breaching rules of the single market about workers' rights? Environmental standards? Undercutting tax costs? Will a deal for Toyota mean a break with state aid rules? He wants guarantees that won't happen. Mr Barnier said he wanted to teach the British people and others what leaving the single market means, hence his reference to being a teacher, a pedagogue. It was notable that he singled out one person by name, the leader of the Eurosceptic, right-wing Dutch Freedom Party, Geert Wilders, who wants the Netherlands to follow the UK out of the EU. He said the ""education"" was for him and those of a similar mind. Dutch Euro-sceptic Geert Wilders, had some choice words for Mr Barnier I asked Mr Wilders what he made of this. ""Mr Barnier who is, of course, a person I respect, is talking a lot of nonsense,"" he said. ""I am a politician and I asked a British institution to make a survey about what would happen if the Dutch would leave the EU. They came up with a result which proved it would hurt, like it is hurting Britain in the short term, but in the long run after three or 4 years our GDP would grow by more than 10%. There are many chances so Mr Barnier will have to look in the mirror if he wants an education."" But Mr Barnier is probably the sort of man who only looks in the mirror with a certain sense of satisfaction. Using the contents of their well coiffured grey heads, few in the EU leadership want a bad relationship with the UK. They want a firm foundation for a good and inevitably close alliance. But both their hearts and their heads tell them anything that encourages further fracture of a project that is still very fragile, anything that looks like suggesting leaving the EU is a primrose path rather than a road to possible perdition, is a non-starter. Michel Barnier concluded by pointing out again that he was, like Theresa May, a walker, a mountaineer used to taking one step after another, watching out for problems but always with his eyes fixed on the peaks. The EU is determined that it will not stumble just because one member of the team is giving up on getting to the summit, particularly when it thinks that member never really believed in the sunny uplands in the first place.

Town targeted by city drug gangs,"Suffolk Police said children were acting as ""runners"" to deliver drugs Drug-related gang violence in a Suffolk town has created a ""perfect storm"" involving children as young as 12, says a report. The University of Suffolk's study found Ipswich had been targeted by London drug gangs. ""Violence, threats and coercion were used routinely by these groups to exert control over vulnerable children and young people,"" the report said. Suffolk Police said children were acting as ""runners"" to deliver drugs. The report, commissioned by the county council, also said children and young people reported missing in London had been found at Suffolk addresses known to be used for Class A drug dealing. The study was conducted by the University of Suffolk It said Jubilee Park, a deprived area of Ipswich, had been targeted by the gangs with addicts' homes being taken over as bases for drug dealers. Intelligence from the police also suggested the gangs were storing weapons at dealing locations and arming runners with knives. ""This kind of violence was evident in other parts of Suffolk where the illicit drug market was saturated and competition between dealers was fierce,"" the report said. One of the authors of the report, Paul Andell, said the rise in drug gang violence could be due to the drop in police numbers and cuts to public services. ""There's a perception that they (criminals) will not be dealt with as robustly (by local police),"" he said.  ""All of these factors create a perfect storm."" Junior Smart, a former Ipswich gang member, who is now a youth worker with the St Giles Trust, said all the agencies involved with the prevention of crime and young people needed to communicate better. ""The agencies aren't talking to each other - in some respects the agencies are more territorial than the gangs are,"" he said. Suffolk's Assistant Chief Constable Rachel Kearton said the police and crime commissioner had put a huge amount of money to help young people stay out of gangs, ""six-figure numbers that allow these kids to actually have a better chance in life"". ""We're investing in the young people for their future to find ways for them to live their lives rather than getting into the drugs world.""

Did 'terrorist hunter' cause Dutch alert?,"Friends of the suspect say he struck up a conversation with a man he believed to be a jihadist based in Spain When a Rotterdam rock concert by the US band Allah-Las was called off at the last minute in August, Dutch police said they were acting on a Spanish tip-off about a possible terrorist attack. The alarm came days after the jihadist murders in and around Barcelona. Hours later, a 22-year-old man was arrested in an overnight raid. But now the man's lawyer has insisted he not only poses no danger to the public but that he is in reality a ""terrorist hunter"". Jimmy F is a student of safety and security management who lives at home with his parents in the southern town of Zevenbergen. He was detained in a dawn raid hours after the club was cordoned off, and held in isolation for a week. Lawyer Karianne Bal says her client's intentions were good; to help catch those who do pose a terror threat. Dutch arrest after gig 'terror tip-off' The Dutch student is part of a tight-knit online network who call themselves ""Syria General"". Ms Bal also claims the authorities were aware of what she described as Jimmy F's ""peculiar hobby"". Based on English-language, image-based website 4chan, Syria General is part of an online discussion forum used to share news and opinions about the conflict. Users usually post anonymously. Most are supporters of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. However, one member of the group, known as ""Jad"", denied claims that one of the group's aims was to track down ""terrorists"". He told the BBC that Jimmy F was active on the forum, but had been acting independently when he engaged in something they call LARPing (Live Action Role Playing), which involves ""infiltrating and baiting"" individuals who may be planning attacks in Europe. Jimmy F posted some of his explanation online Friends say Jimmy F was in contact with someone calling himself ""Ayoub"" on the Telegram messaging app - a person he thought was based in Spain and preparing an act of terror in the West. How IS wages its social media war Russia targets Telegram app after bombing Images obtained by the BBC appear to show Jimmy F sending pictures of weapons which friends say were supposed to convince ""Ayoub"" to share more details about his plans. According to the suspect's lawyer, her client had been arranging a meeting at Rotterdam airport to lure someone he believed posed a terror threat to a location where the Dutch authorities could arrest him. The suspect was detained hours after police evacuated Rotterdam's Maassilo concert venue Ayoub's identity is unclear, but Jimmy F's friends believe Ayoub shared screen grabs of the chat with the Spanish Guardia Civil police. The Spanish authorities alerted the Dutch authorities, who then shut down the Rotterdam music venue. So, if these accounts are to be believed, two people, both pretending to be armed and willing to carry out an attack, caused the mass terror scare in Rotterdam. Covert intelligence-gathering groups have risen to prominence as part of a growing trend for self-taught individuals to harvest open source material online and offer their findings to official investigations. Bellingcat is among the best known for its work in researching chemical weapons use in Syria, as well as the shooting down of passenger jet flight MH17 over eastern Ukraine. Dutch police treated the alert as credible and initially arrested a Spanish driver near the scene before releasing him However, Christiaan Triebert at Bellingcat fears that the kind of closed-source, vigilante, partisan work conducted by people connected to the Syria General forum can adversely affect proper legal investigations - especially, he says, when members are ""ideologically driven"". ""If you have been building an intelligence picture and potential case for years and then a (4chan) guy rocks up and says, 'What's up, fellow jihadists', there's a good chance the genuine terrorists will get spooked and burn the evidence. ""Once you cross the line and start engaging, then you're not only endangering yourself, you're potentially endangering real intelligence operations."" The important question is how the authorities adjust to this reality. There has been no jihadist attack on Dutch soil in recent years, although police have stepped up anti-terror measures around tourist sites in recent days. Police have been granted more time to question Jimmy F.  The intelligence services have refused to comment due to the ongoing investigation. A spokeswoman for the prosecutor's office in Rotterdam told the BBC: ""He is suspected of crimes related to terrorism, however we know what he and his friends have said online. We aren't just investigating what he said but also whom he was speaking to and his motivations. You can say a lot... we have to find out if it's true.""

US seeks tough UN approach to N Korea,"This video can not be played US ambassador Nikki Haley: ""Kim Jong-un is begging for war"" The US envoy to the UN has urged the Security Council to take the ""strongest possible measures"" against North Korea after its latest nuclear test. ""The time has come to exhaust all diplomatic means before it is too late,"" Nikki Haley told an emergency meeting of the council in New York. The US will circulate a draft resolution, for a vote next Monday. South Korea is poised to scrap a warhead weight limit on its own missiles after talks with the US. President Moon Jae-in reached agreement by phone with his counterpart, Donald Trump. Missiles are currently capped at 500kg (1,100lb). How do you defend against North Korea? How should Trump handle North Korea? The country carried out live-fire exercises on Monday, simulating an attack on the North's nuclear test site. Reports suggest the North is preparing new test missile launches. It tested a nuclear bomb underground on Sunday. Estimates of its power range from 50 kilotonnes to 120 kilotonnes. A 50kt device would be about three times the size of the bomb that destroyed Hiroshima in 1945. In other developments: German Chancellor Angela Merkel said she would press for tougher EU sanctions on North Korea, agreeing with Mr Trump by phone on the need for stricter sanctions Swiss President Doris Leuthard said her country was prepared to act as a mediator and called for more discreet negotiations, saying ""Twitter won't be an adequate instrument"" Japan is planning, in the event of war, for a mass evacuation of nearly 60,000 Japanese citizens currently living in or visiting South Korea,Nikkei Asian Review reports,external Opening Monday's meeting, UN Under Secretary General Jeffrey Feltman said North Korea's actions were destabilising global security, and he called on Pyongyang to abide by Security Council resolutions. ""The DPRK [North Korea] is the only country that continues to break the norm against nuclear test explosions,"" he said. The UN Security Council last imposed sanctions in August, targeting North Korean exports Ms Haley argued that only the strongest sanctions would enable the problem to be resolved through diplomacy. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un had shown through his actions that he was ""begging for war"", she said. ""War is never something the United States wants,"" she continued. ""We don't want it now but our country's patience is not unlimited."" She was speaking after President Trump warned the US might consider stopping all trade with any country doing business with North Korea. ""The United States will look at every country that does business with North Korea as a country that is giving aid to their reckless and dangerous nuclear intentions,"" Ms Haley said. The British ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, said direct talks with North Korea were only possible if Pyongyang stopped the escalation. ""Dialogue will always be our end goal but returning to dialogue without a serious sign of intent from Pyongyang would be a set-up to failure,"" he said. ""North Korea must change course to allow a return to dialogue."" China's envoy to the UN, Liu Jieyi, reiterated a call for all sides to return to negotiations. ""The peninsula issue must be resolved peacefully,"" he said. ""China will never allow chaos and war on the peninsula."" By Jonathan Marcus, BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent China is key but it is a conflicted party. On the one hand it does not want to see a nuclear-armed North Korea and it has made its view clear to Pyongyang on many occasions. However, it does not want to see the North Korean regime swept away. This would result in millions of refugees flooding into China and would probably result in a unified Korea very much in the US orbit. This is seen in Beijing as worse than having a difficult nuclear neighbour. If China were to take the view that the coincidence of a rapidly advancing North Korean nuclear programme and the uncertainties of the Trump administration's diplomatic capabilities means that there is a very real risk of misunderstanding and catastrophe, then maybe it might bring much greater pressure to bear on Pyongyang. North Korea is a very isolated country and China is both its major ally and economic prop. There is a lot more that China can do. North Korea's recent testing has been as much an embarrassment to China as it has angered the US. But the Chinese have a difficult diplomatic calculation to make. Full version of analysis Last month,the Security Council voted unanimously to ban North Korean exports and limit investmentsin the country. Ms Haley did not spell out what additional measures might be taken but diplomats have suggested an oil embargo would have a crippling effect. There could also be a ban on the North's national airline, curbs on North Koreans working abroad, and asset freezes and travel bans on officials. It was North Korea's sixth and most powerful nuclear test to date. The US Geological Survey recorded a resulting tremor at 6.3 magnitude.

Kim inspects 'nuclear warhead': A picture decoded 'Tunnel collapse' at nuclear site may provide clues China mutes discussion of North Korea bomb South Korea said it was now presumed that the North had reduced its nuclear warhead in size to below 500kg, and would be able to attach one to an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). But analysts have said the North's claims about miniaturisation should be treated with considerable caution. Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Have North Korea's missile tests paid off? Earlier on Monday, a South Korean defence ministry official said there were signs of ""possibly more ballistic missile launches"", including an ICBM. What's at North Korea's nuclear site? Can we work out the power of the tested bomb? Monday's drills simulated the targeting of the Punggye-ri nuclear site in Kilju County, where North Korea carried out its bomb test. Missiles were fired from the ground and rockets from fighter jets. This video can not be played South Korea carries out live-fire drills in response to the nuclear test The defence ministry in Seoul said there would be more live-fire drills in the South this month, involving Taurus air-to-surface missiles mounted on F-15 jets. The ministry also told parliament the US would seek to deploy a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier to seas off the peninsula. Four more launchers of theUS Thaad (Terminal High-Altitude Area Defence) missile defence system-strongly opposed by China and Russia - would also be deployed to join two already at a site in Seongju, south of Seoul.

Oxford head attacks politicians on pay,"Louise Richardson says top universities have to compete for staff in a 'global marketplace' Oxford University's vice-chancellor says it is dishonest of politicians to link high levels of pay for university leaders with increases in tuition fees. Louise Richardson accused ""tawdry politicians"" of undermining the UK's university sector. She said that pay rates reflected a ""global marketplace"" and counterparts in the US were much better paid. Universities minister Jo Johnson and Labour's Lord Adonis have warned against ""excessive"" pay levels. ""I think it's completely mendacious for politicians to suggest that vice-chancellors have used the Â£9,000 fees to enhance their own salaries,"" said Prof Richardson, speaking in London at the Times Higher Education World Academic Summit. ""We know that the Â£9,000 fees were a substitute for the withdrawal of government funding. ""My own salary is Â£350,000 - which is a very high salary compared to our academics - our junior academics especially, who are very lowly paid."" But Prof Richardson said university heads' pay might not look so high compared with footballers or bankers. She said that leading UK universities wanted to attract heads from around the world - and that meant competing financially in a ""global marketplace"". Jo Johnson says vice-chancellors will have to explain their high levels of pay In the United States, she said that more than 40 university leaders earned more than $1m (Â£770,000) and that some received more than $2m (Â£1.54m). Universities have come under pressure over high levels of pay for senior staff - at a time when tuition fees and levels of student debt are increasing in England. But Prof Richardson accused politicians of using this to undermine the higher education sector. ""I think this is just the politicians, and I wish they wouldn't do it, not because it's embarrassing for me or my colleagues but because it's damaging. ""Why would you want to try and damage what is one of the most successful aspects of the British economy? ""The calibre of university education is something that should be celebrated on a daily basis - not just trying to drag it down by making spurious correlations between fees and salaries."" Universities minister Jo Johnson has warned of the""upward spiral"" in vice-chancellors' pay. He told universities in July that they needed to do more to respond to students' concerns about value for money - ""especially when some vice-chancellors take home a wage that in some cases exceeds that of the prime minister"". Labour's former education minister Lord Adonis has attacked the rising levels of pay for university leaders - at a time when students faced increases in fees and interest rates on loans. Four MPs haveresigned from their roles at the University of Bath,in protest at the pay received there by Prof Dame Glynis Breakwell, who is the highest-paid vice-chancellor in the country. ""At what point does it become justifiable to pay someone Â£450,000?"" asked Bristol East MP, Kerry McCarthy, as she resigned. Oxford head Prof Richardson also challenged universities to protect free speech on campus and to resist those who wanted to stop the airing of controversial views. She said that students did not have a right not to be offended - and that universities had to be places where people might hear opinions they did not share. ""I've had many such conversations with students who come to me and say they don't feel comfortable because their professor has expressed views against homosexuality,"" said Prof Richardson. ""They don't feel comfortable being in class with someone with those views. ""And I say, 'I'm sorry, but my job is not to make you feel comfortable. Education is not about being comfortable. In fact, I'm interested in making you uncomfortable'. ""If you don't like his views, you challenge them, engage with them, and figure out how a smart person like that can have views like that. ""Figure out how you can persuade him to change his mind. It is difficult, but it is absolutely what we have to do if we believe in what we say, and I certainly do.""

'Nightmare neighbour' shakes China,"Chinese President Xi is, again, dealing with the crisis while in the middle of hosting an international summit In the small Chinese city of Yanji, the ground was moving. This Korean-speaking region sits on the border with North Korea and soon local bloggers were posting images on social media of things shaking. What they could not have known was that this earthquake was man-made. Not far away, the government in Pyongyang was soon declaring the successful test of a hydrogen bomb - its most powerful to date. The timing was a clear slap in the face for Beijing. Just hours after the underground nuclear test, President Xi Jinping was due to make a speech as the head of state for the nation hosting the Brics summit, which would welcome delegates from Brazil, Russia, India and South Africa to Xiamen.

It is conceivable that North Korea did not necessarily choose the opening day of this major diplomatic gathering for its test but it certainly did not see the need to call it off for fear of offending China. And, what is more, these weapons test ""coincidences"" are now starting to mount up when it comes to Xi Jinping. North Korea hails 'perfect' H-bomb test Nuclear tests: The story so far Decoding the Kim 'warhead' photo In March, just before the Chinese leader was set to meet United States Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in Beijing, North Koreaannounced the successful testof a new type of rocket engine. Then in May President Xi was preparing to open the One Belt One Road forum. The leaders of dozens of nations had come to the Chinese capital to discuss economic development and transport infrastructure around the Chinese leader's signature foreign policy initiative. Then, whoooooosh! Off goes another North Korean missile test to steal the limelight before the summit could even get going. That this could have happened again with the Brics summit is incredible. Xi Jinping - who is also the chair of the Central Military Commission in China - cannot be happy with this emerging pattern. People look across to North Korea from Tumen The North Koreans, in turn, would be furious with the behaviour of their old Cold War allies. China has not only backed sanctions against them in the United Nations Security Council but, as the isolated regime's principal trading partner, it has also been theprincipal implementer of these sanctions, turning back coal shipments and the like. Yet most observers know that, if it really wanted to, Beijing could bring crippling economic pain to North Korea. Heading into winter, it could freeze oil and gas supplies. Then there are the banks. North Korea is thought to conduct an enormous amount of laundered business via Chinese financial institutions. Various front businesses have been set up to facilitate money and products to flow in and out of the country with the assistance of these bodies. The Chinese government cannot be unaware of this and they could pull the plug on it tomorrow if they wanted to. But they don't for one reason. The Chinese government does not like the regional instability that their neighbour's nuclear weapons testing programme brings, but Beijing fears something even more. This video can not be played North Korean state media announces ""hydrogen bomb"" test They worry that total regime collapse in Pyongyang, leading to a unified Korean Peninsula dominated by the South, could lead to US troops on the border within marching distance of Yanji and they will put up with an awful lot from the Democratic People's Republic of Korea as long as this does not happen. The Environment Ministry here has announced that it has now started ""emergency radiation testing"" along the frontier. The government's displeasure would be significant if Chinese territory has been contaminated. The Chinese Foreign Ministry's official response to this latest North Korean nuclear weapons test condemned it strongly but, with increasingly loud calls coming for this country to do more to pressure Kim Jong-un to give up intercontinental ballistic missile ambitions, there would be serious frustration within the upper echelons of the Chinese Communist Party as to what they can realistically do next. The North Korean leader has made his nuclear ambitions a hallmark of his administration to the extent that it is hard to see what type of offering or threat could alter this situation. That is, unless the US and China have come up with a secret agreement which would see American troops leave Korea in the event of unificationâ¦ if that was in place it could change everything.

What if Trump cut ties with North Korea's trade partners?,"How realistic is cutting off trade ties with all of the countries that do business with North Korea? This is what US President Donald Trump has threatened on Twitter following North Korea's sixth nuclear test, its biggest so far and one it claims isthe successful test of a hydrogen bomb. The international community has tried everything short of military action to get North Korea to stop, but nothing - not sanctions, not isolation, or even the threat of annihilation appears to have dented its nuclear ambitions. So now, instead of just punishing North Korea, President Trump has tweeted that he will punish all countries who still do business with North Korea by stopping US trade with them. To look at how realistic that might be - first we have to look at which countries do business with North Korea. According tofigures from KOTRA,external(Korea's Trade Investment Promotion Agency) there were around 80 countries that traded with Pyongyang in 2016 including: China Russia India Pakistan Singapore Germany Portugal France Thailand Philippines North Korea's total trade with all of the countries on the list last year was worth US$6.5bn. That figure has been growing by about 5% a year. Granted, the amount of trade for some of these countries is small and decreasing.  But there are some fascinating insights. Singapore - which is number 8 on the list of largest traders with North Korea - saw trade with Pyongyang fall by 90% in 2016. Meanwhile the Philippines - saw a massive 171% jump in trade with North Korea. Both are economic partners of the US. In fact, many of the countries on this list are trading partners with the US  and most are doing far more business with the US than they do with the tiny North Korean economy. North Korea fired a missile over Japan in August But there is one country that potentially holds all the right cards. No prizes for guessing who is Pyongyang's biggest customer and supplier - China. 90% of North Korea's trade comes from China. Beijing is mainly buying coal and other minerals from Pyongyang, and crucially supplying food and fuel for its citizens. The data from 2016 doesn't clearly reflect what's going on now, as China banned North Korean coal in February. So when Trump says that the US would stop doing business with countries trading with Pyongyang, it would almost certainly have to include China. US warns of 'massive military response' South Korea holds live-fire drill Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea But frankly it is hard to see how that would happen without some damage to the US economy. This it how it breaks down: Trade:China is the US's largest trading partner. Goods:The US bought more than $450 bn worth ofgoods from China last year,externaland exported $115bn to China. Jobs:Cutting off trade with Beijing wouldcost the US almost a million American jobs,externalconnected to goods and services exported to China. Consumer prices:As I've written about before, even Trump's threats of imposing tariffs on China for being a currency manipulator would have disastrous effects on prices of goods in the US, boosting the cost of aniPhone for instance by about 5%. Don't forget - anything that affects China would necessarily also affect the global economy. Global research house Capital Economics says if the US were to stop buying goods from China altogether, it would cost the country some 3% of GDP. Which would have a knock-on effect of that on economies in Asia, most of whom count China as their biggest trading partner, and buyer of goods. All of that is possibly why Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin has come up with a less direct way to ""punish"" these countries - he said in aFox TV news interview,externalon Monday that he was preparing a sanctions package that would cut off ""all trade and other business"" with Pyongyang, adding that there's ""much more"" the US can do economically. But that just looks like more of the same stuffwe've seen before,external. So what we are left with is a US that appears to have increasingly few economic options left on the table when it comes to negotiating with Pyongyang. Even if President Trump follows through with his trade threat, it would almost certainly result in a congressional backlash. It's hard to see how the president would be able to sell a policy with such questionable effectiveness, and one that would damage the US economically more than it would limit North Korea's nuclear options.

North Korea 'preparing missile launches',"This video can not be played South Korea carries out live-fire drills in response to the nuclear test South Korea says it has seen indications that the North is preparing more missile launches, possibly an intercontinental ballistic missile. It said it was strengthening its controversial US-made Thaad missile defence system after the North's test of a nuclear bomb at the weekend. The South has carried out live-fire exercises in response to the test. The United Nations Security Council is holding an emergency meeting to discuss its response. Itlast imposed sanctions in August, targeting North Korean exports. Speaking before the meeting, the British ambassador to the UN, Matthew Rycroft, told reporters there were ""further sectors of the economy which could be sanctioned"" and more could be done to prevent the North Korean government exploiting North Korean labourers working in other countries. The US haswarnedthat any threat to itself or its allies will be met with a ""massive military response"". The North says it tested a hydrogen bomb that could fit on to a long-range missile. Pyongyang has repeatedly defied UN sanctions and international pressure by developing nuclear weapons and testing missiles, and the provocations have only intensified. In the past two months it has conducted intercontinental ballistic missile tests,sending one over mainland Japaninto the Pacific Ocean. It has also threatened to fire missiles towards the US Pacific territory of Guam. How should Trump handle North Korea? What are the military options? What's at North Korea's nuclear site? Can we work out the power of the tested bomb? Chang Kyung-soo, a South Korean defence ministry official, told parliament: ""We have continued to see signs of possibly more ballistic missile launches. We also forecast North Korea could fire an intercontinental ballistic missile [ICBM]."" The ICBM could be fired into the North Pacific, officials said. No timeframe was given but this Saturday, the anniversary of the foundation of the North's regime, or 10 October, the establishment of the ruling Workers' Party of Korea, are possible dates. By Frank Gardner, BBC security correspondent North Korea is an intelligence failure for the West. All predictions as to the speed of that country's progress towards developing a nuclear-tipped ballistic missile capability have proven to be short of the mark. In both missile technology and nuclear weapons tests, North Korea has astounded defence and intelligence analysts with the pace of its advance towards full ICBM nuclear capability. Why? Because North Korea is an immensely hard intelligence target. Largely sealed off from the outside world, it is possibly the most difficult country to spy on. Most of its citizens do not have access to the worldwide web, limiting the scope for cyber-penetration. On the military side it has developed a network of mobile missile launchers and underground testing sites that are all but invisible to US satellites. The country that has possibly the best idea of what North Korea is up to is its vast neighbour, China. But given China's own tensions with the US, it has not seen it in its interests to share what it knows with Washington. Monday's drills simulated the targeting of the Punggye-ri nuclear site in Kilju County, where North Korea carried out its bomb test. Missiles were fired from the ground and rockets from fighter jets. The ministry said there would be more live-fire drills in the South this month, involving Taurus air-to-surface missiles mounted on F-15 jets.

UK coastal areas 'pockets of deprivation',"This video can not be played The decline of the busy port of Ardrossan in Ayrshire The UK's coastal communities are among the country's worst off for earnings, employment, health and education, a report for the BBC has found. The Social Market Foundation said the economic gap between coastal and non-coastal places has grown. Average wages are Â£3,600 a year lower in these ""pockets of deprivation"", according to the think tank. Meanwhile, the minister for coastal communities has announced Â£40m in funding to help coastal areas. The report, produced for BBC Breakfast, found that five of the 10 local authorities in the UK with the highest unemployment rate for the three months to March 2017 were coastal. These were Hartlepool, North Ayrshire, Torridge, Hastings, South Tyneside and Sunderland. It also found those in employment in coastal areas were likely to be paid less. Of the 98 local authorities on the coast, 85% had pay levels below the UK's average in 2016. Great Yarmouth ranked lowest in England and Wales for post-16 education UK coastal areas 'pockets of deprivation' In terms of health, 10 of the 20 local authorities in England and Wales with the highest proportion of people in poor health are coastal: Neath Port Talbot, Blackpool, Bridgend, Sunderland, Barrow-in-Furness, Carmarthenshire, East Lindsey, South Tyneside, County Durham and Hartlepool. And the two local authorities in England and Wales with the smallest proportion of over-16s holding level four and above qualifications [certificates above A level] are Great Yarmouth in Norfolk and Castle Point in Essex. Report author, SMF chief economist Scott Corfe, said a lack of local job opportunities and poor transport links contribute to badly-performing economies. There is currently no official definition of a coastal community, which the SMF believes is a problem. For its analysis the SMF defined them as a local authority area with a coastal border. ""Despite the evident social and economic problems these places face, there is currently no official definition of a 'coastal community',"" Mr Corfe added. ""The government needs to do more to track - and address - economic problems in our coastal towns."" The SMF warned that some areas - particularly in the South East - ""are pockets of significant deprivation surrounded by affluence - meaning their problems are often overlooked by policymakers"". The report found the economic gap between coastal and non-coastal areas has widened from 23% to 26% from 1997 to 2015. In Blackpool, individual health is among the poorest in the UK Meanwhile, the government announced on Monday that it was providing Â£40m for coastal areas from theCoastal Communities Fund,external. Having launched in 2012, it has so far provided Â£170m for 278 projects across the UK in five rounds of funding. Some of the projects to have received funding include a new conference centre in Blackpool's Winter Gardens and improvements to Southport Pier. Coastal Communities Minister Jake Berry said: ""From the world-renowned Blackpool illuminations to Brighton's i360, our coastal towns and cities have a lot to offer all year round. ""This year is already looking like another record year for staycations and our latest round of funding will help attract even more visitors to the great British coast so that our coastal communities can thrive.""
