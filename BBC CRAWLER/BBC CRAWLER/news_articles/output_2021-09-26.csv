More people feeling forced into private healthcare,"Hayden's mum Shauna raised enough money to get her son's surgery carried out in Turkey ""To be put in a position where you're basically begging off people, it's infuriating."" Last October, 12-year-old Hayden Kildea was diagnosed with severe scoliosis, a condition where the spine twists and curves to the side. Left untreated, it can become a dangerous and life-limiting condition. The Kildeas, who live in Strabane, Northern Ireland, say they were told Hayden would need urgent surgery - but that because of the backlog caused by the pandemic, he would have to wait more than two years. His mum Shauna found a clinic in Turkey that was able to carry out the operation immediately, but it would cost Â£50,000 - money the family didn't have. So in the summer, they turned to crowdfunding and campaigning to raise the money. She says: ""It's really, really frustrating that we're in our own country and we can't get Hayden the surgery he needs."" This video can not be played Staff at a north London GP surgery spoke of  ""overwhelming"" pressure Millions of people across the UK are currently on NHS waiting lists - in Northern Ireland there are over 465,000 people, while in England, 5.6m are queuing for treatment. Data shared with BBC Panorama shows that on average, waiting lists have grown by 50% in the most deprived parts of England since the start of the pandemic, compared with nearly 35% in the most affluent areas. The research, conducted by the King's Fund, also shows that people on waiting lists in poorer areas are nearly twice as likely as those in wealthier areas to wait more than one year for treatment. The data looks at waiting lists from April 2020 to July 2021 (the latest available data) and includes planned hospital treatments such as knee and hip replacements, cataract surgery and other common procedures. Hayden Kildea's family reached their target. He has now had the operation in Turkey and is recovering back at home. The Health and Social Care Board in Northern Ireland said patient demand continued ""to exceed capacity across a range of specialties"". It added: ""As a result, even before the pandemic, the number of people waiting longer than the target waiting times was increasing."" Sofia felt she couldn't wait for an NHS procedure Sofia Jones, 36, has endometriosis - a gynaecological condition that leads to severe pelvic pain. Some days she could barely walk, having to stay in bed all day. Sofia, who lives near Dundee, says she was told she'd have to wait two years for an NHS operation. But that felt too long to wait, so she and her partner decided to take out a Â£7,000 loan to pay to have the surgery in a private hospital. 'It was a really tough decision to go private,"" she says, ""because we were having to put ourselves into debt. And that's a lot of money. But you have to have some quality of life."" A Scottish government spokesman said: ""We're sorry the unprecedented impact of the pandemic has lengthened waiting times for some patients. The pandemic has been the most significant challenge the NHS has faced in its 73-year history, and as in many health care systems across the world, the unavoidable pausing of non-urgent elective procedures has resulted in some delays."" According to Anita Charlesworth, chief economist at the Health Foundation think tank: ""The big worry about long waits leading people to have to go private is that it will increase inequalities, but also that many people will be forced to make awful trade-offs over their finances in order to be able to get access to the care that they need when they need it. ""And that goes against every grain of why we set up the health service,"" she said. Brenda Pugh, 61, from Petersfield in Hampshire, had to give up work in a law firm in 2019 after being diagnosed with arthritis. She was unable to work due to the pain caused by her arthritis which was first diagnosed five years ago. As the pandemic began, she was told she needed a double hip replacement and now has to use crutches. When she moves she says it's like ""walking on jagged glass"". The pain is so severe she has written to her consultant, begging him for the operation. She says: ""I can't carry on like this. My life just isn't worth living."" Brenda Pugh, 61, had to give up work because of arthritis The cost to have the surgery privately would be about Â£10,000 per hip - and she says there's no way she can afford that. Brenda is one of 62,000 patients who've been waiting more than 12 months to get joint replacement surgery. New research conducted by charity Versus Arthritis and given exclusively to BBC Panorama reveals that half (54%) of people with arthritis who are currently waiting for surgery are facing an average cost of Â£1,739 a year to keep their pain at bay, through things like private physio appointments and over-the-counter painkillers. Inevitably, GPs are the ones patients turn to for help managing their pain as they wait. One of them, Dr Leora Harverd, from a practice in north London, says she's overwhelmed by her current caseload. Some of her patients are anxious about long delays for treatment, and says it's not unusual that people go private, but ""it's not how it should be"". This month the government announced they would be investing Â£36bn in NHS and social care for all four home nations up to 2025. Analysis of their plans by the Health Foundation shows that Â£10bn has been committed to address the backlog in England over the next three years. Ms Charlesworth says it's a lot of money but won't necessarily be enough: 'If we want the waiting list to come down by the next election, we would need to spend at least Â£13bn; if we wanted to meet the target to treat people within 18 weeks, we need to be spending Â£17bn - and the government has committed Â£10bn."" But even the prime minister has admitted that ""waiting lists will get worse before they get better"". NHS England said: ""Caring for more than 450,000 seriously ill Covid patients has inevitably had a knock-on effect on non-urgent care. ""NHS staff have stepped up and made effective use of additional resources helping carry out millions more tests, checks, treatments and operations this summer compared to last.""

Labour: Axing business rates will aid High Streets,"This video can not be played Labourâs shadow chancellor says she would invest in ""good jobs in the green industries of the future"" Labour has promised to spend an extra Â£28bn a year on making the UK economy more ""green"" if it wins power. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said the money would go on offshore wind farms, planting trees and developing batteries. In her speech to Labour's annual conference in Brighton, she also pledged to phase out business rates to help the Covid-damaged High Street. And she said giant tech firms would pay more tax in future. An aide to Ms Reeves told the BBC the Â£28bn would come from government borrowing and the investment should ""have a positive impact"" on the wider economy. Labour backs Starmer over party rules reforms Labour needs policies now, says Burnham Rayner renews attack on Johnson in scum row In her speech, Ms Reeves said: ""I will be a responsible chancellor. I will be Britain's first green chancellor."" She added: ""I will invest in good jobs in the green industries of the future, giga-factories to build batteries for electric vehicles, a thriving hydrogen industry, offshore wind with turbines made in Britain, planting trees and building flood defences, keeping homes warm and getting energy bills down, good new jobs in communities throughout Britain."" Rachel Reeves is the shadow chancellor with something for everyone. For the Labour Party activists crying out for ambitious pledges following a series of lukewarm announcements there was Â£28bn a year of investment to help the UK reach its climate targets. She also went after some of the most potent symbols for party members: private schools and Jeff Bezos, the founder of Amazon (""if you can afford to fly to the moon, you can afford to pay your taxes here on earth!"") For the business community there was a promise to axe business rates and replace the Â£30bn of revenue withâ¦ something. For those who thought it was all a bit too much she unveiled some fiscal rules that could lightly limit her room to spend and borrow, and a new value for money ""hit squad"" that would scrutinise government spending. She has also upped her speech game significantly, introducing a group of keyworkers in the front row to rapturous applause and lowering her voice dramatically to deliver her soundbites. Ms Reeves said the annual Â£28bn investment - which would continue until 2030 - would help ""protect our planet for future generations"". It would include the Â£3bn shadow business secretary Ed Miliband promised to help make the UK steel industry carbon-neutral in his conference speech on Sunday. Labour is expected to make a series of announcements on where the rest of the money would go. Greenpeace UK welcomed the overall spending pledge, with its head of politics, Rebecca Newsom, saying: ""Tackling the climate crisis has to be at the heart of what the Treasury does."" The independent Climate Change Committee estimates the cost of making the UK carbon-neutral will bebetween 1% and 2% of GDP,externaluntil 2050. Based on last year's figures, that would equate to between Â£19.6bn and Â£39.2bn a year. During her half-hour speech, Ms Reeves said a Labour government would freeze business rates in England until 2023 and make rates relief for smaller firms more generous. It would eventually scrap rates completely, she said, replacing them with a new ""modern"" business tax, which the party is yet to define. Labour is also proposing a new tax on commercial property. And it is proposing to increase the digital services tax - paid by search engines and social media firms - from 2% to 12%, when it is replaced by a higher global corporation tax rate agreed as part of aninternational scheme. Ms Reeves told the conference the party would bring in the ""biggest overhaul of business taxation in a generation"", allowing businesses to ""lead the pack, not watch opportunities go elsewhere."" She announced plans to scrap ""hundreds"" of tax breaks and set up an Office of Value for Money, which aides describe as a ""hit squad"" to scrutinise government spending and ensure tax is used wisely. Ms Reeves said a Labour government would tell firms which have received contracts to deal with the Covid pandemic but under-delivered to repay the money given to them by the government. ""We will set up a team to go through every line of every failed contract where value was not delivered, and claw back every penny of taxpayers' money we possibly can,"" she added, ""because that money belongs in our police, it belongs in our schools and it belongs in our NHS."" The policies announced by Ms Reeves were welcomed by the Federation for Small Businesses, whose national chair Mike Cherry said: ""The shadow chancellor is right to propose concrete reform of a business rates tax which disproportionately burdens the small businesses and sole traders at the heart of local communities."" But Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""Successive Labour leaders have threatened businesses with tax hikes, higher bills, and more red tape. ""Only the Conservatives can be trusted to support our businesses and help our economy thrive as we build back better.""

It was a dominant performance from the hosts and a chastening experience for Europe, but a thoroughly enjoyable weekend watching one of the greatest sporting events on earth.

Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Whistling Straits Trophy lifted, champagne popped and then Tony Finau takes the mic. âCome on Wisconsin! Show us some love!â he pleads. The fans duly oblige. The DJ has missed a trick thoughâ¦ got to be some Pink with Get The Party Started. No? Something else that is likely to make the back pages.... Apparently Rory McIlroy used some choice words in a later interview with the host broadcaster:""Glad I got a point on the board for Europe, but disappointed I didn't do it sooner. ""I had two good opportunities Friday and Saturday to sort of lift us out of a hole and I wasn't able to do it. It sucks losing. It sucks not being able to be competitive and yeah, I'm glad I put a point on the board for Europe today and that was my goal and mission and I was able to accomplish that. ""But when I look back on this week, it will be a case of sort of lost opportunity."" The four-time major win then went on to say, ""I've never really cried or got emotional over what I've done as an individual, I couldn't give a fig."" ""I've said naÃ¯ve and stupid things in the past but this is by far the biggest tournament we have in golf. I've been able to do this six times. They have always been my greatest experiences of my career.""  And now the captain collects the Ryder Cup! Steve Stricker floats it out in front of him, before allowing each of the American team to get a fingernail on the trophy for the photographs. They'll be on the US sports papers tomorrow, Stricker's backward shades n all. More from USA captain Steve Stricker: ""These guys came with a mission and they did it. ""You are trying to make me cry, aren't you... this is very special, growing up a couple of hours from here, to be with these guys. Come on, you guys show a little emotion too! ""This is a new era right here, they are young, motivated, they came here determined to win. We put them in their groupings, communicated with them, there were no ra-ra speeches - am I going to give them a ra-ra speech? They are the best in the world. ""I have never won a major, but this is my major right here."" #bbcgolf Paolo: Delighted for Lee Westwood and Ian Poulter winning what could well be their final Ryder Cup matches after serving Europe with distinction. Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Whistling Straits âPlease show your appreciation for Team Europe!â The American fans give the visitors a warm round of applause from the grandstands. Despite a few reports of some past-the-mark sledging, the Wisconsinites have proved to be a friendly and respectful bunch. The European players, partners and support staff exit stage left as the American team move onto the stage set up in front of the 18th green. Here's Captain Stricker, glasses still on backwards: ""I knew from the start a couple of weeks ago when they all showed up here, apart from Brooks who was hurt, all the vice-captains showed up and we got involved early with each other, we learned the course. They came in very prepared. ""This is the greatest team of all time, you guys are unbelievable"" Right then, to the presentation. It's all very red up there. Phil Mickelson has the aviators on, Steve Stricker has his on the back of his baseball cap. Many ways to wear a pair of shades, folks. He'll be searching for those later.  Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Whistling Straits This place is ready to blow. Fans sprint down the hill when the rope is relaxed to about 30 yards shy of the putting surface. Watch yourselves guys! Itâs steep. Roars greet the shaking of hands between Daniel Berger and Matt Fitzpatrick, then the players and team staff flood the green. A polite message on the tannoy asks them to vacate the space, not before a line between the two teams. Great to see sportsmanship is not lost. That USA chant you've been hearing all week echoes around Whistling Straits - the Americans need to chug those beers and shape up for the presentation. Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Whistling Straits Must be a good few hundred people congregated around the green now. Three broad camps - Team USA, Team Europe and media. There is plenty of freedom of movement though. A lot of the players exchange hugs, smiles and high five before separating into their two camps. Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau shared a little moment earlier too if youâre interested. 1UP Berger v Fitzpatrick (F) Ah, that's a rotten ending for Matt Fitzpatrick as he dunks his second shot into the creek down 18 and basically hands the hole, and the match, to Daniel Berger as he wins the last. Kind of sums up just how it's gone for Europe this week though. It means it's a huge victory for Team USA and the largest winning margin since Europe joined the Ryder Cup in 1979. Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveGerman rivals neck and neck to succeed MerkelLess than a minute ago,"Projected results from Germany's federal elections suggest the centre-left has edged ahead of the conservatives of Angela Merkel The centre-left SPD candidate, Olaf Scholz, said the country had voted for change It's the conservatives' worst-ever performance but leader Armin Laschet says it's all to play for Laschet says he too could lead a governing coalition, though he acknowledges the results are disappointing The parties in third and fourth place, the Greens and the liberal FDP, will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations Angela Merkel is standing down as chancellor after 16 years in power But with the race this tight, we could be waiting weeks to find out who gets the top job Paul Kirby, Claudia Allen and Joshua Nevett Thank you for following our live coverage of Germany's elections - which will, eventually, see a replacement for Angela Merkel as chancellor voted in by the new MPs. We're wrapping up our coverage now, but here are the main things you need to know from election night:  You can read our full news story on the electionhere.  Angela Merkel has dominated German politics for 16 years A reminder that Angela Merkel remains German chancellor until her replacement is elected by parliament - and that could easily take weeks or months. If she's still in post on 17 December she will become Germany's longest serving post-war chancellor. How will history remember her? Hereâs the assessment of four experts. She has turned German politics into a discussion about policy rather than politics, saysMatt Qvortrup, professor of political science at Coventry University. She has staged a bit of a revolution in German politics and world politics generally. Her position has been symbolically important for women's representation, saysCharlotte Galpin, senior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham. Yet, such symbolic representation doesn't automatically mean wider change, especially for women of colour and the LGBTQ+ community. Her policy legacy is a somewhat bizarre mix of modernisation and backwardness, saysDr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-Beck, professor of political science at the University of Mannheim. Many of the modernising features would not be expected from a Christian Democratic chancellor. Her legacy is a determined and silent one, saysDr Katrin Schreiter, lecturer in German and history at King's College London. Her leadership is based on sober evaluation and projecting reliability. You can read more expert verdicts on Merelâs legacyhere. As we've been reporting, the parties projected to come third and fourth in the election - the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) - will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations. While the Greens have been delighted at their relatively strong showing, their numbers have fallen substantially compared to opinion polls earlier in the summer - which showed the party in the lead nationally. Speaking to the BBC, Omid Nouripour, a member of parliament for the Greens and their spokesman on foreign affairs, said the party could have done better but it was fighting against public perceptions. ""This is one of the funniest moments when you are doing your campaign and people come over and tell you you're a prohibition party... you want to take us away cars, airplanes, I don't know, bridges or rivers or whatever,"" said Mr Nouripour. ""This is a clichÃ© which you have to tackle."" ""We didn't do a proper job on that in the last weeks and this is one of the mistakes maybe we have to talk about,"" he added. ""But at the end of the day these clichÃ©s will not last forever and we're going to fight it."" The Green lead candidate, Annalena Baerbock, promised the next government would be a climate government. But the Greens' policy of funding the fight against global warming through higher taxes is in direct contrast to the low taxation proposed by the FDP - a more natural ally of the centre right. The SDP and the conservatives have already made overtures - separately - to the FDP and the Greens, but negotiations are likely to be long and difficult. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin âShe brought a lot of stability, she was like a rock,â says 18-year-old student Laura of the outgoing chancellor. Angela Merkel is still a very popular leader, but when a government does eventually get formed, she will leave German politics for good. For Laura, the outgoing chancellor did not do a good enough job âBut especially when it comes to giving young people a voice, they really missed their shot. She didnât prepare this country for change.â In all, 14% of voters are under 30, but an estimated 38% are 60 or over. Tackling the climate crisis is key for âGeneration Merkelâ - some of whom can't remember another chancellor - and the Greens are most popular for 18- to 29-year-olds. âGermany should care less about making money and instead look after future generations. We should be an example for other countries,â says Rebecca, 23, from Berlin. Rebecca is among many Germans who see climate change as top priority Marion Wenzelâs home was ravaged by the summer floods in Ahrweiler. âIâm so busy with rebuilding I didnât have any time for the partiesâ programmes.Our biggest task is to have a clear way for the future.â Blogger Diana zur LÃ¶wen, 26, is worried that not enough will change: âWe have to tackle digitisation and optimise education. Iâm not sure if all the parties have a good programme for that. Young people are not really the main focus.â Manuela Schwesig has won a convincing victory in state elections We've been focusing on the federal elections - but two German states are also voting in new assemblies. In the north-eastern Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the SPD are well ahead of all the other parties. State premier Manuela Schwesig is set to stay in the role she's held since 2017. In Berlin the SPD are also ahead in the battle to control the city-state's assembly - but the Greens are close behind them. Charlotte GalpinSenior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham The AfD has been particularly strong in eastern German states in recent years Following its first entry into the Bundestag in 2017, the AfD is set to repeat its success at this election. While in some regions support for the party has declined, and its highs of around 15% in the polls around 2018/9 have dropped, it had been polling at a steady 10-12% across Germany ahead of the election. Tonight's preliminary results show it is likely to receive about 11% of the vote nationally, and be the largest party in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia. These are territories of the former GDR where the radical right has been particularly strong since the early 1990s, and which suffered socio-economic deprivation as a result of the reunification between East and West Germany. While in other regions the AfDâs support is lower, the consistent support for an anti-immigration and Islamophobic party of around a tenth of voters across Germany demonstrates a wider problem with racism and suggests that the party has found a steady core voter base. The Greens were leading in the polls at one point The Greens are on track to be part of the next government based on tonight's results. For a brief period during the election campaign the Greens and their candidate, Annalena Baerbock, topped the opinion polls with 28%. For a party that had only once previously polled more than 10% in a national election (in 2009) these were dizzying heights and further proof that climate change had moved front and centre in German minds. The Green Party has been in government before as a junior partner, but never with this level of support. You might remember Joschka Fischer, the Greensâ leader who served as foreign minister and vice-chancellor from 1998-2005 under Germanyâs last centre-left leader Gerhard SchrÃ¶der. With the centre-left Social Democrats (SDP) on course for a narrow victory, members have been reflecting on what a win would mean for the party, which hasn't led a German government since 2005. Katarina Barley, a senior European Parliament member with the SDP, told the BBC that it would amount to ""absolute revival."" ""Yes of course, we would have liked to be in front more clearly, but I'm sure that this will evolve through the evening,"" Ms Barley said. She suggested that more was achievable on issues like climate change in a coalition which did not feature the conservative CDU/CSU alliance. ""When it comes to climate change, there is not much you can do. [Conservatives] oppose nearly everything, and you see it in the states also where the conservatives are in coalitions with the Greens - nothing moves,"" said Ms Barley. ""So if we get out of this coalition with the conservatives, I think we will see a lot of progress when it comes to climate change,"" she added. Some children have given politicians a tough time on the campaign trail Kids can be cruel, especially to German politicians, it seems. Surprisingly, the toughest interviewers of the election campaign turned out to be children. First, there was the grilling of Tino Chrupalla, one of the lead candidates for the far-right AfD party. He said wanted more German poems taught in schools but, when asked to name one, couldnât do so. âMy favourite poem is... I canât think of any,â he said, after a long and painful pause. Then there was the child interrogation of the three main chancellor candidates in a toy-filled tent. When quizzed about his âunhealthyâ smoking habit, a flustered Armin Laschet replied: âYes, thatâs right but so many things are unhealthy. But I donât really inhale.â Youngsters gave Olaf Scholz and Annelena Baerbock a rough ride too. Scholz was asked to explain why the German government hadnât done more to stop migrants from drowning en route to Europe, while Baerbock faced a bruising question about allegations she inflated her achievements on her CV. Dr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-BeckProfessor of political science at the University of Mannheim Armin Laschet has taken a battering in media coverage of his campaign The CDUâs dramatic shift in the polls from quiet erosion into something more reminiscent of an implosion can be attributed to a â partly self-induced â leadership crisis. The party can thank the unshakeable popularity of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel for a significant portion of its remaining support in recent years. The boots her successor is supposed to fill are very large indeed, and there are doubts over whether Armin Laschet has the necessary stature for this monumental task. The challenges, criticism, and backstabbing from within his own party, even before his nomination, were not exactly helpful. His media image quickly crystallised into one of a candidate of dubious competence in matters of policy and limited ability as a campaigner, but with a great talent for gaffes. In media coverage, everything Laschet came up with was interpreted as a tactical stunt, hastily thought up in a desperate attempt to keep the ship from sinking. Of course, this kind of news coverage can only further undermine the candidateâs credibility among voters. For Laschet, it appeared impossible to escape this narrative. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin Angela Merkelâs conservatives are heading for a
historically low result in Germany's election, with latest projections coming in at
just above 24%. âWeâre disappointedâ, says Peter, a CDU member in Berlin.
âWeâre confident that weâre still in the game for forming a government. But we
thought we would be above 30%.â Eva believes not enough emphasis was put on the party's policies Eva, another CDU supporter, tells me these elections were more about choosing individual candidates than party programmes. ""I think that is what put us off.â Members still found a reason to cheer at a local election party tonight: âThere was no majority for the leftist parties and thatâs a good thing, I think,"" says Johannes. A coalition between the Social Democrats, Greens and the far left  will be impossible if projected results are borne out. While the results are still trickling in, we know that it's likely that more than two political parties will be needed to form a majority in Germany's next parliament. That's because - even if they do get just enough seats to form a majority together - the two main parties, the SPD and the CDU/CSU, are not at all keen to continue to work together in coalition, as they have been doing for the past four years. The SPD looks to be in pole position to lead the next government, as it is currently projected to win the largest share of the vote nationally, albeit by a slim margin. Letâs walk you through some of the coalition combinations that are possible, based on preliminary results. Each combination is given a nickname based on the traditional colours of each party.  It's worth noting that theâred-red-greenâcoalition does not seem possible at this point, because the left-wing Die Linke party is not projected to win enough votes to enter the Bundestag. And the far-right AfD are unpalatable to all the other parties - so they won't feature in any coalition at the federal level. The two other coalition possibilities shown above would have enough seats to govern - but are unlikely as they both require the conservatives and the centre-left SPD to team up (with the addition of a third party). And as we've said, that prospect is unappealing to the two big ""people's parties"", as they're known in Germany. We're just hearing that the conservative CDU has lost the constituency of Chancellor Angela Merkel - who's standing down as an MP at this election - in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state. The centre-left SPD has won the seat in the far north-east of the country. Mrs Merkel has held the constituency since 1990, so this victory for the centre-left marks a major shift. We'll bring you further results from across the country as we get them. Here's a quick look at the three biggest parties' plans for the German economy, should they be in government after today's vote. The conservative CDU/CSU have promised no tax increases and tight public finances.They want Germany to return to a balanced budget after debt ticked up during the pandemic. The SPD wants to build 100,000 new social housing annually, a minimum wage of â¬12 (Â£10; $14) an hour, and a wealth tax of 1% to address inequality. The Greens also want to raise the hourly minimum wage to â¬12, and bump the top tax rate from the current 42% to 48%. A party's underway at the Greens' election event in Berlin - as supporters celebrate the party's best-ever parliamentary election results. The BBC's Damien McGuinness is there...

Two parties appear to have cornered the under-30s vote in this election, according to initial projections. The Greens and the liberal FDP between them appear to have polled over 40% of younger voters. The FDP and Greens look like they're potential kingmakers in the upcoming coalition talks, whichever of the two biggest parties ends up with the most seats in parliament. What's perhaps surprising is that the Social Democrats didn't do quite as well with younger voters. Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) top candidate Alice Weidel said her party had done well The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is on course to win the largest share of the vote in the eastern state of Saxony, according to preliminary results. So far, the party has won more than 28% of second votes (which show voters' party preference) in the state, well ahead of the SPD with 19%. The AfD has also performed well in the neighbouring state of Thuringia, with 24% of the second votes (slightly ahead of the SPD on 23%). In recent years the AfD has tended to do well in eastern Germany. The AfD has managed to woo voters from the centre-right and even the centre-left with its emphasis on Islam and migration. Those issues have galvanised some voters, especially men with nationalist attitudes. But on a national level, the party's share of the vote in this election is projected to be lower than the last one in 2017, when it received almost 13%. Earlier Alice Weidel, one of the party's top candidates, said considering the negative media treatment of the AfD, the party had done well. ""We are in the double figures, we have been able to assert ourselves,"" she said. All the other parties likely to be represented in the Bundestag have long ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD. BBC World Service ""We have made
climate change the number one issue in this election, it's been a climate
election and that's a victory for the Greens"". That's the verdict of Daniel Freund, a German member of the European Parliament for the Greens. On climate policy he told the BBC World Service:
""It is important that we get into action now, that we start shutting off
the coal power plants very soon, we will then increase measures as we go"". I absolutely believe that Germany can abandon coal by 2023. It is absolutely crucial that we make this exit sooner than currently agreed Daniel Freund, Green MEP Thumbs up for the SPD's Olaf Scholz It's just after 23:00 local time, and the centre-left Social Democrats look to be on course for a razor-thin victory in Germany's parliamentary elections - but they will need to form a coalition to build the next government. The party's candidate Olaf Scholz has said the country voted for change - and says voters want him to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor after 16 years. Even so, Armin Laschet, the candidate for Mrs Merkel's conservatives, has declared the outcome ""unclear"" and said he too wants to become Germany's new chancellor. But he acknowledged his party has plunged to a historic low. The progressive Greens appear to have made big gains, but not to have a viable shot at the chancellery. Along with the free-market Free Democrats, they look likely to play a key role in coalition talks. But with many more people voting by post than usual, it could be a while before we know the full outcome of the poll. Nick BeakeBBC News, SPD HQ in Berlin We just tried to ask Olaf
Scholz if heâs confident heâll soon be dealing with Boris Johnson and other
world leaders, but he was tight-lipped and his sizable security guards
whisked him away. But latest projections have given the SPD a slight lead and, after several hours of relative quiet, they've decided it's safe to strike
up the band. First up was Donât Stop Believing and it seems
the party faithful heading to the impromptu dancefloor are increasingly
confident in their belief their man will lead the next coalition government. We
hear the party leader has now gone for the night. As he slipped into the warm Berlin evening air, Message in a Bottle was blasting out. The young SPD party
members think the German people have sent a message at the
ballot box. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
UK suspends competition law to boost fuel suppliesOil firms will be able to share information to target petrol stations which are low on fuel after panic buying.,"The government is to suspend competition law to allow oil firms to target fuel deliveries at petrol stations following recent panic buying. Officials said the move would make it easier for companies to share information and prioritise parts of the country most at need. It follows days of long queues at the pumps, after fears of disruption to the fuel supply sparked panic buying. But a minister said there were no plans to bring in the Army to drive tankers. The government has been considering using the Army, but Environment Secretary George Eustice said the shortage of drivers was ""not a huge problem"". ""The only reason we don't have petrol on forecourts is people are buying petrol when they don't need it,"" he said, predicting that things would ""calm down"" once anxious people had filled their cars. The Petrol Retailers Association has warned that as many as two-thirds of its membership of nearly 5,500 independent outlets are out of fuel, with the rest of them ""partly dry and running out soon"". The UK has a total of more than 8,000 filling stations. Announcing the measure to exempt the oil industry from the Competition Act 1998, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the government had ""long-standing"" contingency plans to maintain fuel supplies. He said allowing the industry to share information would mean companies could work together more effectively to minimise disruption. The government alsorelaxed competition law in March 2020,external, to help supermarkets work together to maintain food supplies. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers A shortage of lorry drivers has caused problems for a range of industries in recent months, from supermarkets to fast food chains. In recent days, some fuel deliveries were affected, leading to panic buying and lengthy queues at some petrol stations. In a joint statement from companies including Shell, ExxonMobil and Greenergy, the industry reiterated that pressures on supply were being caused by ""temporary spikes in customer demand - not a national shortage of fuel"". PRA chairman Brian Madderson told the BBC the shortages were down to ""panic buying, pure and simple"", with oil companies prioritising keeping motorway service station pumps topped up. Pumps were mainly running dry in Britain's urban areas, while Northern Ireland was currently unaffected, he said. Queues began forming again outside this petrol station on Monday morning Mr Madderson also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Monday that filling stations were being restocked, but there were not enough deliveries to restore their normal levels of fuel. ""One of our members yesterday received a tanker at midday and by late afternoon the entire tanker had disappeared into people's cars,"" he said. On Saturday,the government announced it would offertemporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 foreign fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers in a bid to limit disruption in the build up to Christmas. Other measures include sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence - to encourage them back into the industry - and plans to train 4,000 people to become HGV drivers. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""There is plenty of petrol in the country"" Elizabeth de Jong, director of policy for Logistics UK, told Today that it would be ""days, possibly a couple of weeks"" before the visa applications were open. She said the industry had wanted more visas to be available and for a longer time, but she said the key issue now was to make them attractive to drivers, which was likely to mean offering good wages. The UK had lost 72,000 drivers between the second quarter of 2019 and the same period in 2021, Ms de Jong said - partly due to people returning to the EU after Brexit. At the same time, she said the pandemic had disrupted testing for HGV licences, making it harder to replace the lost drivers. The DVLA said there were more than 54,000 applications for licences awaiting processing, although some of those may be renewals and drivers can continue to work while they are dealt with. The shortage of drivers and other workers is also causing concern in the food and retail industry. The British Retail Consortium said the number of visas being offered was ""too small"" to make an impact on the disruption expected at Christmas. Competition benefits consumers. It encourages firms to innovate and improve their offer to draw customers in. It can mean products are better, often at lower prices. It also aims to make sure firms compete on a level playing field, as well as protecting them from other businesses acting unfairly. It stops businesses from making agreements with each other that would distort competition, leaving customers worse off. Agreeing to fix prices for certain goods or services, limiting production to drive prices up, or carving up markets, for example, could all end up breaking competition law. That risks serious fines, people being banned from running companies, or even jail. During the pandemic, the government has intervened to exempt certain industries from elements of competition law. At the height of the coronavirus crisis, for example supermarkets were allowed to share more information with each other on stock levels and share depots and delivery vans, to meet customer demand. The latest move will allow fuel suppliers to share information on which locations are most in need and, according to the Petrol Retailers Association, possibly put fuel into their competitors' sites - which they would not typically be allowed to do. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability policy at the trade association, told the BBC: ""I think we're going to see less choice, less availability, possibly a shorter shelf life as well, which is really disappointing because this could have been averted."" Meanwhile, turkey farmer Kate Martin warnedsupermarkets could run out of poultry before Christmas. She said there were fewer turkeys being produced because the big processors ""know they will not get them processed"". But the boss of supermarket chain Aldi in the UK said he expected""business as usual"" at Christmas. Recruitment for additional short-term HGV drivers and poultry workers will begin in October, with the visas valid until Christmas Eve.

Immigration system 'not meeting' Scotland's needsExternal Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson calls for urgent action from Westminster over temporary visas.Scotland,"Temporary working visas have been introduced for hauliers to tackle labour shortages. Scottish ministers have called for urgent action from the UK government on immigration as the system is ""not meeting"" the needs of Scotland. Temporary working visas have beenintroduced for hauliers and poultry workersto tackle labour shortages. However, Scottish External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson said the measure does not help all UK sectors. The UK's transport secretary said long term changes prevent sectors from standing ""on their own two feet"". The UK government confirmed that 5,000 HGV drivers and 5,500 poultry workers will be eligible to work in the UK for three months, until Christmas Eve. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? No fuel shortage, says transport secretary However Mr Robertson has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel saying: ""The current immigration system is not meeting the needs of Scotland. At the moment it is not meeting the needs of sectors across the UK."" He called for an ""immediate discussion"" with the home secretary - and said the UK government ""needs to urgently address the immigration challenges"". Mr Robertson wants Westminster to immediately introduce a 24-month temporary workers visa. Mr Robertson has called for urgent talks with the home secretary Worker shortages have been linked to both the coronavirus crisis and a lack of European labour after Brexit. A shortage of lorry drivers has caused problems for a range of industries, from supermarkets to fast food chains. In recent days, some fuel deliveries have been affected, leading tolengthy queues at petrol stations- despite ministers insisting the UK has plenty of fuel. There are also concerns that Christmas shopping could be hindered without action. Mr Robertson also said the shortage occupation list used for immigration must be reviewed - arguing that Scottish ministers should be given a formal role in determining what categories of workers are on this. The UK government also has to reduce immigration fees, he said, claiming the costs involved in this were a barrier for both workers and employers. Drivers queued at petrol stations on Friday, despite assurances of no fuel shortage Industry body, Scotland Food & Drink, has accused the UK Government of using temporary visas ""to fix bad headlines than fix the actual problem"". Chief executive, James Withers, said: ""We have been calling for emergency visas for weeks, to avoid the collapse of some food supply chains. ""I seriously doubt that 10,000 three-month visas are going to cut it. It may help the driver situation a little but it won't address the chronic staff shortage in food production."" In addition to temporary visas, Ministry of Defence examiners will be used to help increase immediate HGV testing capacity by thousands. Nearly one million letters will also be sent to all drivers who currently hold an HGV driving licence, encouraging them back into the industry. And the UK Department for Education is investing up to Â£10m to create new ""skills bootcamps"" to train up to 3,000 more HGV drivers. Appearing on BBC Scotland'sThe Sunday Show, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he wanted to support British people, but also make sure they can ""train up for work"". This video can not be played Mr Shapps appeared on The Sunday Show to discuss problems as a result of labour shortages He said his government wanted to avoid ""going back to what has consistently happened"" - that British workers are ""undercut"" by foreign workers prepared to enter the UK for lower salaries. ""In the longer term [this] prevents us from having a sustainable UK haulage sector because it could never stand on its own two feet,"" he said. Pressed on how public sector jobs have also been affected by Brexit, Mr Shapps argued there would be a potential workforce in the form of people coming off the furlough scheme who may be unemployed. He said: ""We're coming out of the coronavirus crisis where all of those millions of people were on furlough. Indeed this month 1.6 million are due to come off furlough and sadly not all will be going back to their old jobs. ""Economists tell us we're likely see influx of people out of work and looking for other jobs. Across sectors and in Scotland there is the opportunity for people to be retraining into other jobs.""

The DJ has missed a trick thoughâ¦ got to be some Pink with Get The Party Started. No? Something else that is likely to make the back pages.... Apparently Rory McIlroy used some choice words in a later interview with the host broadcaster:""Glad I got a point on the board for Europe, but disappointed I didn't do it sooner. ""I had two good opportunities Friday and Saturday to sort of lift us out of a hole and I wasn't able to do it. It sucks losing.

""You are trying to make me cry, aren't you... this is very special, growing up a couple of hours from here, to be with these guys. Come on, you guys show a little emotion too! ""This is a new era right here, they are young, motivated, they came here determined to win.

Despite a few reports of some past-the-mark sledging, the Wisconsinites have proved to be a friendly and respectful bunch. The European players, partners and support staff exit stage left as the American team move onto the stage set up in front of the 18th green. Here's Captain Stricker, glasses still on backwards: ""I knew from the start a couple of weeks ago when they all showed up here, apart from Brooks who was hurt, all the vice-captains showed up and we got involved early with each other, we learned the course. They came in very prepared. ""This is the greatest team of all time, you guys are unbelievable"" Right then, to the presentation. It's all very red up there. Phil Mickelson has the aviators on, Steve Stricker has his on the back of his baseball cap. Many ways to wear a pair of shades, folks. He'll be searching for those later.  Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Whistling Straits This place is ready to blow. Fans sprint down the hill when the rope is relaxed to about 30 yards shy of the putting surface. Watch yourselves guys! Itâs steep. Roars greet the shaking of hands between Daniel Berger and Matt Fitzpatrick, then the players and team staff flood the green. A polite message on the tannoy asks them to vacate the space, not before a line between the two teams. Great to see sportsmanship is not lost. That USA chant you've been hearing all week echoes around Whistling Straits - the Americans need to chug those beers and shape up for the presentation. Jonathan JurejkoBBC Sport at Whistling Straits Must be a good few hundred people congregated around the green now. Three broad camps - Team USA, Team Europe and media. There is plenty of freedom of movement though. A lot of the players exchange hugs, smiles and high five before separating into their two camps. Brooks Koepka and Bryson DeChambeau shared a little moment earlier too if youâre interested. 1UP Berger v Fitzpatrick (F) Ah, that's a rotten ending for Matt Fitzpatrick as he dunks his second shot into the creek down 18 and basically hands the hole, and the match, to Daniel Berger as he wins the last. Kind of sums up just how it's gone for Europe this week though. It means it's a huge victory for Team USA and the largest winning margin since Europe joined the Ryder Cup in 1979. Â© 2025 BBC.

Farmers warn of Christmas turkey shortage,"Paul Kelly says the damage has already been done for the turkey business this Christmas Farmers are warning of a Christmas turkey shortage because visa changes to allow labour recruitment from abroad have come too late. A poultry association said big producers have already scaled back because they assumed they would not have enough staff to process birds. And turkey farmer Paul Kelly told the BBC the damage had already been done. The government has announced a visa scheme to allow 5,500 poultry workers into the UK on three-month contracts. As part of the changes, 5,000 HGV drivers will be allowed into the UK on similar contracts in an attempt to keep supermarket shelves stocked and petrol stations supplied with fuel. Kate Martin, chairwoman of the Traditional Farm Fresh Turkey Association, said: ""This year it's looking like there is a national shortage of turkeys when we're talking about supermarket shelves, rather than buying direct from your farm. ""It is the supermarket shelves that will be emptier of turkeys this year than they have been before, only because there have been less turkeys placed on the ground; only because the big processers know that they will not get them processed."" She said some members of her association had already seen a rise in orders, with one reportedly seeing a 400% increase on last year. No fuel shortage, says transport secretary Hauliers and poultry workers to get temporary visas Ms Martin said farms ""are now missing a whole host of their workforce that they have been training and investing in over the last however many years. Those workers are no longer available for us to use on a seasonal basis - they will go find work in mainland Europe instead."" Paul Kelly, who runs the KellyBronze farm, said the major producers were resigned to producing fewer birds for Christmas. ""The damage has already been done for the bigger processors because they have not put the turkeys on the farm,"" he said. Smaller producers, however, might be better prepared as they tended to recruit local labour rather than draft in large numbers of migrant staff, he added. One supermarket group told the BBC it was far too early to speculate about Christmas stocks. The British Poultry Council has estimated there are nearly 7,000 vacancies across the sector, leading some chicken producers to cut their output, and sparking shortages at restaurant chains Nando's and KFC. Mr Kelly said: ""There are chickens being killed on farms at the moment. There are pigs being shot in fields, because there are not enough people there to do the jobs."" A temporary visa scheme ""is definitely not an answer"" for the long term, he added. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the package of visa measures would help the food and haulage industries cope in the run-up to Christmas. ""After a very difficult 18 months, I know how important this Christmas is for all of us and that's why we're taking these steps at the earliest opportunity to ensure preparations remain on track."" However, some business leaders said the measures did not go far enough, with the British Chambers of Commerce saying they were the equivalent of ""throwing a thimble of water on a bonfire"".

LiveLiveDead heat in German election - exit polls10 minutes ago,"Projected results from Germany's federal elections suggest the centre-left has edged ahead of the conservatives of Angela Merkel The centre-left SPD candidate, Olaf Scholz, said the country had voted for change It's the conservatives' worst-ever performance but leader Armin Laschet says it's all to play for Laschet says he too could lead a governing coalition, though he acknowledges the results are disappointing The parties in third and fourth place, the Greens and the liberal FDP, will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations Angela Merkel is standing down as chancellor after 16 years in power But with the race this tight, we could be waiting weeks to find out who gets the top job Paul Kirby, Claudia Allen and Joshua Nevett Thank you for following our live coverage of Germany's elections - which will, eventually, see a replacement for Angela Merkel as chancellor voted in by the new MPs. We're wrapping up our coverage now, but here are the main things you need to know from election night:  You can read our full news story on the electionhere.  Angela Merkel has dominated German politics for 16 years A reminder that Angela Merkel remains German chancellor until her replacement is elected by parliament - and that could easily take weeks or months. If she's still in post on 17 December she will become Germany's longest serving post-war chancellor. How will history remember her? Hereâs the assessment of four experts. She has turned German politics into a discussion about policy rather than politics, saysMatt Qvortrup, professor of political science at Coventry University. She has staged a bit of a revolution in German politics and world politics generally. Her position has been symbolically important for women's representation, saysCharlotte Galpin, senior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham. Yet, such symbolic representation doesn't automatically mean wider change, especially for women of colour and the LGBTQ+ community. Her policy legacy is a somewhat bizarre mix of modernisation and backwardness, saysDr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-Beck, professor of political science at the University of Mannheim. Many of the modernising features would not be expected from a Christian Democratic chancellor. Her legacy is a determined and silent one, saysDr Katrin Schreiter, lecturer in German and history at King's College London. Her leadership is based on sober evaluation and projecting reliability. You can read more expert verdicts on Merelâs legacyhere. As we've been reporting, the parties projected to come third and fourth in the election - the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) - will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations. While the Greens have been delighted at their relatively strong showing, their numbers have fallen substantially compared to opinion polls earlier in the summer - which showed the party in the lead nationally. Speaking to the BBC, Omid Nouripour, a member of parliament for the Greens and their spokesman on foreign affairs, said the party could have done better but it was fighting against public perceptions. ""This is one of the funniest moments when you are doing your campaign and people come over and tell you you're a prohibition party... you want to take us away cars, airplanes, I don't know, bridges or rivers or whatever,"" said Mr Nouripour. ""This is a clichÃ© which you have to tackle."" ""We didn't do a proper job on that in the last weeks and this is one of the mistakes maybe we have to talk about,"" he added. ""But at the end of the day these clichÃ©s will not last forever and we're going to fight it."" The Green lead candidate, Annalena Baerbock, promised the next government would be a climate government. But the Greens' policy of funding the fight against global warming through higher taxes is in direct contrast to the low taxation proposed by the FDP - a more natural ally of the centre right. The SDP and the conservatives have already made overtures - separately - to the FDP and the Greens, but negotiations are likely to be long and difficult. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin âShe brought a lot of stability, she was like a rock,â says 18-year-old student Laura of the outgoing chancellor. Angela Merkel is still a very popular leader, but when a government does eventually get formed, she will leave German politics for good. For Laura, the outgoing chancellor did not do a good enough job âBut especially when it comes to giving young people a voice, they really missed their shot. She didnât prepare this country for change.â In all, 14% of voters are under 30, but an estimated 38% are 60 or over. Tackling the climate crisis is key for âGeneration Merkelâ - some of whom can't remember another chancellor - and the Greens are most popular for 18- to 29-year-olds. âGermany should care less about making money and instead look after future generations. We should be an example for other countries,â says Rebecca, 23, from Berlin. Rebecca is among many Germans who see climate change as top priority Marion Wenzelâs home was ravaged by the summer floods in Ahrweiler. âIâm so busy with rebuilding I didnât have any time for the partiesâ programmes.Our biggest task is to have a clear way for the future.â Blogger Diana zur LÃ¶wen, 26, is worried that not enough will change: âWe have to tackle digitisation and optimise education. Iâm not sure if all the parties have a good programme for that. Young people are not really the main focus.â Manuela Schwesig has won a convincing victory in state elections We've been focusing on the federal elections - but two German states are also voting in new assemblies. In the north-eastern Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the SPD are well ahead of all the other parties. State premier Manuela Schwesig is set to stay in the role she's held since 2017. In Berlin the SPD are also ahead in the battle to control the city-state's assembly - but the Greens are close behind them. Charlotte GalpinSenior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham The AfD has been particularly strong in eastern German states in recent years Following its first entry into the Bundestag in 2017, the AfD is set to repeat its success at this election. While in some regions support for the party has declined, and its highs of around 15% in the polls around 2018/9 have dropped, it had been polling at a steady 10-12% across Germany ahead of the election. Tonight's preliminary results show it is likely to receive about 11% of the vote nationally, and be the largest party in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia. These are territories of the former GDR where the radical right has been particularly strong since the early 1990s, and which suffered socio-economic deprivation as a result of the reunification between East and West Germany. While in other regions the AfDâs support is lower, the consistent support for an anti-immigration and Islamophobic party of around a tenth of voters across Germany demonstrates a wider problem with racism and suggests that the party has found a steady core voter base. The Greens were leading in the polls at one point The Greens are on track to be part of the next government based on tonight's results. For a brief period during the election campaign the Greens and their candidate, Annalena Baerbock, topped the opinion polls with 28%. For a party that had only once previously polled more than 10% in a national election (in 2009) these were dizzying heights and further proof that climate change had moved front and centre in German minds. The Green Party has been in government before as a junior partner, but never with this level of support. You might remember Joschka Fischer, the Greensâ leader who served as foreign minister and vice-chancellor from 1998-2005 under Germanyâs last centre-left leader Gerhard SchrÃ¶der. With the centre-left Social Democrats (SDP) on course for a narrow victory, members have been reflecting on what a win would mean for the party, which hasn't led a German government since 2005. Katarina Barley, a senior European Parliament member with the SDP, told the BBC that it would amount to ""absolute revival."" ""Yes of course, we would have liked to be in front more clearly, but I'm sure that this will evolve through the evening,"" Ms Barley said. She suggested that more was achievable on issues like climate change in a coalition which did not feature the conservative CDU/CSU alliance. ""When it comes to climate change, there is not much you can do. [Conservatives] oppose nearly everything, and you see it in the states also where the conservatives are in coalitions with the Greens - nothing moves,"" said Ms Barley. ""So if we get out of this coalition with the conservatives, I think we will see a lot of progress when it comes to climate change,"" she added. Some children have given politicians a tough time on the campaign trail Kids can be cruel, especially to German politicians, it seems. Surprisingly, the toughest interviewers of the election campaign turned out to be children. First, there was the grilling of Tino Chrupalla, one of the lead candidates for the far-right AfD party. He said wanted more German poems taught in schools but, when asked to name one, couldnât do so. âMy favourite poem is... I canât think of any,â he said, after a long and painful pause. Then there was the child interrogation of the three main chancellor candidates in a toy-filled tent. When quizzed about his âunhealthyâ smoking habit, a flustered Armin Laschet replied: âYes, thatâs right but so many things are unhealthy. But I donât really inhale.â Youngsters gave Olaf Scholz and Annelena Baerbock a rough ride too. Scholz was asked to explain why the German government hadnât done more to stop migrants from drowning en route to Europe, while Baerbock faced a bruising question about allegations she inflated her achievements on her CV. Dr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-BeckProfessor of political science at the University of Mannheim Armin Laschet has taken a battering in media coverage of his campaign The CDUâs dramatic shift in the polls from quiet erosion into something more reminiscent of an implosion can be attributed to a â partly self-induced â leadership crisis. The party can thank the unshakeable popularity of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel for a significant portion of its remaining support in recent years. The boots her successor is supposed to fill are very large indeed, and there are doubts over whether Armin Laschet has the necessary stature for this monumental task. The challenges, criticism, and backstabbing from within his own party, even before his nomination, were not exactly helpful. His media image quickly crystallised into one of a candidate of dubious competence in matters of policy and limited ability as a campaigner, but with a great talent for gaffes. In media coverage, everything Laschet came up with was interpreted as a tactical stunt, hastily thought up in a desperate attempt to keep the ship from sinking. Of course, this kind of news coverage can only further undermine the candidateâs credibility among voters. For Laschet, it appeared impossible to escape this narrative. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin Angela Merkelâs conservatives are heading for a
historically low result in Germany's election, with latest projections coming in at
just above 24%. âWeâre disappointedâ, says Peter, a CDU member in Berlin.
âWeâre confident that weâre still in the game for forming a government. But we
thought we would be above 30%.â Eva believes not enough emphasis was put on the party's policies Eva, another CDU supporter, tells me these elections were more about choosing individual candidates than party programmes. ""I think that is what put us off.â Members still found a reason to cheer at a local election party tonight: âThere was no majority for the leftist parties and thatâs a good thing, I think,"" says Johannes. A coalition between the Social Democrats, Greens and the far left  will be impossible if projected results are borne out. While the results are still trickling in, we know that it's likely that more than two political parties will be needed to form a majority in Germany's next parliament. That's because - even if they do get just enough seats to form a majority together - the two main parties, the SPD and the CDU/CSU, are not at all keen to continue to work together in coalition, as they have been doing for the past four years. The SPD looks to be in pole position to lead the next government, as it is currently projected to win the largest share of the vote nationally, albeit by a slim margin. Letâs walk you through some of the coalition combinations that are possible, based on preliminary results. Each combination is given a nickname based on the traditional colours of each party.  It's worth noting that theâred-red-greenâcoalition does not seem possible at this point, because the left-wing Die Linke party is not projected to win enough votes to enter the Bundestag. And the far-right AfD are unpalatable to all the other parties - so they won't feature in any coalition at the federal level. The two other coalition possibilities shown above would have enough seats to govern - but are unlikely as they both require the conservatives and the centre-left SPD to team up (with the addition of a third party). And as we've said, that prospect is unappealing to the two big ""people's parties"", as they're known in Germany. We're just hearing that the conservative CDU has lost the constituency of Chancellor Angela Merkel - who's standing down as an MP at this election - in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state. The centre-left SPD has won the seat in the far north-east of the country. Mrs Merkel has held the constituency since 1990, so this victory for the centre-left marks a major shift. We'll bring you further results from across the country as we get them. Here's a quick look at the three biggest parties' plans for the German economy, should they be in government after today's vote. The conservative CDU/CSU have promised no tax increases and tight public finances.They want Germany to return to a balanced budget after debt ticked up during the pandemic. The SPD wants to build 100,000 new social housing annually, a minimum wage of â¬12 (Â£10; $14) an hour, and a wealth tax of 1% to address inequality. The Greens also want to raise the hourly minimum wage to â¬12, and bump the top tax rate from the current 42% to 48%. A party's underway at the Greens' election event in Berlin - as supporters celebrate the party's best-ever parliamentary election results. The BBC's Damien McGuinness is there...

Two parties appear to have cornered the under-30s vote in this election, according to initial projections. The Greens and the liberal FDP between them appear to have polled over 40% of younger voters. The FDP and Greens look like they're potential kingmakers in the upcoming coalition talks, whichever of the two biggest parties ends up with the most seats in parliament. What's perhaps surprising is that the Social Democrats didn't do quite as well with younger voters. Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) top candidate Alice Weidel said her party had done well The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is on course to win the largest share of the vote in the eastern state of Saxony, according to preliminary results. So far, the party has won more than 28% of second votes (which show voters' party preference) in the state, well ahead of the SPD with 19%. The AfD has also performed well in the neighbouring state of Thuringia, with 24% of the second votes (slightly ahead of the SPD on 23%). In recent years the AfD has tended to do well in eastern Germany. The AfD has managed to woo voters from the centre-right and even the centre-left with its emphasis on Islam and migration. Those issues have galvanised some voters, especially men with nationalist attitudes. But on a national level, the party's share of the vote in this election is projected to be lower than the last one in 2017, when it received almost 13%. Earlier Alice Weidel, one of the party's top candidates, said considering the negative media treatment of the AfD, the party had done well. ""We are in the double figures, we have been able to assert ourselves,"" she said. All the other parties likely to be represented in the Bundestag have long ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD. BBC World Service ""We have made
climate change the number one issue in this election, it's been a climate
election and that's a victory for the Greens"". That's the verdict of Daniel Freund, a German member of the European Parliament for the Greens. On climate policy he told the BBC World Service:
""It is important that we get into action now, that we start shutting off
the coal power plants very soon, we will then increase measures as we go"". I absolutely believe that Germany can abandon coal by 2023. It is absolutely crucial that we make this exit sooner than currently agreed Daniel Freund, Green MEP Thumbs up for the SPD's Olaf Scholz It's just after 23:00 local time, and the centre-left Social Democrats look to be on course for a razor-thin victory in Germany's parliamentary elections - but they will need to form a coalition to build the next government. The party's candidate Olaf Scholz has said the country voted for change - and says voters want him to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor after 16 years. Even so, Armin Laschet, the candidate for Mrs Merkel's conservatives, has declared the outcome ""unclear"" and said he too wants to become Germany's new chancellor. But he acknowledged his party has plunged to a historic low. The progressive Greens appear to have made big gains, but not to have a viable shot at the chancellery. Along with the free-market Free Democrats, they look likely to play a key role in coalition talks. But with many more people voting by post than usual, it could be a while before we know the full outcome of the poll. Nick BeakeBBC News, SPD HQ in Berlin We just tried to ask Olaf
Scholz if heâs confident heâll soon be dealing with Boris Johnson and other
world leaders, but he was tight-lipped and his sizable security guards
whisked him away. But latest projections have given the SPD a slight lead and, after several hours of relative quiet, they've decided it's safe to strike
up the band. First up was Donât Stop Believing and it seems
the party faithful heading to the impromptu dancefloor are increasingly
confident in their belief their man will lead the next coalition government. We
hear the party leader has now gone for the night. As he slipped into the warm Berlin evening air, Message in a Bottle was blasting out. The young SPD party
members think the German people have sent a message at the
ballot box. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailersA trade body says filling stations are running out as ministers seek to bring in overseas lorry drivers.,"Offering temporary visas to foreign lorry drivers will not be enough to solve supply chain issues, retailers and hauliers have said. The government's planned measures would not fix the ""ultra-short term"" problems caused by panic buying, the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said. It said some of its members say their forecourts are running dry and others ""are partly dry and running out soon"". Long queues have formed and pumps have closed at some filling stations. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has blamed the Road Haulage Association for triggering a ""rush on petrol stations"". He also told the BBC's Andrew Marr Showthere was ""plenty of fuel""and that he had checked with the six refineries and 47 storage centres in the country. But Brian Madderson, chairman of the PRA, which represents about 5,500 independent petrol stations, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that while there was plenty of fuel in the country ""it is in the wrong place for the motorist"" - in terminals and the refineries. He said: ""Those measures introduced by the government this weekend are not ultra-short term. ""We might see benefits of them later in the autumn as the drivers come across and start to work. But in the very short-term this panic buying has caused really serious problems."" He added that ""between 50% and 90%"" of the PRA's members had reported their forecourts were running dry and ""those that aren't dry are partly dry and running out soon"". How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Nike and Costco warn of product shortages and delays Farmers warn of Christmas turkey shortage A shortage of lorry drivers has caused problems for a range of industries in recent months, from supermarkets to fast food chains. Are you a HGV driver in the EU? Does the temporary visa scheme appeal to you? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. In recent days, some fuel deliveries have been affected, leading to lengthy queues at some petrol stations. On Saturdaythe government announced measuresto give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers in a bid to limit disruption in the build up to Christmas. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""There is plenty of petrol in the country"" Other measures include sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence - to encourage them back into the industry - as well as using Ministry of Defence examiners to increase testing capacity for those entering the industry. The British Retail Consortium welcomed the additional drivers, but said the numbers were ""too small"" to make an impact on the disruption expected at Christmas. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability policy at the trade association, told the BBC: ""I think we're going to see less choice, less availability, possibly a shorter shelf life as well, which is really disappointing because this could have been averted. ""Five thousand drivers, don't get me wrong, that will help and that will make some difference, but we needed so much more than that."" The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the ""limited scope"" of the government's announcement had ""surprised many"" and called for a committee of key government ministers similar to those set up to handle emergencies like flooding or the pandemic to be established to help alleviate the short-term pressures being experienced as the economy bounces back after the coronavirus pandemic. Kayleigh Robinson, a mental health nurse, said she was unable to get diesel at four petrol stations Kayleigh Robinson, who works in Hampshire as a mental health nurse, said she was left unable to make the 37-mile drive to work on Sunday after she was unable to get diesel at four petrol stations. ""It's not something I was expecting. ""When you're working long shifts you don't really get a chance to see the news that often."" In the end, her work arranged a taxi to pick her up and take her back home. Adrienne Kenny, from Cambridge, said she would be unable to go to work as a health, safety and environmental manager for a construction firm on Monday because she needed to drive to Leeds. She said she had tried three petrol stations on Saturday but ""couldn't get diesel anywhere"" before trying another six without success on Sunday, leading her to postpone her meeting. Mr Shapps said he did not want to ""undercut"" British workers by bringing in people from overseas but could not ""stand by and watch while queues are forming"". The transport secretary said there was not a ""dramatic shortage in drivers"" for the fuel industry, with only ""one, two, three hundred drivers"" needed for distribution to petrol stations. Supermarket Asda said it had put a Â£30 limit on fuel transactions but said that it had good levels of fuel supply. Sainsbury's said it was experiencing ""very high demand for fuel"", while Morrisons said it was a ""rapidly moving situation"" and it was working hard to keep its pumps open. Earlier, Mr Shapps blamed ""irresponsible briefing"" by the Road Haulage Association (RHA) for triggering panic buying, after reports that someone from the group had selectively leaked comments about heavy goods vehicle (HGV) driver shortages at fuel firms. RHA spokesman Rod McKenzie said it was ""absolute nonsense"" and that he had not been at the meeting where the issue was raised. A survey from earlier this year suggests a number of reasons for the driver shortage Freight industry group Logistics UK estimates that the UK needs about 90,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by the pandemic, tax changes, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the situation showed a ""complete lack of planning"" from the government. Asked if he would bring in 100,000 foreign drivers, Sir Keir said: ""We have to issue enough visas to cover the number of drivers that we need."" The Liberal Democrats said the transport secretary was ""passing the buck"" by criticising the Road Haulage Association. The party's business, trade and transport spokeswoman, Sarah Olney, added that the government had ""repeatedly ignored calls from businesses to address the shortage of drivers"". Recruitment for additional short-term HGV drivers and poultry workers will begin in October, with the visas valid until Christmas Eve. Turkey farmer Kate Martin has warned supermarkets could run out of birds before Christmas. She said there were fewer turkeys being produced because because the big processors ""know they will not get them processed"".

Any tax rises under Labour will be fair - Starmer,"This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer: ""We will not unfairly hit working families"" Sir Keir Starmer has not ruled out tax rises if Labour wins power, but he promised they would ""not unfairly hit working families"". The party leader told the BBC's Andrew Marr: ""We want those with the broadest shoulders to pay."" But he said it was too far from an election to make firm tax commitments. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said she did not have ""any plans to increase the rates of income tax"" if Labour wins the next election. Asked about her comments by Andrew Marr, Sir Keir said: ""We are looking at tax, nothing is off the table, but we don't know what state of finances will be as we go into the election and nor does anybody else."" Rayner won't apologise for calling PM 'scum' Labour members back nationalising energy industry Starmer should fight election on Brexit - Benn He accused Prime Minister Boris Johnson of ""whacking working people"" with a tax hike, withhis plan to increase National Insuranceto pay for the NHS and social care. In his Marr interview, the Labour leader revealed he would not nationalise the big six energy companies if he were to become prime minister - despite a pledge to support ""common ownership"" of the sector in his party leadership campaign last year. Rachel Reeves will give her first speech to conference as shadow chancellor on Monday He said he would be ""pragmatic"" and not ""ideological"" when it came to nationalisation, saying: ""Where common ownership is value for money for the tax payer and delivers better services then there should be common ownership."" But the former leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, called on Sir Keir to stick to his pledge and show more ""radicalism"", claiming the result would be ""the opinion polls [starting] to move upwards."" The Labour conference, in Brighton, backed a motion, put forward by Unite and the CWU union, calling for the nationalisation of energy companies. The Labour leader also promised children in England an ""education fit for the future"", paid for by a tax on private schools, if he wins power, in aninterview with The Sunday Mirror,external. Ms Reeves will unveil more details in her conference speech on Monday, but a number of Labour's tax and spending policies have already been confirmed: A new ""Office of Value for Money"" to scrutinise government spending and ensure tax is used wisely Covering all day-to-day spending by balancing the current budget - but also borrowing to invest Introducing a target to reduce the national debt Who are the people with ""the broadest shoulders"" who will pay more tax under a Labour government? The party has given two specific examples recently. Removing the charitable status of private schools would make them pay an estimated Â£1.5bn a year in tax. Making private equity fund managers pay full income tax on a type of earning called ""carried interest"" would raise about Â£440m. In an interviewwith the Sunday Times,external, Rachel Reeves suggested a few more: income from stocks and shares and buy-to-let properties. What the general public would really notice, though, are changes to the rates of the big things we all pay: income tax and national insurance. And Starmer and Reeves have kept their options open on a potential rise in the former or whether they'd scrap the government's increase of the second. But the ""broadest shoulders"" rhetoric suggests any increase would be targeted at the wealthy. Which means we really need to know how Labour would apply their tape measure to the nation's shoulders to separate the broad from the narrow. Elsewhere at the conference, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband set out plans to ""green"" the UK steel industry by investing Â£3bn over 10 years in decarbonisation. The former Labour leader also accused the Conservatives failing to protect steelmakers from being undercut by cheap steel imports, as well as spending tens of millions on imported steel to build schools and hospitals. Mr Miliband also describe the current gas prices crisis as a ""disaster made in Downing Street"" because of ""inaction"" from the government, adding: ""As we respond to the climate crisis with all the transformation that entails, we have a fateful choice to make. ""We can try and put a green coat of paint on an unfair, unequal, unjust Britain, or we can make a different choice.""

Energy regulator says gas crisis not its fault,"The head of Ofgem has rejected claims from the industry the current energy crisis represents a failure to adequately regulate the market. Six suppliers have gone bust recently, leaving about 1.5 million customers facing higher bills, with more firms expected to fold. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley, told the BBC: ""No-one could have predicted the kind of gas price rises we have seen. ""In a situation like that any market would be under strain."" Gas prices are up four-fold, Mr Brearley said. However, his view has little support from senior executives in the industry who have told the BBC the regulator knew full well that many smaller suppliers would not be resilient in the face of rises that should have been part of the regulator's stress testing of the sector. Thousands of energy customers facing bill shocks Why are gas prices high and what's the energy price cap? The boss of the UK's fifth largest energy provider, Scottish Power, said the government was essentially asking larger providers to weaken their own financial position by shouldering billions in additional cost to provide these customers with energy that costs more to buy than they are allowed to sell it for under a government-imposed retail price cap. Ofgem insists its primary concern has been protecting consumers, but that promise sounds slightly hollow when millions of customers face being moved to higher tariffs from bigger suppliers and the cost those larger companies incur from taking on new customers will be added to all consumers bills through an industry wide levy. Larger suppliers, including Centrica owned-British Gas, have agreed to take on hundreds of thousands of marooned customers, but expect the cost of doing so to be recouped in a mechanism that Ofgem described as ""tried and tested"" but which bigger companies say is not designed for the mass failures we are now seeing. The Ofgem boss admits that the energy cap (Â£1,277 for a dual fuel household with average energy consumption) which limits the ability of companies to pass on higher wholesale costs to retail customers, is likely to rise again when it is reset in April 2022 after a 12% rise due to take effect at the end of this month. Industry sources also agree that many of the larger companies may be prepared to take on new customers not only because the retail price cap will inevitably rise, but also because the new customers they acquire will be ""stickier"". This means they will be less likely to switch in future given a lack of confidence that cheaper suppliers can be relied upon in the future, The received wisdom and advice of the last ten years to continually switch suppliers now looks less persuasive. Ofgem's Mr Brearley insists he wants a competitive market in the future. Critics argue that it presided over a market that it knew would collapse in a gas crunch - resulting in fewer companies and meaning a less competitive market.

LiveLivePolls closing soon in unpredictable German electionLess than a minute ago,"Projected results from Germany's federal elections suggest the centre-left has edged ahead of the conservatives of Angela Merkel The centre-left SPD candidate, Olaf Scholz, said the country had voted for change It's the conservatives' worst-ever performance but leader Armin Laschet says it's all to play for Laschet says he too could lead a governing coalition, though he acknowledges the results are disappointing The parties in third and fourth place, the Greens and the liberal FDP, will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations Angela Merkel is standing down as chancellor after 16 years in power But with the race this tight, we could be waiting weeks to find out who gets the top job Paul Kirby, Claudia Allen and Joshua Nevett Thank you for following our live coverage of Germany's elections - which will, eventually, see a replacement for Angela Merkel as chancellor voted in by the new MPs. We're wrapping up our coverage now, but here are the main things you need to know from election night:  You can read our full news story on the electionhere.  Angela Merkel has dominated German politics for 16 years A reminder that Angela Merkel remains German chancellor until her replacement is elected by parliament - and that could easily take weeks or months. If she's still in post on 17 December she will become Germany's longest serving post-war chancellor. How will history remember her? Hereâs the assessment of four experts. She has turned German politics into a discussion about policy rather than politics, saysMatt Qvortrup, professor of political science at Coventry University. She has staged a bit of a revolution in German politics and world politics generally. Her position has been symbolically important for women's representation, saysCharlotte Galpin, senior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham. Yet, such symbolic representation doesn't automatically mean wider change, especially for women of colour and the LGBTQ+ community. Her policy legacy is a somewhat bizarre mix of modernisation and backwardness, saysDr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-Beck, professor of political science at the University of Mannheim. Many of the modernising features would not be expected from a Christian Democratic chancellor. Her legacy is a determined and silent one, saysDr Katrin Schreiter, lecturer in German and history at King's College London. Her leadership is based on sober evaluation and projecting reliability. You can read more expert verdicts on Merelâs legacyhere. As we've been reporting, the parties projected to come third and fourth in the election - the Greens and the liberal Free Democrats (FDP) - will be the kingmakers in coalition negotiations. While the Greens have been delighted at their relatively strong showing, their numbers have fallen substantially compared to opinion polls earlier in the summer - which showed the party in the lead nationally. Speaking to the BBC, Omid Nouripour, a member of parliament for the Greens and their spokesman on foreign affairs, said the party could have done better but it was fighting against public perceptions. ""This is one of the funniest moments when you are doing your campaign and people come over and tell you you're a prohibition party... you want to take us away cars, airplanes, I don't know, bridges or rivers or whatever,"" said Mr Nouripour. ""This is a clichÃ© which you have to tackle."" ""We didn't do a proper job on that in the last weeks and this is one of the mistakes maybe we have to talk about,"" he added. ""But at the end of the day these clichÃ©s will not last forever and we're going to fight it."" The Green lead candidate, Annalena Baerbock, promised the next government would be a climate government. But the Greens' policy of funding the fight against global warming through higher taxes is in direct contrast to the low taxation proposed by the FDP - a more natural ally of the centre right. The SDP and the conservatives have already made overtures - separately - to the FDP and the Greens, but negotiations are likely to be long and difficult. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin âShe brought a lot of stability, she was like a rock,â says 18-year-old student Laura of the outgoing chancellor. Angela Merkel is still a very popular leader, but when a government does eventually get formed, she will leave German politics for good. For Laura, the outgoing chancellor did not do a good enough job âBut especially when it comes to giving young people a voice, they really missed their shot. She didnât prepare this country for change.â In all, 14% of voters are under 30, but an estimated 38% are 60 or over. Tackling the climate crisis is key for âGeneration Merkelâ - some of whom can't remember another chancellor - and the Greens are most popular for 18- to 29-year-olds. âGermany should care less about making money and instead look after future generations. We should be an example for other countries,â says Rebecca, 23, from Berlin. Rebecca is among many Germans who see climate change as top priority Marion Wenzelâs home was ravaged by the summer floods in Ahrweiler. âIâm so busy with rebuilding I didnât have any time for the partiesâ programmes.Our biggest task is to have a clear way for the future.â Blogger Diana zur LÃ¶wen, 26, is worried that not enough will change: âWe have to tackle digitisation and optimise education. Iâm not sure if all the parties have a good programme for that. Young people are not really the main focus.â Manuela Schwesig has won a convincing victory in state elections We've been focusing on the federal elections - but two German states are also voting in new assemblies. In the north-eastern Mecklenburg-West Pomerania, the SPD are well ahead of all the other parties. State premier Manuela Schwesig is set to stay in the role she's held since 2017. In Berlin the SPD are also ahead in the battle to control the city-state's assembly - but the Greens are close behind them. Charlotte GalpinSenior lecturer in German and European politics at the University of Birmingham The AfD has been particularly strong in eastern German states in recent years Following its first entry into the Bundestag in 2017, the AfD is set to repeat its success at this election. While in some regions support for the party has declined, and its highs of around 15% in the polls around 2018/9 have dropped, it had been polling at a steady 10-12% across Germany ahead of the election. Tonight's preliminary results show it is likely to receive about 11% of the vote nationally, and be the largest party in the eastern states of Saxony and Thuringia. These are territories of the former GDR where the radical right has been particularly strong since the early 1990s, and which suffered socio-economic deprivation as a result of the reunification between East and West Germany. While in other regions the AfDâs support is lower, the consistent support for an anti-immigration and Islamophobic party of around a tenth of voters across Germany demonstrates a wider problem with racism and suggests that the party has found a steady core voter base. The Greens were leading in the polls at one point The Greens are on track to be part of the next government based on tonight's results. For a brief period during the election campaign the Greens and their candidate, Annalena Baerbock, topped the opinion polls with 28%. For a party that had only once previously polled more than 10% in a national election (in 2009) these were dizzying heights and further proof that climate change had moved front and centre in German minds. The Green Party has been in government before as a junior partner, but never with this level of support. You might remember Joschka Fischer, the Greensâ leader who served as foreign minister and vice-chancellor from 1998-2005 under Germanyâs last centre-left leader Gerhard SchrÃ¶der. With the centre-left Social Democrats (SDP) on course for a narrow victory, members have been reflecting on what a win would mean for the party, which hasn't led a German government since 2005. Katarina Barley, a senior European Parliament member with the SDP, told the BBC that it would amount to ""absolute revival."" ""Yes of course, we would have liked to be in front more clearly, but I'm sure that this will evolve through the evening,"" Ms Barley said. She suggested that more was achievable on issues like climate change in a coalition which did not feature the conservative CDU/CSU alliance. ""When it comes to climate change, there is not much you can do. [Conservatives] oppose nearly everything, and you see it in the states also where the conservatives are in coalitions with the Greens - nothing moves,"" said Ms Barley. ""So if we get out of this coalition with the conservatives, I think we will see a lot of progress when it comes to climate change,"" she added. Some children have given politicians a tough time on the campaign trail Kids can be cruel, especially to German politicians, it seems. Surprisingly, the toughest interviewers of the election campaign turned out to be children. First, there was the grilling of Tino Chrupalla, one of the lead candidates for the far-right AfD party. He said wanted more German poems taught in schools but, when asked to name one, couldnât do so. âMy favourite poem is... I canât think of any,â he said, after a long and painful pause. Then there was the child interrogation of the three main chancellor candidates in a toy-filled tent. When quizzed about his âunhealthyâ smoking habit, a flustered Armin Laschet replied: âYes, thatâs right but so many things are unhealthy. But I donât really inhale.â Youngsters gave Olaf Scholz and Annelena Baerbock a rough ride too. Scholz was asked to explain why the German government hadnât done more to stop migrants from drowning en route to Europe, while Baerbock faced a bruising question about allegations she inflated her achievements on her CV. Dr RÃ¼diger Schmitt-BeckProfessor of political science at the University of Mannheim Armin Laschet has taken a battering in media coverage of his campaign The CDUâs dramatic shift in the polls from quiet erosion into something more reminiscent of an implosion can be attributed to a â partly self-induced â leadership crisis. The party can thank the unshakeable popularity of outgoing Chancellor Angela Merkel for a significant portion of its remaining support in recent years. The boots her successor is supposed to fill are very large indeed, and there are doubts over whether Armin Laschet has the necessary stature for this monumental task. The challenges, criticism, and backstabbing from within his own party, even before his nomination, were not exactly helpful. His media image quickly crystallised into one of a candidate of dubious competence in matters of policy and limited ability as a campaigner, but with a great talent for gaffes. In media coverage, everything Laschet came up with was interpreted as a tactical stunt, hastily thought up in a desperate attempt to keep the ship from sinking. Of course, this kind of news coverage can only further undermine the candidateâs credibility among voters. For Laschet, it appeared impossible to escape this narrative. Sira ThierijBBC News, Berlin Angela Merkelâs conservatives are heading for a
historically low result in Germany's election, with latest projections coming in at
just above 24%. âWeâre disappointedâ, says Peter, a CDU member in Berlin.
âWeâre confident that weâre still in the game for forming a government. But we
thought we would be above 30%.â Eva believes not enough emphasis was put on the party's policies Eva, another CDU supporter, tells me these elections were more about choosing individual candidates than party programmes. ""I think that is what put us off.â Members still found a reason to cheer at a local election party tonight: âThere was no majority for the leftist parties and thatâs a good thing, I think,"" says Johannes. A coalition between the Social Democrats, Greens and the far left  will be impossible if projected results are borne out. While the results are still trickling in, we know that it's likely that more than two political parties will be needed to form a majority in Germany's next parliament. That's because - even if they do get just enough seats to form a majority together - the two main parties, the SPD and the CDU/CSU, are not at all keen to continue to work together in coalition, as they have been doing for the past four years. The SPD looks to be in pole position to lead the next government, as it is currently projected to win the largest share of the vote nationally, albeit by a slim margin. Letâs walk you through some of the coalition combinations that are possible, based on preliminary results. Each combination is given a nickname based on the traditional colours of each party.  It's worth noting that theâred-red-greenâcoalition does not seem possible at this point, because the left-wing Die Linke party is not projected to win enough votes to enter the Bundestag. And the far-right AfD are unpalatable to all the other parties - so they won't feature in any coalition at the federal level. The two other coalition possibilities shown above would have enough seats to govern - but are unlikely as they both require the conservatives and the centre-left SPD to team up (with the addition of a third party). And as we've said, that prospect is unappealing to the two big ""people's parties"", as they're known in Germany. We're just hearing that the conservative CDU has lost the constituency of Chancellor Angela Merkel - who's standing down as an MP at this election - in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania state. The centre-left SPD has won the seat in the far north-east of the country. Mrs Merkel has held the constituency since 1990, so this victory for the centre-left marks a major shift. We'll bring you further results from across the country as we get them. Here's a quick look at the three biggest parties' plans for the German economy, should they be in government after today's vote. The conservative CDU/CSU have promised no tax increases and tight public finances.They want Germany to return to a balanced budget after debt ticked up during the pandemic. The SPD wants to build 100,000 new social housing annually, a minimum wage of â¬12 (Â£10; $14) an hour, and a wealth tax of 1% to address inequality.

Two parties appear to have cornered the under-30s vote in this election, according to initial projections. The Greens and the liberal FDP between them appear to have polled over 40% of younger voters. The FDP and Greens look like they're potential kingmakers in the upcoming coalition talks, whichever of the two biggest parties ends up with the most seats in parliament. What's perhaps surprising is that the Social Democrats didn't do quite as well with younger voters. Far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) top candidate Alice Weidel said her party had done well The far-right Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is on course to win the largest share of the vote in the eastern state of Saxony, according to preliminary results. So far, the party has won more than 28% of second votes (which show voters' party preference) in the state, well ahead of the SPD with 19%. The AfD has also performed well in the neighbouring state of Thuringia, with 24% of the second votes (slightly ahead of the SPD on 23%). In recent years the AfD has tended to do well in eastern Germany. The AfD has managed to woo voters from the centre-right and even the centre-left with its emphasis on Islam and migration. Those issues have galvanised some voters, especially men with nationalist attitudes. But on a national level, the party's share of the vote in this election is projected to be lower than the last one in 2017, when it received almost 13%. Earlier Alice Weidel, one of the party's top candidates, said considering the negative media treatment of the AfD, the party had done well. ""We are in the double figures, we have been able to assert ourselves,"" she said. All the other parties likely to be represented in the Bundestag have long ruled out forming a coalition with the AfD. BBC World Service ""We have made
climate change the number one issue in this election, it's been a climate
election and that's a victory for the Greens"". That's the verdict of Daniel Freund, a German member of the European Parliament for the Greens. On climate policy he told the BBC World Service:
""It is important that we get into action now, that we start shutting off
the coal power plants very soon, we will then increase measures as we go"". I absolutely believe that Germany can abandon coal by 2023. It is absolutely crucial that we make this exit sooner than currently agreed Daniel Freund, Green MEP Thumbs up for the SPD's Olaf Scholz It's just after 23:00 local time, and the centre-left Social Democrats look to be on course for a razor-thin victory in Germany's parliamentary elections - but they will need to form a coalition to build the next government. The party's candidate Olaf Scholz has said the country voted for change - and says voters want him to replace Angela Merkel as chancellor after 16 years. Even so, Armin Laschet, the candidate for Mrs Merkel's conservatives, has declared the outcome ""unclear"" and said he too wants to become Germany's new chancellor. But he acknowledged his party has plunged to a historic low. The progressive Greens appear to have made big gains, but not to have a viable shot at the chancellery. Along with the free-market Free Democrats, they look likely to play a key role in coalition talks. But with many more people voting by post than usual, it could be a while before we know the full outcome of the poll. Nick BeakeBBC News, SPD HQ in Berlin We just tried to ask Olaf
Scholz if heâs confident heâll soon be dealing with Boris Johnson and other
world leaders, but he was tight-lipped and his sizable security guards
whisked him away. But latest projections have given the SPD a slight lead and, after several hours of relative quiet, they've decided it's safe to strike
up the band. First up was Donât Stop Believing and it seems
the party faithful heading to the impromptu dancefloor are increasingly
confident in their belief their man will lead the next coalition government. We
hear the party leader has now gone for the night. As he slipped into the warm Berlin evening air, Message in a Bottle was blasting out. The young SPD party
members think the German people have sent a message at the
ballot box. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"No fuel shortage, says transport secretary","This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""There is plenty of petrol in the country"" There is ""no shortage of fuel"" and people should be ""sensible"" and fill up only when they need to, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said. It comes as there are long queues and closed pumps at some filling stations. Mr Shapps blamed the Road Haulage Association for triggering a ""rush on petrol stations"". He said he was introducing a ""big package"" of measures,including temporary visas for lorry drivers, to help the situation. The transport secretary said there was ""plenty of fuel"" and that he had checked with the six refineries and 47 storage centres in the country. But the Petrol Retailers Association said that ""between 50% and 90%"" of its members' forecourts are dry. Mr Shapps told the BBC's Andrew Marr said that a shortage of heavy goods vehicle (HGV) drivers was ""not anything new"" but said ""irresponsible briefing"" to the press following a meeting with road haulage groups had sparked a reaction from people. TheMail on Sunday,externalreported that someone from the Road Haulage Association had selectively leaked comments about HGV driver shortages at fuel firms. But spokesman Rod McKenzie told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House that it was ""absolute nonsense"" and said he had not been at the meeting. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Nike and Costco warn of product shortages and delays A shortage of lorry drivers has caused problems for a range of industries in recent months, from supermarkets to fast food chains. In recent days, some fuel deliveries have been affected, leading to lengthy queues at petrol stations - with reports of dozens of cars queuing in London by 07:00 BST on Sunday morning. Supermarket Sainsbury's said it was experiencing ""very high demand for fuel"", while Morrisons said it was a ""rapidly moving situation"" and it was working hard to keep its pumps open. Asda said it had put a Â£30 limit on fuel transactions and said that it had good levels of fuel supply. Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that the forecourts which were not dry were ""partly dry and running out soon"". ""That is something which the government obviously are loathe to recognise,"" he said. ""There is plenty of fuel in this country but it is in the wrong place for the motorist."" Freight industry group Logistics UK estimates that the UK needs about 90,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by the pandemic, tax changes, Brexit, an ageing workforce, and low wages and poor working conditions. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the situation showed a ""complete lack of planning"" from the government. He said the situation had been known about for years and said ""we knew in particular that when we exited the EU there would be a need for a back-up plan to deal with the situation."" He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson needed to say what he was going to do about the situation on Sunday. Asked if he would bring in 100,000 foreign drivers, Sir Keir said: ""We have to issue enough visas to cover the number of drivers that we need."" Under plans to limit supply disruption in the run up to Christmas up to 5,000 lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers could receive UK visas, the government announced on Saturday. Logistics UK welcomed the policy calling it ""a huge step forward in solving the disruption to supply chains"". But the British Chambers of Commerce said the measures were the equivalent of ""throwing a thimble of water on a bonfire"", while the Road Haulage Association said the announcement ""barely scratches the surface"". A survey from earlier this year suggests a number of reasons for the driver shortage Mr Shapps said the Covid pandemic had created a problem by preventing tests for new HGV drivers and Ministry of Defence examiners were being drafted in to help increase testing capacity. He said he did not want to ""undercut"" British workers by bringing in foreign workers but could not ""stand by and watch while queues are forming"". Mr Shapps said the government did not want to be reliant on overseas labour in the long term but said he had acted to reassure people in the short term. ""I'm doing some things we wouldn't necessarily have wanted to do because we believe in fixing this market for the long term so the drivers are paid better, and we welcome that - we think it is a good idea for drivers to be paid more and for conditions to be better,"" he said. While 5,000 temporary visas are being assigned for lorry drivers this is for supplying the food industry as well as fuel tankers. Mr Shapps said there was not a ""dramatic shortage in drivers"" for the fuel industry with only ""one, two, three hundred drivers"" needed for distribution to petrol stations. One of those who struggled to refill their car was Adrienne Kenny, from Cambridge, who needed to drive to Leeds for work on Monday. She said she had tried three petrol stations on Saturday but ""couldn't get diesel anywhere"" before trying another six without success on Sunday, leading her to postpone her meeting. Recruitment for additional short-term HGV drivers and poultry workers will begin in October, with the visas valid until Christmas Eve. Other measures include sending nearly one million letters to drivers who hold an HGV licence, seeking to encourage them back into the industry. Poultry workers have also been included in the temporary visa scheme and turkey farmer Kate Martin has warned supermarkets could run out of birds before Christmas. She said there were fewer turkeys being produced because because the big processors ""know they will not get them processed"". ""Come Christmas, if you leave ordering your turkey from your local farm supplier, you are going to be out of luck,"" she added.

Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers,"Offering temporary visas to foreign lorry drivers will not be enough to solve supply chain issues, retailers and hauliers have said. The government's planned measures would not fix the ""ultra-short term"" problems caused by panic buying, the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said. It said some of its members say their forecourts are running dry and others ""are partly dry and running out soon"". Long queues have formed and pumps have closed at some filling stations. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has blamed the Road Haulage Association for triggering a ""rush on petrol stations"". He also told the BBC's Andrew Marr Showthere was ""plenty of fuel""and that he had checked with the six refineries and 47 storage centres in the country. But Brian Madderson, chairman of the PRA, which represents about 5,500 independent petrol stations, told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that while there was plenty of fuel in the country ""it is in the wrong place for the motorist"" - in terminals and the refineries. He said: ""Those measures introduced by the government this weekend are not ultra-short term. ""We might see benefits of them later in the autumn as the drivers come across and start to work. But in the very short-term this panic buying has caused really serious problems."" He added that ""between 50% and 90%"" of the PRA's members had reported their forecourts were running dry and ""those that aren't dry are partly dry and running out soon"".

The British Retail Consortium welcomed the additional drivers, but said the numbers were ""too small"" to make an impact on the disruption expected at Christmas. Andrew Opie, director of food and sustainability policy at the trade association, told the BBC: ""I think we're going to see less choice, less availability, possibly a shorter shelf life as well, which is really disappointing because this could have been averted. ""Five thousand drivers, don't get me wrong, that will help and that will make some difference, but we needed so much more than that."" The Confederation of British Industry (CBI) said the ""limited scope"" of the government's announcement had ""surprised many"" and called for a committee of key government ministers similar to those set up to handle emergencies like flooding or the pandemic to be established to help alleviate the short-term pressures being experienced as the economy bounces back after the coronavirus pandemic. Kayleigh Robinson, a mental health nurse, said she was unable to get diesel at four petrol stations Kayleigh Robinson, who works in Hampshire as a mental health nurse, said she was left unable to make the 37-mile drive to work on Sunday after she was unable to get diesel at four petrol stations. ""It's not something I was expecting. ""When you're working long shifts you don't really get a chance to see the news that often."" In the end, her work arranged a taxi to pick her up and take her back home. Adrienne Kenny, from Cambridge, said she would be unable to go to work as a health, safety and environmental manager for a construction firm on Monday because she needed to drive to Leeds.

FT: Arsenal 3-1 Tottenham Phil McNultyBBC Sport chief football writer at Emirates Stadium Nuno has watched his side concede three goals in three successive league games, a worrying sign for a manager renowned for establishing a solid defensive platform. The manager himself looked a beaten man at times, a motionless presence as the full scale of Spurs' capitulation unfolded in front of him. The second half introduction of Oliver Skipp and Emerson Royal for Dele Alli and Japhet Tanganga - and presumably some very harsh words from Nuno and the simple fact that Spurs could not get any worse - prompted an improvement of sorts after the break. It was all far too little too late and Spurs did not deserve anything from this performance. FT: Arsenal 3-1 Tottenham Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Energy crisis not a failure of regulation - Ofgem,"The head of Ofgem has rejected claims from the industry the current energy crisis represents a failure to adequately regulate the market. Six suppliers have gone bust recently, leaving about 1.5 million customers facing higher bills, with more firms expected to fold. Ofgem boss Jonathan Brearley, told the BBC: ""No-one could have predicted the kind of gas price rises we have seen. ""In a situation like that any market would be under strain."" Gas prices are up four-fold, Mr Brearley said. However, his view has little support from senior executives in the industry who have told the BBC the regulator knew full well that many smaller suppliers would not be resilient in the face of rises that should have been part of the regulator's stress testing of the sector. Thousands of energy customers facing bill shocks Why are gas prices high and what's the energy price cap? The boss of the UK's fifth largest energy provider, Scottish Power, said the government was essentially asking larger providers to weaken their own financial position by shouldering billions in additional cost to provide these customers with energy that costs more to buy than they are allowed to sell it for under a government-imposed retail price cap. Ofgem insists its primary concern has been protecting consumers, but that promise sounds slightly hollow when millions of customers face being moved to higher tariffs from bigger suppliers and the cost those larger companies incur from taking on new customers will be added to all consumers bills through an industry wide levy. Larger suppliers, including Centrica owned-British Gas, have agreed to take on hundreds of thousands of marooned customers, but expect the cost of doing so to be recouped in a mechanism that Ofgem described as ""tried and tested"" but which bigger companies say is not designed for the mass failures we are now seeing. The Ofgem boss admits that the energy cap (Â£1,277 for a dual fuel household with average energy consumption) which limits the ability of companies to pass on higher wholesale costs to retail customers, is likely to rise again when it is reset in April 2022 after a 12% rise due to take effect at the end of this month. Industry sources also agree that many of the larger companies may be prepared to take on new customers not only because the retail price cap will inevitably rise, but also because the new customers they acquire will be ""stickier"". This means they will be less likely to switch in future given a lack of confidence that cheaper suppliers can be relied upon in the future, The received wisdom and advice of the last ten years to continually switch suppliers now looks less persuasive. Ofgem's Mr Brearley insists he wants a competitive market in the future. Critics argue that it presided over a market that it knew would collapse in a gas crunch - resulting in fewer companies and meaning a less competitive market.

"Universal credit cut diabolical, recipient says","A Â£20 increase to universal credit has been in place for almost 18 months A Â£20 per week cut to universal credit has been branded ""diabolical"" by those who are set to lose out. The cash was introduced as a top up to help people during the pandemic, but it is being stopped from next week. But in one of the most deprived parts of Wales, residents accused the UK government of not understanding what it is like ""trying to make your food last from one day to the next"". The UK government said it was focused on getting people into work. The Â£20 uplift to universal credit and working tax credits - the benefits working-age people are eligible for - has been in place since March 2020. Universal credit: When will the Â£20 increase stop? Families must choose food or fuel in benefits cut Very difficult winter ahead for many - minister Benefits cut: 'Â£20 is a lifeline, don't take it away' Work and pensions secretary, Therese Coffey, who previously backed the cut, said last week stopping the extra cash would only mean ""about two hours' extra work, every week"" needed for claimants. However, six former Conservative work and pensions secretaries, including Preseli Pembrokeshire MP Stephen Crabb, have spoken out against the move. Rhyl, in the Vale of Clwyd constituency, has two of Wales' most deprived neighbourhoods and charity volunteer Donna Evans said the loss of Â£20 a week would hit her and the community hard. ""It might not sound a lot, but to someone who hasn't got a lot, it's a massive amount,"" she said. Donna Evans said people need to be able to put food on the table She started volunteering at the Foryd community centre, which has a foodbank, cafe, social clubs, people who offer help and advice to those in need. ""We'll definitely need this more than anything, especially now the Â£80 a month is going to go,"" she said. ""We'll need the shelves filling up quick but they'll empty just as quickly. It's going to be really hard to help everybody."" Ms Evans cares for her grandson and receives universal credit, but said the money did not go far ahead of the cut. ""It's horrible panicking,"" she added. ""You're trying to make your food last from one day to the next day, and then you have to think a week ahead. ""If you don't get any money, and you have the stress of having kids wanting something, needing something."" She described ending the uplift as ""cold, it's heartless, it's thoughtless, it's diabolical"". Twins Philip and Michael said they cannot understand the decision to end the uplift Twins Michael and Phillip agreed. ""Every bit of money we have is gone before we've even spent it,"" said Michael. Phillip added: ""I cannot understand the government's decision when they're not living like this. ""They've not been given a budget like this to live on."" About 40% of people receiving universal credit have jobs, while the others are trying to find work, or are unable to work. Wages in Wales are lower than the UK average, while inflation in the cost of goods has been driven up by food and energy prices to the highest rate since 2012. Council tax and National Insurance are also set to rise. Citizens Advice Cymru said it was expecting a ""sharp uplift"" in people struggling once the extra benefits are cut, having helped 15,700 people with their credit claims in the past six months. Research by Bevan Foundation found eight areas where a quarter of households will suffer, with the figure higher among those with children. The UK government said it was focused on getting people into work. Areas identified by the foundation's research include Merthyr Tydfil and Rhymney, Torfaen, Newport East, Rhondda, Swansea East and the Vale of Clwyd parliamentary constituencies. In families with children, the numbers hit by the change reach 42% but in Rhondda and Cardiff South and Penarth it is half of all families. The research predicted the policy change would affect pandemic recovery as people tend to spend their universal credit on high streets, meaning Â£286m could be taken out of the Welsh economy. Benefits expert Gareth Morgan rejected claims that those on universal credit could cover the loss with two extra hours of work An expert whose company delivers training for the Welsh government on benefits rejected the claim about two hours extra work, saying that would only apply for a ""tiny minority"". Gareth Morgan said: ""You would have rather hoped that the secretary of state for work and pensions might have understood how the benefits system worked, and the way in which when you give people extra by way of earnings, the government takes a lot of it back again by tax, National Insurance and by reducing the amount of in-work benefits they're entitled to."" The Department for Work and Pensions said the Â£20 uplift ""was always temporary"". A spokesman added: ""It was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so. ""It's right that the government should focus on our plan for jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more.""

Immigration system 'not meeting' Scotland's needs,"Temporary working visas have been introduced for hauliers to tackle labour shortages. Scottish ministers have called for urgent action from the UK government on immigration as the system is ""not meeting"" the needs of Scotland. Temporary working visas have beenintroduced for hauliers and poultry workersto tackle labour shortages. However, Scottish External Affairs Secretary Angus Robertson said the measure does not help all UK sectors. The UK's transport secretary said long term changes prevent sectors from standing ""on their own two feet"". The UK government confirmed that 5,000 HGV drivers and 5,500 poultry workers will be eligible to work in the UK for three months, until Christmas Eve. How serious is the shortage of lorry drivers? No fuel shortage, says transport secretary However Mr Robertson has written to Home Secretary Priti Patel saying: ""The current immigration system is not meeting the needs of Scotland. At the moment it is not meeting the needs of sectors across the UK."" He called for an ""immediate discussion"" with the home secretary - and said the UK government ""needs to urgently address the immigration challenges"". Mr Robertson wants Westminster to immediately introduce a 24-month temporary workers visa. Mr Robertson has called for urgent talks with the home secretary Worker shortages have been linked to both the coronavirus crisis and a lack of European labour after Brexit. A shortage of lorry drivers has caused problems for a range of industries, from supermarkets to fast food chains. In recent days, some fuel deliveries have been affected, leading tolengthy queues at petrol stations- despite ministers insisting the UK has plenty of fuel. There are also concerns that Christmas shopping could be hindered without action. Mr Robertson also said the shortage occupation list used for immigration must be reviewed - arguing that Scottish ministers should be given a formal role in determining what categories of workers are on this. The UK government also has to reduce immigration fees, he said, claiming the costs involved in this were a barrier for both workers and employers. Drivers queued at petrol stations on Friday, despite assurances of no fuel shortage Industry body, Scotland Food & Drink, has accused the UK Government of using temporary visas ""to fix bad headlines than fix the actual problem"". Chief executive, James Withers, said: ""We have been calling for emergency visas for weeks, to avoid the collapse of some food supply chains. ""I seriously doubt that 10,000 three-month visas are going to cut it. It may help the driver situation a little but it won't address the chronic staff shortage in food production."" In addition to temporary visas, Ministry of Defence examiners will be used to help increase immediate HGV testing capacity by thousands. Nearly one million letters will also be sent to all drivers who currently hold an HGV driving licence, encouraging them back into the industry. And the UK Department for Education is investing up to Â£10m to create new ""skills bootcamps"" to train up to 3,000 more HGV drivers. Appearing on BBC Scotland'sThe Sunday Show, UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said he wanted to support British people, but also make sure they can ""train up for work"". This video can not be played Mr Shapps appeared on The Sunday Show to discuss problems as a result of labour shortages He said his government wanted to avoid ""going back to what has consistently happened"" - that British workers are ""undercut"" by foreign workers prepared to enter the UK for lower salaries. ""In the longer term [this] prevents us from having a sustainable UK haulage sector because it could never stand on its own two feet,"" he said. Pressed on how public sector jobs have also been affected by Brexit, Mr Shapps argued there would be a potential workforce in the form of people coming off the furlough scheme who may be unemployed. He said: ""We're coming out of the coronavirus crisis where all of those millions of people were on furlough. Indeed this month 1.6 million are due to come off furlough and sadly not all will be going back to their old jobs. ""Economists tell us we're likely see influx of people out of work and looking for other jobs. Across sectors and in Scotland there is the opportunity for people to be retraining into other jobs.""

'I'm not a sulker - I will bounce back',"This video can not be played Anthony Joshua v Oleksandr Usyk: I'll still fight Tyson Fury without the belts - Joshua Anthony Joshua says he is ""a different animal, not a sulker"" and ""will bounce back"" from losing his world heavyweight titles to Oleksandr Usyk. Joshua said he ""couldn't see in round nine"" after an eye injury sustained in Saturday's 12-round fight with the Ukrainian at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. His promoter Eddie Hearn suggested his fighter may have suffered a broken eye socket. ""I can't go back and sulk - that's wasting time,"" Joshua, 31, said. How the boxing world reacted to Usyk's stunning victory 5 Live boxing podcast: Analysis of Joshua's defeat Asked after the fight about what went wrong, the defeated Briton said: ""I couldn't see in the ninth round, couldn't see anything really because my eye was shut. ""It was a good experience because in adversity you've just got to learn to control yourself, stay on top of things, so when I couldn't see anything - it's the first time that it's happened in a fight."" Hearn had said Joshua had given Usyk, 34, too much respect and would have to make ""fundamental changes"" to regain the WBA, WBO and IBF titles he lost in the fight. The Briton has a rematch clause in his contract with Usyk, and later confirmed he would take it. Fight report: Usyk outclasses Joshua to take unanimous points win 'Why didn't he have a go?' Pundits bemused by 'negative' Joshua Joshua v Usyk - fight as it unfolded, and reaction Okolie retains cruiserweight title with third-round knockout ""This experience today is invaluable. This will have a massive benefit in the next fight,"" said Joshua, pictured with his swollen eye mid-fight Joshua added: ""When I was walking back through the tunnel, I just said to myself, 'I'm ready to get back to the gym, I'm ready to just put that work in'. ""I just want to get back to the gym, get back on the grind and improve, so when I fight these good guys and see that they are hurt I can capitalise on the opportunity. ""It was a great lesson today. I know we can look at it from a negative point of view but, for me, I've got to take it as a great lesson and build on that situation. ""I never tend to look at the opponent. I just tend to look at myself and realise where I went wrong. So it's not so much what he done, it's the opportunities that I gave him. It's not so much him. I'm just going to go back and look at myself and correct my wrongs. ""I'm a different kind of animal. I'm not a sulker. This is a blessed opportunity, to be able to fight for the heavyweight title of the world, fight good fighters time and time again and for people to come out. ""I'm not going to be going home and be crying about it, because this is war. It's a long process. This isn't just one fight and then I'm done. ""I'm going back to look at way that I can improve. Straight away, I've already been watching the fight and thinking 'I could've done that better'."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tyson Fury's co-promoter Frank Warren is now doubtful a long-awaited all-British fight with Joshua will happen after a dominant Usyk became the unified heavyweight champion. ""I don't see it happening now,"" Warren told BBC Sport. ""If it did happen, what would Tyson have done to him? It wouldn't have gone 12 rounds. Tyson would have destroyed him. Absolutely. The unification fight was there, such a big fight. Heartbreaking. ""What would Tyson Fury had done to Joshua? A better chin, bigger puncher."" Warren said Joshua ""didn't have any tactics"" and compared Saturday's fight with hisJune 2019 shock defeatby Andy Ruiz Jr. ""Usyk is a good fighter, he boxed extremely well,"" Warren said. ""But that was my thing about this fight - Joshua is so vulnerable. He's been like that for ages. ""I thought Joshua would be too big for Usyk, but I knew if he was there at the end, then he's been outboxed. Usyk nearly had him over at the end."" ""He was gun shy. Never let his hands go. They can talk all they want about rematches. He's just been totally exposed, like he was against Ruiz. How can he be getting outjabbed by Usyk, who was taking the fight to him? I was shocked at that. ""Even if he was to beat Usyk, what is Tyson Fury going to do to Joshua? You'd have your house on Tyson beating him."" Asked about any future fight with WBC champion Fury, Joshua said: ""The road to undisputed is marketing. When I pulled up today, it just reminds me that it's a big circus. This is the greatest show on Earth. ""I'll fight Tyson Fury and Wilder without the belts. The belts are fun, it's great, it's legacy - but with or without the belts, I'll fight whoever. The road to undisputed [champion] is a nice title to have and chase but would you still watch it without the belts? ""The main thing is that you have got two competitive fighters in the ring from UK soil that just want to go toe-to-toe."" Matchroom boss Eddie Hearn admitted he was ""gutted"" about the defeat. ""He will have to make fundamental changes, he will have to box differently,"" Hearn told BBC Radio 5 Live after the fight. ""I can't see AJ taking a 10-round fight, he boxes twice a year and maybe that is something we will have to look at. ""He is going to go away and all he will do is think about Oleksandr Usyk. He will be thinking: 'How can I beat him, how can I improve?' He is obsessed with improving. ""I just feel there is so much more Anthony Joshua in that fight but he will have to do a lot more in the rematch to be victorious."" BBC Sport's Coral Barry, at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium Even in defeat, Joshua is a classy fighter. The word after the fight was that the heavyweight would be heading straight to the hospital to treat a nasty eye injury. But just as he did when he was defeated by Andy Ruiz Jr in New York, Joshua faced the media. Hours after the 65,000-plus crowd had left the Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, a bruised Joshua sat down and made no excuses for his performance. It's a rare trait in the boxing world to accept defeat by the better fighter. There were no flashes of anger as Joshua calmly answered questions about what went wrong. There was almost an air of excitement from the two-time world champion at the prospect of overcoming what can only be described as a heavy loss to an exceptional opponent. Joshua was still confident, and it remains to be seen if that bravado will see him through another dark chapter in his career. Joshua was able to reinvent himself to beat Ruiz. It will be an even tougher task to do the same to defeat Usyk. Float:Will it be sink or swim for this poolside romance?

Jubilee medal designed for emergency service staff,"The medals are being made at a workshop in Birmingham About 400,000 medals commemorating the Queen's 70-year reign will be given out to frontline workers. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the medals, for the Platinum Jubilee, was a fitting tribute to emergency workers and other recipients.

Worcestershire Medal Service said the commission has helped create jobs. Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said the medals would be people who had ""served us throughout the years"" Ms Dorries saw the coin-shaped pieces of metal called ""blanks"" being stamped with the design by Timothy Noad from the College of Arms when she visited the firm's Birmingham workshop. ""We've been through such a lot as a nation, it's been a really torrid time everyone's been through over the past 20 months,"" she said. ""I think looking forward, 2022 is going to be a year when everyone can put that behind us and we can celebrate the Commonwealth Games, Festival UK, the Queen's Jubilee and the extended bank holiday weekend to celebrate the Queen's Jubilee."" Phil McDermott designed the medal's ribbon Phil McDermott, head of the firm making the medals, said the order was a welcome boost.

At sea with 'Europe's largest fish counter'Marine researchers return to the Irish Sea to work on a project to protect vulnerable species.,"The SeaMonitor project is tracking the movement of five species in the Irish Sea Marine researchers working on a project to protect the Irish Sea's most vulnerable species have returned to the waters off Northern Ireland for the first time since the start of the Covid pandemic. It is part of the SeaMonitor project that's tracking a number of species, including Atlantic salmon, basking sharks, harbour seals, flapper skate and cetaceans. SeaMonitor, led by the Loughs Agency which refers to it as ""Europe's largest fish counter"", uses acoustic telemetry technology to listen to life under the sea. Over the last week, fieldworkers from Canada's Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) have been servicing the project's underwater technology. ""This is the first time that the Ocean Tracking Network team has travelled internationally since the beginning of the pandemic,"" OTN's Cassandra Hartery tells BBC News NI. ""It has truly been an unforgettable experience."" The OTN researchers have been working to maintain SeaMonitor's underwater infrastructure SeaMonitor's sub aqua listening stations stretch from Malin Head in Ireland to the island of Islay in Scotland. They record transmissions from a variety of marine species tagged by scientists. Launched in 2019, SeaMonitor involves eight international research partners, including OTN, based at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. Cassandra and her OTN colleague Caitlin Bate have been based in Londonderry and Ballycastle in recent weeks. The acoustic technology allows researchers to listen to life under the sea Caitlin says the ""globally important"" project will help develop a better understanding of life in the Irish Sea. ""Acoustic monitoring is helping fill gaps in the biology and movements of species in decline, and to inform marine management strategies, such as the establishment of marine protected areas,"" she says. The project's research ""will be used to protect these populations in the near future and also for generations to come"". Researchers from Northern Ireland, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, the USA and Canada are all involved. That collaboration is significant, Cassandra adds. ""It not only demonstrates the impact of multi-national marine tracking through the creation of a shared infrastructure, but it's also allowing scientists from partner countries to conduct much larger-scale studies than they were able to do before."" The project's principal officer, Ross McGill of the Loughs Agency, says little is still known about many of the species' sub aquatic movements. SeaMonitor's listening stations stretch the Irish Sea ""Having all this high quality, robust data allows us to create management plans and tools that are dynamic and effective,"" he says. ""The data collected will allow us to understand the pressures vulnerable species like Atlantic salmon and basking sharks face so that we can then translate that knowledge into management plans and policies to better protect them."" SeaMontior's findings - including specific management plans for the Foyle and Clyde rivers' salmon populations - are due to be published in early 2023.

Ed Sheeran and Billy Eilish join 24-hour concert,"Singer Lizzo performed in New York's Central Park for Global Citizen Live Ed Sheeran, Lizzo and Billie Eilish were among stars to take part in a 24-hour gig to raise awareness of climate change, vaccine inequality and famine. Over 60 artists performed in The Global Citizen festival in cities including New York, London and Seoul. Tens of thousands of people attended concerts around the world, and millions more tuned in to the broadcast. The event kicked off on Saturday in Paris, where Elton John performed in front of the Eiffel Tower. He took to the stage following a pre-recorded performance by the K-pop band BTS. Elton John performed in Paris alongside US artist Charlie Puth The show, believed to be one of the biggest-ever international charity events, was organised by Global Citizen - a charity working to end extreme poverty by 2030. Unlike most events of this nature, organisers were not aiming to raise cash, but to use participation as evidence for world leaders that people support bold action on the issues. ""Across six continents, artists will help rally citizens in demanding that governments, major corporations and philanthropists work together to defend the planet and defeat poverty,"" Global Citizen said in a statement. Taboo, will.i.am and J. Rey Soul of the Black Eyed Peas took to the stage in Paris It called on international governments to plant one billion trees, deliver one billion vaccines to the poorest countries and donate meals for 41 million people on the brink of famine. Billie Eilish performed in New York Jennifer Lopez was among those who performed in New York, along with Billie Eilish and Coldplay. Prince Harry and Meghan Markle called for the Covid-19 vaccine to be treated as a basic human right Earlier, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, took to the stage calling for access to Covid-19 vaccines to be treated ""as a basic human right."" ""The way you're born should not dictate your ability to survive,"" the Duke of Sussex told crowds in the city's Central Park. They were followed performances by singer Alessia Cara and pop veteran Cyndi Lauper, who sang a rendition of Girls Just Want To Have Fun, dedicated to Afghan women. Thousands of people filled The Great Lawn in New York's Central Park for a concert in the city Ed Sheeran performed in Paris alongside the Black Eyed Peas and Stormzy, while Stevie Wonder played in Los Angeles. There were also pre-recorded performances from a huge number of stars, including Green Day, Kylie Minogue and Andrea Bocelli. Funding announcements poured in between sets. In a recorded message, USAID Administrator Samantha Power announced that the US would contribute more than $295m (Â£215m) ""to stave off famine and extreme hunger, confront gender-based violence and address the urgent humanitarian needs the Covid-19 pandemic is leaving in its wake."" Kylie Minogue is one of many stars to have pre-recorded a performance French President Emmanuel Macron also pledged to double the number of coronavirus vaccines his country will send to poorer nations, to 120 million. Meanwhile, a host of international companies like Lego, Cisco and Verizon promised charitable donations. The head of the World Health Organization has backed Saturday's concerts, calling on the leaders of the developed world to unite and bring an end to vaccine inequality. ""We now face a two-track pandemic of haves and have-nots,"" Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. ""We cannot disregard this gross inequity or become complacent."" Grime star Stormzy also took to the stage in the French capital Those attending the concerts were required to produce either proof of vaccination or a negative Covid test. Tickets to the shows were distributed free of charge to randomly selected people who signed up for the Global Citizen app and shared its petitions on social media.

'I'm not a sulker - I will bounce back'Anthony Joshua loses his world heavyweight titles after being defeated by Oleksandr Usyk.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Anthony Joshua v Oleksandr Usyk: I'll still fight Tyson Fury without the belts - Joshua Anthony Joshua says he is ""a different animal, not a sulker"" and ""will bounce back"" from losing his world heavyweight titles to Oleksandr Usyk. Joshua said he ""couldn't see in round nine"" after an eye injury sustained in Saturday's 12-round fight with the Ukrainian at Tottenham Hotspur Stadium. His promoter Eddie Hearn suggested his fighter may have suffered a broken eye socket. ""I can't go back and sulk - that's wasting time,"" Joshua, 31, said. How the boxing world reacted to Usyk's stunning victory 5 Live boxing podcast: Analysis of Joshua's defeat Asked after the fight about what went wrong, the defeated Briton said: ""I couldn't see in the ninth round, couldn't see anything really because my eye was shut. ""It was a good experience because in adversity you've just got to learn to control yourself, stay on top of things, so when I couldn't see anything - it's the first time that it's happened in a fight."" Hearn had said Joshua had given Usyk, 34, too much respect and would have to make ""fundamental changes"" to regain the WBA, WBO and IBF titles he lost in the fight. The Briton has a rematch clause in his contract with Usyk, and later confirmed he would take it. Fight report: Usyk outclasses Joshua to take unanimous points win 'Why didn't he have a go?' Pundits bemused by 'negative' Joshua Joshua v Usyk - fight as it unfolded, and reaction Okolie retains cruiserweight title with third-round knockout ""This experience today is invaluable. This will have a massive benefit in the next fight,"" said Joshua, pictured with his swollen eye mid-fight Joshua added: ""When I was walking back through the tunnel, I just said to myself, 'I'm ready to get back to the gym, I'm ready to just put that work in'. ""I just want to get back to the gym, get back on the grind and improve, so when I fight these good guys and see that they are hurt I can capitalise on the opportunity. ""It was a great lesson today. I know we can look at it from a negative point of view but, for me, I've got to take it as a great lesson and build on that situation. ""I never tend to look at the opponent. I just tend to look at myself and realise where I went wrong. So it's not so much what he done, it's the opportunities that I gave him. It's not so much him. I'm just going to go back and look at myself and correct my wrongs. ""I'm a different kind of animal. I'm not a sulker. This is a blessed opportunity, to be able to fight for the heavyweight title of the world, fight good fighters time and time again and for people to come out. ""I'm not going to be going home and be crying about it, because this is war. It's a long process. This isn't just one fight and then I'm done. ""I'm going back to look at way that I can improve. Straight away, I've already been watching the fight and thinking 'I could've done that better'."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tyson Fury's co-promoter Frank Warren is now doubtful a long-awaited all-British fight with Joshua will happen after a dominant Usyk became the unified heavyweight champion. ""I don't see it happening now,"" Warren told BBC Sport. ""If it did happen, what would Tyson have done to him? It wouldn't have gone 12 rounds. Tyson would have destroyed him. Absolutely. The unification fight was there, such a big fight. Heartbreaking. ""What would Tyson Fury had done to Joshua? A better chin, bigger puncher."" Warren said Joshua ""didn't have any tactics"" and compared Saturday's fight with hisJune 2019 shock defeatby Andy Ruiz Jr. ""Usyk is a good fighter, he boxed extremely well,"" Warren said. ""But that was my thing about this fight - Joshua is so vulnerable. He's been like that for ages. ""I thought Joshua would be too big for Usyk, but I knew if he was there at the end, then he's been outboxed. Usyk nearly had him over at the end."" ""He was gun shy. Never let his hands go. They can talk all they want about rematches. He's just been totally exposed, like he was against Ruiz. How can he be getting outjabbed by Usyk, who was taking the fight to him? I was shocked at that. ""Even if he was to beat Usyk, what is Tyson Fury going to do to Joshua? You'd have your house on Tyson beating him."" Asked about any future fight with WBC champion Fury, Joshua said: ""The road to undisputed is marketing. When I pulled up today, it just reminds me that it's a big circus. This is the greatest show on Earth. ""I'll fight Tyson Fury and Wilder without the belts. The belts are fun, it's great, it's legacy - but with or without the belts, I'll fight whoever. The road to undisputed [champion] is a nice title to have and chase but would you still watch it without the belts? ""The main thing is that you have got two competitive fighters in the ring from UK soil that just want to go toe-to-toe."" Matchroom boss Eddie Hearn admitted he was ""gutted"" about the defeat. ""He will have to make fundamental changes, he will have to box differently,"" Hearn told BBC Radio 5 Live after the fight. ""I can't see AJ taking a 10-round fight, he boxes twice a year and maybe that is something we will have to look at. ""He is going to go away and all he will do is think about Oleksandr Usyk. He will be thinking: 'How can I beat him, how can I improve?' He is obsessed with improving. ""I just feel there is so much more Anthony Joshua in that fight but he will have to do a lot more in the rematch to be victorious.""

"Taliban hang bodies as warning in Afghan cityBodies of alleged kidnappers are hung in public, a day after a warning executions would resume.Asia","Taliban fighters - pictured here in Herat on 10 September - have been patrolling the centre of the city The Taliban say they have shot dead four alleged kidnappers and hung their bodies in public squares in the Afghan city of Herat. The gruesome display came a day after a notorious Taliban official warned that extreme punishments such as executions and amputations would resume. The men were killed in a gun battle after allegedly seizing a businessman and his son, a local official said. Local residents said a body was hung from a crane in the city centre. Wazir Ahmad Seddiqi, a local shopkeeper, told the Associated Press news agency that four bodies were brought to the square, one was hung there and the three other bodies were moved to other squares in the city to be displayed. The deputy governor of Herat, Maulwai Shair, said displaying the bodies was done to deter further abductions. He said the men were killed in a gun battle after the Taliban learnt that they had kidnapped a businessman and his son - who were both freed. The BBC has not independently confirmed the circumstances under which the men were killed. However, graphic images shared on social media appeared to show bloody bodies on the back of a pick-up truck with a crane hoisting one man up. Another video showed a man suspended from a crane with a sign on his chest reading: ""Abductors will be punished like this."" Since taking power in Afghanistan on 15 August, the Taliban have been promising a milder form of rule than in their previous tenure. But there have already been numerous reports of human rights abuses carried out across the country. The Taliban's notorious former head of religious police Mullah Nooruddin Turabi - now in charge of prisons - said on Thursday that extreme punishments such asexecutions and amputations would resumein Afghanistan as they were ""necessary for security"". In an interview with AP, he said these punishments may not be meted out in public, as they were under previous Taliban rule in the 1990s. Public executions were frequently held in Kabul's sports stadium or on the vast grounds of the Eid Gah mosque during the group's five year rule. But he dismissed outrage over their past public executions: ""No-one will tell us what our laws should be."" Turabi - who is on a UN sanctions list for his past actions - added that ""everyone criticised us for the punishments in the stadium, but we have never said anything about their laws and punishments"". In August, Amnesty International said that Taliban fighters were behind the massacre of nine members of the persecuted Hazara minority. Amnesty's Secretary-General AgnÃ¨s Callamard said at the time that the ""cold-blooded brutality"" of the killings was ""a reminder of the Taliban's past record, and a horrifying indicator of what Taliban rule may bring"".

At sea with 'Europe's largest fish counter',"The SeaMonitor project is tracking the movement of five species in the Irish Sea Marine researchers working on a project to protect the Irish Sea's most vulnerable species have returned to the waters off Northern Ireland for the first time since the start of the Covid pandemic. It is part of the SeaMonitor project that's tracking a number of species, including Atlantic salmon, basking sharks, harbour seals, flapper skate and cetaceans. SeaMonitor, led by the Loughs Agency which refers to it as ""Europe's largest fish counter"", uses acoustic telemetry technology to listen to life under the sea. Over the last week, fieldworkers from Canada's Ocean Tracking Network (OTN) have been servicing the project's underwater technology. ""This is the first time that the Ocean Tracking Network team has travelled internationally since the beginning of the pandemic,"" OTN's Cassandra Hartery tells BBC News NI. ""It has truly been an unforgettable experience."" The OTN researchers have been working to maintain SeaMonitor's underwater infrastructure SeaMonitor's sub aqua listening stations stretch from Malin Head in Ireland to the island of Islay in Scotland. They record transmissions from a variety of marine species tagged by scientists. Launched in 2019, SeaMonitor involves eight international research partners, including OTN, based at Dalhousie University in Nova Scotia. Cassandra and her OTN colleague Caitlin Bate have been based in Londonderry and Ballycastle in recent weeks. The acoustic technology allows researchers to listen to life under the sea Caitlin says the ""globally important"" project will help develop a better understanding of life in the Irish Sea. ""Acoustic monitoring is helping fill gaps in the biology and movements of species in decline, and to inform marine management strategies, such as the establishment of marine protected areas,"" she says. The project's research ""will be used to protect these populations in the near future and also for generations to come"". Researchers from Northern Ireland, Scotland, the Republic of Ireland, the USA and Canada are all involved. That collaboration is significant, Cassandra adds. ""It not only demonstrates the impact of multi-national marine tracking through the creation of a shared infrastructure, but it's also allowing scientists from partner countries to conduct much larger-scale studies than they were able to do before."" The project's principal officer, Ross McGill of the Loughs Agency, says little is still known about many of the species' sub aquatic movements. SeaMonitor's listening stations stretch the Irish Sea ""Having all this high quality, robust data allows us to create management plans and tools that are dynamic and effective,"" he says. ""The data collected will allow us to understand the pressures vulnerable species like Atlantic salmon and basking sharks face so that we can then translate that knowledge into management plans and policies to better protect them."" SeaMontior's findings - including specific management plans for the Foyle and Clyde rivers' salmon populations - are due to be published in early 2023.

Anthony Joshua loses world titles to Oleksandr Usyk,"Joshua looked one-paced with Usyk more often the aggressor Oleksandr Usyk is the new unified heavyweight world champion after dethroning Anthony Joshua with an incredible performance in London. The Ukrainian put on a masterclass in front of 65,000 fans inside Tottenham Hotspur Stadium, outclassing Joshua over 12 rounds, and hurting the defending champion on numerous occasions. The scorecards - 117-112, 116-112, 115-113 - were all for Usyk and there was a mere shrug of the shoulders from Joshua as the second defeat of his professional career was confirmed. Having seen a fight with fellow Briton Tyson Fury collapse last summer, Joshua opted to face his WBO mandatory challenger and former undisputed cruiserweight champion Usyk instead. It appeared the easier fight for Joshua, but boxing's triumphant return to stadium nights was soured for the home crowd by a truly exceptional performance from the challenger. 5 Live boxing podcast: Analysis of Joshua's defeat How the boxing world reacted to the fight Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn suggested his fighter may have suffered a broken eye socket and would need to go to hospital. ""I don't know if he has broken his eye socket, it doesn't look great,"" he said. ""He said he couldn't see after the ninth round, obviously he was getting tagged a lot as well."" A devastated Joshua left the ring immediately after the decision but laterposted a short message on Twitter,,externalsaying: ""Keep positive even if the world's crumbling in front of you! London I love you & thank you each and every time!"" I'm not a sulker - I will bounce back, says defeated Joshua 'Why didn't he have a go?' Pundits bemused by 'negative' Joshua Joshua v Usyk - fight as it unfolded, and reaction Joshua was relaxed and cheerful as he approached the ring, but concentration was etched on his face from the first bell. Usyk's abilities quickly became apparent, the 34-year-old full of feints and pace from the off, moving Joshua around the ring at will as the defending champion settled into a surprisingly passive role. A few warning shots from Joshua fell short in the early rounds, Usyk either catching them with a glove or spinning away. It would become the pattern of the fight as Usyk made Joshua miss and executed a perfect gameplan of his own. A left cross from Usyk rattled Joshua in the third round, and prompted a noisy response from the crowd. Joshua rode the danger, failing to respond, but making it to the bell safely. Usyk was now brimming with confidence and the London crowd tried in vain to rouse their man into life. A low shot from Joshua brought a complaint from Usyk and Joshua fired off another, perhaps sensing a weakness in his opponent. Round five was Joshua's best to that point, but Usyk remained in control and the Briton continued to miss his attempts to land any meaningful shots. Finally, in the sixth round, Joshua landed his right hand, sparking a response form Usyk, who widened his stance and appeared ready to trade. Joshua backed off, wary of a firefight. And Joshua's fears were realised in the seventh as Usyk responded brilliantly to stun him with a left hook to the chin and send him stumbling backwards. Joshua stayed on his feet, surviving the round but now in a dire predicament. Usyk was comfortably ahead on the scorecards and Joshua struggled to close the gap. The huge weight advantage was nowhere in evidence, with Usyk keeping the fight at range and urgings from Joshua's corner to move forward appearing to fall on deaf ears. Joshua had Usyk briefly on the ropes in the ninth but returned to his corner with a bloody nose having caught a hard shot to the face in the closing seconds of the round. There was blood on the faces of both men in the 11th round. Joshua had a cut and swelling on his eye; Usyk had a gash on his left eye. But while Usyk's mouth was open, he was by far the busier fighter in the penultimate round, outclassing Joshua with ease once again. The crowd desperately tried to inspire the defending champion, who needed a knockout in the final round. But it was the challenger who almost found the decisive punch, pushing a dazed Joshua on to the ropes. The bell saved Joshua from suffering another knockout defeat and there was a nervous wait for Usyk's team for the scorecards. There were to be no more shocks, however, as all three judges gave it to the challenger and ended Joshua's short second reign as world champion after just one fight. This video can not be played Anthony Joshua v Oleksandr Usyk: I'll still fight Tyson Fury without the belts - Joshua It is unclear where Joshua goes from here. There is a rematch clause, one that the two-time world champion is likely to exercise. He now has two losses to his name and on both occasions the Briton was dominated by a smaller man. Usyk did not find the knockout punch, but he exposed Joshua's frailties and somewhat light attacking arsenal. Joshua had no answer to Usyk and while his opponent glided across the ring, the champion appeared to be dragging his feet through mud. There was no attempt to bully Usyk, wear him down or go to the body. It was a strange, almost hapless display from Joshua which leaves his legacy as one of the heavyweight greats in ruins. Aside from the Briton's long-term career prospects, Joshua versus Fury now appears to be dead. Fury fights Deontay Wilder next month in Las Vegas and every fight fan's greatest fear has been realised after the unification bout collapsed last summer. To begin with, Joshua will have to win his rematch with Usyk which, after Saturday night's meeting, appears a near impossible prospect. Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn said his fighter had given Usyk too much respect and would have to make ""fundamental changes"" to regain his titles. ""We knew it [defeat] could happen if he didn't get it right, and he didn't get it right,"" Hearn told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""He took too many shots early and Usyk was more aggressive than I thought he would be and he was the deserved winner. ""Tony Bellew's comments about overthinking, and it fatiguing you, were right. It is like these last three or four days you get spellbound by Usyk and you end up giving him too much respect and that becomes a problem."" Hearn said Joshua was already thinking about how to beat Usyk next time. ""He is going to go away and all he will do is think about Oleksandr Usyk. He will be thinking 'how can I beat him, how can I improve?' He is obsessed with improving,"" said Hearn. ""I just feel there is so much more Anthony Joshua in that fight but he will have to do a lot more in the rematch to be victorious."" Float:Will it be sink or swim for this poolside romance?
