Hancock 'had drink' with Cameron and Greensill,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock met former PM David Cameron and financier Lex Greensill for a ""private drink"" in 2019 to discuss a new payment scheme for the NHS, it has been revealed. It is thelatest in a series of Sunday Times disclosures,externalabout Mr Cameron's lobbying work since leaving office. Mr Greensill advised Mr Cameron's government, and the ex-PM went on to be employed by Greensill Capital. An ally of Mr Hancock said he had ""acted in entirely the correct way"". They told the BBC that Mr Hancock had ""updated officials on the business that was discussed, as is appropriate"". Greensill Capital's scheme, which allowed staff to be paid early for hours they had already worked, went on to be used by some NHS trusts. The development is the latest to be published by the Sunday Times detailing Mr Cameron's work for Greensill Capital after he left politics. Mr Hancock is the fourth minister to have been lobbied by Mr Cameron on behalf of the company, which recently collapsedcosting 440 jobs.

The financier developed a policy designed to help small businesses get their bills paid faster, as part of a scheme that also benefited his own financial company, Greensill Capital. Mr Cameron began working for Greensill Capital after leaving office, and tried unsuccessfully to lobby the government to increase the firm's access to government-backed loans during the first phase of the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Cameron pressed Treasury officials - andsent text messagesto Chancellor Rishi Sunak's personal phone - to access emergency funding for Greensill Capital. Lex Greensill was an unpaid government adviser The former Tory leader - who was PM between 2010 and 2016 - is reported to have told friends he was set to earn as much as Â£60m from share options in Greensill Capital, although this has since been disputed. In the end, Mr Cameron's pleas to the Treasury for Covid emergency loans for Greensill Capital fell on deaf ears. The ""private drink"" between Mr Hancock, Mr Cameron and Mr Greensill took place in October 2019. In August 2019, Mr Greensill wrote to Mr Hancock to set out a proposal to allow the NHS access to an app Greensill Capital had devised, called Earnd, to pay doctors and nurses either daily or weekly in advance and free-of-charge to workers. Having received the letter, the health secretary commissioned advice from civil servants to explore the idea. The advice was that the ""principle"" of the idea was ""good,"" but sources insisted he wanted other suppliers to be able to offer the same work and it would be up to local NHS managers to decide whether to sign up to it. Some NHS trusts went on to use Greensill Capital's Earnd app during the pandemic.

Matt Hancock insists he behaved entirely correctly. Neither Mr Cameron nor Mr Greensill have spoken publicly since headlines about the two of them started to appear several weeks ago now.

Chinese regulator slaps huge fine on tech giant,"The world's biggest online retailer - China's Alibaba - has been hit with a record fine equivalent to $2.75bn (just over Â£2bn). Regulators in China said the internet giant had abused its dominant market position for several years. In a statement the company said it accepted the ruling and would ""ensure its compliance"". Analysts say the fine shows China intends to move against internet platforms that it thinks are too big. Chinaâs tech giants face new anti-monopoly rules China opens door to Ant Group's stock market debut The race to create the world's next super-app While not well known outside China, inside the country Alibaba is an ever-present behemoth, the BBC's Robin Brant reports from Shanghai. The company is China's Amazon meets eBay, our correspondent says. Retail is its main activity but its work has spread to digital payments, credit and cloud computing. The fine amounts to 4% of Alibaba's revenue in 2019. Regulators say Alibaba restricted competition by stopping some sellers using other platforms. It is the latest in a chain of events targeting the company that kicked off last October, just after its high-profile co-founder, Jack Ma, told a gathering of China's leading regulators that they were stifling innovation. Jack Ma is well-known in China as one of the country's most successful entrepreneurs. Why did China's most famous tech titan disappear? ""This penalty will be viewed as a closure to the anti-monopoly case for now by the market,"" Hong Hao, head of research at BOCOM International in Hong Kong, told Reuters news agency. ""It's indeed the highest profile anti-monopoly case in China. The market has been anticipating some sort of penalty for some time... but people need to pay attention to the measures beyond the anti-monopoly investigation."" The country's other tech giants are also coming under increasing pressure from regulators worried about their growing influence. Last month12 companies were finedover deals that violated anti-monopoly rules. The companies included Tencent, Baidu, Didi Chuxing, SoftBank and a ByteDance-backed firm.

Obituary: The Duke of Edinburgh,"Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, won widespread respect for his steadfast and constant support of the Queen. It was a desperately difficult role for anyone, let alone a man who had been used to naval command and who held strong views on a wide range of subjects. Yet it was that very strength of character that enabled him to discharge his responsibilities so effectively, and provide such wholehearted support to his wife in her role as Queen. As male consort to a female sovereign, Prince Philip had no constitutional position. But no-one was closer to the monarchy, or of greater importance to the monarch, than he was. Prince Philip of Greece was born on 10 June 1921 on the island of Corfu. His birth certificate shows the date as 28 May 1921, as Greece had not then adopted the Gregorian calendar. His father was Prince Andrew of Greece, a younger son of King George I of the Hellenes. His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was the eldest child of Prince Louis of Battenberg and sister of Earl Mountbatten of Burma. After a coup d'etat in 1922, his father was banished from Greece by a revolutionary court. A British warship sent by his second cousin, King George V, took the family to Italy. Baby Philip spent much of the voyage in a crib made from an orange box. His mother, Princess Alice, was a great-granddaughter of Queen Victoria He was the youngest child, the only boy in a family of sisters - and his early childhood was spent in a loving atmosphere. The prince began his education in France but, at the age of seven, came to live with his Mountbatten relatives in England, where he attended a prep school in Surrey. By this time his mother had been diagnosed with schizophrenia and been placed in an asylum. The young prince would have little contact with her. In 1933, he was sent to Schule Schloss Salem in southern Germany, which was run by educational pioneer Kurt Hahn. But within months, Hahn, who was Jewish, was forced to flee Nazi persecution. Hahn moved to Scotland where he founded Gordonstoun school, to which the prince transferred after only two terms in Germany. Gordonstoun's Spartan regime, with its emphasis on self-reliance, was the ideal environment for a teenage boy who, separated from his parents, felt very much on his own. With war looming, Prince Philip decided on a military career. He wanted to join the Royal Air Force but his mother's family had a seafaring tradition and he became a cadet at the Britannia Royal Naval College, Dartmouth. While there he was delegated to escort the two young princesses, Elizabeth and Margaret, while King George VI and Queen Elizabeth toured the college. According to witnesses, Prince Philip showed off a great deal. But the meeting made a deep impression on the 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth. Philip quickly proved himself an outstanding prospect, passing out at the top of his class in January 1940 and seeing military action for the first time in the Indian Ocean. Philip (seated) thrived at Gordonstoun where he enjoyed amateur dramatics He transferred to the battleship HMS Valiant in the Mediterranean Fleet, where he was mentioned in dispatches for his part in the Battle of Cape Matapan in 1941. As the officer in charge of the ship's searchlights, he played a crucial role in this decisive night action. ""I found another ship and it lit up the middle part of it, whereupon it practically disappeared instantly under a salvo of 15in shells at point-blank range,""he told BBC Radio 4 in 2014. By October 1942, he was one of the youngest first lieutenants in the Royal Navy, serving on board the destroyer HMS Wallace. Throughout this period, he and the young Princess Elizabeth had been exchanging letters, and he was invited to stay with the Royal Family on a number of occasions. It was after one of these visits, over Christmas 1943, that Elizabeth placed a photograph of Philip, in naval uniform, on her dressing table. Their relationship developed in peacetime, although there was opposition to it from some courtiers - one of whom described Prince Philip as ""rough and ill-mannered"". But the young princess was very much in love and, in the summer of 1946, her suitor asked the King for his daughter's hand in marriage. Philip had a distinguished naval career However, before an engagement could be announced, the prince needed a new nationality and a family name. He renounced his Greek title, became a British citizen and took his mother's anglicised name, Mountbatten. The day before the marriage ceremony, King George VI bestowed the title of His Royal Highness on Philip and on the morning of the wedding day he was created Duke of Edinburgh, Earl of Merioneth and Baron Greenwich. The wedding took place in Westminster Abbey on 20 November 1947. It was, as Winston Churchill put it, a ""flash of colour"" in a grey post-war Britain. The duke returned to his naval career and was posted to Malta where, for a while at least, the couple could live the life of any other service family. Their son, Prince Charles, was born at Buckingham Palace in 1948, and a daughter, Princess Anne, arrived in 1950. They were later joined by Prince Andrew (1960) and Prince Edward (1964). On 2 September 1950, he achieved the ambition of every naval officer when he was appointed to his own command, the sloop HMS Magpie. But his naval career was about to be curtailed. The worsening health of George VI meant his daughter had to take on more royal duties and needed her husband by her side. His wedding to Princess Elizabeth was described as ""a flash of colour in a grey post-war Britain"" Philip took leave from the Royal Navy in July 1951. He never returned in an active role. The duke was not a man to carry regrets, but he did say in later life that he was sorry he had been unable to continue his career in the navy. Contemporaries have said that he could, on his own merit, have risen to become first sea lord. In 1952, the royal couple set off on a tour of the Commonwealth originally planned to be undertaken by the King and Queen. It was while they were staying at a game lodge in Kenya in February that word came through the King had died. He had suffered a coronary thrombosis - a fatal heart blood clot. It fell to the prince to break the news to his wife that she was now Queen. A friend later described Prince Philip as looking as if ""half the world"" had dropped on him. Philip was the first to pay homage to the Queen at her coronation Deprived of his naval career, he had to create a new role for himself, and Elizabeth's accession to the throne raised the whole question of what that was to be. As the coronation approached, a Royal Warrant proclaimed that Prince Philip would have precedence after the Queen on all occasions, yet he was never to have any constitutional position. The duke was full of ideas about how best to modernise and streamline the monarchy but became increasingly disillusioned by the entrenched opposition from a number of the palace old guard. He channelled some of his energies into an active social life. He and a group of male friends met every week in rooms above a restaurant in Soho, central London. There were long, convivial lunches and visits to nightclubs and he was often photographed with glamorous companions. One area in which the duke was given free rein to exercise his authority was in the family, although he lost the battle over the name his children would carry. He had to adapt to life as a royal consort The Queen's decision that the family would carry the name of Windsor, rather than his own family name of Mountbatten, was a bitter blow. ""I am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children,"" he complained to friends. ""I'm nothing but a bloody amoeba."" As a parent, Prince Philip could appear brusque and insensitive. According to Prince Charles's biographer, Jonathan Dimbleby, Charles was reduced to tears in his youth by public reprimands from his father and the relationship between father and eldest son was never easy. Philip insisted that Prince Charles go to his old school, Gordonstoun, in the well-intentioned belief that its regime would help counter his son's somewhat retiring nature. In the event the young prince hated the school, where he suffered homesickness and was often the target of bullies. The duke's attitudes reflected the difficult nature of his own, sometimes lonely, childhood. He was forced from an early age to develop self-reliance and found it difficult to understand that not everyone shared his strength of character. His insistence that Prince Charles attend Gordonstoun caused a rift between father and son One of Prince Philip's main concerns was for the welfare of young people, and in 1956 that interest sparked the launch of his phenomenally successful Duke of Edinburgh's Award. Over the years it enabled some six million 15-to-25-year-olds - many with disabilities - the world over to challenge themselves physically, mentally and emotionally in a range of outdoor activities designed to promote teamwork, resourcefulness and a respect for nature. ""If you can get young people to succeed in any area of activity,"" he told the BBC, ""that sensation of success will spread over into a lot of others."" Throughout his life the duke continued to devote much time to the scheme, attending various functions and involving himself in its day-to-day running. He was also a passionate advocate for wildlife and the environment, although his decision to shoot a tiger while on a trip to India in 1961 caused a furore. The publication of a photograph, in which the tiger was displayed as a trophy, only made matters worse. However, he threw his considerable influence and energy behind the World Wildlife Fund, later to become the World Wide Fund for Nature, and seemed a natural choice as its first president. The Duke of Edinburgh threw himself into his conservation efforts with typical energy and enthusiasm ""I think it's marvellous we have such a fantastic variety of life on this planet, all interdependent,"" he told a BBC interviewer. ""I think also that if we humans have the power of life or death - or extinction or survival - we ought to exercise it with some sort of moral sense. Why make something extinct if you don't have to?"" He upset some conservationists when he defended grouse shooting. ""If you have a game species, you want it to survive because you want to have some next year - exactly like a farmer. You want to crop it, you don't want to exterminate it."" But he was widely praised for his commitment to preserving the world's forests and campaigning against overfishing in the oceans. Prince Philip also took a keen interest in industry, visiting factories and becoming patron of the Industrial Society, now known as the Work Foundation. It was to a group of industrialists in 1961 that the duke displayed characteristic bluntness when he told them: ""Gentlemen, it's time we pulled our fingers out."" He took a keen interest in British industry This tendency to be forthright was interpreted by some as boorishness and sometimes got him into trouble. He certainly gained a reputation for misjudging situations, particularly when he was abroad. He made one of his most controversial comments while accompanying the Queen on a state visit to China in 1986. He made what he thought was a private remark about ""slitty eyes"". The tabloids went into a frenzy, although it seemed to cause little concern in China. On a visit to Australia in 2002, he asked an Aboriginal businessman whether ""you still throw spears at each other"". While he was heavily criticised in some quarters for such remarks, others saw them as reflecting someone who was his own man and who had refused to become bound by political correctness. Indeed, many saw his so-called ""gaffes"" as nothing more than an attempt to lighten the atmosphere and put people at their ease. Throughout his life, Prince Philip maintained an enthusiasm for sport. He sailed, played cricket and polo, excelled at carriage driving and was president of the International Equestrian Federation for many years. He had a particular passion for polo The tensions with his eldest son resurfaced with the publication of Jonathan Dimbleby's biography of Prince Charles. The Duke of Edinburgh, it was said, had pushed Charles into his marriage to Lady Diana Spencer. Yet the duke was more solicitous than many critics would allow during the difficult years when his children's marriages were disintegrating. He took the lead in attempting to understand the problems, prompted perhaps by his own memories of the difficulties of marrying into the Royal Family. Prince Philip was greatly saddened by the ending of the marriages of three of his four children - Princess Anne and Prince Andrew, as well as Prince Charles. But he always refused to talk about personal matters, telling a newspaper in 1994 that he had not done so before and was not going to start then. Advancing years barely slowed the pace of his life. He continued to travel extensively, both for the World Wide Fund for Nature and with the Queen on state visits abroad. Carriage driving was one of the duke's many sporting interests And he made a personal pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1994 to visit the tomb of his mother. Her wish to be buried there had been fulfilled. There was another poignant moment for him during the 50th anniversary of VJ Day in 1995. Prince Philip had been on a British destroyer in Tokyo Bay when the Japanese surrendered and, on the anniversary, he joined other veterans of the Far East campaign in marching past the Queen on The Mall. He also expressed sympathy for those former prisoners of the Japanese who had found it hard, or indeed impossible, to forgive what had been done to them. His brusqueness mellowed a little in later years, prompted by the public's sometimes hostile attitude to the Royal Family after the death of Diana, Princess of Wales. He was a source of great support to Diana, Princess of Wales In 2007, letters between the duke and the princess were published in an attempt to refute claims that he had been hostile to his daughter-in-law. Dubbed the Dearest Pa letters, they showed he had been a source of great support to Diana, a fact underlined by the warm tones in which she wrote to him. Mohamed Al Fayed, the father of Diana's last companion, Dodi, even suggested at the inquest into her death that she had been murdered on Prince Philip's orders - an allegation the coroner strongly rejected. Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, was a strong-willed and independent man who found himself at the centre of British society. He was a natural leader whose role forced him always to take second place; a man with a combative temperament that frequently sat uneasily with the sensitivities of his position. ""I've just done what I think was my best,"" he once told the BBC. ""I can't suddenly change my whole way of doing things, I can't change my interests or the way I react to things. That's just my style."" The Queen referred to him as her 'strength and stay' The duke retired from public life in August 2017 after decades supporting the Queen and attending events for his own charities and organisations. Buckingham Palace calculated he had completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952, and Theresa May, the then prime minister, thanked him for a ""remarkable life of public service"". Philip celebrated his 70th wedding anniversary later that year. An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures Duke of Edinburgh: A life in London A hip replacement operation did not stop him driving his carriages around the grounds of Windsor Castle, and he survived a serious car accident while driving near Sandringham in January 2019. Two women in the other car were injured, and the duke voluntarily surrendered his driver's licence. During the coronavirus pandemic, Philip and the Queen moved to Windsor Castle, and were given a vaccine in January 2021. Philip was successful in using his position to make a huge contribution to British life and played his part in helping the monarchy come to terms with changing social attitudes over the years. But his greatest achievement was undoubtedly the constancy and strength of his support for the Queen in the long years of her reign. He believed his job was, as he told his biographer, ""to ensure the Queen can reign"". At a speech given at a celebration to mark the couple's golden wedding anniversary, the Queen paid tribute to her husband, the longest-serving royal consort in British history. ""He is someone who doesn't take easily to compliments, but he has quite simply been my strength and stay all these years. And I, and his whole family, and this and many other countries, owe him a debt greater than he would ever claim or we shall ever know.""

Usually they went smoothly but one, which produced a ""human moment"", was derailed by a swarm of bees. Photographer Chris Young, working for the Press Association at the time, was there to capture it on camera. As colonel of the regiment, the duke was standing in full uniform, as he prepared to accompany Her Majesty when she emerged. But it was at this point that Young became aware of the bees. ""I got lucky,"" says Young, recalling the event 18 years later. ""I recognised that it was a human moment. She was giggling like a little girl and he was laughing too. ""I thought the reaction from both of them was pretty unique. ""Some of the guests were unsure as to whether they should move, but eventually everyone had to beat a retreat."" A royal beekeeper was swiftly summoned to sort things out. Read the story of that picturehere. Election campaigning will resume on Tuesday after a pause following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, councils, police and crime commissioners, and mayoral races in England are being held on 6 May. Campaigning will resume a day after tributes are paid to Prince Philip on Monday in the House of Commons, Holyrood and the Senedd. It will pause again on Saturday, the day of the duke's funeral. Read morehere. The Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will be a family affair attended by close relatives, with a guest list limited to just 30 because of ongoing coronavirus restrictions in England. The Queen and Prince Philip's children and grandchildren will gather to pay their respects. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be present, to allow for as many family members as possible to be there under Covid-19 rules, Downing Street has said. The duke's long-standing close aide, his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, will be one of the few, and possibly only, non-royals invited to attend the historic occasion inside St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on Saturday. Brigadier Miller-Bakewell has been the duke's right hand man for 11 years, taking on the role in 2010. Read more about the funeral planshere. The Duke of Edinburgh's first experience of the Royal Navy was as an 18-month old exile after the Greek military government banished his family. Years after that evacuation, as he left his Scottish boarding school, Prince Philip expressed a wish to join the Royal Air Force. He was persuaded by his uncle to consider joining the navy and began his budding career. Philip served with distinction during World War Two and was mentioned in dispatches Despite his career
being cut short by his royal duties, Prince Philip is remembered as an immensely
capable officer who drove himself as hard as his men and remained cool in moments
of crisis. He maintained
his love of ships and the sea, which remained a constant source of fascination
to him. ""You're
at sea and exposed to the elements in a way you never are ashore. ""At sea
you're in a cockleshell in this enormous expanse of the ocean. ""So that
tends to cut you down in size a bit."" Read morehere. Princess Alice with Prince Philip, 1924 When remembering Prince Philip, it is easy to forget that he
endured an exceptionally turbulent childhood, historian Philip Eade has told the
BBC. He was abruptly separated from his parents and four elder
sisters at the age of eight, and destined never again to live in the same home
as his immediate family. His mother, Princess Alice of
Battenberg, was placed into a sanatorium. Philip only saw his mother a handful of times during the first
two years of her confinement and for five years between the summer of 1932 and
the spring of 1937, he never saw or heard from his mother at all. It was not in his nature to overstate the effect of all this.
""I just had to get on with it,"" he later told one biographer. Read more
here The opening night of the virutal Bafta film awards has begun with a tribute paid to the Duke of Edinburgh. Host Clara Amfo praises the work of Prince Philip - a former Bafta president. ""Before we start tonight we want to say that on behalf of Bafta we are extremely saddened by the passing of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on Friday,"" she says. ""The duke was Bafta's very first president over 60 years ago and was the first of a line of royal patronage all the way through to Bafta's current president, his grandson, the Duke of Cambridge. ""It was Prince Philip and Her Majesty the Queen's support throughout these years that in many ways allowed Bafta, a leading charity in the arts, to continue in difficult times and to be here today in 2021 celebrating another outstanding year of achievement in film."" As the Queen comes to terms with the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, people in Windsor tell us what they'd say to Her Majesty if they had the chance. This video can not be played Prince Philip: What would you say to the Queen today? Writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth says the public reaction to the Duke of Edinburgh's death in part reflects ""people's affection for the Queen"" and the realisation that she is alone. ""She met Prince Philip in the 1930s, they fell in love in the 1940s, and were married in 1947, which is longer than most people have been alive, and now she is alone, so it's partly a sense of affection for the Queen and her loss,"" he said. He adds: ""But this is also someone who has lived 100 years - he has been there all our lives, so people can pause and reflect on a whole century that has gone by."" He says he thinks people have also stopped to think that Prince Philip ""always did what he was asked to do"". ""He was asked to support the Queen and he did, and he turned up in the right uniform on the right day at the right time without fail, for more than 70 years,"" he says. You can read more from Gyles Brandreth here. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News The Duke of Edinburgh visited India on a number of occasions, and
had a close friendship with the royal family in Jaipur in the state of
Rajasthan. The Maharaja of Jaipur, His
Highness, Sawai Padmanabh Singh, says he is saddened by the passing of the
Duke of Edinburgh. ""This is truly the end of an era,"" he says.  Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh ""The Royal House of Jaipur has been close to the Royal Family of Britain for generations. One of my ancestors, the late Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II of Jaipur, was among the few princes from India invited to attend the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902,"" he writes. The Queen and Prince Philip continued the friendship through the generations and were close to Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and his third wifeMaharani Gayatri Devi- a glamorous royal couple, described as India's answer to John and Jackie Kennedy - visiting them all on their trips to India. âWhen Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip made a State visit to India in 1961, they asked to include Jaipur on their itinerary because of their personal equation.â So warm was the friendship, Maharani Gayatri Devi sent the duke a box of alfonso mangoes for his birthday every year, those close to the family have said. The close ties between the two families extended to the polo ground too: âHRH Prince Philip was a talented polo player, who has played on the Rambagh Polo Ground of Jaipur, just as our family has in England each summer."" The Maharani presented Prince Philip with the trophy when his polo team Windsor Park won the Victoria Cup in 1960 Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The writer Walter Bagehot, in 1867, wrote about the ""dignified"" bit of the state, and the ""efficient"" part. Monarchy and government, in other words. The death of one of the most senior members of the former leads to a pause in the public actions of the latter, and opposition parties. The cacophony of politics has quietened, for now, at just the point it was getting louder. There are elections next month to the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and elections for mayors, councils and police and crime commissioners in England. But campaigning was suspended yesterday. Tonight, the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, has said the Tories will resume campaigning on Tuesday morning, but pause again next Saturday, the day of the Duke's funeral. A Labour source tells me they are likely to adopt a similar approach. The Liberal Democrats say they are likely to restart their campaigning at some point on Monday. Other parties are likely to follow a broadly similar plan. World leaders including US President Joe Biden and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Mr Biden called the duke ""a heck of a guy"", while Ms Ardern highlighted his awards scheme. See more tributes here: This video can not be played Sarah CampbellRoyal Correspondent In a marriage that lasted more than seven decades, Prince Philip was the Queen's support in public at significant national moments - and in private the person who knew her best. As one private secretary once put it: ""Prince Philip is the only man in the world who treats the Queen simply as another human being. He's the only man who can."" It was a marriage based on love. They chose one another. Although it wasn't the first time their paths had crossed, the photographs from their meeting at Dartmouth Naval College in 1939 reveal the beginning of their life together. He was the dashing 18-year-old cadet who caught 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth's eye, larking about playing croquet and tennis. What started as a teenage crush developed over the years into friendship with letters exchanged and occasional visits during the war years. While he was away serving with the Royal Navy, the young princess kept a picture of him in her room. Their grandson Prince William would later sum up their connection, saying: ""He makes her laugh because some of the things he says and does and the way he looks at life is obviously slightly different than her, so together they're a great couple.""

following confirmation the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will take place at Windsor
Castle that afternoon. A national minute's silence will be observed as the ceremonial royal funeral
begins at 15:00 BST. The funeral will take place on a busy sporting weekend with the FA Cup
semi-finals, a full Football League programme, the Women's Six Nations rugby and the
opening day of the World Snooker Championship among the events on the calendar. The Football League has announcedmatches scheduled to begin at 15:00 will be rearranged""as a mark of respect"". The government says it is up to the discretion of organisers as to whether sport fixtures are rearranged. In Scotland, Rangers are due to host Celtic at 16:00, one of six fourth-round
ties scheduled in the Scottish Cup, with the Scottish Football Association saying it hasentered dialogue with the relevant stakeholders about the matches. Queen Rania of Jordan has shared her thoughts about what life as a royal consort is like. She describes the Duke of Edinburgh as
a âconstant anchorâ for the Queen and says the Queen might not have been able
to âcarry on her journey the way she did without him by her sideâ. Queen Rania married her husband, now King Abdullah of Jordan, in 1993 and he became king in 1999. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview
with ITV News, she says the role of a consort is âdefined as you go along, based
on how and where you can make a difference, where you are needed and where your
passions lieâ. âBeing married to someone who is under so much pressure
means you have to do whatever you can to try and alleviate some of that
pressure. Even if thatâs by being a distraction,â she says. ""The wellbeing of your spouse eventually has an impact on how well they can carry out their duties."" Queen Rania adds there ""must have been times when it wasn't easy for him"". People around the UK have been finding a way to mark the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Outside Buckingham Palace, a steady stream of people have been queuing to leave flowers. In Windsor, hundreds of people have left bunches of flowers outside the castle. A smaller number has been left outside Balmoral Castle in Scotland. And drivers of the iconic London black cab have lined up on The Mall, the road which leads to Buckingham Palace. The UK government has urged the public not to gather because of the pandemic, while the Royal Family has asked people to consider making a donation to a charity instead of flowers, and is encouraging the public to use an online book of condolence. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Downing Street has announced the Prime Minister will not attend the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral next Saturday - as we reported a few minutes ago. In a statement, a Number 10 spokesman says: âThe
Prime Minister has throughout wanted to act in accordance with what is best for
the Royal household, and so to allow for as many family members as possible
will not be attending the funeral on Saturdayâ. My understanding is the protocol around this is those who would be expected to attend such a funeral is drawn up well in advance, and in normal times that would include the prime minister. But given the Covid restrictions, Boris Johnson felt it was appropriate to say he wouldn't be there, to allow someone who knew him better the chance to be there.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Officers sacked after filming themselves speedingThe policemen were on road safety duty when they drove at 89mph in a seized vehicle.,"The officers broke the speed limit in a high performance vehicle they seized Two police officers have been sacked after filming themselves breaking the speed limit at 89mph in a seized high-performance vehicle. Devon and Cornwall Police officers PC Shaun Pearce and PC Daniel Pike shared the video with colleagues on WhatsApp. They were taking part in aroad safety campaign,external, which included preventing speeding, at the time. A disciplinary hearing on Thursday found the officers had committed gross misconduct and should be dismissed. They are now banned from working for the police in England and Wales. PC Pearce and PC Pike were on road safety duty as part of the 'Fatal Five' campaign - which includes targeting speeding drivers - when the incident happened on 16 January 2019 , the hearing heard. The officers had seized the vehicle, and while waiting for a recovery vehicle to arrive, drove it without the owner's permission reaching speeds up to 89 mph over 3.1 miles. The vehicle was returned minutes later to the same position. PC Pike, who was a passenger, filmed PC Pearce speeding. The footage was then shared with colleagues in a WhatsApp group, along with an explanation that the vehicle had to be moved rather than await recovery. After a three-day hearing, the panel concluded the officers had breached expected standards of professional behaviour and they should be dismissed without notice. Head of Professional Standards Det Supt Paul Kessell said: ""The behaviour displayed by these officers falls well below what the force and the public expect of a police officer. ""Through their actions, they have undermined the public's trust and confidence in the police force and taken advantage of the responsibility placed on them in their roles. ""We will not tolerate such behaviours and therefore dismissal was the right and proper outcome."" Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Bafta announces first 2021 film award winners,"Chadwick Boseman (left) and Viola Davis star in Ma Rainey's Black Bottom The movie Ma Rainey's Black Bottom has won two prizes on the first night of the Bafta Film Awards, which are being split over two days for the first time. Many of the technical prizes were handed out on Saturday, with the main awards still to be presented on Sunday. Riz Ahmed, Sir Anthony Hopkins, Vanessa Kirby and Daniel Kaluuya are among the stars up for acting awards. Both halves of the ceremony are being presented from the Royal Albert Hall, but winners are appearing virtually. Ma Rainey's Black Bottom stars Viola Davis and the late Chadwick Boseman as members of a 1920s blues band. Many of the young stars of Rocks, which won best casting, had not acted before Other winners included Rocks, a low-budget British film starring a group of teenage girls, many of whom had not acted before; Christopher Nolan's time-bending thriller Tenet; and Mank, in which Gary Oldman plays Citizen Kane screenwriter Herman J Mankiewicz. The winners from the first night were: Casting - Rocks Costume design - Ma Rainey's Black Bottom Make-up and hair - Ma Rainey's Black Bottom Production design - Mank Sound - Sound of Metal Special visual effects - Tenet British short film - The Present British short animation - The Owl and the Pussycat The winners and nominees in full Noel Clarke - the Kidulthood, Bulletproof and Doctor Who actor - was also presented with the outstanding British contribution to cinema award. He dedicated it to ""my young black boys and girls out there that never believed it could happen to them"". Bafta Film Awards 2021: Red carpet in pictures The Duke of Cambridge had been due to appear in a pre-recorded segment, but pulled out following the death of his grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh. Host Clara Amfo paid tribute to Prince Philip, who was Bafta's first president from 1959-66. On Sunday, prizes including best film, director, screenplay and animated feature will be handed out, as well as the acting awards. Noel Clarke received the outstanding contribution award This year's shortlists includea diverse line-up of talent, following an outcry last year when voters only nominated white actors. This time, 16 of the 24 acting contenders come from minority ethnic backgrounds. Two films lead the overall field with seven nominations each - Rocks and Nomadland, which stars Frances McDormand as a US woman living a nomadic life in a van after the financial crash.

Sunday's ceremony will be hosted by Edith Bowman and Dermot O'Leary, and will be broadcaston BBC One from 19.00-21.00 BST. Dermot O'Leary and Edith Bowman will host Sunday's leg of the ceremony Following the lack of diversity last year, a seven-month review led Bafta to introduce more than 120 changes to its voting, membership and campaigning processes. They included the introduction of a new longlist round of voting, the expansion of the outstanding British film field to 10 nominations, and increasing all four acting categories and best director to six nominees in an attempt to ensure greater diversity. This year's Baftas were delayed by two months because of the pandemic, and come two weeks before the awards season reaches its climax with the Oscars. Unlike the Baftas, the Oscars organisers want nominees to appear in person, and will have a London venue for the first time for UK-based contenders.

Officers sacked after filming themselves speeding,"The officers broke the speed limit in a high performance vehicle they seized Two police officers have been sacked after filming themselves breaking the speed limit at 89mph in a seized high-performance vehicle. Devon and Cornwall Police officers PC Shaun Pearce and PC Daniel Pike shared the video with colleagues on WhatsApp. They were taking part in aroad safety campaign,external, which included preventing speeding, at the time. A disciplinary hearing on Thursday found the officers had committed gross misconduct and should be dismissed. They are now banned from working for the police in England and Wales. PC Pearce and PC Pike were on road safety duty as part of the 'Fatal Five' campaign - which includes targeting speeding drivers - when the incident happened on 16 January 2019 , the hearing heard. The officers had seized the vehicle, and while waiting for a recovery vehicle to arrive, drove it without the owner's permission reaching speeds up to 89 mph over 3.1 miles. The vehicle was returned minutes later to the same position. PC Pike, who was a passenger, filmed PC Pearce speeding. The footage was then shared with colleagues in a WhatsApp group, along with an explanation that the vehicle had to be moved rather than await recovery. After a three-day hearing, the panel concluded the officers had breached expected standards of professional behaviour and they should be dismissed without notice. Head of Professional Standards Det Supt Paul Kessell said: ""The behaviour displayed by these officers falls well below what the force and the public expect of a police officer. ""Through their actions, they have undermined the public's trust and confidence in the police force and taken advantage of the responsibility placed on them in their roles. ""We will not tolerate such behaviours and therefore dismissal was the right and proper outcome."" Follow BBC West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Usually they went smoothly but one, which produced a ""human moment"", was derailed by a swarm of bees. Photographer Chris Young, working for the Press Association at the time, was there to capture it on camera. As colonel of the regiment, the duke was standing in full uniform, as he prepared to accompany Her Majesty when she emerged. But it was at this point that Young became aware of the bees. ""I got lucky,"" says Young, recalling the event 18 years later. ""I recognised that it was a human moment. She was giggling like a little girl and he was laughing too. ""I thought the reaction from both of them was pretty unique. ""Some of the guests were unsure as to whether they should move, but eventually everyone had to beat a retreat."" A royal beekeeper was swiftly summoned to sort things out. Read the story of that picturehere. Election campaigning will resume on Tuesday after a pause following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh.

The Queen and Prince Philip's children and grandchildren will gather to pay their respects. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be present, to allow for as many family members as possible to be there under Covid-19 rules, Downing Street has said. The duke's long-standing close aide, his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, will be one of the few, and possibly only, non-royals invited to attend the historic occasion inside St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on Saturday. Brigadier Miller-Bakewell has been the duke's right hand man for 11 years, taking on the role in 2010. Read more about the funeral planshere. The Duke of Edinburgh's first experience of the Royal Navy was as an 18-month old exile after the Greek military government banished his family. Years after that evacuation, as he left his Scottish boarding school, Prince Philip expressed a wish to join the Royal Air Force. He was persuaded by his uncle to consider joining the navy and began his budding career. Philip served with distinction during World War Two and was mentioned in dispatches Despite his career
being cut short by his royal duties, Prince Philip is remembered as an immensely
capable officer who drove himself as hard as his men and remained cool in moments
of crisis. He maintained
his love of ships and the sea, which remained a constant source of fascination
to him. ""You're
at sea and exposed to the elements in a way you never are ashore. ""At sea
you're in a cockleshell in this enormous expanse of the ocean. ""So that
tends to cut you down in size a bit."" Read morehere. Princess Alice with Prince Philip, 1924 When remembering Prince Philip, it is easy to forget that he
endured an exceptionally turbulent childhood, historian Philip Eade has told the
BBC. He was abruptly separated from his parents and four elder
sisters at the age of eight, and destined never again to live in the same home
as his immediate family. His mother, Princess Alice of
Battenberg, was placed into a sanatorium. Philip only saw his mother a handful of times during the first
two years of her confinement and for five years between the summer of 1932 and
the spring of 1937, he never saw or heard from his mother at all. It was not in his nature to overstate the effect of all this.
""I just had to get on with it,"" he later told one biographer. Read more

""Before we start tonight we want to say that on behalf of Bafta we are extremely saddened by the passing of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on Friday,"" she says. ""The duke was Bafta's very first president over 60 years ago and was the first of a line of royal patronage all the way through to Bafta's current president, his grandson, the Duke of Cambridge. ""It was Prince Philip and Her Majesty the Queen's support throughout these years that in many ways allowed Bafta, a leading charity in the arts, to continue in difficult times and to be here today in 2021 celebrating another outstanding year of achievement in film."" As the Queen comes to terms with the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, people in Windsor tell us what they'd say to Her Majesty if they had the chance. This video can not be played Prince Philip: What would you say to the Queen today? Writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth says the public reaction to the Duke of Edinburgh's death in part reflects ""people's affection for the Queen"" and the realisation that she is alone. ""She met Prince Philip in the 1930s, they fell in love in the 1940s, and were married in 1947, which is longer than most people have been alive, and now she is alone, so it's partly a sense of affection for the Queen and her loss,"" he said. He adds: ""But this is also someone who has lived 100 years - he has been there all our lives, so people can pause and reflect on a whole century that has gone by."" He says he thinks people have also stopped to think that Prince Philip ""always did what he was asked to do"". ""He was asked to support the Queen and he did, and he turned up in the right uniform on the right day at the right time without fail, for more than 70 years,"" he says.

had a close friendship with the royal family in Jaipur in the state of
Rajasthan. The Maharaja of Jaipur, His
Highness, Sawai Padmanabh Singh, says he is saddened by the passing of the
Duke of Edinburgh. ""This is truly the end of an era,"" he says.  Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh ""The Royal House of Jaipur has been close to the Royal Family of Britain for generations. One of my ancestors, the late Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II of Jaipur, was among the few princes from India invited to attend the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902,"" he writes. The Queen and Prince Philip continued the friendship through the generations and were close to Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and his third wifeMaharani Gayatri Devi- a glamorous royal couple, described as India's answer to John and Jackie Kennedy - visiting them all on their trips to India. âWhen Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip made a State visit to India in 1961, they asked to include Jaipur on their itinerary because of their personal equation.â So warm was the friendship, Maharani Gayatri Devi sent the duke a box of alfonso mangoes for his birthday every year, those close to the family have said. The close ties between the two families extended to the polo ground too: âHRH Prince Philip was a talented polo player, who has played on the Rambagh Polo Ground of Jaipur, just as our family has in England each summer."" The Maharani presented Prince Philip with the trophy when his polo team Windsor Park won the Victoria Cup in 1960 Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The writer Walter Bagehot, in 1867, wrote about the ""dignified"" bit of the state, and the ""efficient"" part. Monarchy and government, in other words. The death of one of the most senior members of the former leads to a pause in the public actions of the latter, and opposition parties. The cacophony of politics has quietened, for now, at just the point it was getting louder. There are elections next month to the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and elections for mayors, councils and police and crime commissioners in England. But campaigning was suspended yesterday. Tonight, the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, has said the Tories will resume campaigning on Tuesday morning, but pause again next Saturday, the day of the Duke's funeral. A Labour source tells me they are likely to adopt a similar approach. The Liberal Democrats say they are likely to restart their campaigning at some point on Monday. Other parties are likely to follow a broadly similar plan. World leaders including US President Joe Biden and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Mr Biden called the duke ""a heck of a guy"", while Ms Ardern highlighted his awards scheme. See more tributes here: This video can not be played Sarah CampbellRoyal Correspondent In a marriage that lasted more than seven decades, Prince Philip was the Queen's support in public at significant national moments - and in private the person who knew her best. As one private secretary once put it: ""Prince Philip is the only man in the world who treats the Queen simply as another human being. He's the only man who can."" It was a marriage based on love. They chose one another. Although it wasn't the first time their paths had crossed, the photographs from their meeting at Dartmouth Naval College in 1939 reveal the beginning of their life together. He was the dashing 18-year-old cadet who caught 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth's eye, larking about playing croquet and tennis. What started as a teenage crush developed over the years into friendship with letters exchanged and occasional visits during the war years. While he was away serving with the Royal Navy, the young princess kept a picture of him in her room. Their grandson Prince William would later sum up their connection, saying: ""He makes her laugh because some of the things he says and does and the way he looks at life is obviously slightly different than her, so together they're a great couple.""

following confirmation the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will take place at Windsor
Castle that afternoon. A national minute's silence will be observed as the ceremonial royal funeral
begins at 15:00 BST. The funeral will take place on a busy sporting weekend with the FA Cup
semi-finals, a full Football League programme, the Women's Six Nations rugby and the
opening day of the World Snooker Championship among the events on the calendar. The Football League has announcedmatches scheduled to begin at 15:00 will be rearranged""as a mark of respect"". The government says it is up to the discretion of organisers as to whether sport fixtures are rearranged. In Scotland, Rangers are due to host Celtic at 16:00, one of six fourth-round
ties scheduled in the Scottish Cup, with the Scottish Football Association saying it hasentered dialogue with the relevant stakeholders about the matches. Queen Rania of Jordan has shared her thoughts about what life as a royal consort is like. She describes the Duke of Edinburgh as
a âconstant anchorâ for the Queen and says the Queen might not have been able
to âcarry on her journey the way she did without him by her sideâ. Queen Rania married her husband, now King Abdullah of Jordan, in 1993 and he became king in 1999. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview
with ITV News, she says the role of a consort is âdefined as you go along, based
on how and where you can make a difference, where you are needed and where your
passions lieâ. âBeing married to someone who is under so much pressure
means you have to do whatever you can to try and alleviate some of that
pressure. Even if thatâs by being a distraction,â she says. ""The wellbeing of your spouse eventually has an impact on how well they can carry out their duties."" Queen Rania adds there ""must have been times when it wasn't easy for him"". People around the UK have been finding a way to mark the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Outside Buckingham Palace, a steady stream of people have been queuing to leave flowers. In Windsor, hundreds of people have left bunches of flowers outside the castle. A smaller number has been left outside Balmoral Castle in Scotland. And drivers of the iconic London black cab have lined up on The Mall, the road which leads to Buckingham Palace. The UK government has urged the public not to gather because of the pandemic, while the Royal Family has asked people to consider making a donation to a charity instead of flowers, and is encouraging the public to use an online book of condolence. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Downing Street has announced the Prime Minister will not attend the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral next Saturday - as we reported a few minutes ago. In a statement, a Number 10 spokesman says: âThe
Prime Minister has throughout wanted to act in accordance with what is best for
the Royal household, and so to allow for as many family members as possible
will not be attending the funeral on Saturdayâ. My understanding is the protocol around this is those who would be expected to attend such a funeral is drawn up well in advance, and in normal times that would include the prime minister. But given the Covid restrictions, Boris Johnson felt it was appropriate to say he wouldn't be there, to allow someone who knew him better the chance to be there.  Â© 2025 BBC.

Usually they went smoothly but one, which produced a ""human moment"", was derailed by a swarm of bees. Photographer Chris Young, working for the Press Association at the time, was there to capture it on camera. As colonel of the regiment, the duke was standing in full uniform, as he prepared to accompany Her Majesty when she emerged. But it was at this point that Young became aware of the bees. ""I got lucky,"" says Young, recalling the event 18 years later. ""I recognised that it was a human moment. She was giggling like a little girl and he was laughing too. ""I thought the reaction from both of them was pretty unique. ""Some of the guests were unsure as to whether they should move, but eventually everyone had to beat a retreat."" A royal beekeeper was swiftly summoned to sort things out. Read the story of that picturehere. Election campaigning will resume on Tuesday after a pause following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh.

The Duke of Edinburgh's first experience of the Royal Navy was as an 18-month old exile after the Greek military government banished his family. Years after that evacuation, as he left his Scottish boarding school, Prince Philip expressed a wish to join the Royal Air Force. He was persuaded by his uncle to consider joining the navy and began his budding career. Philip served with distinction during World War Two and was mentioned in dispatches Despite his career
being cut short by his royal duties, Prince Philip is remembered as an immensely
capable officer who drove himself as hard as his men and remained cool in moments
of crisis. He maintained
his love of ships and the sea, which remained a constant source of fascination
to him. ""You're
at sea and exposed to the elements in a way you never are ashore. ""At sea
you're in a cockleshell in this enormous expanse of the ocean. ""So that
tends to cut you down in size a bit."" Read morehere. Princess Alice with Prince Philip, 1924 When remembering Prince Philip, it is easy to forget that he
endured an exceptionally turbulent childhood, historian Philip Eade has told the
BBC. He was abruptly separated from his parents and four elder
sisters at the age of eight, and destined never again to live in the same home
as his immediate family. His mother, Princess Alice of
Battenberg, was placed into a sanatorium. Philip only saw his mother a handful of times during the first
two years of her confinement and for five years between the summer of 1932 and
the spring of 1937, he never saw or heard from his mother at all. It was not in his nature to overstate the effect of all this.

""Before we start tonight we want to say that on behalf of Bafta we are extremely saddened by the passing of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on Friday,"" she says. ""The duke was Bafta's very first president over 60 years ago and was the first of a line of royal patronage all the way through to Bafta's current president, his grandson, the Duke of Cambridge. ""It was Prince Philip and Her Majesty the Queen's support throughout these years that in many ways allowed Bafta, a leading charity in the arts, to continue in difficult times and to be here today in 2021 celebrating another outstanding year of achievement in film."" As the Queen comes to terms with the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, people in Windsor tell us what they'd say to Her Majesty if they had the chance. This video can not be played Prince Philip: What would you say to the Queen today? Writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth says the public reaction to the Duke of Edinburgh's death in part reflects ""people's affection for the Queen"" and the realisation that she is alone. ""She met Prince Philip in the 1930s, they fell in love in the 1940s, and were married in 1947, which is longer than most people have been alive, and now she is alone, so it's partly a sense of affection for the Queen and her loss,"" he said. He adds: ""But this is also someone who has lived 100 years - he has been there all our lives, so people can pause and reflect on a whole century that has gone by."" He says he thinks people have also stopped to think that Prince Philip ""always did what he was asked to do"". ""He was asked to support the Queen and he did, and he turned up in the right uniform on the right day at the right time without fail, for more than 70 years,"" he says.

had a close friendship with the royal family in Jaipur in the state of
Rajasthan. The Maharaja of Jaipur, His
Highness, Sawai Padmanabh Singh, says he is saddened by the passing of the
Duke of Edinburgh. ""This is truly the end of an era,"" he says.  Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh ""The Royal House of Jaipur has been close to the Royal Family of Britain for generations. One of my ancestors, the late Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II of Jaipur, was among the few princes from India invited to attend the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902,"" he writes. The Queen and Prince Philip continued the friendship through the generations and were close to Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and his third wifeMaharani Gayatri Devi- a glamorous royal couple, described as India's answer to John and Jackie Kennedy - visiting them all on their trips to India. âWhen Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip made a State visit to India in 1961, they asked to include Jaipur on their itinerary because of their personal equation.â So warm was the friendship, Maharani Gayatri Devi sent the duke a box of alfonso mangoes for his birthday every year, those close to the family have said. The close ties between the two families extended to the polo ground too: âHRH Prince Philip was a talented polo player, who has played on the Rambagh Polo Ground of Jaipur, just as our family has in England each summer."" The Maharani presented Prince Philip with the trophy when his polo team Windsor Park won the Victoria Cup in 1960 Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The writer Walter Bagehot, in 1867, wrote about the ""dignified"" bit of the state, and the ""efficient"" part. Monarchy and government, in other words. The death of one of the most senior members of the former leads to a pause in the public actions of the latter, and opposition parties. The cacophony of politics has quietened, for now, at just the point it was getting louder. There are elections next month to the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and elections for mayors, councils and police and crime commissioners in England. But campaigning was suspended yesterday. Tonight, the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, has said the Tories will resume campaigning on Tuesday morning, but pause again next Saturday, the day of the Duke's funeral. A Labour source tells me they are likely to adopt a similar approach. The Liberal Democrats say they are likely to restart their campaigning at some point on Monday. Other parties are likely to follow a broadly similar plan. World leaders including US President Joe Biden and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Mr Biden called the duke ""a heck of a guy"", while Ms Ardern highlighted his awards scheme. See more tributes here: This video can not be played Sarah CampbellRoyal Correspondent In a marriage that lasted more than seven decades, Prince Philip was the Queen's support in public at significant national moments - and in private the person who knew her best. As one private secretary once put it: ""Prince Philip is the only man in the world who treats the Queen simply as another human being. He's the only man who can."" It was a marriage based on love. They chose one another. Although it wasn't the first time their paths had crossed, the photographs from their meeting at Dartmouth Naval College in 1939 reveal the beginning of their life together. He was the dashing 18-year-old cadet who caught 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth's eye, larking about playing croquet and tennis. What started as a teenage crush developed over the years into friendship with letters exchanged and occasional visits during the war years. While he was away serving with the Royal Navy, the young princess kept a picture of him in her room. Their grandson Prince William would later sum up their connection, saying: ""He makes her laugh because some of the things he says and does and the way he looks at life is obviously slightly different than her, so together they're a great couple.""

following confirmation the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will take place at Windsor
Castle that afternoon. A national minute's silence will be observed as the ceremonial royal funeral
begins at 15:00 BST. The funeral will take place on a busy sporting weekend with the FA Cup
semi-finals, a full Football League programme, the Women's Six Nations rugby and the
opening day of the World Snooker Championship among the events on the calendar. The Football League has announcedmatches scheduled to begin at 15:00 will be rearranged""as a mark of respect"". The government says it is up to the discretion of organisers as to whether sport fixtures are rearranged. In Scotland, Rangers are due to host Celtic at 16:00, one of six fourth-round
ties scheduled in the Scottish Cup, with the Scottish Football Association saying it hasentered dialogue with the relevant stakeholders about the matches. Queen Rania of Jordan has shared her thoughts about what life as a royal consort is like. She describes the Duke of Edinburgh as
a âconstant anchorâ for the Queen and says the Queen might not have been able
to âcarry on her journey the way she did without him by her sideâ. Queen Rania married her husband, now King Abdullah of Jordan, in 1993 and he became king in 1999. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview
with ITV News, she says the role of a consort is âdefined as you go along, based
on how and where you can make a difference, where you are needed and where your
passions lieâ. âBeing married to someone who is under so much pressure
means you have to do whatever you can to try and alleviate some of that
pressure. Even if thatâs by being a distraction,â she says. ""The wellbeing of your spouse eventually has an impact on how well they can carry out their duties."" Queen Rania adds there ""must have been times when it wasn't easy for him"". People around the UK have been finding a way to mark the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Outside Buckingham Palace, a steady stream of people have been queuing to leave flowers. In Windsor, hundreds of people have left bunches of flowers outside the castle. A smaller number has been left outside Balmoral Castle in Scotland. And drivers of the iconic London black cab have lined up on The Mall, the road which leads to Buckingham Palace. The UK government has urged the public not to gather because of the pandemic, while the Royal Family has asked people to consider making a donation to a charity instead of flowers, and is encouraging the public to use an online book of condolence. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Downing Street has announced the Prime Minister will not attend the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral next Saturday - as we reported a few minutes ago. In a statement, a Number 10 spokesman says: âThe
Prime Minister has throughout wanted to act in accordance with what is best for
the Royal household, and so to allow for as many family members as possible
will not be attending the funeral on Saturdayâ. My understanding is the protocol around this is those who would be expected to attend such a funeral is drawn up well in advance, and in normal times that would include the prime minister. But given the Covid restrictions, Boris Johnson felt it was appropriate to say he wouldn't be there, to allow someone who knew him better the chance to be there.  Â© 2025 BBC.

By Becky Morton, BBC News Anne says Prince Philip ""was a great support to the Queen and she obviously adored him"" Windsor evokes memories of royal weddings, with crowds lining the streets waving the union jack. Today the mood is sombre, and some locals - and others from further afield - have come to pay their respects. Anne Yearsley, 82, from Waltham St Lawrence in Berkshire, has brought her grandchildren Cordelia, 10, and Sherlock, six, to Windsor Castle. ""We just thought it would be wonderful for them to have this memory,"" she says. Anne has followed the royal couple's lives since they married in 1947 and remembers their wedding. More recently, she recalls passing the duke riding his carriage in Windsor Great Park a few years ago. Sherlock is wearing a military uniform for the occasion - passed down from his father who used to wear it as a child watching Trooping the Colour. The children have been learning about Prince Philip's achievements from news coverage and Cordelia is now excited to do the Duke of Edinburgh Award when she's older. ""I didn't really know much about him before, apart from that he was the husband of the Queen,"" she says. ""I didn't know he did all these amazing things.""

His coffin will instead lay at rest in the private chapel at Windsor Castle and will be draped with the duke's personal standard with a wreath of flowers on top.

The funeral will take place at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle A spokesman for the Palace said: ""Whilst this is a time of sadness and mourning the coming days will be an opportunity to celebrate a remarkable life."" Only 30 people - expected to be the duke's children, grandchildren and other close family - will attend the ceremony as guests. On the day of the funeral, Prince Philip's coffin will be transported from Windsor Castle to St George's Chapel in a specially modified Land Rover he helped to design. Members of the Royal Family including the Prince of Wales will walk behind the coffin, and the Queen will travel separately to the chapel. Guests will socially distance and wear face coverings in line with coronavirus restrictions. Jockeys, owners and trainers marked a two-minute silence in tribute to the duke at Aintree Racecourse, Liverpool on Saturday Military guns will fire during the procession, which will take eight minutes, and the curfew bell will toll.

Chinese regulator slaps huge fine on tech giantThe e-commerce company Alibaba Group is fined $2.75bn for violating anti-monopoly rules.Business,"The world's biggest online retailer - China's Alibaba - has been hit with a record fine equivalent to $2.75bn (just over Â£2bn). Regulators in China said the internet giant had abused its dominant market position for several years. In a statement the company said it accepted the ruling and would ""ensure its compliance"". Analysts say the fine shows China intends to move against internet platforms that it thinks are too big. Chinaâs tech giants face new anti-monopoly rules China opens door to Ant Group's stock market debut The race to create the world's next super-app While not well known outside China, inside the country Alibaba is an ever-present behemoth, the BBC's Robin Brant reports from Shanghai. The company is China's Amazon meets eBay, our correspondent says. Retail is its main activity but its work has spread to digital payments, credit and cloud computing. The fine amounts to 4% of Alibaba's revenue in 2019. Regulators say Alibaba restricted competition by stopping some sellers using other platforms. It is the latest in a chain of events targeting the company that kicked off last October, just after its high-profile co-founder, Jack Ma, told a gathering of China's leading regulators that they were stifling innovation. Jack Ma is well-known in China as one of the country's most successful entrepreneurs. Why did China's most famous tech titan disappear? ""This penalty will be viewed as a closure to the anti-monopoly case for now by the market,"" Hong Hao, head of research at BOCOM International in Hong Kong, told Reuters news agency. ""It's indeed the highest profile anti-monopoly case in China. The market has been anticipating some sort of penalty for some time... but people need to pay attention to the measures beyond the anti-monopoly investigation."" The country's other tech giants are also coming under increasing pressure from regulators worried about their growing influence. Last month12 companies were finedover deals that violated anti-monopoly rules. The companies included Tencent, Baidu, Didi Chuxing, SoftBank and a ByteDance-backed firm.

Royals reflect on the 'rock in the Queenâs life',"""His energy was astonishing,"" Prince Charles said of his father in his support of the Queen The Duke of Edinburgh's children have shared their reflections on their father's life, his ""astonishing achievement"" and his legacy. The Prince of Wales told the BBC ""his energy was astonishing in supporting my mama, and doing it for such a long time"". ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life,"" said the Earl of Wessex. The Princess Royal praised the ""double act"" he created with the monarch. And the Duke of York fondly recalled Prince Philip as a father spending time with his family. ""Like any other family at the time, your parents went out to work during the day but in the evening - just the same as any other family - we would get together, we would sit on the sofa as a group and he would read to us,"" Prince Andrew said. The royals were speaking in interviews to mark the Duke of Edinburgh's death as part of a BBC special programme billed as a tribute ""from those who knew him best"". Prince Charles told the programme: ""I think he'll probably want to be remembered as an individual in his own right."" Princess Anne reflected on the ""incredible challenge"" of moving from a career in the Royal Navy to royal consort Reflecting on his father's difficult upbringing after his family was exiled, he said: ""It can't have been easy and life was uncertain and everyone had to rely on other people to help - and presumably he had to fall back on himself."" This uncertain upbringing left him with the ""extraordinary ability"" to be positive and move on from adversity, said Princess Anne. Prince Charles spoke of the ""huge value"" his father found in his education at Gordonstoun under its founder Kurt Hahn, an unconventional figure who emphasised self-reliance and risking - and who partly inspired the creation of the Duke of Edinburgh's award. Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures More on Prince Philip's life,external Moving from a career in the Royal Navy to become royal consort was ""an incredible challenge"", Princess Anne said. ""In the Royal Navy he was in charge of ships, he was making all the decisions. In his next life, he was making very few."" But Prince Andrew, who served in the navy during the Falklands War, said he had never had any discussions with his father about whether he would have stayed on in the service. ""He saw his role as supporting the Queen,"" the prince said. Princess Anne spoke of how his appreciation of how he could help the Queen ""always seemed to be present"" and was vital because she succeeded to the throne so young. ""They needed to be a double act for a lot of that time to allow her to take on that role,"" she said. Prince Edward recalled a ""lovely moment"" when his mother was able to pay tribute to his father at the 50th anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, by giving the organisation a Royal Charter. ""It probably meant more to my mother anyway. My father is far too modest to be remotely interested in all that sort of thing, he would brush it off,"" the prince said. He said the award was a result of Prince Philip's belief ""that if you could tap into what a young person's passion was, that would drive them forward in terms of their life and their success"". Prince Edward said he was ""a great source of support and encouragement and guidance all the way through"" while Princess Anne added: ""I think I will best remember him as always being there and a person you could bounce off ideas, but if you were having problems you could always go to him."" Prince Philip's legendary ""directness"" was inherited from his mother, Prince Charles explained with an anecdote. The duke took on his role with ""extraordinary tact and diplomacy"", said Prince Edward His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was buried in Jerusalem, where she is also honoured at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial as ""Righteous Among the Nations"" for protecting Jews at her house in Athens during World War Two. ""My father said, but hang on, how are we ever going to visit your grave?"" the Prince of Wales recalled. ""She said, don't be so silly, there's a very good bus service from Athens."" The Duke of Edinburgh ""did not suffer fools gladly"", Prince Charles said, which ""made one choose your words carefully"". Prince Edward said had taken on a challenging role ""with the most extraordinary flair, and the most extraordinary tact and diplomacy - he's never, ever tried to overshadow the Queen in any way, shape or form. ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same."" ""His energy was astonishing, in supporting my mama, and doing it for such a long time,"" said Prince Charles. ""What he's done has amounted to an astonishing achievement, I think.""

The telegram from King Felipe and Queen Letizia of Spain was particularly poignant, sending ""all our love and affection"" to Aunt Lilibet (the affectionate name used by the duke for his wife) and Dear Uncle Philip. ""We shall never forget the moments that we shared with him,"" they told the Queen. Prince Philip rides in a carriage with Spain's Queen Letizia in London in 2017 Sweden's King Carl Gustaf said the duke had been ""a great friend of our family for many years, a relation we have deeply valued"". Swedish royal family spokeswoman Margareta Thorgren told the BBC the king and the duke had sailed together in England, adding: ""That was the start of a great friendship between them."" The Dutch royal family said they remembered Prince Philip with great respect, adding: ""His lively personality made an indelible impression."" Belgium's King Philippe said he and Queen Mathilde would ""always cherish the memories of our warm encounters"". Tributes came in too from the Commonwealth - 54 nations, most with roots in the British Empire and home to 2.4 billion people. Australian flags were flown at half-mast on the Sydney Harbour Bridge in tribute to the duke Flags were lowered to half-mast at Australia's Parliament House in Canberra, where a 41-gun salute took place on Saturday, and at the Sydney Harbour Bridge, where in 1954 Prince Philip arrived alongside the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth on the first visit by a reigning monarch to the country. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern noted that thousands of young people had ""completed life-changing challenges"" through the duke's Hillary Award. A 41-gun salute is fired to commemorate the death of Prince Philip at Parliament House in Canberra, Australia Canada's Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the duke had ""contributed so much to the social fabric of our country - and the world"". Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said Philip had been a ""wise leader"" and his ""role in promoting Pakistan-UK relations will always be remembered"". And Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi was another to praise a lifetime of dedication to ""many community service initiatives"". Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta said the duke had been a ""towering symbol of family values and the unity of the British people as well as the entire global community"". African leaders mourn Philip Other warm condolences from Africa included Zimbabwe - which has had a rocky relationship with the UK and is no longer in the Commonwealth - and the president of Tanzania, which only recentlylost its leader John Pombe Magufuli amid Covid-19 rumours. Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures Other tributes came from nations deeply linked to the duke and his family. Malta's Prime Minister Robert Abela wrote: ""Truly saddened by the loss of Prince Philip, who made Malta his home and returned here so often. Our people will always treasure his memory."" Philip and Elizabeth spent two idyllic years on Malta, where he was stationed in the Navy, before King George VI died in 1952. Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said the duke had been ""the consummate public servant"" and would be much missed. The duke's mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, who died in 1969, is buried at the Church of Mary Magdalene in Jerusalem. The Duke of Edinburgh with his mother Princess Alice Of Battenberg The Emir of Qatar, Sheikh Tamim bin Hamad Al Thani, sent his ""sincere condolences and sympathies"" to the Queen, the Royal Family and the British people.

WHO chief criticises 'shocking' vaccine inequality,"The WHO-led Covax scheme is designed to boost vaccine supplies to poorer nations around the world The World Health Organization (WHO) has criticised what it describes as a ""shocking imbalance"" in the distribution of coronavirus vaccines between rich and poor countries. The group's chief said a target of seeing vaccination programmes under way in every country by Saturday would be missed. The WHO has long called for fairer distribution of Covid-19 vaccines. It is leading the Covax scheme which is designed to get jabs to poorer nations. So far, more than 38 million doses have been delivered to around 100 countries under the scheme. Covax hopes to deliver more than two billion doses to people in 190 countries in less than a year. In particular, it wants to ensure that 92 poorer countries will receive access to vaccines at the same time as wealthier countries. ""There remains a shocking imbalance in the global distribution of vaccines,"" WHO Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus told a news conference on Friday. ""On average in high-income countries, almost one in four people have received a Covid-19 vaccine. In low-income countries, it's one in more than 500,"" he said. 'Some countries can't afford the Covid vaccine' Africa's long wait for the Covid-19 vaccine Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? The Covax scheme had been expected to distribute at least 100 million doses worldwide by the end of March, but only 38 million jabs have been delivered so far. ""We hope to be able to catch up during April and May,"" Dr Tedros said. He also criticised countries that have sought their own vaccine deals outside of the Covax scheme. ""Some countries and companies plan to do their own bilateral vaccine donations, bypassing Covax for their own political or commercial reasons,"" Dr Tedros said. ""These bilateral arrangements run the risk of fanning the flames of vaccine inequity,"" he added. ""Scarcity of supply is driving vaccine nationalism."" Earlier this year, Dr Tedros warned that the world was facing a ""catastrophic moral failure"" over vaccine inequality.  He said a ""me-first"" approach would be self-defeating because it would encourage hoarding and prolong the pandemic. Vaccines produced in the UK, US, Europe, Russia and China are already being widely used, having been bought up and approved in countries around the world. But doses have not been shared equally between countries.

'You look hung-over!' When the public met the duke,"Prince Philip at Sandringham for the Christmas service in 2017 It was a cold morning on the Sunday between Christmas and New Year, and Cat Kidd was among the well-wishers at Sandringham in Norfolk, waiting for the Royal Family to arrive at church. Cat, now 34 and living in Cambridge, is from the area, and would often visit Sandringham with her family to see the royals' traditional Christmas church visit. On this morning, five or six years ago, Prince Philip spotted Cat in the crowd. To her surprise, he said something. So what was his festive greeting? ""He shouted out: 'You look like you've had a heavy Christmas!'"" says Cat. ""And I think he followed it up with: 'You're looking very pale.' I'm quite a pale person anyway, but obviously he picked up that I was extra pale."" The well-wishers are asked not to take pictures, so there is no record of the exchange. But it remains a fond memory. ""I guess technically he was insulting me - but it was still a bit of an honour to have him speak to you,"" she says. ""It's a nice story to have - I've told it a few times over the years. But it's a nice badge of honour to have been insulted by the duke."" And the final question - was the duke correct? Was she feeling a little worse for wear? ""Well itwasChristmas..."" Cat replies. Cat Kidd In 1997, Trevor Adams was a journalism student in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. He was due to interview a businessman for an assignment, but at the last minute, it fell through. He needed something to fill the gap. ""Or,"" says Trevor, ""I was looking at an F - for fail."" Then a friend, who worked in a downtown hotel, mentioned that Prince Philip was in Halifax for a World Wildlife Fund event. Trevor grabbed his camera operator, rushed to the Prince George Hotel, and crossed his fingers. Somehow - he's not sure how - he was able to breeze past the police and into the same room as the prince. He tapped the duke on the arm - ""Which I now understand to be a major faux pas,"" he says - and made his pitch. ""I explained to him - probably very quickly - that I was a journalism student and desperately needed an interview today, or I was going to get an F. I said if he helped me out, I would be the envy of my classmates."" The duke chuckled, says Trevor, and ""immediately"" agreed to rescue his assignment. Prince Philip spoke for a few minutes on camera about the WWF, with one question about football, before the duke shook Trevor's hand and ended with a joke. Sadly, Trevor cannot remember the joke. ""I wish I'd written it down,"" he says. Nonetheless, Trevor's scoop earned him an A. ""My classmates wondered how on earth I had managed to get the interview,"" he says. ""And really, it amounted to walking into a room I wasn't supposed to be in."" The scoop certainly didn't do Trevor's career any harm - 24 years after meeting the duke in a downtown hotel, he is now the editor ofHalifax Magazine.,external Trevor Adams, photographed by wife Tammy Fancy How the navy shaped the duke's life A turbulent childhood stalked by exile, illness and death The enduring love of the Queen and Prince Philip According to a 2018 YouGov poll,22% of the British public had seen or met Prince Philip,external- that's around 14 million people. Only the Queen, whom 31% had seen or met, was more visible. Darren Johnson is one of that 22% - he met Prince Philip in February 2008, when the duke accompanied the Queen at the opening of the London Fire Brigade headquarters. Darren was there as a ""backbench"" member of the London Fire Authority - the body that ran the brigade. So was the small talk formal and buttoned-up? Not quite... ""We lined up to be introduced to the royal guests,"" says Darren. ""Ken Livingstone (then London mayor) introduced me as the Green member of the fire authority. ""Immediately, Prince Philip said: 'So did you choose to be on this body - or did someone make you do it?' ""I said there were two Greens on the London Assembly and one of us had to do it!"" Darren, who was on the London Assembly for 16 years, says he is ""not a fanatical royalist, or anything like that"". ""But I did like his spirit of irreverence, definitely,"" says Darren, now 54. ""I do think one of his qualities was he was able to cut through a lot of that formality."" Indeed, as the countless tributes have proven, there are many words to describe the Duke of Edinburgh. But - as Cat, Trevor, and Darren know - formal was not one of them. Darren Johnson Have you met Prince Philip? Do you have a story from that time?

Usually they went smoothly but one, which produced a ""human moment"", was derailed by a swarm of bees. Photographer Chris Young, working for the Press Association at the time, was there to capture it on camera. As colonel of the regiment, the duke was standing in full uniform, as he prepared to accompany Her Majesty when she emerged. But it was at this point that Young became aware of the bees. ""I got lucky,"" says Young, recalling the event 18 years later. ""I recognised that it was a human moment. She was giggling like a little girl and he was laughing too. ""I thought the reaction from both of them was pretty unique. ""Some of the guests were unsure as to whether they should move, but eventually everyone had to beat a retreat."" A royal beekeeper was swiftly summoned to sort things out. Read the story of that picturehere. Election campaigning will resume on Tuesday after a pause following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, councils, police and crime commissioners, and mayoral races in England are being held on 6 May. Campaigning will resume a day after tributes are paid to Prince Philip on Monday in the House of Commons, Holyrood and the Senedd. It will pause again on Saturday, the day of the duke's funeral.

The Queen and Prince Philip's children and grandchildren will gather to pay their respects. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be present, to allow for as many family members as possible to be there under Covid-19 rules, Downing Street has said. The duke's long-standing close aide, his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, will be one of the few, and possibly only, non-royals invited to attend the historic occasion inside St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on Saturday. Brigadier Miller-Bakewell has been the duke's right hand man for 11 years, taking on the role in 2010. Read more about the funeral planshere. The Duke of Edinburgh's first experience of the Royal Navy was as an 18-month old exile after the Greek military government banished his family. Years after that evacuation, as he left his Scottish boarding school, Prince Philip expressed a wish to join the Royal Air Force. He was persuaded by his uncle to consider joining the navy and began his budding career. Philip served with distinction during World War Two and was mentioned in dispatches Despite his career
being cut short by his royal duties, Prince Philip is remembered as an immensely
capable officer who drove himself as hard as his men and remained cool in moments
of crisis. He maintained
his love of ships and the sea, which remained a constant source of fascination
to him. ""You're
at sea and exposed to the elements in a way you never are ashore. ""At sea
you're in a cockleshell in this enormous expanse of the ocean. ""So that
tends to cut you down in size a bit."" Read morehere. Princess Alice with Prince Philip, 1924 When remembering Prince Philip, it is easy to forget that he
endured an exceptionally turbulent childhood, historian Philip Eade has told the
BBC. He was abruptly separated from his parents and four elder
sisters at the age of eight, and destined never again to live in the same home
as his immediate family. His mother, Princess Alice of
Battenberg, was placed into a sanatorium. Philip only saw his mother a handful of times during the first
two years of her confinement and for five years between the summer of 1932 and
the spring of 1937, he never saw or heard from his mother at all. It was not in his nature to overstate the effect of all this.
""I just had to get on with it,"" he later told one biographer. Read more

""Before we start tonight we want to say that on behalf of Bafta we are extremely saddened by the passing of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on Friday,"" she says. ""The duke was Bafta's very first president over 60 years ago and was the first of a line of royal patronage all the way through to Bafta's current president, his grandson, the Duke of Cambridge. ""It was Prince Philip and Her Majesty the Queen's support throughout these years that in many ways allowed Bafta, a leading charity in the arts, to continue in difficult times and to be here today in 2021 celebrating another outstanding year of achievement in film."" As the Queen comes to terms with the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, people in Windsor tell us what they'd say to Her Majesty if they had the chance. This video can not be played Prince Philip: What would you say to the Queen today? Writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth says the public reaction to the Duke of Edinburgh's death in part reflects ""people's affection for the Queen"" and the realisation that she is alone. ""She met Prince Philip in the 1930s, they fell in love in the 1940s, and were married in 1947, which is longer than most people have been alive, and now she is alone, so it's partly a sense of affection for the Queen and her loss,"" he said. He adds: ""But this is also someone who has lived 100 years - he has been there all our lives, so people can pause and reflect on a whole century that has gone by."" He says he thinks people have also stopped to think that Prince Philip ""always did what he was asked to do"". ""He was asked to support the Queen and he did, and he turned up in the right uniform on the right day at the right time without fail, for more than 70 years,"" he says. You can read more from Gyles Brandreth here. Rajini VaidyanathanBBC News The Duke of Edinburgh visited India on a number of occasions, and
had a close friendship with the royal family in Jaipur in the state of
Rajasthan. The Maharaja of Jaipur, His
Highness, Sawai Padmanabh Singh, says he is saddened by the passing of the
Duke of Edinburgh. ""This is truly the end of an era,"" he says.  Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh ""The Royal House of Jaipur has been close to the Royal Family of Britain for generations. One of my ancestors, the late Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II of Jaipur, was among the few princes from India invited to attend the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902,"" he writes. The Queen and Prince Philip continued the friendship through the generations and were close to Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and his third wifeMaharani Gayatri Devi- a glamorous royal couple, described as India's answer to John and Jackie Kennedy - visiting them all on their trips to India. âWhen Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip made a State visit to India in 1961, they asked to include Jaipur on their itinerary because of their personal equation.â So warm was the friendship, Maharani Gayatri Devi sent the duke a box of alfonso mangoes for his birthday every year, those close to the family have said. The close ties between the two families extended to the polo ground too: âHRH Prince Philip was a talented polo player, who has played on the Rambagh Polo Ground of Jaipur, just as our family has in England each summer."" The Maharani presented Prince Philip with the trophy when his polo team Windsor Park won the Victoria Cup in 1960 Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The writer Walter Bagehot, in 1867, wrote about the ""dignified"" bit of the state, and the ""efficient"" part. Monarchy and government, in other words. The death of one of the most senior members of the former leads to a pause in the public actions of the latter, and opposition parties. The cacophony of politics has quietened, for now, at just the point it was getting louder. There are elections next month to the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and elections for mayors, councils and police and crime commissioners in England. But campaigning was suspended yesterday. Tonight, the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, has said the Tories will resume campaigning on Tuesday morning, but pause again next Saturday, the day of the Duke's funeral. A Labour source tells me they are likely to adopt a similar approach. The Liberal Democrats say they are likely to restart their campaigning at some point on Monday. Other parties are likely to follow a broadly similar plan. World leaders including US President Joe Biden and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Mr Biden called the duke ""a heck of a guy"", while Ms Ardern highlighted his awards scheme. See more tributes here: This video can not be played Sarah CampbellRoyal Correspondent In a marriage that lasted more than seven decades, Prince Philip was the Queen's support in public at significant national moments - and in private the person who knew her best. As one private secretary once put it: ""Prince Philip is the only man in the world who treats the Queen simply as another human being. He's the only man who can."" It was a marriage based on love. They chose one another. Although it wasn't the first time their paths had crossed, the photographs from their meeting at Dartmouth Naval College in 1939 reveal the beginning of their life together. He was the dashing 18-year-old cadet who caught 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth's eye, larking about playing croquet and tennis. What started as a teenage crush developed over the years into friendship with letters exchanged and occasional visits during the war years. While he was away serving with the Royal Navy, the young princess kept a picture of him in her room. Their grandson Prince William would later sum up their connection, saying: ""He makes her laugh because some of the things he says and does and the way he looks at life is obviously slightly different than her, so together they're a great couple.""

following confirmation the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will take place at Windsor
Castle that afternoon. A national minute's silence will be observed as the ceremonial royal funeral
begins at 15:00 BST. The funeral will take place on a busy sporting weekend with the FA Cup
semi-finals, a full Football League programme, the Women's Six Nations rugby and the
opening day of the World Snooker Championship among the events on the calendar. The Football League has announcedmatches scheduled to begin at 15:00 will be rearranged""as a mark of respect"". The government says it is up to the discretion of organisers as to whether sport fixtures are rearranged. In Scotland, Rangers are due to host Celtic at 16:00, one of six fourth-round
ties scheduled in the Scottish Cup, with the Scottish Football Association saying it hasentered dialogue with the relevant stakeholders about the matches. Queen Rania of Jordan has shared her thoughts about what life as a royal consort is like. She describes the Duke of Edinburgh as
a âconstant anchorâ for the Queen and says the Queen might not have been able
to âcarry on her journey the way she did without him by her sideâ. Queen Rania married her husband, now King Abdullah of Jordan, in 1993 and he became king in 1999. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview
with ITV News, she says the role of a consort is âdefined as you go along, based
on how and where you can make a difference, where you are needed and where your
passions lieâ. âBeing married to someone who is under so much pressure
means you have to do whatever you can to try and alleviate some of that
pressure. Even if thatâs by being a distraction,â she says. ""The wellbeing of your spouse eventually has an impact on how well they can carry out their duties."" Queen Rania adds there ""must have been times when it wasn't easy for him"". People around the UK have been finding a way to mark the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Outside Buckingham Palace, a steady stream of people have been queuing to leave flowers. In Windsor, hundreds of people have left bunches of flowers outside the castle. A smaller number has been left outside Balmoral Castle in Scotland. And drivers of the iconic London black cab have lined up on The Mall, the road which leads to Buckingham Palace. The UK government has urged the public not to gather because of the pandemic, while the Royal Family has asked people to consider making a donation to a charity instead of flowers, and is encouraging the public to use an online book of condolence. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Downing Street has announced the Prime Minister will not attend the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral next Saturday - as we reported a few minutes ago. In a statement, a Number 10 spokesman says: âThe
Prime Minister has throughout wanted to act in accordance with what is best for
the Royal household, and so to allow for as many family members as possible
will not be attending the funeral on Saturdayâ. My understanding is the protocol around this is those who would be expected to attend such a funeral is drawn up well in advance, and in normal times that would include the prime minister. But given the Covid restrictions, Boris Johnson felt it was appropriate to say he wouldn't be there, to allow someone who knew him better the chance to be there.  Â© 2025 BBC.

And the noise of gunfire echoed out from Edinburgh Castle, where more than 100 people gathered as the salute began. Royal Navy ships at sea, including HMS Diamond and HMS Montrose, also fired salutes in honour of the duke, who served as a naval officer during World War Two and held the office of Lord High Admiral.

Speaking to the BBC before the salutes, she said military personnel ""will feel great sadness"" after the duke's death, and the salutes would ""mean a huge amount"". Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford was among those watching the salutes at the grounds of Cardiff Castle Families and groups of friends stood on the esplanade at Edinburgh Castle Prince Philip was Queen Elizabeth II's husband of 73 years, and died at Windsor Castle at the age of 99. Announcing the duke's death on Friday, Buckingham Palace said: ""It is with deep sorrow that Her Majesty the Queen announces the death of her beloved husband. ""The Royal Family join with people around the world in mourning his loss.""

By Becky Morton, BBC News Anne says Prince Philip ""was a great support to the Queen and she obviously adored him"" Windsor evokes memories of royal weddings, with crowds lining the streets waving the union jack. Today the mood is sombre, and some locals - and others from further afield - have come to pay their respects. Anne Yearsley, 82, from Waltham St Lawrence in Berkshire, has brought her grandchildren Cordelia, 10, and Sherlock, six, to Windsor Castle. ""We just thought it would be wonderful for them to have this memory,"" she says. Anne has followed the royal couple's lives since they married in 1947 and remembers their wedding. More recently, she recalls passing the duke riding his carriage in Windsor Great Park a few years ago. Sherlock is wearing a military uniform for the occasion - passed down from his father who used to wear it as a child watching Trooping the Colour. The children have been learning about Prince Philip's achievements from news coverage and Cordelia is now excited to do the Duke of Edinburgh Award when she's older. ""I didn't really know much about him before, apart from that he was the husband of the Queen,"" she says. ""I didn't know he did all these amazing things.""

In BBC interviews to mark his death, Prince Philip's children shared their reflections on his life - with Prince Charles calling his legacy an ""astonishing achievement"". He said: ""His energy was astonishing in supporting my mama [the Queen] - and doing it for such a long time, and, in some extraordinary way, being able to go on doing it for so long. ""What he has done has amounted to an astonishing achievement, I think."" The Princess Royal said the duke ""treated everyone as an individual, and gave them the respect he felt they were due as individuals"".

'You look hungover!' When the public met the dukeMatt Smith on playing Prince Philip in The CrownHow the navy shaped the duke's life,"Prince Philip at Sandringham for the Christmas service in 2017 It was a cold morning on the Sunday between Christmas and New Year, and Cat Kidd was among the well-wishers at Sandringham in Norfolk, waiting for the Royal Family to arrive at church. Cat, now 34 and living in Cambridge, is from the area, and would often visit Sandringham with her family to see the royals' traditional Christmas church visit. On this morning, five or six years ago, Prince Philip spotted Cat in the crowd. To her surprise, he said something. So what was his festive greeting? ""He shouted out: 'You look like you've had a heavy Christmas!'"" says Cat. ""And I think he followed it up with: 'You're looking very pale.' I'm quite a pale person anyway, but obviously he picked up that I was extra pale."" The well-wishers are asked not to take pictures, so there is no record of the exchange. But it remains a fond memory. ""I guess technically he was insulting me - but it was still a bit of an honour to have him speak to you,"" she says. ""It's a nice story to have - I've told it a few times over the years. But it's a nice badge of honour to have been insulted by the duke."" And the final question - was the duke correct? Was she feeling a little worse for wear? ""Well itwasChristmas..."" Cat replies. Cat Kidd In 1997, Trevor Adams was a journalism student in Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. He was due to interview a businessman for an assignment, but at the last minute, it fell through. He needed something to fill the gap. ""Or,"" says Trevor, ""I was looking at an F - for fail."" Then a friend, who worked in a downtown hotel, mentioned that Prince Philip was in Halifax for a World Wildlife Fund event. Trevor grabbed his camera operator, rushed to the Prince George Hotel, and crossed his fingers. Somehow - he's not sure how - he was able to breeze past the police and into the same room as the prince. He tapped the duke on the arm - ""Which I now understand to be a major faux pas,"" he says - and made his pitch. ""I explained to him - probably very quickly - that I was a journalism student and desperately needed an interview today, or I was going to get an F. I said if he helped me out, I would be the envy of my classmates."" The duke chuckled, says Trevor, and ""immediately"" agreed to rescue his assignment. Prince Philip spoke for a few minutes on camera about the WWF, with one question about football, before the duke shook Trevor's hand and ended with a joke. Sadly, Trevor cannot remember the joke. ""I wish I'd written it down,"" he says. Nonetheless, Trevor's scoop earned him an A. ""My classmates wondered how on earth I had managed to get the interview,"" he says. ""And really, it amounted to walking into a room I wasn't supposed to be in."" The scoop certainly didn't do Trevor's career any harm - 24 years after meeting the duke in a downtown hotel, he is now the editor ofHalifax Magazine.,external Trevor Adams, photographed by wife Tammy Fancy How the navy shaped the duke's life A turbulent childhood stalked by exile, illness and death The enduring love of the Queen and Prince Philip According to a 2018 YouGov poll,22% of the British public had seen or met Prince Philip,external- that's around 14 million people. Only the Queen, whom 31% had seen or met, was more visible. Darren Johnson is one of that 22% - he met Prince Philip in February 2008, when the duke accompanied the Queen at the opening of the London Fire Brigade headquarters. Darren was there as a ""backbench"" member of the London Fire Authority - the body that ran the brigade. So was the small talk formal and buttoned-up? Not quite... ""We lined up to be introduced to the royal guests,"" says Darren. ""Ken Livingstone (then London mayor) introduced me as the Green member of the fire authority. ""Immediately, Prince Philip said: 'So did you choose to be on this body - or did someone make you do it?' ""I said there were two Greens on the London Assembly and one of us had to do it!"" Darren, who was on the London Assembly for 16 years, says he is ""not a fanatical royalist, or anything like that"". ""But I did like his spirit of irreverence, definitely,"" says Darren, now 54. ""I do think one of his qualities was he was able to cut through a lot of that formality."" Indeed, as the countless tributes have proven, there are many words to describe the Duke of Edinburgh. But - as Cat, Trevor, and Darren know - formal was not one of them. Darren Johnson Have you met Prince Philip? Do you have a story from that time?

Matt Smith on playing Prince Philip in The CrownHow the navy shaped the duke's life,"Matt Smith (L) and Tobias Menzies (R) both played Prince Philip in The Crown ""Don't. Be. Ridiculous."" That, according to actor Matt Smith, was apparently the Duke of Edinburgh's terse response when asked whether he had ever watched The Crown. Smith relayed the anecdote during a 2017interview with the Guardian,external, as he reflected on his time playing the duke in the hugely successful Netflix drama. The series portrays the inner life of Britain's modern-day Royal Family, from the abdication of Edward VIII in 1936 to the break-up of Prince Charles's marriage to Diana, Princess of Wales, in the early 1990s. The drama is set to continue in a new season in 2022. Claire Foy and Matt Smith as the royal couple in their early years It has been showered with praise for its lavish sets, immense budget, compelling script and accomplished cast, and the awards have followed. More controversial though has been its relationship with the truth. The royals are notoriously guarded about their private lives. Even the duke's supposed stinging rebuke when asked whether he had watched the series is a matter of debate. ""Whether it's true or not, I don't know, but I just think he's a bit of a cool cat,"" said Smith, after relating the second-hand anecdote. ""And that's what I love about him: he's done what he wants, when he wants, how he wants, with whom he wants. He hasn't asked permission. And his wife's the Queen."" The former Doctor Who star played the dashing, young Philip Mountbatten, who wooed Princess Elizabeth and became her royal consort. Yet there were, in reality, limits to how much the duke really did what he wanted. Smith's portrayal of Philip takes in many of the compromises the prince was forced to make - giving up his title as Prince Philip of Greece and Denmark, resigning his career in the navy and, ultimately, swearing allegiance to the Queen. When Elizabeth was crowned in 1953, Philip is depicted in the show asking her if he can be excused from kneeling to pay homage to her during the ceremony. Prince Philip (Matt Smith) knelt before the Queen (Claire Foy) during her 1953 coronation So what did his role teach Smith about the man himself? ""In this day and age, with all the conversations we're having about being a man and maleness, and what it is to be empowered and respected as a woman - I just found that thrilling,"" hetold BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs. ""And also, I kind of sided with him, which is controversial. I felt, 'Yeah, I wouldn't really want to kneel to my wife'."" His enthusiasm for the character continued into season two when Smith said he saw the duke as a ""roguish, brilliant man"", adding: ""I just found a lot to celebrate in Philip."" Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered More on Prince Phillip's life,external The actor, who was Emmy-nominated in 2018 for playing the role, told Variety that year: ""I sort of loved Philip, and there was a lot that I could identify with: the competitiveness, the sporting nature, the battle, the defiance and the maleness. ""One of the interesting challenges for me was that I felt there was a sort of a misconception and a preconception about him, which reduced him a bit. ""And actually all the research I did found him to be brilliantly funny, very clever, very popular. In the royal house he's the most popular of all of them. If you've talked to any of the staff, Philip's the one they all love really. I think more than a lot of them, he's a bit more of a man of the people."" Smith was no less complimentary when reacting to news of the duke's death. ""Prince Philip was the man. And he knew it. 99 and out, but what an innings. And what style,"" he said. ""Thank you for your service old chap - it won't be the same without you."" Smith portrayed just a few of Prince Philip's 22,219 royal engagements The role of Philip was passed to Tobias Menzies in season three, when the middle-aged duke played opposite Olivia Colman. Speaking in the immediate aftermath of the duke's death on Friday, Menzies was the essence of modesty. ""If I know anything about the Duke of Edinburgh I'm fairly sure he wouldn't want some actor who has portrayed him on television giving their opinion on his life,"" he said, going on to quote the character of Orlando in Shakespeare's As You Like It. ""O good old man! how well in thee appears ""The constant service of the antique world..."" Before adding: ""Rest in Peace."" Tobias Menzies and Olivia Colman play an older version of the royal couple But some time before that, Menzies, who bleached his eyebrows for the role of the duke, wasasked by the LA Times,externalif he knew whether Prince Philip had watched his portrayal. ""'The crown doesn't comment.' I think that's the motto,"" he replied. He played the prince in seasons three and four, covering 1964 to 1990, and said that by this stage in his life, he ""has acclimatised"" and ""seems to be chafing at the bit less... and seems to have found his feet"". The Outlander actortold the New York Times,externalthat for Philip, season three was ""a continuation of themes in the first seasons: being second to his wife, sacrificing his own life and career to some extent"". Menzies told the LA Times it was a challenge playing the duke. ""They're quite guarded, both him and the Queen. Having watched a lot of footage of Philip and having read about him a lot, I find him quite a hard man to pin down. That makes him interesting to play."" The actor, who was nominated for a Golden Globe last year for his role in the show,told Screen Daily,externalplaying the royal was ""primarily a technical challenge... But it's a subtle thing to pitch - you don't want it to be pastiche or caricature"". Emma Corrin and Tobias Menzies playing Lady Diana Spencer and the duke during a stag hunt at Balmoral Season four's storylines featuring Prince Philip include a depiction of the early relationship between Prince Charles and Lady Diana Spencer. The show suggests Prince Philip and Diana shared an affinity with each other. Speaking to Vanity Fair, Menzies said: ""Someone in production managed to get hold of copies of some letters between him and Diana. ""I was really struck by the kind of balanced, calm, quite tender kind of atmosphere to those letters. He clearly, behind the scenes, worked quite hard to mend that relationship. And if those letters are anything to go by, he does seem to have been a keen supporter of hers."" Jonathan Pryce will play the Duke of Edinburgh in the 1990s and early 2000s Thefinal actor to play Prince Philip in the serieswill be Oscar, Bafta and Golden Globe-nominated Jonathan Pryce, who starred inThe Two Popeswith Sir Anthony Hopkins in 2019. Hesaid playing the duke,externalwas a ""daunting prospect"" but added doing it with the Crown's creator Peter Morgan, along with Imelda Staunton playing the Queen, and Lesley Manville as Princess Margaret, would be ""a joy"".

Usually they went smoothly but one, which produced a ""human moment"", was derailed by a swarm of bees. Photographer Chris Young, working for the Press Association at the time, was there to capture it on camera. As colonel of the regiment, the duke was standing in full uniform, as he prepared to accompany Her Majesty when she emerged. But it was at this point that Young became aware of the bees. ""I got lucky,"" says Young, recalling the event 18 years later. ""I recognised that it was a human moment. She was giggling like a little girl and he was laughing too. ""I thought the reaction from both of them was pretty unique. ""Some of the guests were unsure as to whether they should move, but eventually everyone had to beat a retreat."" A royal beekeeper was swiftly summoned to sort things out. Read the story of that picturehere. Election campaigning will resume on Tuesday after a pause following the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Elections to the Scottish and Welsh parliaments, councils, police and crime commissioners, and mayoral races in England are being held on 6 May.

The Queen and Prince Philip's children and grandchildren will gather to pay their respects. But Prime Minister Boris Johnson will not be present, to allow for as many family members as possible to be there under Covid-19 rules, Downing Street has said. The duke's long-standing close aide, his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller-Bakewell, will be one of the few, and possibly only, non-royals invited to attend the historic occasion inside St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle on Saturday. Brigadier Miller-Bakewell has been the duke's right hand man for 11 years, taking on the role in 2010. Read more about the funeral planshere. The Duke of Edinburgh's first experience of the Royal Navy was as an 18-month old exile after the Greek military government banished his family. Years after that evacuation, as he left his Scottish boarding school, Prince Philip expressed a wish to join the Royal Air Force. He was persuaded by his uncle to consider joining the navy and began his budding career. Philip served with distinction during World War Two and was mentioned in dispatches Despite his career
being cut short by his royal duties, Prince Philip is remembered as an immensely
capable officer who drove himself as hard as his men and remained cool in moments
of crisis. He maintained
his love of ships and the sea, which remained a constant source of fascination
to him. ""You're
at sea and exposed to the elements in a way you never are ashore. ""At sea
you're in a cockleshell in this enormous expanse of the ocean. ""So that
tends to cut you down in size a bit."" Read morehere. Princess Alice with Prince Philip, 1924 When remembering Prince Philip, it is easy to forget that he
endured an exceptionally turbulent childhood, historian Philip Eade has told the
BBC. He was abruptly separated from his parents and four elder
sisters at the age of eight, and destined never again to live in the same home
as his immediate family. His mother, Princess Alice of
Battenberg, was placed into a sanatorium. Philip only saw his mother a handful of times during the first
two years of her confinement and for five years between the summer of 1932 and
the spring of 1937, he never saw or heard from his mother at all. It was not in his nature to overstate the effect of all this.
""I just had to get on with it,"" he later told one biographer. Read more
here The opening night of the virutal Bafta film awards has begun with a tribute paid to the Duke of Edinburgh. Host Clara Amfo praises the work of Prince Philip - a former Bafta president. ""Before we start tonight we want to say that on behalf of Bafta we are extremely saddened by the passing of His Royal Highness Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, on Friday,"" she says. ""The duke was Bafta's very first president over 60 years ago and was the first of a line of royal patronage all the way through to Bafta's current president, his grandson, the Duke of Cambridge. ""It was Prince Philip and Her Majesty the Queen's support throughout these years that in many ways allowed Bafta, a leading charity in the arts, to continue in difficult times and to be here today in 2021 celebrating another outstanding year of achievement in film."" As the Queen comes to terms with the death of her husband, the Duke of Edinburgh, people in Windsor tell us what they'd say to Her Majesty if they had the chance. This video can not be played Prince Philip: What would you say to the Queen today? Writer and broadcaster Gyles Brandreth says the public reaction to the Duke of Edinburgh's death in part reflects ""people's affection for the Queen"" and the realisation that she is alone. ""She met Prince Philip in the 1930s, they fell in love in the 1940s, and were married in 1947, which is longer than most people have been alive, and now she is alone, so it's partly a sense of affection for the Queen and her loss,"" he said. He adds: ""But this is also someone who has lived 100 years - he has been there all our lives, so people can pause and reflect on a whole century that has gone by."" He says he thinks people have also stopped to think that Prince Philip ""always did what he was asked to do"". ""He was asked to support the Queen and he did, and he turned up in the right uniform on the right day at the right time without fail, for more than 70 years,"" he says.

had a close friendship with the royal family in Jaipur in the state of
Rajasthan. The Maharaja of Jaipur, His
Highness, Sawai Padmanabh Singh, says he is saddened by the passing of the
Duke of Edinburgh. ""This is truly the end of an era,"" he says.  Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II pictured with the Duke of Edinburgh ""The Royal House of Jaipur has been close to the Royal Family of Britain for generations. One of my ancestors, the late Maharaja Sawai Madho Singh II of Jaipur, was among the few princes from India invited to attend the coronation of King Edward VII in 1902,"" he writes. The Queen and Prince Philip continued the friendship through the generations and were close to Maharaja Sawai Man Singh II and his third wifeMaharani Gayatri Devi- a glamorous royal couple, described as India's answer to John and Jackie Kennedy - visiting them all on their trips to India. âWhen Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip made a State visit to India in 1961, they asked to include Jaipur on their itinerary because of their personal equation.â So warm was the friendship, Maharani Gayatri Devi sent the duke a box of alfonso mangoes for his birthday every year, those close to the family have said. The close ties between the two families extended to the polo ground too: âHRH Prince Philip was a talented polo player, who has played on the Rambagh Polo Ground of Jaipur, just as our family has in England each summer."" The Maharani presented Prince Philip with the trophy when his polo team Windsor Park won the Victoria Cup in 1960 Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent The writer Walter Bagehot, in 1867, wrote about the ""dignified"" bit of the state, and the ""efficient"" part. Monarchy and government, in other words. The death of one of the most senior members of the former leads to a pause in the public actions of the latter, and opposition parties. The cacophony of politics has quietened, for now, at just the point it was getting louder. There are elections next month to the Scottish and Welsh Parliaments and elections for mayors, councils and police and crime commissioners in England. But campaigning was suspended yesterday. Tonight, the Chairman of the Conservative Party, Amanda Milling, has said the Tories will resume campaigning on Tuesday morning, but pause again next Saturday, the day of the Duke's funeral. A Labour source tells me they are likely to adopt a similar approach. The Liberal Democrats say they are likely to restart their campaigning at some point on Monday. Other parties are likely to follow a broadly similar plan. World leaders including US President Joe Biden and New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern have paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh. Mr Biden called the duke ""a heck of a guy"", while Ms Ardern highlighted his awards scheme. See more tributes here: This video can not be played Sarah CampbellRoyal Correspondent In a marriage that lasted more than seven decades, Prince Philip was the Queen's support in public at significant national moments - and in private the person who knew her best. As one private secretary once put it: ""Prince Philip is the only man in the world who treats the Queen simply as another human being. He's the only man who can."" It was a marriage based on love. They chose one another. Although it wasn't the first time their paths had crossed, the photographs from their meeting at Dartmouth Naval College in 1939 reveal the beginning of their life together. He was the dashing 18-year-old cadet who caught 13-year-old Princess Elizabeth's eye, larking about playing croquet and tennis. What started as a teenage crush developed over the years into friendship with letters exchanged and occasional visits during the war years. While he was away serving with the Royal Navy, the young princess kept a picture of him in her room. Their grandson Prince William would later sum up their connection, saying: ""He makes her laugh because some of the things he says and does and the way he looks at life is obviously slightly different than her, so together they're a great couple.""

following confirmation the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral will take place at Windsor
Castle that afternoon. A national minute's silence will be observed as the ceremonial royal funeral
begins at 15:00 BST. The funeral will take place on a busy sporting weekend with the FA Cup
semi-finals, a full Football League programme, the Women's Six Nations rugby and the
opening day of the World Snooker Championship among the events on the calendar. The Football League has announcedmatches scheduled to begin at 15:00 will be rearranged""as a mark of respect"". The government says it is up to the discretion of organisers as to whether sport fixtures are rearranged. In Scotland, Rangers are due to host Celtic at 16:00, one of six fourth-round
ties scheduled in the Scottish Cup, with the Scottish Football Association saying it hasentered dialogue with the relevant stakeholders about the matches. Queen Rania of Jordan has shared her thoughts about what life as a royal consort is like. She describes the Duke of Edinburgh as
a âconstant anchorâ for the Queen and says the Queen might not have been able
to âcarry on her journey the way she did without him by her sideâ. Queen Rania married her husband, now King Abdullah of Jordan, in 1993 and he became king in 1999. Speaking in a pre-recorded interview
with ITV News, she says the role of a consort is âdefined as you go along, based
on how and where you can make a difference, where you are needed and where your
passions lieâ. âBeing married to someone who is under so much pressure
means you have to do whatever you can to try and alleviate some of that
pressure. Even if thatâs by being a distraction,â she says. ""The wellbeing of your spouse eventually has an impact on how well they can carry out their duties."" Queen Rania adds there ""must have been times when it wasn't easy for him"". People around the UK have been finding a way to mark the death of the Duke of Edinburgh. Outside Buckingham Palace, a steady stream of people have been queuing to leave flowers. In Windsor, hundreds of people have left bunches of flowers outside the castle. A smaller number has been left outside Balmoral Castle in Scotland. And drivers of the iconic London black cab have lined up on The Mall, the road which leads to Buckingham Palace. The UK government has urged the public not to gather because of the pandemic, while the Royal Family has asked people to consider making a donation to a charity instead of flowers, and is encouraging the public to use an online book of condolence. Chris MasonPolitical Correspondent Downing Street has announced the Prime Minister will not attend the Duke of Edinburgh's funeral next Saturday - as we reported a few minutes ago. In a statement, a Number 10 spokesman says: âThe
Prime Minister has throughout wanted to act in accordance with what is best for
the Royal household, and so to allow for as many family members as possible
will not be attending the funeral on Saturdayâ. My understanding is the protocol around this is those who would be expected to attend such a funeral is drawn up well in advance, and in normal times that would include the prime minister. But given the Covid restrictions, Boris Johnson felt it was appropriate to say he wouldn't be there, to allow someone who knew him better the chance to be there.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"Royals reflect on the 'rock in the Queenâs life'The Duke of Edinburgh's children share reflections on his legacy and ""astonishing achievement"".UK","""His energy was astonishing,"" Prince Charles said of his father in his support of the Queen The Duke of Edinburgh's children have shared their reflections on their father's life, his ""astonishing achievement"" and his legacy. The Prince of Wales told the BBC ""his energy was astonishing in supporting my mama, and doing it for such a long time"". ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life,"" said the Earl of Wessex. The Princess Royal praised the ""double act"" he created with the monarch. And the Duke of York fondly recalled Prince Philip as a father spending time with his family. ""Like any other family at the time, your parents went out to work during the day but in the evening - just the same as any other family - we would get together, we would sit on the sofa as a group and he would read to us,"" Prince Andrew said. The royals were speaking in interviews to mark the Duke of Edinburgh's death as part of a BBC special programme billed as a tribute ""from those who knew him best"". Prince Charles told the programme: ""I think he'll probably want to be remembered as an individual in his own right."" Princess Anne reflected on the ""incredible challenge"" of moving from a career in the Royal Navy to royal consort Reflecting on his father's difficult upbringing after his family was exiled, he said: ""It can't have been easy and life was uncertain and everyone had to rely on other people to help - and presumably he had to fall back on himself."" This uncertain upbringing left him with the ""extraordinary ability"" to be positive and move on from adversity, said Princess Anne. Prince Charles spoke of the ""huge value"" his father found in his education at Gordonstoun under its founder Kurt Hahn, an unconventional figure who emphasised self-reliance and risking - and who partly inspired the creation of the Duke of Edinburgh's award. Obituary: HRH the Duke of Edinburgh An extraordinary man who led an extraordinary life Who he was, what he did and why he mattered Prince Philip: A life in pictures More on Prince Philip's life,external Moving from a career in the Royal Navy to become royal consort was ""an incredible challenge"", Princess Anne said. ""In the Royal Navy he was in charge of ships, he was making all the decisions. In his next life, he was making very few."" But Prince Andrew, who served in the navy during the Falklands War, said he had never had any discussions with his father about whether he would have stayed on in the service. ""He saw his role as supporting the Queen,"" the prince said. Princess Anne spoke of how his appreciation of how he could help the Queen ""always seemed to be present"" and was vital because she succeeded to the throne so young. ""They needed to be a double act for a lot of that time to allow her to take on that role,"" she said. Prince Edward recalled a ""lovely moment"" when his mother was able to pay tribute to his father at the 50th anniversary of the Duke of Edinburgh's Award, by giving the organisation a Royal Charter. ""It probably meant more to my mother anyway. My father is far too modest to be remotely interested in all that sort of thing, he would brush it off,"" the prince said. He said the award was a result of Prince Philip's belief ""that if you could tap into what a young person's passion was, that would drive them forward in terms of their life and their success"". Prince Edward said he was ""a great source of support and encouragement and guidance all the way through"" while Princess Anne added: ""I think I will best remember him as always being there and a person you could bounce off ideas, but if you were having problems you could always go to him."" Prince Philip's legendary ""directness"" was inherited from his mother, Prince Charles explained with an anecdote. The duke took on his role with ""extraordinary tact and diplomacy"", said Prince Edward His mother, Princess Alice of Battenberg, was buried in Jerusalem, where she is also honoured at the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial as ""Righteous Among the Nations"" for protecting Jews at her house in Athens during World War Two. ""My father said, but hang on, how are we ever going to visit your grave?"" the Prince of Wales recalled. ""She said, don't be so silly, there's a very good bus service from Athens."" The Duke of Edinburgh ""did not suffer fools gladly"", Prince Charles said, which ""made one choose your words carefully"". Prince Edward said had taken on a challenging role ""with the most extraordinary flair, and the most extraordinary tact and diplomacy - he's never, ever tried to overshadow the Queen in any way, shape or form. ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same."" ""His energy was astonishing, in supporting my mama, and doing it for such a long time,"" said Prince Charles. ""What he's done has amounted to an astonishing achievement, I think.""
