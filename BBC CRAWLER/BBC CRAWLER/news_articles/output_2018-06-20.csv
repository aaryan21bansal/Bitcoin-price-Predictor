Hammond: Taxes will rise to pay for NHS,"The chancellor is to admit for the first time that taxes will have to rise to cover the costs of increased spending on the NHS. In a speech on Thursday, Philip Hammond will say that any increases will be done in a ""fair and balanced way"". He will also make it clear the government will stick to its promise to reduce the nation's debts. That means there will be little room for extra borrowing to pay for the PM's promised spending boost. ""We are getting debt down, while investing in Britain's infrastructure, supporting our vital public services, and helping hard working families across the United Kingdom,"" the chancellor will say at the Mansion House in the City. ""And this week, the prime minister announced a five year NHS funding package that will boost spending on health by over Â£20bn a year in real terms in England alone. ""So, as the prime minister said, across the nation taxpayers will have to contribute a bit more in a fair and balanced way to support the NHS we all use. ""We also confirmed we would stick to our fiscal rule and continue to reduce debt."" The NHS, taxes and that 'Brexit dividend' Tax rise to pay for NHS boost - PM Brexit could cost Â£1k per household The admission that tax rises are ahead puts at risk a Conservative manifesto pledge in 2017 that the party had a ""firm intention to reduce taxes"". In the words from the speech released overnight by the Treasury there was no mention of the ""Brexit dividend"" which the prime minister claimed at the weekend could be used to pay for part of the extra spending on the NHS. Economists have dismissed the idea that there is a ""dividend"" from leaving the European Union (EU), arguing that the costs to the economy outweigh any reduction in payments to the EU. Mr Hammond's speech will make it clear the Treasury is still committed to reducing the deficit - the amount of money the government spends above the amount it gains in revenues from taxes and investment - to 2% of the value of the economy (gross domestic product) by 2021. The Treasury has also promised as part of its ""fiscal rules"" that the country's overall debts - the total amount it has borrowed - will be falling as a proportion of the overall economy by the same time. My sources tell me that reducing the nation's debts - which has yet to happen - is seen in Conservative circles as the ""big dividing line"" with Labour which the party must stick to. That means increased taxes will be needed to cover the costs of the NHS pledge. John McDonnell, the shadow chancellor, has just responded to Mr Hammond's comments: ""Just 12 months ago Theresa May claimed the only way voters can be sure their taxes won't rise was to vote Conservative, but it seems Philip Hammond didn't get the message. ""It is scandalous that the chancellor is still planning to go ahead with billions of pounds in tax giveaways to big business and a wealthy few over this parliament, but now suggests he will raise taxes on low and middle earners at the same time to pay for the Tory made crisis in our health and social care system. ""In contrast, Labour set out a fully costed plan to fund our NHS and public services by ending the Tory tax giveaways to big business, and with a modest tax rise on the top 5% of earners.""

Ofsted chief backs school phones ban,"The chief inspector of Ofsted is backing head teachers who ban mobile phones to prevent bad behaviour. In a speech, Amanda Spielman is expected to blame technology for making ""low-level disruption"" more common and endorse tough behaviour policies. ""The place of mobile phones in the classroom seems to me dubious at best,"" she will say. Her speech comes afterCulture Secretary Matt Hancock also called on head teachers to ban phones. Ms Spielman is due to tell the audience at the Festival of Education at Wellington College that it was ""entirely appropriate"" for schools to use sanctions such as writing lines, detention or ""community service"" punishments such as picking up litter. Should phones be allowed in schools? 'Don't be afraid to take phones off teens' French MPs back school phone ban She will say: ""I fundamentally disagree with those who say that taking a tough stance on behaviour is unfair to children. ""Quite the opposite, there is nothing kind about letting a few pupils spoil school for everyone else."" Ofsted boss Amanda Spielman says the educational role of mobile phones is ""dubious"" Her speech says that the educational benefits of mobile phones are unproven, but they do distract pupils in class and make teachers' jobs harder. ""There's no doubt that technology has made the challenge of low-level disruption even worse, which is why I also support recent calls to back heads who have decided that the way to improve behaviour is to ban mobile phones in their schools,"" Ms Spielman will say. ""I'm not the target audience, but nevertheless I am yet to be convinced of the educational benefits of all-day access to Snapchat and the like."" This video can not be played James Reevell looks at the tricks technology companies use to keep you hooked on your phone Ms Spielman will say that she wants Ofsted to respond to the importance that parents attach to behaviour by giving it a prominent place in inspection reports. ""I want to see behaviour get the attention it deserves in our inspections, probably through a separate behaviour and attitudes judgement,"" she will say. Low-level disruption which gets in the way of pupils' learning will be taken as seriously as incidents such as bullying, she will pledge. The chief inspector's speech also says that Ofsted will examine whether schools are trying to conceal badly behaved students during inspections to get a better grade. ""I want to address once and for all, the constant rumours we hear about badly behaved children being hidden from inspectors, perhaps on conveniently timed school trips,"" she will say. Ofsted's research and analysis teams are devising a way to assess how often such incidents happen and how inspectors can respond. According to the Department for Education, 95% of schools now control the use of mobile phones in some way. Some schools insist that they are kept switched off and out of sight during the whole school day, others restrict their use to break time and some allow them to be used in lessons for specific educational activities. A Snapchat spokesman said parents and teachers should have regular conversations about the appropriate use of technology, including the company's app. He said: ""We don't recommend that young people use it all day while at school.""

Panama Papers: Owners could not be traced,"The 2016 Panama Papers revealed the tax havens of the world's elite A new leak of documents from the offshore service provider at the centre of the Panama Papers scandal reveals the company could not identify the owners of up to three quarters of companies it administered. Two months after becoming aware of the data breach, Mossack Fonseca was unable to identify the beneficial owners of more than 70% of 28,500 active companies in the British Virgin Islands (BVI) as well as 75% of companies in Panama, according to new documents seen by BBC Panorama. At the time, BVI law permitted corporate service providers to rely upon intermediaries, banks, legal firms and other offshore service providers overseas to check the identities of the owners, although they were required to provide information if requested by the authorities. The firm was fined $440,000 (Â£333,000) by the BVI Financial Services Commission in November 2016 for regulatory and legal infringements of anti-money laundering and other laws. The new leak contains 1.2 million documents dating from before the Panama Papers went public in April 2016 to December 2017. The data was obtained by Suddeutsche Zeitung which shared it with the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ). Email correspondence from clients and intermediaries reveal the reaction to the leak, Mossack Fonseca's desperate attempts to close gaps in their record keeping, and their difficulties doing so. Responding to questions from the firm, one Swiss wealth manager said: ""THE CLIENT HAS DISAPPEARED! I CANT FIND HIM ANYMORE!!!!!!"" Q&A: Panama Papers Iceland PM resigns over tax leaks Panama Papers: Full coverage How tax evasion works Other correspondence points to the primary reasons many clients were using offshore structures. One Uruguayan financial planner commented:  ""â¦the main purpose of this type of structure has been broken: confidentiality"". Another intermediary wrote: ""â¦ the names of our customers have been known by the authorities of their countries. Thanks to Mossack, customers have to pay incomes taxes."" According to Margaret Hodge MP, former chair of the UK parliament's public accounts committee: ""This is simply further proof, if any were needed, why we absolutely must have public registers of beneficial owners if we are to stamp out money laundering, tax avoidance, tax evasion and other crimes."" In the wake of the Panama Papers and under pressure from the UK government, the BVI and other British Overseas Territories have established registers of beneficial ownership for companies in their jurisdictions. But the register relies upon offshore service providers, like Mossack Fonseca, to provide the information. And it is only directly accessible to authorities in the BVI - the public cannot see it. The BVI denies the register is secret and says it is accessible to the authorities and relevant UK authorities on request within one hour. They say they have been at the forefront of global transparency initiatives. A spokesman said: ""A public register is not a silver bullet. It is not about who can see the information, it's about the information being verified, accurate, and therefore useful to law enforcement. A verified register is a far more robust and effective approach to ensure transparency than an unverified public register."" Eleven million documents were leaked from Panamanian law firm Mossack Fonseca The BVI has resisted pressure for a public register open to scrutiny. Last month the UK government adopted an amendment to its Sanctions and Anti-Money Laundering Bill to force overseas territories to establish public registers by 2020.The BVI government is considering a legal challenge,external. Margaret Hodge, who tabled the amendment with former Conservative minister Andrew Mitchell says: ""I would be astounded if the BVI government chooses to waste their own taxpayers' money litigating against the British parliament - now supported by the British government."" A spokesman for BVI Finance said that legal advice was ""that the imposition of a public register raises serious constitutional and human rights issues. As we have consistently stated, our position is that we will not introduce public registers until they become a global standard"". The Panama Papers investigation went public in April 2016 when the BBC and more than 100 other media organisations started publishing stories emanating from 11.5 million documents leaked from Mossack Fonseca. The investigation was organised by the ICIJ and involved journalists from 76 countries scrutinising internal emails and corporate documents passed to the ICIJ by Suddeutsche Zeitung. The German newspaper obtained the data from an anonymous source called ""Jon Doe"". The UK investigation was led by BBC Panorama and the Guardian newspaper. Revelations included documents linking Russian President Vladimir Putin's close friend, the cellist Sergi Roldugin, to suspected money laundering,Fifa corruption, sanctions busting and systemic tax dodging. ThenPrime Minister David Cameron faced a barrage of questioning over his late father's offshore investment fundand the prime minister of Iceland was forced to resign following demonstrations about his failure to declare an offshore interest. This video can not be played ""The Icelandic people have been protesting and calling for fresh elections"", says Gavin Hewitt PakistaniPrime Minister Nawaz Sharif resigned last year as a result of an investigationprompted by revelations about his family's offshore financial affairs. Panamanian police raided Mossack Fonseca's offices and by the end of 2016 governments and companies in 79 countries had launched 150 inquiries, audits or investigations into the firm, companies it worked with, or its clients. The new documents show how authorities from around the world, including the UK's Serious Fraud Office, contacted Mossack Fonseca demanding information about individuals and companies identified in the leak. Mossack Fonseca's documents have since been obtained by a number of tax authorities including HM Revenue and Customs which paid an undisclosed sum for the leaked data. In November 2017, the UK tax authority revealed there were 66 ongoing investigations related to the Panama Papers,externaland that they expected to recover Â£100m in tax. Three months agoMossack Fonseca announced it was closing down,externalciting reputational damage and the actions of the Panamanian authorities.  In a statement this month, the company's founders said that neither they, the firm, nor its employees, were ""involved in unlawful acts"".

"BA cancels 2,000 'too cheap' tickets","British Airways has apologised and offered full refunds for the error More than 2,000 British Airways passengers have had their tickets cancelled because the prices were too cheap, a travel agent has said. Travel Up chief Ali Shah said he believes another five agencies also sold tickets through the airline's mistake. BA has apologised for the error on flights to Tel Aviv and Dubai but refused to say how many were affected. Customers said they were angry their tickets are not being honoured. Mr Shah said flights normally costing more than Â£200 were advertised for Â£1 plus airport taxes, which can be several hundred pounds, between 17:45 BST on 11 June and 11:00 the following day. The agent, who said more than 2,000 of his customers have been affected, said: ""It's very cruel for the customers because they have booked these flights in good faith and expected it to be honoured. ""But I can also understand British Airways' position, it's a human error."" Mr Shah said all affected customers are being contacted and BA will provide a full refund as well as a Â£100 voucher. Travel Up customer Ash Gubbay, from London, says he had booked a return flight to Tel Aviv for Â£195 but now has to pay about Â£1,000. Ash Gubbay was going to Tel Aviv for a family wedding and memorial service Mr Gubbay said he thought the tickets were cheap but ""not far-fetched"" and comparable with other airlines. He said the firm should honour the flights. Mr Gubbay said he was ""annoyed and angry"" and the voucher would be of ""no help"" as it will not cover the cost difference for new flights. He said: ""I'm very disappointed and let down by British Airways. ""If I wanted to cancel my tickets I wouldn't have been able to but it seems like they can just do what they want."" Another customer, Esther Vadia, had booked six tickets to Tel Aviv for Â£167 each and a seventh for her son later in the year for Â£195. All have been cancelled. She says she is unable to afford to pay for other flights and although she will be refunded, she will still have to pay credit card fees for the cancelled tickets. Ms Vadia also said she would end up losing more than Â£1,000 on non-refundable accommodation in Israel. She said: ""If you go to a supermarket and buy something for cheap, they cannot come after you later and say you have to give it back. ""So how can an airline do that? Besides, I don't think the tickets were so cheap as to be unbelievable."" by Brian Milligan, BBC personal finance reporter Whether BA was entitled to cancel the tickets is likely to depend whether they were so cheap that the so-called mistake should have been obvious to customers. If they were miles cheaper than comparable tickets, the company could argue that it made a ""unilateral mistake"" in its pricing. But the difficulty for BA is that a quick search online reveals flights from London to Tel Aviv to be on sale for around Â£215. So the BA fare of Â£195 may not seem unusually good value. James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance, thinks BA may be in the wrong. ""I don't understand how, technically, they could wriggle out of it. It's their error,"" he said. However, it may take a legal challenge from one of the passengers involved to fully test the law on this. Hanna Simon, another passenger, also said she did not believe the flights were ""excessively cheap"". She said she was particularly frustrated as she had corresponded with BA about add-ons to her flight and no problem had been raised by the airline. Several people the BBC spoke to also said they had not been informed of the cancellation and only found out when they checked their online accounts. They also said the Â£100 voucher was ""useless"" as, aside from ""restrictive"" terms and conditions, the flights were now costing much more than that. Flights to Dubai were also affected by the pricing error BA said in a statement: ""Errors like this are exceptionally rare, and if they do occur, under contract law, there is no binding contract between the parties. ""We have apologised to customers and offered a gesture of goodwill."" Guy Anker, deputy editor ofMoneySavingExpert.com,external, said BA should ""do the right thing"" and let the passengers ""fly at the price they booked"". He said: ""While this may have been a 'rare' error, it's not the passengers' error. ""They've bought these tickets in good faith at a believable price - it's not as though the tickets cost Â£5, which would clearly have been a glitch."" Jack Sheldon, founder of Jack's Flight Club, said ""fare errors"" were not uncommon but in almost 70% of cases the airline would honour the tickets. He said: ""They honour it because it's bad PR to cancel tickets. ""This is an odd one. In cases where tickets are cancelled it is usually because the ticket was supposed to be say Â£400 but was sold for Â£40. ""In this case the error doesn't seem to have been that big and a typical customer could well have thought this was a genuine fare.""

Family slams restraint death inquest 'farce',"Rashan Charles died after being apprehended by police in Dalston The death of a man who was restrained by a police officer was accidental, an inquest has found. Rashan Charles, 20, died in hospital after police chased him into a shop in Dalston, east London, on 22 July 2017. A jury at St Pancras Coroner's Court found the officer used ""justified"" force against Mr Charles but he failed to follow other police protocols. Mr Charles's family said the inquest process was a ""farce"" and some pieces of evidence were ""downright lies"". The father-of-one's death sparked violence and led to threats being made to police. Coroner Mary Hassell read the jury's narrative verdict, which said Mr Charles died of a cardiac arrest and an obstructed airway during the restraint. During the inquest, the court was shown CCTV footage of Mr Charles putting a ""golf ball-sized"" package in his mouth before he was grabbed from behind by an officer. The officer, who was granted anonymity and referred to in court as BX47, then restrained Mr Charles. The coroner, Mary Hassell, had apologised to the court for showing ""distressing"" footage of Mr Charles's restraint An initial investigation conducted by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) found the package, which was later removed from Mr Charles's mouth by paramedics, contained a mixture of caffeine and paracetamol. BX47 failed to follow Met Police protocol by taking ""immediate and appropriate action in the face of a medical emergency"", the jury found. It added that the officer had not managed the involvement of a passer-by, known as Witness 1, who said he put a finger down Mr Charles's throat in a bid to help him. However, the jury said BX47's failures did not make a difference to Mr Charles's death. It added: ""Rashan's death was an accident, which occurred by virtue of deliberate human actions on the part of Rashan, the police officer who chased him and a civilian bystander."" Before the verdict came back, Mr Charles's family branded the inquest process a ""farce"". Mr Charles's great uncle, retired Ch Insp Rod Charles said: ""I have due respect for the jury... but I have rafts and waves of concerns with the process,"" the 54-year-old said. The former policeman, who has more than 30 years' experience with the Met, said: ""I have had to listen to implausible evidence at times, and at times downright lies."" He said the evidence of witnesses who had worked for the Met was ""not impartial and not objective"". Rod Charles said he respected the jury but that the investigation itself was flawed Violence broke out in Kingsland Road following a protest over Mr Charles' death Mr Charles said the family would pursue all further legal options and have asked the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) to review a decision to take no further action against an officer after considering a common assault charge. Kim Vernal, the solicitor representing the family, said the inquest revealed deficiencies in police officer training around choking risks. ""Officers should be taught, if in doubt, to err on the side of caution,"" Ms Vernal added. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Richard Martin said the Met will ""take action"" if the coroner recommends any improvements. ""If there is learning to take forward for the Met as a whole we will take action where we need to,"" he said.

Former bank boss sentenced to six years,"David Drumm moved to the US in 2009 but was extradited in 2016 Former Anglo Irish Bank chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to six years in jail. He was sentenced on Wednesday at the Dublin Criminal Court. The ex-banker wasfound guilty earlier in Juneof authorising a â¬7.2bn (Â£5.4bn) conspiracy to defraud and of false accounting. Drumm had pleaded not guilty to conspiring to dishonestly make Anglo's balance sheet look better between March and September 2008. He also denied knowingly giving false figures to the market that December. Anglo Irish, which was nationalised in 2009 and wound down from 2011, was synonymous with the lending practices that drove the 'Celtic Tiger' boom and subsequent bust, pushing the Republic of Ireland to the brink of meltdown in 2010. Mr Drumm moved to the US in 2009 but was extradited in 2016. Judge Karen O'Connor said that people were entitled to trust their banks and this was grossly reprehensible behaviour. She said Drumm was in a position of trust in the bank. David Drumm's legal team accepted before sentencing that he would get a jail term. Once the poster boy of Irish banking, Anglo-Irish Bank is expected to cost the Irish taxpayer up to â¬30bn (Â£26.3bn) over the coming years. Ireland's banking-related property crash destroyed both lives and livelihoods. The three other men convicted on similar charges got between two and three and a half years behind bars. So, there is some surprise, but little sympathy for Drumm, the main mover behind the fraud, with his six year jail term. The passage of time may have blunted some of the anger people felt about Anglo, but far from all of it. David Drumm is a former chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank Judge O'Connor sentenced him to six years and ordered that he would get credit for the five months he had spent in a prison in Boston, before being extradited to Ireland in March 2016. She said that she felt ""the appropriate headline figure is eight years imprisonment in relation to both counts"", but ordered that he serve a six-year sentence after considering mitigating factors. The court heard that Drumm had emerged from ""humble beginnings"" and had risen to ""dizzying heights"". He was the fourth of eight children from Skerries in north County Dublin. Drumm left school after his Leaving Certificate and did an accountancy apprenticeship. He joined Anglo in 1993, when he was 26, and worked his way up to the position of chief executive ""somewhat unexpectedly"" in 2005. The court heard Drumm was married with two children. Defence counsel, Brendan Grehan, said Drumm was facing a sentence that would reverberate not just in Ireland but much farther afield. He said that with the benefit of hindsight, Drumm acknowledged he had made a ""huge error of judgement"". Mr Grehan added that his client's future options were restricted and he would carry with him this ""notoriety"" for the rest of his days.

Hospital drugs left 456 patients dead,"This video can not be played Hundreds of lives were cut short due to prescribed opioids at Gosport War Memorial Hospital More than 450 patients died after being given powerful painkillers inappropriately at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, a report has found. An independent panel,externalsaid, taking into account missing records, a further 200 patients may have suffered a similar fate. The report found there was a ""disregard for human life"" of a large number of patients from 1989 to 2000. It saidDr Jane Barton oversaw the practice of prescribingon the wards. There was an ""institutionalised regime"" of prescribing and administering ""dangerous"" amounts of a medication not clinically justified at the Hampshire hospital, the report said. The scandals that haunt the NHS Jane Barton, the doctor who shortened lives NHS 'closed ranks' over hospital deaths Reaction to hospital deaths report Prime Minister Theresa May described events at Gosport as ""deeply troubling"" and apologised to families over the time it took to get answers from the NHS. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt told MPs police and the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) would examine material in the report to consider their next steps and ""whether criminal charges should now be brought"". Bridget Reeves - whose grandmother Elsie Divine, 88, died at the hospital in 1999 - said: ""These horrifying, shameful, unforgivable actions need to be disclosed in a criminal court for a jury to decide and only then can we put our loved ones to rest."" This video can not be played Gosport hospital: Families 'grossly let down' by authorities Dr Jane Barton was found guilty of serious professional misconduct in 2010 but no prosecutions were brought So far, the only person to face disciplinary action has been Dr Barton, who was found guilty of failings in her care of 12 patients at Gosport between 1996 and 1999. But no prosecutions were brought and she was not struck off the medical register, choosing to retire after the findings. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. Former Bishop of Liverpool James Jones, who led the Gosport Independent Panel, said: ""The documents seen by the panel show that for a 12-year period a clinical assistant, Dr Barton, was responsible for the practice of prescribing which prevailed on the wards. ""Although the consultants were not involved directly in treating patients on the wards, the medical records show that they were aware of how drugs were prescribed and administered but did not intervene to stop the practice."" Families of those who have died at Gosport Memorial Hospital gathered at Portsmouth Cathedral to hear the findings of the inquiry Relatives had said they hoped the findings of the report would end their""harrowing"" wait for answers. The document said families were ""consistently let down"" by those in authority, both medical individuals and institutions, when they complained about the treatment of their loved ones. Bishop Jones, who also headed the Hillsborough Inquiry, said: ""It's not for the panel to ascribe criminal or civil liability. ""It will be for any future judicial processes to determine whatever culpability and criticism might be forthcoming."" Bishop Jones led the panel and announced its findings outside Portsmouth Cathedral Police previously investigated the deaths of 92 patients during three inquires between 1998 and 2006, but no prosecutions were brought. Chief Constable Olivia Pinkney, of Hampshire Constabulary, said the force had ""co-operated fully"" with the panel and ""shared with them more than 25,000 documents containing 100,000 pages of information"". ""We will assess any new information contained within the report in conjunction with our partners in health and the CPS in order to decide the next steps,"" she added. The CPS said it will ""consider"" the report and take ""any appropriate steps as required"". The report said an ""awareness"" that the deaths ""might be due to 'another Shipman'"" had ""cast a shadow over how concerns at the hospital were viewed"". GP Harold Shipman was jailed for life in 2000 for murdering 15 patients between 1995 and 1998. Family tributes were placed outside the cathedral ""The police focused on the allegation that Dr Barton was guilty of unlawful killing, rather than pursuing a wider investigation,"" the report added. ""Hampshire Constabulary approached Dr Barton's managers, including the then chief executive at the trust and Dr Althea Lord, the responsible consultant, in a way that ignored the possibility that they too might have been subject to investigation."" It said the quality of the force's three investigations was ""consistently poor"". The panel found officers had a mindset of seeing family members who complained as ""stirring up trouble"" while seeing the hospital as the place to go for guidance and assurance during their inquiries. The report added: ""There was an institutionalised regime of prescribing and administering 'dangerous doses' of a hazardous combination of medication not clinically indicated or justified, with patients and relatives powerless in their relationship with professional staff."" Gladys Richards who died at the hospital in 1998 was among the photographs on display Gosport MP Caroline Dinenage said it highlighted many ""failures"" by the authorities to properly investigate. She said organisations must look closely at the full report and urged the government to take action if there were cases to answer. She said: ""I can't even imagine what the families must be going through - it's absolutely heartbreaking."" Nursing staff first raised concerns about the poor prescribing and administration of opioids at the Gosport Memorial Hospital nearly 30 years ago but their fears were ""silenced"" by management, the inquiry revealed. In 1991, Anita Tubbritt, a staff nurse at the hospital rang Keith Murray, the local Royal College of Nursing branch convener, to express concerns she and other staff shared over the use of diamorphine and syringe drivers. The report said the nurses gave the hospital a chance to rectify the practice and in choosing not to do so ""deaths resulted and, 22 years later, it became necessary to establish this panel in order to discover the truth of what happened"". Janet Davies, chief executive of the Royal College of Nursing, said the report made for ""very sober reading for everybody involved in the care of patients"". ""Nursing as a profession must work hard to seek out lessons from Gosport and we expect that approach to be shared by regulators and the health and care system,"" she added. ""The report is right to praise the bravery shown by the nurses who raised concerns.  It highlights how difficult it can be for nursing staff to challenge the decisions taken by others."" Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said there had been a ""catalogue of failures"" The health secretary described the findings as ""truly shocking"". He said ""brave nurse whistleblowers"" had first raised concerns in 1991, as well as families. He added there had been a ""catalogue of failures"", including by the Department of Health. A report first compiled by Prof Richard Baker in 2003 - and published 10 years later - found evidence of an ""almost routine use of opiates"" since 1998. Speaking in the Commons, Mr Hunt asked why it had taken 10 years for this to be made public. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Brexit bill finally gets through Parliament,"This video can not be played Liam Fox tells Laura Kuenssberg rebels have not changed Brexit stance The government's Brexit bill has passed through Parliament after Theresa May saw off a revolt by Tory MPs. Peers accepted the amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sent to them from the House of Commons, meaning the bill now goes for Royal Assent, becoming law. Earlier, the government won the vote 319 to 303, after assurances were accepted by would-be rebels that MPs would have a meaningful say. The PM called it a ""crucial step"" in delivering a ""smooth"" Brexit. Mrs May said: ""Today's votes show people in the UK, and to the EU, that the elected representatives in this country are getting on with the job, and delivering on the will of the British people. ""Over the next few weeks we will publish more details of our proposed future relationship with the EU in a White Paper, and will bring the Trade and Customs Bills back to the House of Commons. ""But today has been an important step in delivering the Brexit people voted for, a Brexit that gives Britain a brighter future, a Britain in control of its money, laws, and borders."" Who really backed down over Brexit vote? Can Theresa May 'take back control'? Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Before the Commons vote, Dominic Grieve, leader of the would-be rebels - who wanted to ensure MPs had the power to stop the UK leaving without a deal - said the ""sovereignty of Parliament"" had been acknowledged. Both sides have claimed victory with Stephen Hammond, a pro-EU MP who eventually sided with the government, suggesting ministers had agreed to give Parliament a ""real say"" on top of other concessions. But international trade secretary Liam Fox said nothing had really changed and the option of a no-deal Brexit had been left firmly on the table. ""There is no change to the fundamental issue here which is the government cannot be forced by Parliament to negotiate something which it does not want to do,"" he told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. He said the government had ""to be able to hold out in our negotiations the prospect of no deal"" otherwise the EU would get the upper hand. On Wednesday evening, following the Commons vote, Leader of the Lords Baroness Evans of Bowes Park said the EU (Withdrawal) Bill had been ""debated at length"" and was very different as a result of amendments tabled by the Lords. ""I believe our role now is to accept their view as expressed in a vote a few hours ago,"" she said. Peers approved the government's proposal without a vote. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 and negotiations have been taking place over the terms of its departure. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch. It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to. And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM. The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts. Read more from Laura The government has been at odds with the House of Lords in the long-running row over what happens if the UK cannot reach a deal with the EU, or if MPs reject whatever deal the government agrees with the EU. The Commons vote had been expected to be tight and the government eventually prevailed by a majority of 16. Six Tory MPs - Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen, Antoinette Sandbach and Phillip Lee - rebelled while four Labour MPs backed the government and six other Labour MPs abstained, as did Kelvin Hopkins, who sits as an independent after having the whip withdrawn. Ms Wollaston tweeted that she was disappointed with the outcome. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Lords is expected to finally approve the EU Withdrawal Bill on Wednesday The debate centred on what happens in three Brexit scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal If Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached If 21 January passes with no deal being struck. Under these circumstances, the government has said, a minister will make a statement in Parliament, setting out the proposed next steps. MPs will then vote on this statement. According to the government, this vote should be ""on neutral terms"", with MPs simply noting what has been said. But an amendment backed by the House of Lords on Monday went further, saying MPs should have to ""approve"" the minister's statement. The Department for Exiting the European Union has now conceded that it will be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide the matter at the time. The government statement that Mr Grieve has accepted Speaking in the Commons, Dominic Grieve said the issue of the meaningful vote was about giving ""assurances to the House and many, many people in the country who are worried about this process and how it will end"". If Parliament wished to ""speak with one voice"" and exert its influence in the face of a non-deal scenario, it ""has the power to do it"". Mr Grieve said he had insisted on a key paragraph in the government statement accepting ""it is open to MPs to table motions and debate matters of concern and that, as is the convention, parliamentary time will be provided for this"". Another potential rebel Nicky Morgan said she did not wish to see Mrs May ""destabilised or undermined"" ahead of next week's summit of EU leaders. But she warned of further battles to come over the UK's trade and customs arrangements with the EU and suggested relationships between MPs had been ""strained almost beyond belief"". Please upgrade your browser And Conservative MP Vicky Ford, another pro-European MP who stuck with the government, said the outcome was ""not a mandate for a no-deal Brexit"". She said MPs had secured a ""backstop"" which meant if Parliament rejected the deal it could trigger ""another set of negotiations"" between the UK and EU aimed at getting an agreement before the UK left.

The scandals that haunt the NHS,"One by one the scandals have become etched on the public consciousness. The mass killings by Harold Shipman. The deaths of babies undergoing heart surgery at Bristol Royal Infirmary and born under the care of Morecambe Bay maternity services. The needless suffering of patients at Stafford Hospital. Now we can add Gosport War Memorial Hospital in Hampshire to that list. News that 456 patients died after they were given opiate painkillers without reason is one of those moments that send a shudder through the NHS - and the nation. All these scandals are, of course, different. Shipman was about the actions of one person. Stafford was an institutional failing on a mass scale. Gosport has elements of both. But there are similarities too that run through all of them - and they go to the heart of what perhaps still remains an uncomfortable truth about healthcare. Whether it is in the GP's surgery, on a ward in a hospital, a room in a care home or from the comfort of your sofa during a home visit, patients see doctors and other healthcare staff when they are at their most vulnerable. The interactions are based on trust. A trust which is overwhelmingly repaid by the thousands of dedicated staff who treat millions of patients every week in the NHS. But bad practices can set in and poor care can go unchallenged. It is the common thread that runs through all four cases. And it begs two questions. Prescribed painkillers 'shortened 456 lives' NHS closed ranks, says Norman Lamb Reaction to hospital deaths report In unveiling his findings, panel chairman Bishop James Jones talked about the ""institutionalised"" nature of what went wrong at Gosport. A culture where the unacceptable became acceptable had developed. It seems shocking. But it shouldn't. In any workplace, the culture and values are key. In an organisation the size of the NHS, they come from the top, but also from those you work with directly. Gladys Richards who died at the hospital in 1998 was among the photographs on display Peter Carter, the former general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing, has talked about the NHS being a series of ""microclimates"", where good care can exist next to bad. He visited Stafford Hospital before the horror of what happened came to light. He was shown around wards, but not the ones that were at the centre of the subsequent inquiry. Afterwards he praised the care he saw. It can make identifying problems very difficult. It requires those on the inside - staff or patients - to blow the whistle. But time and time again that doesn't happen. Inquiries into Stafford Hospital, Morecambe Bay and Shipman detail the trusts placed in the system and staff. When people do have concerns there is a temptation to want to avoid making a ""nuisance"" of yourself or a fear of reprisals, according to Sir Robert Francis, who led the Stafford inquiry. Even when concerns are raised, they are not always acted on. This has happened in all these cases. Lib Dem MP Norman Lamb, who has been active in supporting the families in the Gosport case, has described how the hospital ""closed ranks"". Similar conclusions were drawn by the inquiries into Bristol, Morecambe Bay and Stafford Hospital. Hence, it has taken relatives 20 years of fighting to get the full scale of what went on at Gosport into the light. The NHS has changed dramatically in the past 10 to 20 years. The Shipman case led to changes into how deaths are recorded, controlled medicines are monitored and GPs are assessed. The Bristol Royal Infirmary and Stafford Hospital cases led to an overhaul in how hospitals are inspected and death rates used to hold them to account. Whistle-blowers now enjoy greater protection when they come forward. Patients are encouraged to play an active role in making decisions about their care, with doctors and nurses consulting with them in a way that would have been unimaginable previously. It means healthcare is undoubtedly safer than it was when each of these scandals were unfolding. But consider this: the failings at Morecambe Bay were still going on as recently as 2013. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt says ""searching"" questions must be asked about the whole system Indeed, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt, in his statement to Parliament on Gosport, said it was only right that ""searching questions"" are asked about whether everything is being done to prevent another scandal. You need only look at the most recent NHS staff survey in England to see the system is far from perfect. Nearly a third did not feel secure in raising concerns about unsafe care.  An even greater number were not confident their complaints would be acted on. Dr Harold Shipman- Responsible for killing at least 215 patients over a 25-year period from the mid 1970s. Many were elderly women who died after he injected them with lethal doses of diamorphine. Stafford Hospital- Criticised for causing suffering to hundreds of patients during the late 2000s. Trust in charge of hospital later placed into administration. Bristol heart deaths- Thirty-five babies died and dozens more left brain-damaged by poor practices identified at child heart surgery unit between 1991 and 1995 Morecambe Bay- An inquiry said a ""lethal mix"" of failures in maternity care led to the deaths of 11 babies and a mother over nine years. Gosport War Memorial Hospital- Independent panel found there was a ""disregard for human life"" at hospital where inappropriate use of strong painkillers linked to the deaths of over 450 people.

Kuenssberg: Who blinked first?,"This video can not be played Liam Fox tells Laura Kuenssberg rebels have not changed Brexit stance Who blinked? Maybe both sides did, a bit. Lots will be said and written in the next 24 hours about who really backed down after another day of shenanigans in Parliament - whips cornering potential rebels, even today, the grim sight of a Labour MP being forced to come to vote while visibly ill in a wheelchair and on morphine, the Tories so nervous about the vote that they suspended the normal rules that allow for ill MPs to stay out of the Chamber. As Westminster games go, it is getting pretty extreme. But ultimately, your view on whether the compromise had a winner, may depend on the side you are on. Both sides of course will claim they were the victor, the haggling over a deal took so long because both sides wanted to save face. The cabinet minister Liam Fox has just told us that nothing has really changed, it was just ""procedural"" and the fundamentals were exactly the same. In contrast, one of the organisers of the rebel group, Stephen Hammond, tweeted that the government has now conceded that Parliament would have a ""real say with no constraints"", if the final Brexit deal is rejected. The two sides will, guess what, continue to argue it for weeks to come, and every insult, every rankle, every cross word on this episode, being remembered in the difficult months to come. May sees off Tory Brexit vote rebellion Here are two things however that are hard to dispute. The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch. It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to. And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM. The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts. The former boss of the Treasury, Nick McPherson, no fan of Brexit it's important to say, has just acidly written online: ""Axiom of the last 30 years. Europhile Tories always compromise to preserve party unity, Their opponents don't. #thatswhywearewhereweare"" But the last 24 hours has also been frustrating for Brexiteers. Many of them believe that Theresa May didn't have to push it this far, that she could have faced down the potential rebels without having to give any ground. There are many behind the scenes urging Number 10 to take a firmer line, to dare them to vote against her. Not the Parliamentary arithmetic, but the Tories' own arithmetic, makes them believe that she'd be easily able to do so, to end it once and for all and make plain that Brexiteers are the dominant force. But to face down the rebels who want to maintain closer ties to the EU or the Brexiteers would require the prime minister to risk something that she wants to avoid - to make the splits in Tory party more exposed, to make one side of the party the overt winner. For many months she has survived by tacking first an inch one way, and then the other. Today's events with a non-compromise-compromise suggest she is simply not ready to abandon that approach. But with so many more difficult decisions to come in the next few months, on both sides, Tories are more and more frustrated that she refuses to choose. One observes that Number 10 might believe the ""lesson of Maastricht"", is to try everything to keep the Tory party together, but the truth they suggest is that the real lesson of Maastricht is that any war is only over when one side is the clear victor. The trouble is, another source suggested, she never wants to say no to anyone, but when it comes to doing this deal, she simply can't say yes to everyone.

NHS 'closed ranks' over deaths,"A former health minister has accused the NHS of closing ranks after the deaths in hospital of elderly patients from alleged overprescribed painkiller drugs. Norman Lamb said the NHS and elements of Whitehall had refused to face up to ""hard and uncomfortable facts"". The Liberal Democrat MP served as a health minister between 2012-15 during the coalition government. He was speaking to the BBC on the eve of the publication of a report into hundreds of deaths at Gosport War Memorial Hospital near Portsmouth in the 1990s. The former bishop of Liverpool James Jones has spent the last four years chairing an independent panel which has been examining the deaths of elderly patients who were allegedly prescribed the painkiller diamorphine. Jones chaired the independent Hillsborough panel. Dr Jane Barton, a local GP who cared for the some of the patients at Gosport, was found guilty in 2010 by the General Medical Council of ""serious professional misconduct"" after it concluded that she had prescribed potentially hazardous levels of drugs. Dr Barton was not struck off and she chose to retire after the findings. Police examined 92 cases among the 833 death certificates signed by the GP. Dr Barton has previously denied wrongdoing and has maintained that she always acted in the interests of her patients. In an interview with BBC Newsnight Norman Lamb spoke of his anger when department of health officials advised him in 2013 that a public enquiry should not be held after the publication of an official report into the deaths.

The Baker report was completed in 2003 but not published until ten years later once all the inquests had been completed. This video can not be played ""There's been a real systemic failure here,"" says former health minister Norman Lamb Lamb told BBC Newsnight: ""I just think it's horrific and there has been a real systemic failure here, a closing of ranks in my view and a sense that ordinary people just weren't being listened to at all, and an unwillingness by the NHS to face up to some really serious allegations about what happened in that hospital."" The former minister recalled his reaction when he was advised by department of health officials in 2013, in an email sent to him on holiday in France, that a public enquiry should not be held. He said: ""I was incandescent about this so I immediately sensed that there might have been a conspiracy to cover this up whilst I was out of the country. To this day I dont know whether it was cock up or cover up but I was very clear in my mind that there must on no account be that statement made the next day."" Lamb said he persuaded ministerial colleagues to launch the enquiry. The findings will be published tomorrow. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Norman Lamb, in his capacity as a Minister at the Department of Health at the time, was instrumental in the decision to set up a panel investigation into the tragic events at Gosport.

Trump reverses migrant separation policy,"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""You're going to have a lot of very happy people"" US President Donald Trump has bowed to public pressure and signed an executive order promising to ""keep families together"" in migrant detentions. Mr Trump reversed his own policy amid international fury over the separation of undocumented parents and children. He said he had been swayed by images of children who have been taken from parents while they are jailed and prosecuted for illegal border-crossing. But the order does not address families already separated by the policy. US immigration officials say 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 parents between 5 May and 9 June. ""It's about keeping families together,"" Mr Trump said at the signing ceremony on Wednesday. ""I did not like the sight of families being separated,"" he said, but added the administration would continue its ""zero tolerance policy"" of criminally prosecuting anyone who crosses the border illegally. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained Psychological impact on separated children Who decided to take the children away? Trump's blame game on separating families Theexecutive order,externalcalls for: Immigrant families to be detained together while their legal cases are considered Expediting immigration cases involving families Requesting the modification of a court ruling that dictates how long immigrant children can be detained The president said his wife, Melania, and daughter, Ivanka, who reportedly have been applying pressure on him to drop the policy, ""feel strongly"" about ending the practice of separating migrant families. ""I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it,"" he said. ""We don't like to see families separated."" Vice-President Mike Pence and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who has emerged as the face of the White House policy, were both present for the signing of the order on Wednesday. This video can not be played US youth shelter worker quit after being ordered to separate siblings Before his U-turn on Wednesday the president had previously said ""you can't do it through an executive order"", insisting that only Congress could fix the policy by passing immigration reform. Republican congressional leader Paul Ryan said the House of Representatives will vote on Thursday ""on legislation to keep families together"". A series of White House contradictions on migrants Fenced enclosures hold migrant children He did not immediately provide details of the bill, but said it resolves the issue of so-called Dreamers, undocumented adult migrants who entered the US as children, ""in a very elegant way"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher,BBC News, Washington For days administration officials have insisted they were simply following the law as written and their ""zero tolerance"" policy for illegal border crossings meant they ""have to take the children away"", in the president's words. Critics have countered that Mr Trump unilaterally created the situation that produced the heart-rending accounts of children separated from their parents, and he could unilaterally fix it. By taking executive action, the president is effectively acknowledging they were correct. Now the fight will probably move to the courts, with legal challenges to the administration's decision to hold detained families together while their immigration status is adjudicated. That is more politically hospitable ground for Republicans, who already face challenging mid-term congressional elections. Read more of Anthony Zurcher's analysis In April, the US attorney general announced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy to criminally charge and jail undocumented border crossers. As children cannot legally be jailed with their parents, they are kept in separate facilities. US immigration officials say more than 2,300 children have been taken from some 2,200 parents since 5 May. This video can not be played The sound of migrant children separated from parents Pictures of dozens of children sleeping in fenced enclosures and audio of them crying emerged in recent days, provoking widespread criticism. Under previous US administrations, immigrants caught crossing the border for the first time tended to be issued with court summonses and released. Six American airlines have told the Trump administration not to use their aircraft to transport child migrants who have been separated from their parents. Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, Southwest and United airlines all said the policy contravened their values. Holding cells:They are first detained at Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, where chain-link fenced enclosures are used, though the children can only be legally held there for three days. Detention centres:They are then supposed to be moved to one of around 100 detention centres run through the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), part of the Department of Health and Human Services. US officials recently showed reporters around a converted Walmart Supercenter in Texas which was housing migrant boys aged 10-17. They apparently had access to beds, classes and games. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart in Texas ""Tender age shelters"":AP news agency reports that babies and toddlers are being taken to three ""tender age shelters"" in southern Texas. A CBP official said it is up to the discretion of border agents whether to detain ""tender-aged"" children, who are typically less than five years old. Tentcamps:US officials have set up a tent camp for migrant children in Tornillo, Texas. Family members:Under US law, the children are meant to be released to stay with relatives or foster carers ""without delay"". In practice, the ORR says this process takesabout two months,external. How aretheyreunited?Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has set up a hotline for parents to call after they are released from custody. However, a former ICE director has said some family separations are ""permanent"". This video can not be played The US teens training in border patrol Mr Trump's order says that families could remain together in detention instead of separating children from parents illegally crossing into the country. But immigrant children are only allowed to be held for 20 days, according to a 21-year-old landmark court decision known as the Flores agreement. The order also calls for the justice department to request to modify the Flores agreement to allow children to be held longer, but it is unclear what will happen if the law does not change. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The Trump administration is likely to become tangled in legal battles with immigration activists on behalf of detained migrants if it is unable to overturn the Flores agreement before the 20-day deadline. ""This is a stopgap measure,"" said Gene Hamilton, counsel to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The order also did not provide any date or timeline on when it would be implemented and does not address how the more than 2,000 children already stripped from their families would be reunited. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar has said his department will begin working to return detained immigrant children to their families, but did not give a timeline. A top HHS official told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday they have no system in place to do so. US child detention pics 'disturbing' - May.

"BA cancels 2,000 'too cheap' ticketsPassengers are angry after tickets to Tel Aviv and Dubai were cancelled for being the incorrect price.","British Airways has apologised and offered full refunds for the error More than 2,000 British Airways passengers have had their tickets cancelled because the prices were too cheap, a travel agent has said. Travel Up chief Ali Shah said he believes another five agencies also sold tickets through the airline's mistake. BA has apologised for the error on flights to Tel Aviv and Dubai but refused to say how many were affected. Customers said they were angry their tickets are not being honoured. Mr Shah said flights normally costing more than Â£200 were advertised for Â£1 plus airport taxes, which can be several hundred pounds, between 17:45 BST on 11 June and 11:00 the following day. The agent, who said more than 2,000 of his customers have been affected, said: ""It's very cruel for the customers because they have booked these flights in good faith and expected it to be honoured. ""But I can also understand British Airways' position, it's a human error."" Mr Shah said all affected customers are being contacted and BA will provide a full refund as well as a Â£100 voucher. Travel Up customer Ash Gubbay, from London, says he had booked a return flight to Tel Aviv for Â£195 but now has to pay about Â£1,000. Ash Gubbay was going to Tel Aviv for a family wedding and memorial service Mr Gubbay said he thought the tickets were cheap but ""not far-fetched"" and comparable with other airlines. He said the firm should honour the flights. Mr Gubbay said he was ""annoyed and angry"" and the voucher would be of ""no help"" as it will not cover the cost difference for new flights. He said: ""I'm very disappointed and let down by British Airways. ""If I wanted to cancel my tickets I wouldn't have been able to but it seems like they can just do what they want."" Another customer, Esther Vadia, had booked six tickets to Tel Aviv for Â£167 each and a seventh for her son later in the year for Â£195. All have been cancelled. She says she is unable to afford to pay for other flights and although she will be refunded, she will still have to pay credit card fees for the cancelled tickets. Ms Vadia also said she would end up losing more than Â£1,000 on non-refundable accommodation in Israel. She said: ""If you go to a supermarket and buy something for cheap, they cannot come after you later and say you have to give it back. ""So how can an airline do that? Besides, I don't think the tickets were so cheap as to be unbelievable."" by Brian Milligan, BBC personal finance reporter Whether BA was entitled to cancel the tickets is likely to depend whether they were so cheap that the so-called mistake should have been obvious to customers. If they were miles cheaper than comparable tickets, the company could argue that it made a ""unilateral mistake"" in its pricing. But the difficulty for BA is that a quick search online reveals flights from London to Tel Aviv to be on sale for around Â£215. So the BA fare of Â£195 may not seem unusually good value. James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance, thinks BA may be in the wrong. ""I don't understand how, technically, they could wriggle out of it. It's their error,"" he said. However, it may take a legal challenge from one of the passengers involved to fully test the law on this. Hanna Simon, another passenger, also said she did not believe the flights were ""excessively cheap"". She said she was particularly frustrated as she had corresponded with BA about add-ons to her flight and no problem had been raised by the airline. Several people the BBC spoke to also said they had not been informed of the cancellation and only found out when they checked their online accounts. They also said the Â£100 voucher was ""useless"" as, aside from ""restrictive"" terms and conditions, the flights were now costing much more than that. Flights to Dubai were also affected by the pricing error BA said in a statement: ""Errors like this are exceptionally rare, and if they do occur, under contract law, there is no binding contract between the parties. ""We have apologised to customers and offered a gesture of goodwill."" Guy Anker, deputy editor ofMoneySavingExpert.com,external, said BA should ""do the right thing"" and let the passengers ""fly at the price they booked"". He said: ""While this may have been a 'rare' error, it's not the passengers' error. ""They've bought these tickets in good faith at a believable price - it's not as though the tickets cost Â£5, which would clearly have been a glitch."" Jack Sheldon, founder of Jack's Flight Club, said ""fare errors"" were not uncommon but in almost 70% of cases the airline would honour the tickets. He said: ""They honour it because it's bad PR to cancel tickets. ""This is an odd one. In cases where tickets are cancelled it is usually because the ticket was supposed to be say Â£400 but was sold for Â£40. ""In this case the error doesn't seem to have been that big and a typical customer could well have thought this was a genuine fare.""

Instagram now allows 60-minute videosIGTV allows users to create long-form videos in portrait mode that can be up to an hour long.Newsbeat,"Instagram has released a long-form video feature which allows users to post hour-long clips. IGTV lets users create content exceeding the current maximum 60-second clip limit for the first time. It's not clear if the longer videos would include adverts or if users would be paid for their content as they are on platforms like YouTube. Speaking exclusively to Newsbeat, Instagram founder Kevin Systrom said it's in ""no rush to figure that out"". Five things we learnt from Instagram boss Instagram pins hopes on vertical video IGTV will show videos in portrait mode, which Instagram says is the ""natural way"" people use their phones. Kevin said: ""Video deserves a better home on mobile"". Tech expert Alex Brinnand, fromTenEighty magazine,external, says IGTV could make Instagram a more dominant player in the social media industry. He said: ""We're still yet to see exactly what power Instagram does have. I'm sure there are lots of discussions happening at other platforms about how much of a threat this could be and those are valid"". This video can not be played Instagram released this video to promote IGTV The longest video you can currently post is 60 seconds long - that's in ""feed"" mode - the main bit of Instagram you see when you open the app. Instagram Stories - which normally expire after 24 hours - have a 15-second video limit per clip. In the Instagram app, you'll see IGTV next to your messages tab The new platform will be a standalone app as well as existing on users' homepages. Kevin told Newsbeat Instagram wants to change how people make and watch video - taking it away from traditional media like desktop computers and TVs. ""All the data we have shows that people are spending less and less time in front of TVs, but spending more and more time on their phones,"" he said. He said he feels a ""responsibility"" to make these changes to Instagram. Until now, you've only been able to post to Instagram on a mobile device. That's another big change with IGTV - where you'll be able to upload on desktop and clips will get a unique link. Each user will have a channel, similar to YouTube, where the videos will be stored. If you've got an Instagram account, you'll get a channel once you update the app. We asked Kevin about the inevitable comparisons with YouTube and he said videos on IGTV would be ""more engaging and perhaps more emotional"". Like all content on Instagram - IGTV will follow itsrules and regulations,external. Those guidelines explain the user must not post violent, nude, discriminatory or hateful content but Kevin admitted to Newsbeat that not every video will be approved by the company before it's uploaded. ""We want to make sure Instagram is a safe, welcoming and kind platform for all,"" he said. Earlier this year YouTubehad to apologisefor not reacting quickly enough when one of its stars, Logan Paul, uploaded a vlog showing the body of a man who had killed himself in a forest in Japan. At the time YouTube's chief business officertold Newsbeatit didn't think the platform should be regulated in the way that traditional broadcasters are by Ofcom. Kevin Systrom says it's hard to speculate how IGTV will be monitored: ""We're going to look at how the product engages consumers and to make sure that it's safe and fair.""

Heineken beer hit by COÃ¢ÂÂ supply shortage,"Supplies of meat, chicken and beer are facing disruption by the an industry-wide shortage of carbon dioxide. At least five CO2 producers in northern Europe are offline for maintenance,according to the publication Gasworld,external. CO2 is used in the guns used to kill animals, as well as providing the fizz in carbonated drinks and being crucial to propelling beer from bar pumps. Meat producers have asked the government to prioritise their need for the gas above those of other users. Seasonal maintenance shutdowns have left the UK with only one big CO2 producer in action. Gasworld, which first raised the issue, said carbonated drinks producers were now ""desperate"" amid the worst CO2 supply crisis for decades. The Grocer magazine has also reported stark warnings from the British Poultry Council (BPC) that up to 60% of poultry processing plants could be knocked out ""within days"" as a result of the CO2 shortage. CO2 is used to stun and ultimately suffocate poultry in many slaughterhouses. BPC chief executive, Richard Griffiths, said that with the supply of CO2 tightened across Europe, the British Poultry Council was  calling on the government and major gas producers to ""prioritise supplies to slaughterhouses and keep the food chain moving"". The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said it was asking officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to prioritise meat producers when finding back-up supplies of CO2. BMPA deputy director Fiona Steiger said: ""Supply is running out and it's pretty tight for some people. ""We don't know when supplies will be back up. We've been told it could be about a month."" Heineken's John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel kegs have been already been hit. Heineken said it was ""working with customers to minimise disruption"". ""We've been informed by our CO2 supplier that they are facing a major issue with supply availability in the UK,"" Heineken confirmed in a statement. Wetherspoons pub chain said that while it had not had any supply issues yet, ""that is likely to change in the coming days, and it's not likely to get any better. ""There might be some products we don't have available and if it affects Wetherspoons, then it will affect everyone else."" The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents brewers and 20,000 UK pubs, said the CO2 shortage was beginning to cause stoppages in beer production, although it did not name specific companies. As much as 82% of beer consumed in the UK is produced here, requiring carbon dioxide, according to Brigid Simmonds, head of the BBPA. Demand for beer and fizzy drinks is peaking as fans gather to watch the football, thanks to the recent run of hot weather. Carbon dioxide doesn't just put the fizz into soft drinks, canned and bottled beers. It also delivers beer at the pub pumps and is additionally used to pack fresh meat and salads. It comes from ammonia plants that manufacture fertiliser. But as demand for fertiliser peaks in winter, manufacturers often shut down during the summer for maintenance work. This video can not be played Are we in for a beer shortage this summer? The BBPA has issued some guidance to its members reminding them that CO2 used in drinks, including for dispensing beer at the pumps, must be food grade CO2. ""We'd be concerned this is not the time to go looking for a white van man who says they can supply you with CO2,"" she said. Gavin Partington, director general at the British Soft Drinks Association, said soft drinks producers were ""taking active steps to maintain their service to customers"". Coca Cola European Partners' spokesperson said it was currently able to fulfil orders to customers and was working with suppliers, partners and customers ""on a number of solutions"". The UK is particularly hard hit by the shortages, according to Gasworld, because only one major CO2 plant is still operating and imports from the European mainland have been affected by shutdowns in northern Europe. The UK is a large market for carbon dioxide and imports about a third of its CO2 needs. It has a vast range of applications in industry, with one of the main uses being the manufacture of dry ice to chill airline meals. The UK has a number of plants that produce CO2, but three of the four largest are currently down for maintenance or technical reasons. Carbon dioxide has a range of uses including packaging fresh food Gasworld said the heatwave in May had boosted demand for fizzy drinks across northern Europe at a time when ammonia plants producing CO2 as a by-product were closed. The current low price of ammonia meant producers were not restarting production quickly. Carbon dioxide production also comes from bioethanol plants, and as a by-product from whisky distilleries in Scotland. But these tend to be on a smaller scale and one UK bioethanol plant is also currently closed. While there were ready supplies of carbon dioxide in southern Europe, including Hungary and Romania, transporting it to northern Europe required specialist pressurised transport, Gasworld said.

Former bank boss sentenced to six yearsDavid Drumm made Anglo Irish Bank's balance sheet look better by Ã¢ÂÂ¬7.2bn (ÃÂ£5.4bn) in 2008.,"David Drumm moved to the US in 2009 but was extradited in 2016 Former Anglo Irish Bank chief executive David Drumm has been sentenced to six years in jail. He was sentenced on Wednesday at the Dublin Criminal Court. The ex-banker wasfound guilty earlier in Juneof authorising a â¬7.2bn (Â£5.4bn) conspiracy to defraud and of false accounting. Drumm had pleaded not guilty to conspiring to dishonestly make Anglo's balance sheet look better between March and September 2008. He also denied knowingly giving false figures to the market that December. Anglo Irish, which was nationalised in 2009 and wound down from 2011, was synonymous with the lending practices that drove the 'Celtic Tiger' boom and subsequent bust, pushing the Republic of Ireland to the brink of meltdown in 2010. Mr Drumm moved to the US in 2009 but was extradited in 2016. Judge Karen O'Connor said that people were entitled to trust their banks and this was grossly reprehensible behaviour. She said Drumm was in a position of trust in the bank. David Drumm's legal team accepted before sentencing that he would get a jail term. Once the poster boy of Irish banking, Anglo-Irish Bank is expected to cost the Irish taxpayer up to â¬30bn (Â£26.3bn) over the coming years. Ireland's banking-related property crash destroyed both lives and livelihoods. The three other men convicted on similar charges got between two and three and a half years behind bars. So, there is some surprise, but little sympathy for Drumm, the main mover behind the fraud, with his six year jail term. The passage of time may have blunted some of the anger people felt about Anglo, but far from all of it. David Drumm is a former chief executive of Anglo Irish Bank Judge O'Connor sentenced him to six years and ordered that he would get credit for the five months he had spent in a prison in Boston, before being extradited to Ireland in March 2016. She said that she felt ""the appropriate headline figure is eight years imprisonment in relation to both counts"", but ordered that he serve a six-year sentence after considering mitigating factors. The court heard that Drumm had emerged from ""humble beginnings"" and had risen to ""dizzying heights"". He was the fourth of eight children from Skerries in north County Dublin. Drumm left school after his Leaving Certificate and did an accountancy apprenticeship. He joined Anglo in 1993, when he was 26, and worked his way up to the position of chief executive ""somewhat unexpectedly"" in 2005. The court heard Drumm was married with two children. Defence counsel, Brendan Grehan, said Drumm was facing a sentence that would reverberate not just in Ireland but much farther afield. He said that with the benefit of hindsight, Drumm acknowledged he had made a ""huge error of judgement"". Mr Grehan added that his client's future options were restricted and he would carry with him this ""notoriety"" for the rest of his days.

Man arrested over Tube station blast,"Police said the cause of the explosion was a faulty battery A 23-year-old man has been arrested after an explosion at a north London Tube station left five people injured. Witnesses described smelling ""burning rubber"" and seeing ""six-foot flames"" at the entrance to Southgate Underground station in Enfield on Tuesday evening. Police believe the explosion was caused by a faulty drill battery. The man was held on suspicion of an act likely to cause an explosion to injure or damage property, and endangering safety on the railway. The station was shut and a cordon set up after the explosion occurred at about 19:00 BST. London Ambulance Service said they treated three people at the scene for minor injuries while two others were taken to hospital. Police said officers are ""working to establish the full facts"" James Ayton, 34, from Southgate, was on the ""packed"" escalator when he saw a ""quick burst"" of flames at the top. He said they were ""six foot plus"" and everyone ""legged it"" upon hearing a ""rapid whooshing sound"". ""The Tube had just unloaded. A few people got trampled on the escalator. There was screaming."" He said he saw a Tube worker pick something up that was on fire and extinguish it, but added: ""I think that was secondary rather than the cause."" The Met responded to the incident, which is now being investigated by British Transport Police Finance worker Haluk Ozkan was about to get on a bus outside the station when he smelt something ""like burning rubber"". ""We then saw people rushing to get out of the station. Not necessarily running or panicking, but moving quickly,"" he said. ""Then my partner saw a station staff member pointing a fire extinguisher at something and heard it go off, but we didn't see what it was directed at."" The station has reopened with services running although some officers remain in the area to provide reassurance to passengers, British Transport Police said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the explosion had been ""confirmed as non-suspicious"" and praised the emergency services ""for a swift and professional response"". The arrested man, who is from Enfield, has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Cough syrup recall over mould risk,"Parents are being urged to check bottles of own-brand blackcurrant cough syrup because of a problem with one of the ingredients. This could cause mould to grow, which could make children unwell or cause a reaction, medicines experts said. No cases have been identified so far but eight products are being recalled as a precaution. The UK body which regulates medicines said the cough syrup bottles should be returned. Dr Sam Atkinson, from the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency's (MHRA) said: ""Check if you have any of the listed cough syrups and if you do, please don't use them. Take them back to where you bought them from. ""The mould is not always visible, so return any of the affected cough syrup bottles, even if it looks OK to use. ""If your child has recently taken one of these cough syrups, and, in the unlikely event that they have become unwell or had a reaction, please speak to your GP, pharmacist or other healthcare professional."" Even though there is a low risk of a reaction, Dr Atkinson said people should check the medicines they have at home. The list of products affected are: Asda Children's Dry Cough Syrup Glycerol Blackcurrant Flavour - batch 274V1, 276V1, 278V1, 283W1 - expiry dates 01/08/2020, 01/10/2020, 01/12/2020, 01/02/2021 Bell's Healthcare Children's Dry Cough Glycerin 0.75g/5ml Syrup - 280V3 - exp 01/12/2020 Morrisons Children's Dry Tickly Cough Glycerin 0.75g/5ml Oral Solution - 282W1- exp 01/01/2021 Numark Children's Dry Cough 0.75 g/5 ml Oral Solution - 280V1, 288W1- exp 01/12/2020, 01/04/2021 Sainsbury's Children's Dry Cough 0.75g/5ml Syrup - 275V1 - exp 01/09/2020 Superdrug Children's Dry Tickly Cough Glycerin 0.75 g/5 ml Oral Solution - 280V2, 284W1- exp 01/12/2020, 01/03/2021 Tesco Children's Dry Cough Syrup - 277V1, 278V2, 281W1 - exp 01/10/2020, 01/12/2020, 01/01/2021 Wilko Tickly Cough 0.75g/5ml Oral Solution - 275V2 - exp 01/09/2020 Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Instagram now allows 60-minute videos,"Instagram has released a long-form video feature which allows users to post hour-long clips. IGTV lets users create content exceeding the current maximum 60-second clip limit for the first time. It's not clear if the longer videos would include adverts or if users would be paid for their content as they are on platforms like YouTube. Speaking exclusively to Newsbeat, Instagram founder Kevin Systrom said it's in ""no rush to figure that out"". Five things we learnt from Instagram boss Instagram pins hopes on vertical video IGTV will show videos in portrait mode, which Instagram says is the ""natural way"" people use their phones. Kevin said: ""Video deserves a better home on mobile"". Tech expert Alex Brinnand, fromTenEighty magazine,external, says IGTV could make Instagram a more dominant player in the social media industry. He said: ""We're still yet to see exactly what power Instagram does have. I'm sure there are lots of discussions happening at other platforms about how much of a threat this could be and those are valid"". This video can not be played Instagram released this video to promote IGTV The longest video you can currently post is 60 seconds long - that's in ""feed"" mode - the main bit of Instagram you see when you open the app. Instagram Stories - which normally expire after 24 hours - have a 15-second video limit per clip. In the Instagram app, you'll see IGTV next to your messages tab The new platform will be a standalone app as well as existing on users' homepages. Kevin told Newsbeat Instagram wants to change how people make and watch video - taking it away from traditional media like desktop computers and TVs. ""All the data we have shows that people are spending less and less time in front of TVs, but spending more and more time on their phones,"" he said. He said he feels a ""responsibility"" to make these changes to Instagram. Until now, you've only been able to post to Instagram on a mobile device. That's another big change with IGTV - where you'll be able to upload on desktop and clips will get a unique link. Each user will have a channel, similar to YouTube, where the videos will be stored. If you've got an Instagram account, you'll get a channel once you update the app. We asked Kevin about the inevitable comparisons with YouTube and he said videos on IGTV would be ""more engaging and perhaps more emotional"". Like all content on Instagram - IGTV will follow itsrules and regulations,external. Those guidelines explain the user must not post violent, nude, discriminatory or hateful content but Kevin admitted to Newsbeat that not every video will be approved by the company before it's uploaded. ""We want to make sure Instagram is a safe, welcoming and kind platform for all,"" he said. Earlier this year YouTubehad to apologisefor not reacting quickly enough when one of its stars, Logan Paul, uploaded a vlog showing the body of a man who had killed himself in a forest in Japan. At the time YouTube's chief business officertold Newsbeatit didn't think the platform should be regulated in the way that traditional broadcasters are by Ofcom. Kevin Systrom says it's hard to speculate how IGTV will be monitored: ""We're going to look at how the product engages consumers and to make sure that it's safe and fair.""

'Own goal' is World Cup's leading scorer,"Cristiano Ronaldo, Lionel Messi and Harry Kane are among the players hoping to be top scorer at the 2018 World Cup in Russia. But for now their main rival is... own goal. Otherwise known as ""og"" - own goal has so far scored for Iran, France, Croatia and Senegal. They've also popped up with one for the hosts, Russia. Cristiano Ronaldo's four goals at the World Cup are closest to catching the five own goals scored after 17 games. The only tournament to have more own goals was France 1998, when there were six in the entire tournament - that's 64 games. Watch all five of own goal's goals in Russia so far below.

Theresa May declined to comment on what she described as ""leaked"" documents She said the emails show how ""officials describe key Northern routes as valueless, discuss classic handling strategies for members of Parliament, discuss whether to throw a sop to Northern passenger groups and debate whether to propagate myths in order to divert public attention from agreed planned route closures.""

Student admits killing sister in crash,"Meliha Kaya was speeding in a 30mph zone when she crashed her Mini A student has admitted killing her 16-year-old sister in a car crash in east London. Meliha Kaya, 22, smashed into a tree while speeding as she drove her sister Elif and a friend back from a pub in Wanstead on 13 February 2016. At the Old Bailey Kaya, of Woodford, east London, admitted causing death and serious injury by dangerous driving. A judge told her she could be spared jail due to the ""devastating"" impact of the crash on her family. Jordash Graham, 24, from Leytonstone, who was speeding in a Ford Focus behind Kaya, admitted dangerous driving at the court on Wednesday. All the occupants of Kaya's Mini were badly injured when the car crashed into a BMW in Chigwell Road, went over a low wall and hit a tree. Front seat passenger Elif, who was the only person wearing a seat belt, was pronounced dead at the scene. Before criminology student Kaya admitted the charge, Judge Wendy Joseph QC told her she would consider suspending her jail sentence if she pleaded guilty. ""There is no sentence I can impose which could begin to put it right. There is nothing she can do to ever put it right,"" the judge said. Judge Joseph added that the impact on the family ""must be devastating and never ending"". Kaya and Graham will be sentenced on Friday.

US child detention images disturbing - May,"This video can not be played Theresa May: US child detention ""disturbing"" and ""wrong"" Theresa May has condemned the forced separation of migrant children from their parents at the US-Mexico border, but dismissed calls to cancel President Donald Trump's visit to the UK. The PM said the images of children being kept in what look like cages was ""deeply disturbing"" and ""wrong"". But she said Mr Trump's visit next month should go ahead to ensure ""shared interests"" could be discussed. Where she disagreed on something, she would tell Mr Trump, Mrs May insisted. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Trump official booed at Mexican restaurant She was challenged on the issue at Prime Minister's Questions by the SNP's Ian Blackford and a host of Labour MPs, including former leader Ed Miliband. Mrs May said she was ""clearly, wholly and unequivocally"" clear that she disagreed with the policy. ""On what we have seen in the United States, pictures of children being held in what appear to be cages are deeply disturbing,"" she said. This video can not be played The sound of migrant children separated from parents ""This is not something that we agree with, this is not the United Kingdom's approach."" But she said the UK had a ""long and enduring special relationship"" with the US and Mr Trump's visit next month was an opportunity to raise a range of issues. Republicans scramble amid border crisis Why the US is separating migrant children from their parents What is Donald Trump's family-separation endgame? The Republican-controlled Congress is under pressure to change the border policy, following widespread condemnation. But the president says it is necessary to stop illegal border crossings. The ""zero-tolerance"" policy - brought in by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month - means that adults who try to cross the border, many planning to seek asylum, are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As a result, hundreds of minors are now being housed in detention centres, and kept away from their parents. Children walking between tents at the Tornillo camp in Texas On Tuesday, Mr Trump said children had to be taken away if their parents were jailed for illegally crossing the US border. ""When you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally - which should happen - you have to take the children away,"" he said. US immigration officials say 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 parents between 5 May and 9 June. Babies and toddlers have been sent to three ""tender age"" shelters after being separated from their parents, the Associated Press news agency reported. Doctors and lawyers who visited the shelters described the infants as hysterical, crying, and acting out,external, according to the AP report. Mr Trump is due to visit the UK on Friday, 13 July.

Heineken beer hit by COâ supply shortage,"Supplies of meat, chicken and beer are facing disruption by the an industry-wide shortage of carbon dioxide. At least five CO2 producers in northern Europe are offline for maintenance,according to the publication Gasworld,external. CO2 is used in the guns used to kill animals, as well as providing the fizz in carbonated drinks and being crucial to propelling beer from bar pumps. Meat producers have asked the government to prioritise their need for the gas above those of other users. Seasonal maintenance shutdowns have left the UK with only one big CO2 producer in action. Gasworld, which first raised the issue, said carbonated drinks producers were now ""desperate"" amid the worst CO2 supply crisis for decades. The Grocer magazine has also reported stark warnings from the British Poultry Council (BPC) that up to 60% of poultry processing plants could be knocked out ""within days"" as a result of the CO2 shortage. CO2 is used to stun and ultimately suffocate poultry in many slaughterhouses. BPC chief executive, Richard Griffiths, said that with the supply of CO2 tightened across Europe, the British Poultry Council was  calling on the government and major gas producers to ""prioritise supplies to slaughterhouses and keep the food chain moving"". The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said it was asking officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to prioritise meat producers when finding back-up supplies of CO2. BMPA deputy director Fiona Steiger said: ""Supply is running out and it's pretty tight for some people. ""We don't know when supplies will be back up. We've been told it could be about a month."" Heineken's John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel kegs have been already been hit. Heineken said it was ""working with customers to minimise disruption"". ""We've been informed by our CO2 supplier that they are facing a major issue with supply availability in the UK,"" Heineken confirmed in a statement. Wetherspoons pub chain said that while it had not had any supply issues yet, ""that is likely to change in the coming days, and it's not likely to get any better. ""There might be some products we don't have available and if it affects Wetherspoons, then it will affect everyone else."" The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents brewers and 20,000 UK pubs, said the CO2 shortage was beginning to cause stoppages in beer production, although it did not name specific companies. As much as 82% of beer consumed in the UK is produced here, requiring carbon dioxide, according to Brigid Simmonds, head of the BBPA. Demand for beer and fizzy drinks is peaking as fans gather to watch the football, thanks to the recent run of hot weather. Carbon dioxide doesn't just put the fizz into soft drinks, canned and bottled beers. It also delivers beer at the pub pumps and is additionally used to pack fresh meat and salads. It comes from ammonia plants that manufacture fertiliser. But as demand for fertiliser peaks in winter, manufacturers often shut down during the summer for maintenance work. This video can not be played Are we in for a beer shortage this summer? The BBPA has issued some guidance to its members reminding them that CO2 used in drinks, including for dispensing beer at the pumps, must be food grade CO2. ""We'd be concerned this is not the time to go looking for a white van man who says they can supply you with CO2,"" she said. Gavin Partington, director general at the British Soft Drinks Association, said soft drinks producers were ""taking active steps to maintain their service to customers"". Coca Cola European Partners' spokesperson said it was currently able to fulfil orders to customers and was working with suppliers, partners and customers ""on a number of solutions"". The UK is particularly hard hit by the shortages, according to Gasworld, because only one major CO2 plant is still operating and imports from the European mainland have been affected by shutdowns in northern Europe. The UK is a large market for carbon dioxide and imports about a third of its CO2 needs. It has a vast range of applications in industry, with one of the main uses being the manufacture of dry ice to chill airline meals. The UK has a number of plants that produce CO2, but three of the four largest are currently down for maintenance or technical reasons. Carbon dioxide has a range of uses including packaging fresh food Gasworld said the heatwave in May had boosted demand for fizzy drinks across northern Europe at a time when ammonia plants producing CO2 as a by-product were closed. The current low price of ammonia meant producers were not restarting production quickly. Carbon dioxide production also comes from bioethanol plants, and as a by-product from whisky distilleries in Scotland. But these tend to be on a smaller scale and one UK bioethanol plant is also currently closed. While there were ready supplies of carbon dioxide in southern Europe, including Hungary and Romania, transporting it to northern Europe required specialist pressurised transport, Gasworld said.

Appeal to find 'silly' 1989 cancer nurse,"Liz Brown's appeal to find nurse Debbie (right) has been shared more than 1,000 times A woman has appealed for help to track down the nurse who did ""silly things"" to make having cancer as a teenager ""less painful"" 30 years ago. Liz Brown spent four months of 1989 in Addenbrooke's Hospital, Cambridge, with aggressive osteoblastoma after waking up paralysed on her 14th birthday. She said one nurse, Debbie, would give her jobs to do and ""take the mick out of her"" to ease her time in hospital. Ms Brown's Twitter appeal has been retweeted,externalmore than 1,000 times. Addenbrooke's Hospital has said it is putting an appeal in its daily newsletter to see if anyone can help with identifying Debbie. Liz Brown had to learn to walk again after her cancer diagnosis Ms Brown, originally from Peterborough, said that after being taken to hospital with the spinal tumour she was placed on a children's ward. ""[Debbie] saw how hard I found it being on that ward with 14-year-old hormones flying around and being told pretty much that I was going to die,"" she added ""She would give me jobs to do and take the mick out of me. She gave me a job as a postman so I could deliver post to the adult patients, silly things like that to make it less painful than it could be."" Liz Brown was not expected to live more than five years Ms Brown, who now lives in East Riding, had to learn to walk again and was given the all-clear from the osteoblastoma near her neck five years later. She said Debbie inspired her own career in support work and wants to track her down to say ""thank you and what she did for me"". ""My prognosis was very poor. I wasn't expected to live more than five years, but now I'm 43 with three children and there's not a wheelchair in sight.

Trump plans to halt migrant separationsThe Department of Homeland Security has reportedly drafted an executive order to curb the policy.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""You're going to have a lot of very happy people"" US President Donald Trump has bowed to public pressure and signed an executive order promising to ""keep families together"" in migrant detentions. Mr Trump reversed his own policy amid international fury over the separation of undocumented parents and children. He said he had been swayed by images of children who have been taken from parents while they are jailed and prosecuted for illegal border-crossing. But the order does not address families already separated by the policy. US immigration officials say 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 parents between 5 May and 9 June. ""It's about keeping families together,"" Mr Trump said at the signing ceremony on Wednesday. ""I did not like the sight of families being separated,"" he said, but added the administration would continue its ""zero tolerance policy"" of criminally prosecuting anyone who crosses the border illegally.

Trump's blame game on separating families Theexecutive order,externalcalls for: Immigrant families to be detained together while their legal cases are considered Expediting immigration cases involving families Requesting the modification of a court ruling that dictates how long immigrant children can be detained The president said his wife, Melania, and daughter, Ivanka, who reportedly have been applying pressure on him to drop the policy, ""feel strongly"" about ending the practice of separating migrant families. ""I think anybody with a heart would feel very strongly about it,"" he said. ""We don't like to see families separated."" Vice-President Mike Pence and Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, who has emerged as the face of the White House policy, were both present for the signing of the order on Wednesday. This video can not be played US youth shelter worker quit after being ordered to separate siblings Before his U-turn on Wednesday the president had previously said ""you can't do it through an executive order"", insisting that only Congress could fix the policy by passing immigration reform. Republican congressional leader Paul Ryan said the House of Representatives will vote on Thursday ""on legislation to keep families together"". A series of White House contradictions on migrants Fenced enclosures hold migrant children He did not immediately provide details of the bill, but said it resolves the issue of so-called Dreamers, undocumented adult migrants who entered the US as children, ""in a very elegant way"". Analysis by Anthony Zurcher,BBC News, Washington For days administration officials have insisted they were simply following the law as written and their ""zero tolerance"" policy for illegal border crossings meant they ""have to take the children away"", in the president's words. Critics have countered that Mr Trump unilaterally created the situation that produced the heart-rending accounts of children separated from their parents, and he could unilaterally fix it. By taking executive action, the president is effectively acknowledging they were correct. Now the fight will probably move to the courts, with legal challenges to the administration's decision to hold detained families together while their immigration status is adjudicated. That is more politically hospitable ground for Republicans, who already face challenging mid-term congressional elections. Read more of Anthony Zurcher's analysis In April, the US attorney general announced a ""zero-tolerance"" policy to criminally charge and jail undocumented border crossers. As children cannot legally be jailed with their parents, they are kept in separate facilities. US immigration officials say more than 2,300 children have been taken from some 2,200 parents since 5 May. This video can not be played The sound of migrant children separated from parents Pictures of dozens of children sleeping in fenced enclosures and audio of them crying emerged in recent days, provoking widespread criticism. Under previous US administrations, immigrants caught crossing the border for the first time tended to be issued with court summonses and released. Six American airlines have told the Trump administration not to use their aircraft to transport child migrants who have been separated from their parents. Alaska, American, Delta, Frontier, Southwest and United airlines all said the policy contravened their values. Holding cells:They are first detained at Customs and Border Protection (CBP) facilities, where chain-link fenced enclosures are used, though the children can only be legally held there for three days. Detention centres:They are then supposed to be moved to one of around 100 detention centres run through the Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR), part of the Department of Health and Human Services. US officials recently showed reporters around a converted Walmart Supercenter in Texas which was housing migrant boys aged 10-17. They apparently had access to beds, classes and games. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart in Texas ""Tender age shelters"":AP news agency reports that babies and toddlers are being taken to three ""tender age shelters"" in southern Texas. A CBP official said it is up to the discretion of border agents whether to detain ""tender-aged"" children, who are typically less than five years old. Tentcamps:US officials have set up a tent camp for migrant children in Tornillo, Texas. Family members:Under US law, the children are meant to be released to stay with relatives or foster carers ""without delay"". In practice, the ORR says this process takesabout two months,external. How aretheyreunited?Immigrations and Customs Enforcement (ICE) has set up a hotline for parents to call after they are released from custody. However, a former ICE director has said some family separations are ""permanent"". This video can not be played The US teens training in border patrol Mr Trump's order says that families could remain together in detention instead of separating children from parents illegally crossing into the country. But immigrant children are only allowed to be held for 20 days, according to a 21-year-old landmark court decision known as the Flores agreement. The order also calls for the justice department to request to modify the Flores agreement to allow children to be held longer, but it is unclear what will happen if the law does not change. This video can not be played The missing - consequences of Trump's immigration crackdown The Trump administration is likely to become tangled in legal battles with immigration activists on behalf of detained migrants if it is unable to overturn the Flores agreement before the 20-day deadline. ""This is a stopgap measure,"" said Gene Hamilton, counsel to Attorney General Jeff Sessions. The order also did not provide any date or timeline on when it would be implemented and does not address how the more than 2,000 children already stripped from their families would be reunited. Health and Human Services (HHS) Secretary Alex Azar has said his department will begin working to return detained immigrant children to their families, but did not give a timeline. A top HHS official told Agence France-Presse on Tuesday they have no system in place to do so. US child detention pics 'disturbing' - May.

Benetton criticised for migrant images,"The photo by German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e that is being used in Benetton's ad campaign Italian clothing firm United Colors of Benetton has been criticised after launching a controversial advertising campaign featuring images of migrants rescued from the Mediterranean. The ads show migrants in life jackets accompanied by volunteers this month. The charity behind the rescue, SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e, condemned Benetton for using pictures of ""people in distress"". Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini later tweeted: ""Am I the only one to find this despicable?"" The ads, which appeared online and in Italian newspaper La Repubblica, feature two separate images captured on 9 June by German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e as part of what became the rescue of hundreds of migrants.

""SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e fully dissociates itself from this campaign, which displays a picture taken while our teams were rescuing people in distress at sea,"" the charity said in a statement posted on Twitter on Tuesday. Benetton has not yet responded to the comments. Mr Salvini, who leads the right-wing populist League party, refused to allow the ship which rescued the migrants permission to dock at Italy's ports. Salvini shuts ports to migrant rescue ship Reality Check: Claims about migrants in Italy Who is responsible for providing helping at sea? The ship, the Aquarius, was also turned away by Malta but it and other ships were later permitted to dock at the Spanish port of Valencia. Mr Salvini promised during Italy's recent general election to take a tough stance against migration. Italy is the main entry point for migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe. The Benetton advertising campaign was designed by controversial Italian photographer Oliviero Toscani who said the images were ""dramatic"", adding that Mr Salvini's criticism ""makes me realise I'm right"". Toscani, who left Benetton in 2000 but returned in February this year, has been behind several divisive ads for the clothing company since the 1980s. Italian photographer Oliviero Toscani said he was right to use the images He has said that his campaigns, which have touched on subjects such as human rights, religion and racism, are designed to raise awareness of certain issues. In 1991, Toscani offended Italy's Roman Catholic Church by using an image showing a priest and a nun kissing. The following year, the photographer was criticised over the use of a picture of gay activist and Aids victim David Kirby as he lay ill in a hospital bed. Some of the worst advertising fails Then in 1996, Toscani produced an ad showing three ""human"" hearts alongside one another with the words white, black and yellow placed on each of the organs. He lost his position at Benetton in 2000 after the company was forced to apologise over a campaign labelled ""We, On Death Row"", which used photographs of prisoners sentenced to death in the US.

"Disney improves bid for Murdoch's FoxDisney has raised its offer for 21st Century Fox to $71.3bn in cash and shares, from a $52bn all-stock offer.Business","Disney has increased its offer for 21st Century Fox to $71.3bn in cash and shares, up from an earlier $52bn offer. The move values Fox at $38 a share, some $10 higher than Disney's first offer in December. Disney is locked in a battle with US media conglomerate Comcast, which has offered $65bn in cash for Fox. ""The acquisition of 21st Century Fox will bring significant financial value to the shareholders of both companies,"" said Disney boss Robert Iger. Both Disney and Comcast are vying for Fox's entertainment assets, including movie studio, cable channels, National Geographic, a 30% stake in video website Hulu, and Indian network Star. The pair are also separately battling over European news broadcaster Sky News. Fox would retain some successful outlets, including Fox Sports, Fox News, Fox Television Stations and other assets, and mould them into a new company called ""New Fox"". The fight for 21st Century Fox comes as traditional media groups scramble to consolidate in the face of mounting competition from online challengers like Netflix and Amazon. It has driven broadcast giant CBS to try to merge with Viacom, which owns the MTV and Nickelodeon television stations. It also spurred AT&T's takeover of Time Warner, whose assets include pay TV channel HBO. The improved offer from Disney came as 21st Century Fox's board was set to decide whether to back Comcast's bid for assets that include Fox's film and television studios and international businesses. Fox said it would now allow shareholders to evaluate Disney's amended offer. Disney's latest offer is ""superior"" to the proposal made by Comcast, Fox added in a statement. Any takeover by either Disney or Comcast would be likely to face regulatory scrutiny. The US Department of Justice may have recently lost in its battle to block a merger between Time Warner and telecoms giant AT&Tm, but that does not mean there may not be antitrust concerns in this case. As mentioned, running alongside the main battle for Fox, there is jousting over Sky. 21st Century Fox wants to buy the remaining proportion of Sky that it does not already own. Meanwhile, Comcast has bid $31bn for Sky. And Disney has also agreed to a deal in principle to acquire the Sky News network from Fox,  should the latter be successful in obtaining full ownership of Sky. Culture Secretary Matt Hancock recently cleared Fox's bid for full ownership of Sky - with the condition that the news channel is then sold to Walt Disney or another party. On Tuesday, Mr Hancock announced that should Disney be successful in acquiring Sky News, then the news network would continue to operate and be guaranteed funding for at least 15 years. That is up from the previous 10 year period. In addition, he said Disney would have to get permission from the government if it wanted to sell the channel during that period.

Heineken beer hit by CO2 supply shortage,"Supplies of meat, chicken and beer are facing disruption by the an industry-wide shortage of carbon dioxide. At least five CO2 producers in northern Europe are offline for maintenance,according to the publication Gasworld,external. CO2 is used in the guns used to kill animals, as well as providing the fizz in carbonated drinks and being crucial to propelling beer from bar pumps. Meat producers have asked the government to prioritise their need for the gas above those of other users. Seasonal maintenance shutdowns have left the UK with only one big CO2 producer in action. Gasworld, which first raised the issue, said carbonated drinks producers were now ""desperate"" amid the worst CO2 supply crisis for decades. The Grocer magazine has also reported stark warnings from the British Poultry Council (BPC) that up to 60% of poultry processing plants could be knocked out ""within days"" as a result of the CO2 shortage. CO2 is used to stun and ultimately suffocate poultry in many slaughterhouses. BPC chief executive, Richard Griffiths, said that with the supply of CO2 tightened across Europe, the British Poultry Council was  calling on the government and major gas producers to ""prioritise supplies to slaughterhouses and keep the food chain moving"". The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said it was asking officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to prioritise meat producers when finding back-up supplies of CO2. BMPA deputy director Fiona Steiger said: ""Supply is running out and it's pretty tight for some people. ""We don't know when supplies will be back up. We've been told it could be about a month."" Heineken's John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel kegs have been already been hit. Heineken said it was ""working with customers to minimise disruption"". ""We've been informed by our CO2 supplier that they are facing a major issue with supply availability in the UK,"" Heineken confirmed in a statement. Wetherspoons pub chain said that while it had not had any supply issues yet, ""that is likely to change in the coming days, and it's not likely to get any better. ""There might be some products we don't have available and if it affects Wetherspoons, then it will affect everyone else."" The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents brewers and 20,000 UK pubs, said the CO2 shortage was beginning to cause stoppages in beer production, although it did not name specific companies. As much as 82% of beer consumed in the UK is produced here, requiring carbon dioxide, according to Brigid Simmonds, head of the BBPA. Demand for beer and fizzy drinks is peaking as fans gather to watch the football, thanks to the recent run of hot weather. Carbon dioxide doesn't just put the fizz into soft drinks, canned and bottled beers. It also delivers beer at the pub pumps and is additionally used to pack fresh meat and salads. It comes from ammonia plants that manufacture fertiliser. But as demand for fertiliser peaks in winter, manufacturers often shut down during the summer for maintenance work. This video can not be played Are we in for a beer shortage this summer? The BBPA has issued some guidance to its members reminding them that CO2 used in drinks, including for dispensing beer at the pumps, must be food grade CO2. ""We'd be concerned this is not the time to go looking for a white van man who says they can supply you with CO2,"" she said. Gavin Partington, director general at the British Soft Drinks Association, said soft drinks producers were ""taking active steps to maintain their service to customers"". Coca Cola European Partners' spokesperson said it was currently able to fulfil orders to customers and was working with suppliers, partners and customers ""on a number of solutions"". The UK is particularly hard hit by the shortages, according to Gasworld, because only one major CO2 plant is still operating and imports from the European mainland have been affected by shutdowns in northern Europe. The UK is a large market for carbon dioxide and imports about a third of its CO2 needs. It has a vast range of applications in industry, with one of the main uses being the manufacture of dry ice to chill airline meals. The UK has a number of plants that produce CO2, but three of the four largest are currently down for maintenance or technical reasons. Carbon dioxide has a range of uses including packaging fresh food Gasworld said the heatwave in May had boosted demand for fizzy drinks across northern Europe at a time when ammonia plants producing CO2 as a by-product were closed. The current low price of ammonia meant producers were not restarting production quickly. Carbon dioxide production also comes from bioethanol plants, and as a by-product from whisky distilleries in Scotland. But these tend to be on a smaller scale and one UK bioethanol plant is also currently closed. While there were ready supplies of carbon dioxide in southern Europe, including Hungary and Romania, transporting it to northern Europe required specialist pressurised transport, Gasworld said.

'Grenfell two' looms if cladding not banned,"Natasha Elcock, who escaped Grenfell Tower, called for the cladding to be banned straight away Another disaster like the Grenfell Tower fire is looming if the government does not act to ban combustible cladding, survivors have said. Speaking to MPs on the housing select committee, they warned ""Grenfell two is in the post"" while it stays in use. Cladding on the tower is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire during the blaze on 14 June 2017. The government is consulting on a proposed ban but survivor Natasha Elcock told MPs: ""We shouldn't wait."" The chairman of the committee, Clive Betts, said Ms Elcock and other former Grenfell residents who had accepted the invitation to speak to the committee at the House of Commons, had delivered a ""very powerful message"" to government. A total of 72 people died as a result of fire in west London. Cladding ban considered after Grenfell Tests show scale of fire safety problem Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Ms Elcock, who escaped from the 11th floor of Grenfell Tower, was giving evidence to the committee as a representative of Grenfell United, the official organisation for the bereaved families of the fire, as well as as those residents who survived. Asked what her message was to the government on the cladding, she said: ""I think it should be banned. ""No-one should go through what we've gone through, absolutely not, but also no-one should go to sleep at night knowing they've got combustible cladding wrapped round their building."" Cladding has been removed from some tower blocks in the country, but has not been banned She said that while she understood some things needed to be consulted on, ""things are not happening quick enough"", adding: ""It has been a year - a year - and it is quite evident there was something really wrong with what was put on that building. ""Our world was turned upside down 12 months ago and as survivors and a bereaved community, we shouldn't be fighting for what is right for other people. ""We will if we have to, but we shouldn't have to. It should be banned and it should be banned now. We shouldn't wait."" The first anniversary of the fire was marked earlier this month Edward Daffarn, who lived on the 16th floor of the tower,had written a blog six months before the blaze warning of the risk. Also representing Grenfell United, he told the committee: ""There are 300 buildings with this cladding on... [it] is a disgrace. ""Grenfell two is in the post unless you act and act quickly. The government needs to take responsibility for this, step in, end people's misery, end people's fear and act."" Jacqui Haynes, who chairs the Lancaster West Residents' Association and lived next to the tower, added: ""We are all sitting here, knowing the potential of those materials, knowing after the disaster what the possibilities are, and therefore we are all culpable sitting here with that knowledge. ""How can that be? How is that a discussion?"" Jacqui Haynes, who lived next to the tower, said those who knew the risks were ""culpable"" if another fire happened Mr Daffarn also told the committee of a ""vast chasm of mistrust"" between the residents and Kensington and Chelsea Council. Sophie Earnshaw, from the North Kensington Law Centre, said the council ""had a chance to remedy this"", but instead they put ""a lot of pressure"" on survivors who felt they had to accept unsuitable offers of accommodation after the fire. The councilpromised all affected residents would be provided with a permanent homewithin a year. However, of those 203 households, around 20 still do not have a permanent home. Tomassina Hessel, also of the Lancaster West Residents' Association, said the community were ""made to look ungrateful"" for turning down homes, when actually they were not suitable - including homes with views of the tower, flats on high levels and properties that had not had fire risk assessments. Edward Daffarn blogged about the fire risks at Grenfell Tower before the blaze Leader of the council, Elizabeth Campbell, later gave evidence to the committee and said 90% of people had accepted permanent homes - showing they felt those properties were suitable. She told MPs: ""We have really tried to give people a choice. It is not just a property, it is a home. ""We have tried to personalise it, but that has taken time. ""What we don't want to happen is for someone to feel they are forced or pushed."" She added: ""We absolutely do care, we are totally committed to working with everyoneâ¦ and we are committed to getting people houses as quickly as possible."" The public inquiry into the firecontinued in central London earlier, with an expert saying the disaster was unlike any other flat fire because the flames spread in all directions. Professor Luke Bisbytold the inquiry that previous tall building fires abroad saw the flames going upwards, but at Grenfell, they spread both horizontally and downward. He also said he believed the fire escaped from the kitchen of a flat on the fourth floor through a side window, before catching on the plastic at the rear of cladding panels, which were installed as part of a refurbishment to the tower. He said he had identified a cavity behind cladding on the pillars which allowed fire to race to its top in less than 30 minutes.

May sees off Tory Brexit vote rebellion,"This video can not be played Liam Fox tells Laura Kuenssberg rebels have not changed Brexit stance The government's Brexit bill has passed through Parliament after Theresa May saw off a revolt by Tory MPs. Peers accepted the amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sent to them from the House of Commons, meaning the bill now goes for Royal Assent, becoming law. Earlier, the government won the vote 319 to 303, after assurances were accepted by would-be rebels that MPs would have a meaningful say. The PM called it a ""crucial step"" in delivering a ""smooth"" Brexit. Mrs May said: ""Today's votes show people in the UK, and to the EU, that the elected representatives in this country are getting on with the job, and delivering on the will of the British people. ""Over the next few weeks we will publish more details of our proposed future relationship with the EU in a White Paper, and will bring the Trade and Customs Bills back to the House of Commons. ""But today has been an important step in delivering the Brexit people voted for, a Brexit that gives Britain a brighter future, a Britain in control of its money, laws, and borders."" Who really backed down over Brexit vote? Can Theresa May 'take back control'? Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Before the Commons vote, Dominic Grieve, leader of the would-be rebels - who wanted to ensure MPs had the power to stop the UK leaving without a deal - said the ""sovereignty of Parliament"" had been acknowledged. Both sides have claimed victory with Stephen Hammond, a pro-EU MP who eventually sided with the government, suggesting ministers had agreed to give Parliament a ""real say"" on top of other concessions. But international trade secretary Liam Fox said nothing had really changed and the option of a no-deal Brexit had been left firmly on the table. ""There is no change to the fundamental issue here which is the government cannot be forced by Parliament to negotiate something which it does not want to do,"" he told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. He said the government had ""to be able to hold out in our negotiations the prospect of no deal"" otherwise the EU would get the upper hand. On Wednesday evening, following the Commons vote, Leader of the Lords Baroness Evans of Bowes Park said the EU (Withdrawal) Bill had been ""debated at length"" and was very different as a result of amendments tabled by the Lords. ""I believe our role now is to accept their view as expressed in a vote a few hours ago,"" she said. Peers approved the government's proposal without a vote. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 and negotiations have been taking place over the terms of its departure. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch. It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to. And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM. The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts. Read more from Laura The government has been at odds with the House of Lords in the long-running row over what happens if the UK cannot reach a deal with the EU, or if MPs reject whatever deal the government agrees with the EU. The Commons vote had been expected to be tight and the government eventually prevailed by a majority of 16. Six Tory MPs - Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen, Antoinette Sandbach and Phillip Lee - rebelled while four Labour MPs backed the government and six other Labour MPs abstained, as did Kelvin Hopkins, who sits as an independent after having the whip withdrawn. Ms Wollaston tweeted that she was disappointed with the outcome. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Lords is expected to finally approve the EU Withdrawal Bill on Wednesday The debate centred on what happens in three Brexit scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal If Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached If 21 January passes with no deal being struck. Under these circumstances, the government has said, a minister will make a statement in Parliament, setting out the proposed next steps. MPs will then vote on this statement. According to the government, this vote should be ""on neutral terms"", with MPs simply noting what has been said. But an amendment backed by the House of Lords on Monday went further, saying MPs should have to ""approve"" the minister's statement. The Department for Exiting the European Union has now conceded that it will be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide the matter at the time. The government statement that Mr Grieve has accepted Speaking in the Commons, Dominic Grieve said the issue of the meaningful vote was about giving ""assurances to the House and many, many people in the country who are worried about this process and how it will end"". If Parliament wished to ""speak with one voice"" and exert its influence in the face of a non-deal scenario, it ""has the power to do it"". Mr Grieve said he had insisted on a key paragraph in the government statement accepting ""it is open to MPs to table motions and debate matters of concern and that, as is the convention, parliamentary time will be provided for this"". Another potential rebel Nicky Morgan said she did not wish to see Mrs May ""destabilised or undermined"" ahead of next week's summit of EU leaders. But she warned of further battles to come over the UK's trade and customs arrangements with the EU and suggested relationships between MPs had been ""strained almost beyond belief"". Please upgrade your browser And Conservative MP Vicky Ford, another pro-European MP who stuck with the government, said the outcome was ""not a mandate for a no-deal Brexit"". She said MPs had secured a ""backstop"" which meant if Parliament rejected the deal it could trigger ""another set of negotiations"" between the UK and EU aimed at getting an agreement before the UK left.

Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament Universities minister Sam Gyimah says the government recognises that ""the programme has played an important role in achieving some tremendous outcomes"". He says he's pleased the UK will continue to participate until the end of 2020, and says that the continued participation ""is a matter of future negotiations"". The government has ""made the EU very aware of the UK's desire to continue in the programme"" and are looking very closely at the options of continuing ""as a third country for a fair contribution"". Mr Gyimah agrees that value for money is vital and says discussion needs to be based on an assessment of UK priorities. ""We will ensure the UK secures the best deal."" Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament Shadow education minister Gordon Marsden says that education programmes like this help with social mobility, something which he says the government claims they want to address. He says ""it is still very unclear"" what will happen after the programme ends in 2020. ""We continue to believe that it is imperative that future involvement in this programme is on the agenda,"" he says. He says that education and culture ministers should be around the negotiating tables debating the future of this programme. The Russell Group has said that it will likely be less costly to maintain membership of it, rather than universities trying to replicate their own schemes, he adds. Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Kirsty Blackman suggests to Huw Merriman that ""of course the costs will double if the participants double"" and the benefits increase as well. She says the UK needs to continue it's links with Europe however it can after Brexit, and the Erasmus+ is a huge opportunity for that. ""We need to make clear how strong our interest is in this continuing...the more the government can do to state that case, the better for our students, our universities and for our communities."" Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament A series of Conservative MPs step up to share their support for the scheme, with Vicky Ford, who declares an interest of having helped ""put the plus on Erasmus+"", enthusing about the benefits. Erasmus graduates are 44% more likely than others to be in management roles in 10 years time, she says. Rachel Maclean quotes her own son's enthusiastic words, and Huw Merriman says he shares the same passion for the ability of students to learn from abroad. Mr Merriman does say however that he is concerned by the rising costs, which have doubled, and suggests it is a clear example of how people have fallen out of love with the European project. Ms Ford intervenes to defend the spending. Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle is now opening a debate on the future of the Erasmus+ programme, which allows young people to study across Europe and is not guaranteed to continue after Brexit. Support for the scheme, he says, cuts across political parties and across the Brexit debate. Mr Russell-Moyle, who worked towards establishing and running the current scheme before becoming an MP, suggests MPs are united by a deep concern at the lack of full commitment to it's future by the government. Uncertainty over the scheme's future, he says, ""puts at risk the future existence of one of this country's most successful exports - higher education."" PM tweets Allow Twitter content?

Armed forces reserves House of LordsParliament Conservative Lord De Mauley opens the debate on the contribution of the Armed Forces reserves by speaking of his own time in the Territorial Army during the Wilson government. He gives a history of the changing fortunes of the reserve forces, and then speaks of the challenges they are now facing. Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes says the government has done a great deal of work to enable civil society to play an increased role in the resettlement of refugees. She gives one example of where Â£1m has been given to a group working to support refugees and assist their integration. Indeed, she says, many in society are ""well placed to wrap their arms around"" resettled refugees. This week, she says, she spoke with a group of US teenagers and expressed her dismay at the treatment of children at the hands of Trump's government. She was pleased that they shared her response. Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament Shadow Home Office Minister Afzal Khan says that while the prime minister has been right to criticise President Donald Trump over the US's treatment of immigrant children, her government follows similar policies. The government must halt their approach of making the lives of refugees and asylum seekers so awful that they don't want to come to the UK, he says - as if so-called ""pull factors"" were what caused them to flee their homes and there weren't enough ""push factors"" in the first place. UK future trade relations House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Whitty, who echoes Baroness McIntosh of Pickering in stressing the importance of this debate, expresses surprise that he is the only backbencher wishing to speak. He looks back to his younger days, when even then the ""far left circles"" he spent time were filled with constant disagreement over the benefits of a world trade. There is now no universal support for free trade, he suggests, such is the frustration. It's not just world trade that has problems, he says, suggesting that when the world order is blamed rather than the government then ""democracy is in a bit of a mess"". The rise of populism, which he describes as ""an idea the lower orders find attractive and the elites deplore"", is understandable in this situation, and he says it raises questions over whether World Trade Organisation rules are working. ""We may need to rethink."" BBC journalist tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK future trade relations House of LordsParliament Baroness McIntosh of Pickering is opening a debate on the UK's future trade relations following the failure to reach an agreement at the G7 Summit in Canada, which the prime minister described as ""difficult"" with ""strong consequences"". She warns the UK faces many economic challenges following the introduction of high tariffs by the US, combined with the decision to leave the EU, and asks how we will replace the huge existing EU markets we currently access when no obvious alternatives exist. ""No matter how difficult we might think our relations and negotiations with the EU have been, future negotiations with the World Trade Organisations may be far worse."" Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament The SNP's immigration and asylum spokesperson Stuart C. McDonald says that the current system ""is not fit for purpose"" and too many decisions are made incorrectly. He says that by encouraging safe passage, the UK would undermine traffickers who help people travel illegally. He says there is little evidence to show that children are often sent ahead to make it legal for the rest of the family to join. Denmark and the UK are the only countries which have restrictions on family reunions, he states. He used to be an immigration solicitor, and he says with his knowledge of the system, legal aid for family reunions is necessary. EU Citizens Statement House of LordsParliament Baroness Williams of Trafford has repeated the statement made in the House of Commons outlining the new EU citizen settlement scheme for those that wish to remain in the UK after Brexit. Labour spokesperson Lord Rosser in response asks what restrictions there will be on those that take up the scheme, as well as how many are expected to to take up the option. He says the government must have a clear view of what it expects from the EU in terms of UK citizens in the EU after Brexit, warning some comments made today would not be helpful in negotiations. He warns the government to remember its previous failings, mentioning the Windrush scandal, and to ensure it does not repeat such mistakes. He asks further questions around staffing and funding, and also what will happen if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He says he would accept a written response to his questions if preferred. Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament Angus MacNeil says that people all over the country have been proven to be welcoming to refugee families who move into their area. In Canterbury, an area of the south east which he says the tabloids frequently portray as overcrowded, has an excellent record of taking in refugee children. He says he is ""lost"" between the idea of ""stupidity and evil"" at the current situation of children in the United States being separated from their parents when they're accused of trying to get into the country illegally.

He says that education and culture ministers should be around the negotiating tables debating the future of this programme. The Russell Group has said that it will likely be less costly to maintain membership of it, rather than universities trying to replicate their own schemes, he adds. Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Kirsty Blackman suggests to Huw Merriman that ""of course the costs will double if the participants double"" and the benefits increase as well. She says the UK needs to continue it's links with Europe however it can after Brexit, and the Erasmus+ is a huge opportunity for that. ""We need to make clear how strong our interest is in this continuing...the more the government can do to state that case, the better for our students, our universities and for our communities."" Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament A series of Conservative MPs step up to share their support for the scheme, with Vicky Ford, who declares an interest of having helped ""put the plus on Erasmus+"", enthusing about the benefits. Erasmus graduates are 44% more likely than others to be in management roles in 10 years time, she says. Rachel Maclean quotes her own son's enthusiastic words, and Huw Merriman says he shares the same passion for the ability of students to learn from abroad. Mr Merriman does say however that he is concerned by the rising costs, which have doubled, and suggests it is a clear example of how people have fallen out of love with the European project. Ms Ford intervenes to defend the spending. Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle is now opening a debate on the future of the Erasmus+ programme, which allows young people to study across Europe and is not guaranteed to continue after Brexit. Support for the scheme, he says, cuts across political parties and across the Brexit debate. Mr Russell-Moyle, who worked towards establishing and running the current scheme before becoming an MP, suggests MPs are united by a deep concern at the lack of full commitment to it's future by the government. Uncertainty over the scheme's future, he says, ""puts at risk the future existence of one of this country's most successful exports - higher education."" PM tweets Allow Twitter content?

Armed forces reserves House of LordsParliament Conservative Lord De Mauley opens the debate on the contribution of the Armed Forces reserves by speaking of his own time in the Territorial Army during the Wilson government. He gives a history of the changing fortunes of the reserve forces, and then speaks of the challenges they are now facing. Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes says the government has done a great deal of work to enable civil society to play an increased role in the resettlement of refugees. She gives one example of where Â£1m has been given to a group working to support refugees and assist their integration. Indeed, she says, many in society are ""well placed to wrap their arms around"" resettled refugees. This week, she says, she spoke with a group of US teenagers and expressed her dismay at the treatment of children at the hands of Trump's government. She was pleased that they shared her response. Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament Shadow Home Office Minister Afzal Khan says that while the prime minister has been right to criticise President Donald Trump over the US's treatment of immigrant children, her government follows similar policies. The government must halt their approach of making the lives of refugees and asylum seekers so awful that they don't want to come to the UK, he says - as if so-called ""pull factors"" were what caused them to flee their homes and there weren't enough ""push factors"" in the first place. UK future trade relations House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Whitty, who echoes Baroness McIntosh of Pickering in stressing the importance of this debate, expresses surprise that he is the only backbencher wishing to speak. He looks back to his younger days, when even then the ""far left circles"" he spent time were filled with constant disagreement over the benefits of a world trade. There is now no universal support for free trade, he suggests, such is the frustration. It's not just world trade that has problems, he says, suggesting that when the world order is blamed rather than the government then ""democracy is in a bit of a mess"". The rise of populism, which he describes as ""an idea the lower orders find attractive and the elites deplore"", is understandable in this situation, and he says it raises questions over whether World Trade Organisation rules are working. ""We may need to rethink."" BBC journalist tweets Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK future trade relations House of LordsParliament Baroness McIntosh of Pickering is opening a debate on the UK's future trade relations following the failure to reach an agreement at the G7 Summit in Canada, which the prime minister described as ""difficult"" with ""strong consequences"". She warns the UK faces many economic challenges following the introduction of high tariffs by the US, combined with the decision to leave the EU, and asks how we will replace the huge existing EU markets we currently access when no obvious alternatives exist. ""No matter how difficult we might think our relations and negotiations with the EU have been, future negotiations with the World Trade Organisations may be far worse."" Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament The SNP's immigration and asylum spokesperson Stuart C. McDonald says that the current system ""is not fit for purpose"" and too many decisions are made incorrectly. He says that by encouraging safe passage, the UK would undermine traffickers who help people travel illegally. He says there is little evidence to show that children are often sent ahead to make it legal for the rest of the family to join. Denmark and the UK are the only countries which have restrictions on family reunions, he states. He used to be an immigration solicitor, and he says with his knowledge of the system, legal aid for family reunions is necessary. EU Citizens Statement House of LordsParliament Baroness Williams of Trafford has repeated the statement made in the House of Commons outlining the new EU citizen settlement scheme for those that wish to remain in the UK after Brexit. Labour spokesperson Lord Rosser in response asks what restrictions there will be on those that take up the scheme, as well as how many are expected to to take up the option. He says the government must have a clear view of what it expects from the EU in terms of UK citizens in the EU after Brexit, warning some comments made today would not be helpful in negotiations. He warns the government to remember its previous failings, mentioning the Windrush scandal, and to ensure it does not repeat such mistakes. He asks further questions around staffing and funding, and also what will happen if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He says he would accept a written response to his questions if preferred. Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament Angus MacNeil says that people all over the country have been proven to be welcoming to refugee families who move into their area. In Canterbury, an area of the south east which he says the tabloids frequently portray as overcrowded, has an excellent record of taking in refugee children. He says he is ""lost"" between the idea of ""stupidity and evil"" at the current situation of children in the United States being separated from their parents when they're accused of trying to get into the country illegally.

CO2 shortage threatens beer supplies,"Supplies of meat, chicken and beer are facing disruption by the an industry-wide shortage of carbon dioxide. At least five CO2 producers in northern Europe are offline for maintenance,according to the publication Gasworld,external. CO2 is used in the guns used to kill animals, as well as providing the fizz in carbonated drinks and being crucial to propelling beer from bar pumps. Meat producers have asked the government to prioritise their need for the gas above those of other users. Seasonal maintenance shutdowns have left the UK with only one big CO2 producer in action. Gasworld, which first raised the issue, said carbonated drinks producers were now ""desperate"" amid the worst CO2 supply crisis for decades. The Grocer magazine has also reported stark warnings from the British Poultry Council (BPC) that up to 60% of poultry processing plants could be knocked out ""within days"" as a result of the CO2 shortage. CO2 is used to stun and ultimately suffocate poultry in many slaughterhouses. BPC chief executive, Richard Griffiths, said that with the supply of CO2 tightened across Europe, the British Poultry Council was  calling on the government and major gas producers to ""prioritise supplies to slaughterhouses and keep the food chain moving"". The British Meat Processors Association (BMPA) said it was asking officials at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs to prioritise meat producers when finding back-up supplies of CO2. BMPA deputy director Fiona Steiger said: ""Supply is running out and it's pretty tight for some people. ""We don't know when supplies will be back up. We've been told it could be about a month."" Heineken's John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel kegs have been already been hit. Heineken said it was ""working with customers to minimise disruption"". ""We've been informed by our CO2 supplier that they are facing a major issue with supply availability in the UK,"" Heineken confirmed in a statement. Wetherspoons pub chain said that while it had not had any supply issues yet, ""that is likely to change in the coming days, and it's not likely to get any better. ""There might be some products we don't have available and if it affects Wetherspoons, then it will affect everyone else."" The British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), which represents brewers and 20,000 UK pubs, said the CO2 shortage was beginning to cause stoppages in beer production, although it did not name specific companies. As much as 82% of beer consumed in the UK is produced here, requiring carbon dioxide, according to Brigid Simmonds, head of the BBPA. Demand for beer and fizzy drinks is peaking as fans gather to watch the football, thanks to the recent run of hot weather. Carbon dioxide doesn't just put the fizz into soft drinks, canned and bottled beers. It also delivers beer at the pub pumps and is additionally used to pack fresh meat and salads. It comes from ammonia plants that manufacture fertiliser. But as demand for fertiliser peaks in winter, manufacturers often shut down during the summer for maintenance work. This video can not be played Are we in for a beer shortage this summer? The BBPA has issued some guidance to its members reminding them that CO2 used in drinks, including for dispensing beer at the pumps, must be food grade CO2. ""We'd be concerned this is not the time to go looking for a white van man who says they can supply you with CO2,"" she said. Gavin Partington, director general at the British Soft Drinks Association, said soft drinks producers were ""taking active steps to maintain their service to customers"". Coca Cola European Partners' spokesperson said it was currently able to fulfil orders to customers and was working with suppliers, partners and customers ""on a number of solutions"". The UK is particularly hard hit by the shortages, according to Gasworld, because only one major CO2 plant is still operating and imports from the European mainland have been affected by shutdowns in northern Europe. The UK is a large market for carbon dioxide and imports about a third of its CO2 needs. It has a vast range of applications in industry, with one of the main uses being the manufacture of dry ice to chill airline meals. The UK has a number of plants that produce CO2, but three of the four largest are currently down for maintenance or technical reasons. Carbon dioxide has a range of uses including packaging fresh food Gasworld said the heatwave in May had boosted demand for fizzy drinks across northern Europe at a time when ammonia plants producing CO2 as a by-product were closed. The current low price of ammonia meant producers were not restarting production quickly. Carbon dioxide production also comes from bioethanol plants, and as a by-product from whisky distilleries in Scotland. But these tend to be on a smaller scale and one UK bioethanol plant is also currently closed. While there were ready supplies of carbon dioxide in southern Europe, including Hungary and Romania, transporting it to northern Europe required specialist pressurised transport, Gasworld said.

Rebels back down in Brexit vote battle,"This video can not be played Liam Fox tells Laura Kuenssberg rebels have not changed Brexit stance The government's Brexit bill has passed through Parliament after Theresa May saw off a revolt by Tory MPs. Peers accepted the amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sent to them from the House of Commons, meaning the bill now goes for Royal Assent, becoming law. Earlier, the government won the vote 319 to 303, after assurances were accepted by would-be rebels that MPs would have a meaningful say. The PM called it a ""crucial step"" in delivering a ""smooth"" Brexit. Mrs May said: ""Today's votes show people in the UK, and to the EU, that the elected representatives in this country are getting on with the job, and delivering on the will of the British people. ""Over the next few weeks we will publish more details of our proposed future relationship with the EU in a White Paper, and will bring the Trade and Customs Bills back to the House of Commons. ""But today has been an important step in delivering the Brexit people voted for, a Brexit that gives Britain a brighter future, a Britain in control of its money, laws, and borders."" Who really backed down over Brexit vote? Can Theresa May 'take back control'? Brexit: All you need to know Brexit: Your guide to EU jargon Before the Commons vote, Dominic Grieve, leader of the would-be rebels - who wanted to ensure MPs had the power to stop the UK leaving without a deal - said the ""sovereignty of Parliament"" had been acknowledged. Both sides have claimed victory with Stephen Hammond, a pro-EU MP who eventually sided with the government, suggesting ministers had agreed to give Parliament a ""real say"" on top of other concessions. But international trade secretary Liam Fox said nothing had really changed and the option of a no-deal Brexit had been left firmly on the table. ""There is no change to the fundamental issue here which is the government cannot be forced by Parliament to negotiate something which it does not want to do,"" he told the BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg. He said the government had ""to be able to hold out in our negotiations the prospect of no deal"" otherwise the EU would get the upper hand. On Wednesday evening, following the Commons vote, Leader of the Lords Baroness Evans of Bowes Park said the EU (Withdrawal) Bill had been ""debated at length"" and was very different as a result of amendments tabled by the Lords. ""I believe our role now is to accept their view as expressed in a vote a few hours ago,"" she said. Peers approved the government's proposal without a vote. The UK is due to leave the European Union on 29 March 2019 and negotiations have been taking place over the terms of its departure. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor The government was worried enough about losing today to budge, even if they only gave an inch. It might be a concession that only really parliamentary lawyers understand, but the PM had to move, again, despite not wanting to. And despite the fact that she did compromise even in a meaningless way (yes I can't believe that I did just write that sentence, but it is relevant), the vote was still relatively close, certainly not comfortable enough for the government to relax any time soon. What's also the case is that the Tory rebels, or potential rebels more like, weren't willing to take dramatic action in enough number to humiliate the PM. The vote result suggests that they have the hypothetical numbers, but their critics, and their internal opponents in the Tory party would question if they really have the guts. Read more from Laura The government has been at odds with the House of Lords in the long-running row over what happens if the UK cannot reach a deal with the EU, or if MPs reject whatever deal the government agrees with the EU. The Commons vote had been expected to be tight and the government eventually prevailed by a majority of 16. Six Tory MPs - Ken Clarke, Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen, Antoinette Sandbach and Phillip Lee - rebelled while four Labour MPs backed the government and six other Labour MPs abstained, as did Kelvin Hopkins, who sits as an independent after having the whip withdrawn. Ms Wollaston tweeted that she was disappointed with the outcome. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Lords is expected to finally approve the EU Withdrawal Bill on Wednesday The debate centred on what happens in three Brexit scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal If Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached If 21 January passes with no deal being struck. Under these circumstances, the government has said, a minister will make a statement in Parliament, setting out the proposed next steps. MPs will then vote on this statement. According to the government, this vote should be ""on neutral terms"", with MPs simply noting what has been said. But an amendment backed by the House of Lords on Monday went further, saying MPs should have to ""approve"" the minister's statement. The Department for Exiting the European Union has now conceded that it will be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide the matter at the time. The government statement that Mr Grieve has accepted Speaking in the Commons, Dominic Grieve said the issue of the meaningful vote was about giving ""assurances to the House and many, many people in the country who are worried about this process and how it will end"". If Parliament wished to ""speak with one voice"" and exert its influence in the face of a non-deal scenario, it ""has the power to do it"". Mr Grieve said he had insisted on a key paragraph in the government statement accepting ""it is open to MPs to table motions and debate matters of concern and that, as is the convention, parliamentary time will be provided for this"". Another potential rebel Nicky Morgan said she did not wish to see Mrs May ""destabilised or undermined"" ahead of next week's summit of EU leaders. But she warned of further battles to come over the UK's trade and customs arrangements with the EU and suggested relationships between MPs had been ""strained almost beyond belief"". Please upgrade your browser And Conservative MP Vicky Ford, another pro-European MP who stuck with the government, said the outcome was ""not a mandate for a no-deal Brexit"". She said MPs had secured a ""backstop"" which meant if Parliament rejected the deal it could trigger ""another set of negotiations"" between the UK and EU aimed at getting an agreement before the UK left.

"Man arrested over Tube station blastPolice believe the explosion in north London, which injured five, was caused by a faulty drill battery.","Police said the cause of the explosion was a faulty battery A 23-year-old man has been arrested after an explosion at a north London Tube station left five people injured. Witnesses described smelling ""burning rubber"" and seeing ""six-foot flames"" at the entrance to Southgate Underground station in Enfield on Tuesday evening. Police believe the explosion was caused by a faulty drill battery. The man was held on suspicion of an act likely to cause an explosion to injure or damage property, and endangering safety on the railway. The station was shut and a cordon set up after the explosion occurred at about 19:00 BST. London Ambulance Service said they treated three people at the scene for minor injuries while two others were taken to hospital. Police said officers are ""working to establish the full facts"" James Ayton, 34, from Southgate, was on the ""packed"" escalator when he saw a ""quick burst"" of flames at the top. He said they were ""six foot plus"" and everyone ""legged it"" upon hearing a ""rapid whooshing sound"". ""The Tube had just unloaded. A few people got trampled on the escalator. There was screaming."" He said he saw a Tube worker pick something up that was on fire and extinguish it, but added: ""I think that was secondary rather than the cause."" The Met responded to the incident, which is now being investigated by British Transport Police Finance worker Haluk Ozkan was about to get on a bus outside the station when he smelt something ""like burning rubber"". ""We then saw people rushing to get out of the station. Not necessarily running or panicking, but moving quickly,"" he said. ""Then my partner saw a station staff member pointing a fire extinguisher at something and heard it go off, but we didn't see what it was directed at."" The station has reopened with services running although some officers remain in the area to provide reassurance to passengers, British Transport Police said. London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the explosion had been ""confirmed as non-suspicious"" and praised the emergency services ""for a swift and professional response"". The arrested man, who is from Enfield, has been released under investigation pending further enquiries.

Benetton criticised for migrant imagesThe Italian clothing firm is condemned for using images of migrants rescued at sea.Europe,"The photo by German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e that is being used in Benetton's ad campaign Italian clothing firm United Colors of Benetton has been criticised after launching a controversial advertising campaign featuring images of migrants rescued from the Mediterranean. The ads show migrants in life jackets accompanied by volunteers this month. The charity behind the rescue, SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e, condemned Benetton for using pictures of ""people in distress"". Italian Interior Minister Matteo Salvini later tweeted: ""Am I the only one to find this despicable?"" The ads, which appeared online and in Italian newspaper La Repubblica, feature two separate images captured on 9 June by German charity SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e as part of what became the rescue of hundreds of migrants.

""SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e fully dissociates itself from this campaign, which displays a picture taken while our teams were rescuing people in distress at sea,"" the charity said in a statement posted on Twitter on Tuesday. Benetton has not yet responded to the comments. Mr Salvini, who leads the right-wing populist League party, refused to allow the ship which rescued the migrants permission to dock at Italy's ports. Salvini shuts ports to migrant rescue ship Reality Check: Claims about migrants in Italy Who is responsible for providing helping at sea? The ship, the Aquarius, was also turned away by Malta but it and other ships were later permitted to dock at the Spanish port of Valencia. Mr Salvini promised during Italy's recent general election to take a tough stance against migration. Italy is the main entry point for migrants crossing from North Africa to Europe. The Benetton advertising campaign was designed by controversial Italian photographer Oliviero Toscani who said the images were ""dramatic"", adding that Mr Salvini's criticism ""makes me realise I'm right"". Toscani, who left Benetton in 2000 but returned in February this year, has been behind several divisive ads for the clothing company since the 1980s. Italian photographer Oliviero Toscani said he was right to use the images He has said that his campaigns, which have touched on subjects such as human rights, religion and racism, are designed to raise awareness of certain issues. In 1991, Toscani offended Italy's Roman Catholic Church by using an image showing a priest and a nun kissing. The following year, the photographer was criticised over the use of a picture of gay activist and Aids victim David Kirby as he lay ill in a hospital bed. Some of the worst advertising fails Then in 1996, Toscani produced an ad showing three ""human"" hearts alongside one another with the words white, black and yellow placed on each of the organs. He lost his position at Benetton in 2000 after the company was forced to apologise over a campaign labelled ""We, On Death Row"", which used photographs of prisoners sentenced to death in the US.

Verhofstadt 'two decade' Brexit warning,"Brexit could take as long as two decades to get EU approval unless the two sides agree a ""precise"" blueprint in October, Guy Verhofstadt has said. The European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator wants the UK to have an ""association agreement"" with the EU. He told the UK MPs' Brexit committee he wanted to see clear details of how that would work in the Autumn. If there was room for misunderstanding it could take a long time for the EU to ratify it, he warned. The EU and UK are hoping to publish the final withdrawal agreement and a political statement on future relations in October or November so it can be voted on by MPs at Westminster and MEPs in the European Parliament. UK 'can't keep European Arrest Warrant' Commons set for Brexit vote showdown Brexit: All you need to know Mr Verhofstadt said the agreement had to be published by the end of 2018 at the latest, to give the European Parliament enough time to ratify before the UK formally leaves the EU in March. He said it would take the entire two-year transition period, which is due to kick in after Brexit on 29 March 2019, to sort out the details of future trading relations between the EU and UK. But he warned MPs that it would take a lot longer if the political statement published in the autumn was not clear enough about what kind of relationship the EU was going to have with the UK. The advantage of an association agreement, he argued, was that it would be a flexible framework, allowing for a ""very narrow"" relationship based on trade alone, or a ""very broad"" relationship. And it would avoid the prospect of an ""inflation of agreements between the EU and the UK"" in a lot of different areas as the two sides hammered out their differences during the transition period. If, he told the MPs, ""this whole bunch of agreements will be put in the ratification machine of the European Union, including the member states, we are going to be in ratification - and in uncertainty - for more than one decade, even two decades"". Please upgrade your browser The European Parliament set out details of what it means by an ""association agreement"" - something the EU normally signs with aspiring member countries such as Ukraine - in adraft resolution in March,external. It would open the door to continued cooperation with some EU institutions, although Mr Verhofstadt said the UK would still have to be kicked out schemes such as the European Arrest Warrant and the Galileo satellite navigation system when it became a ""third country"" outside the EU. UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said last month he had no ""intrinsic objection"" to an ""association agreement"" but it ""depends what's in it"", adding that he would not accept the continued jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Mr Verhofstadt said Brexit had increased the ""popularity"" of the EU in other member states and that it had reignited debate about reform of its institutions. He said he was looking forward to the UK government's Brexit White Paper, which he hoped would give more details about how to resolve sticking points such as the Irish border and ECJ membership. ""I think that is it still possible to have for October/November an agreement on the political declaration. For that we need to speed up, certainly the negotiations in the coming months."" Mr Verhofstadt was also quizzed by the Commons home affairs committee. He repeated his warning of the ""nightmare"" of multiple agreements - on security, nuclear materials and many other issues - that he said could could take decades to ratify. This could be avoided with a single ""association agreement"", he told the MPs, but he cautioned against the idea of copying Ukraine's association agreement, which he said was ""specific"" to its ambition to join the EU. Committee chairman Yvette Cooper asked whether the Ukraine model, which allows partial access to the single market but not free movement, could point the way to a deal that might work for the UK. ""We did it with Ukraine so it's possible,"" said Mr Verhofstadt, but he said if the UK wanted deeper access to the single market than that enjoyed by Ukraine it would have to accept free movement. Similarly, he added, the EU would accept continued membership of the customs union, but only if the UK accepted it could not strike its own trade deals.

"Jane Barton, the doctor who shortened lives","Doctors are meant to preserve life and cause no harm. TheHippocratic Oath,external, written 2,500 years ago, includes the line: ""I will use treatments for the benefit of the ill in accordance with my ability and my judgment, but from what is to their harm and injustice I will keep them.""A review published on Wednesdayfound more than 450 patients died sooner than they would have after being given powerful painkillers inappropriately at Gosport War Memorial Hospital. Who is the doctor who actively shortened her patients' lives? Dr Jane Ann Barton, now aged 70, graduated from Oxford University in 1972 as a Bachelor of Medicine. She became a GP and worked at Forton Medical Centre in Gosport, and was employed for five sessions a week as a clinical assistant in the Department of Medicine for Elderly People at Gosport War Memorial Hospital from 1 May 1988 until her resignation on 5 July 2000. Forton Medical Centre, where Jane Barton was a GP While at the hospital she was responsible for the care of people inhabiting 44 beds. During her 12 years at the hospital, Dr Barton signed 854 death certificates. Of the patients she treated, 94% had received opiates, with ""little evidence of the three analgesia steps recommended in palliative care: non-opiate, then weak opiate, then strong opiate"", an earlier review in 2003 found. Hospital drugs left 456 patients dead NHS 'closed ranks' over hospital deaths Reaction to hospital deaths report Dr Barton's patients had usually been transferred from an acute hospital where they had been admitted for major illness or surgery. They needed more support than could have been provided in a nursing home. In some cases the aim of transfer to Gosport was for long-term care, as in patients with terminal cancer. Others, however, were there for rehabilitation following a stroke or fractured hip. When people die from a fracture, the cause of death should be recorded as ""accidental"" and accidental death is reported to a coroner. Dr Barton, however, recorded fracture-related deaths as stemming from bronchopneumonia, meaning the coroner was not informed. Any unusually high post-fracture death rate would therefore have passed unnoticed. Dr Barton signed 854 death certificates during her 12 years at Gosport War Memorial Hospital Dr Barton stopped working at the hospital in 2000 but continued to practise as a GP. A2003 review of deaths of patients,externalat Gosport War Memorial Hospital examined the medical records of patients who had died, and found Dr Barton's notes ""suggested a conservative rather than active attitude towards clinical management"", meaning she leant towards palliative care rather than recovery - even for people with fractures rather than illnesses. For example, some records included instructions to nursing staff written on the day of admission: ""Please make comfortable"", medical shorthand for an invitation to give patients high doses of painkillers. In some cases the appropriate medical procedure of pain assessment was not carried out. In one set of notes Dr Barton wrote: ""[The patient] is frightened, agitated appears in pain. Suggest transdermal analgesia despite no obvious clinical justification!! Dr Lord to countersign. I am happy for nursing staff to confirm death."" Dr Barton stopped working at the hospital in 2000 A 2010 General Medical Council investigation found Dr Barton guilty of serious professional misconduct, and of putting her patients at risk of an early death - but the panel did not remove her right to practice medicine, saying it had ""taken into account her 10 years of safe practice as a GP"" and 200 letters of support. Instead, 11 conditions were placed upon Dr Barton, including a three-year ban on injecting opiates. In a statement after the panel's ruling, Dr Barton said: ""Throughout my career I have tried to do my very best for all my patients and have had only their interests and wellbeing at heart."" Following the ruling Dr Barton decided to retire and on 9 March 2011 she relinquished her registration with the GMC.

Theresa May declined to comment on what she described as ""leaked"" documents She said the emails show how ""officials describe key Northern routes as valueless, discuss classic handling strategies for members of Parliament, discuss whether to throw a sop to Northern passenger groups and debate whether to propagate myths in order to divert public attention from agreed planned route closures.""

Prince Louis' christening announced,"Prince Louis, the third child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, is to be baptised on 9 July, Kensington Palace has announced. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will conduct the christening at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, London. Louis Arthur Charles - togive him his full name- was born on 23 April. The good news for his football-loving dad, Prince William, is that 9 July is one of the rest days in the World Cup. It falls neatly between the potential quarter-final and semi-final dates for England, should the team progress that far in the competition. Last month, the prince, who is president of the FA,had to miss the FA Cup finalto fulfil best man duties at his brother Harry's wedding. Prince Louis will be baptised at the same place as his older brother George.  Their sister, Charlotte, had her christening at St Mary Magdalene Church at the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk. In the past, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have mostly chosen close friends rather than royal relatives to fulfil the godparent role. For Prince George they chose: Julia Samuel, a friend of Princess Diana Jamie Lowther-Pinkerton, former private secretary to the couple William's childhood friend William van Cutsem Zara Tindall, William's cousin Emilia Jardine-Paterson, interior designer and school friend of Kate Earl Grosvenor, son of the Duke of Westminster Oliver Baker, a friend from St Andrews University where the couple met And for Princess Charlotte: Adam Middleton, Kate's cousin William's cousin Lady Laura Fellowes And friends of the couple Thomas van Straubenzee, James Meade and Sophie Carter.

Analysis by Nada Tawfik, BBC News, New York This is just the latest rejection of multilateralism by the Trump administration, and will likely unsettle those who look to the United States to protect and promote human rights around the world. The United States has always had a conflicting relationship with the UN Human Rights Council. The Bush Administration decided to boycott the council when it was created in 2006 for many of the same reasons cited by the Trump administration.

It wasn't until years later, in 2009, that the United States re-joined under the Obama administration. Many allies have tried to convince the United States to remain in the council. Even many who agree with Washington's long standing criticisms of the body believe the United States should actively work to reform it from within, rather than disengaging.

A group of 47 elected countries from different global regions serve for three-year terms on the council.

Verhofstadt 'two decade' Brexit warningThe European Parliament's Brexit chief tells MPs the two sides must be clear about what they want.UK Politics,"Brexit could take as long as two decades to get EU approval unless the two sides agree a ""precise"" blueprint in October, Guy Verhofstadt has said. The European Parliament's chief Brexit negotiator wants the UK to have an ""association agreement"" with the EU. He told the UK MPs' Brexit committee he wanted to see clear details of how that would work in the Autumn. If there was room for misunderstanding it could take a long time for the EU to ratify it, he warned. The EU and UK are hoping to publish the final withdrawal agreement and a political statement on future relations in October or November so it can be voted on by MPs at Westminster and MEPs in the European Parliament. UK 'can't keep European Arrest Warrant' Commons set for Brexit vote showdown Brexit: All you need to know Mr Verhofstadt said the agreement had to be published by the end of 2018 at the latest, to give the European Parliament enough time to ratify before the UK formally leaves the EU in March. He said it would take the entire two-year transition period, which is due to kick in after Brexit on 29 March 2019, to sort out the details of future trading relations between the EU and UK. But he warned MPs that it would take a lot longer if the political statement published in the autumn was not clear enough about what kind of relationship the EU was going to have with the UK. The advantage of an association agreement, he argued, was that it would be a flexible framework, allowing for a ""very narrow"" relationship based on trade alone, or a ""very broad"" relationship. And it would avoid the prospect of an ""inflation of agreements between the EU and the UK"" in a lot of different areas as the two sides hammered out their differences during the transition period. If, he told the MPs, ""this whole bunch of agreements will be put in the ratification machine of the European Union, including the member states, we are going to be in ratification - and in uncertainty - for more than one decade, even two decades"". Please upgrade your browser The European Parliament set out details of what it means by an ""association agreement"" - something the EU normally signs with aspiring member countries such as Ukraine - in adraft resolution in March,external. It would open the door to continued cooperation with some EU institutions, although Mr Verhofstadt said the UK would still have to be kicked out schemes such as the European Arrest Warrant and the Galileo satellite navigation system when it became a ""third country"" outside the EU. UK Brexit Secretary David Davis said last month he had no ""intrinsic objection"" to an ""association agreement"" but it ""depends what's in it"", adding that he would not accept the continued jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Mr Verhofstadt said Brexit had increased the ""popularity"" of the EU in other member states and that it had reignited debate about reform of its institutions. He said he was looking forward to the UK government's Brexit White Paper, which he hoped would give more details about how to resolve sticking points such as the Irish border and ECJ membership. ""I think that is it still possible to have for October/November an agreement on the political declaration. For that we need to speed up, certainly the negotiations in the coming months."" Mr Verhofstadt was also quizzed by the Commons home affairs committee. He repeated his warning of the ""nightmare"" of multiple agreements - on security, nuclear materials and many other issues - that he said could could take decades to ratify. This could be avoided with a single ""association agreement"", he told the MPs, but he cautioned against the idea of copying Ukraine's association agreement, which he said was ""specific"" to its ambition to join the EU. Committee chairman Yvette Cooper asked whether the Ukraine model, which allows partial access to the single market but not free movement, could point the way to a deal that might work for the UK. ""We did it with Ukraine so it's possible,"" said Mr Verhofstadt, but he said if the UK wanted deeper access to the single market than that enjoyed by Ukraine it would have to accept free movement. Similarly, he added, the EU would accept continued membership of the customs union, but only if the UK accepted it could not strike its own trade deals.

Prince Louis' christening announcedThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's youngest son will be baptised at the same place as his brother George.UK,"Prince Louis, the third child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, is to be baptised on 9 July, Kensington Palace has announced. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, will conduct the christening at the Chapel Royal, St James's Palace, London. Louis Arthur Charles - togive him his full name- was born on 23 April. The good news for his football-loving dad, Prince William, is that 9 July is one of the rest days in the World Cup. It falls neatly between the potential quarter-final and semi-final dates for England, should the team progress that far in the competition. Last month, the prince, who is president of the FA,had to miss the FA Cup finalto fulfil best man duties at his brother Harry's wedding. Prince Louis will be baptised at the same place as his older brother George.  Their sister, Charlotte, had her christening at St Mary Magdalene Church at the Queen's Sandringham estate in Norfolk.

BA cancels 'incorrectly' cheap tickets,"British Airways has apologised and offered full refunds for the error More than 2,000 British Airways passengers have had their tickets cancelled because the prices were too cheap, a travel agent has said. Travel Up chief Ali Shah said he believes another five agencies also sold tickets through the airline's mistake. BA has apologised for the error on flights to Tel Aviv and Dubai but refused to say how many were affected. Customers said they were angry their tickets are not being honoured. Mr Shah said flights normally costing more than Â£200 were advertised for Â£1 plus airport taxes, which can be several hundred pounds, between 17:45 BST on 11 June and 11:00 the following day. The agent, who said more than 2,000 of his customers have been affected, said: ""It's very cruel for the customers because they have booked these flights in good faith and expected it to be honoured. ""But I can also understand British Airways' position, it's a human error."" Mr Shah said all affected customers are being contacted and BA will provide a full refund as well as a Â£100 voucher. Travel Up customer Ash Gubbay, from London, says he had booked a return flight to Tel Aviv for Â£195 but now has to pay about Â£1,000. Ash Gubbay was going to Tel Aviv for a family wedding and memorial service Mr Gubbay said he thought the tickets were cheap but ""not far-fetched"" and comparable with other airlines. He said the firm should honour the flights. Mr Gubbay said he was ""annoyed and angry"" and the voucher would be of ""no help"" as it will not cover the cost difference for new flights. He said: ""I'm very disappointed and let down by British Airways. ""If I wanted to cancel my tickets I wouldn't have been able to but it seems like they can just do what they want."" Another customer, Esther Vadia, had booked six tickets to Tel Aviv for Â£167 each and a seventh for her son later in the year for Â£195. All have been cancelled. She says she is unable to afford to pay for other flights and although she will be refunded, she will still have to pay credit card fees for the cancelled tickets. Ms Vadia also said she would end up losing more than Â£1,000 on non-refundable accommodation in Israel. She said: ""If you go to a supermarket and buy something for cheap, they cannot come after you later and say you have to give it back. ""So how can an airline do that? Besides, I don't think the tickets were so cheap as to be unbelievable."" by Brian Milligan, BBC personal finance reporter Whether BA was entitled to cancel the tickets is likely to depend whether they were so cheap that the so-called mistake should have been obvious to customers. If they were miles cheaper than comparable tickets, the company could argue that it made a ""unilateral mistake"" in its pricing. But the difficulty for BA is that a quick search online reveals flights from London to Tel Aviv to be on sale for around Â£215. So the BA fare of Â£195 may not seem unusually good value. James Daley, managing director of Fairer Finance, thinks BA may be in the wrong. ""I don't understand how, technically, they could wriggle out of it. It's their error,"" he said. However, it may take a legal challenge from one of the passengers involved to fully test the law on this. Hanna Simon, another passenger, also said she did not believe the flights were ""excessively cheap"". She said she was particularly frustrated as she had corresponded with BA about add-ons to her flight and no problem had been raised by the airline. Several people the BBC spoke to also said they had not been informed of the cancellation and only found out when they checked their online accounts. They also said the Â£100 voucher was ""useless"" as, aside from ""restrictive"" terms and conditions, the flights were now costing much more than that. Flights to Dubai were also affected by the pricing error BA said in a statement: ""Errors like this are exceptionally rare, and if they do occur, under contract law, there is no binding contract between the parties. ""We have apologised to customers and offered a gesture of goodwill."" Guy Anker, deputy editor ofMoneySavingExpert.com,external, said BA should ""do the right thing"" and let the passengers ""fly at the price they booked"". He said: ""While this may have been a 'rare' error, it's not the passengers' error. ""They've bought these tickets in good faith at a believable price - it's not as though the tickets cost Â£5, which would clearly have been a glitch."" Jack Sheldon, founder of Jack's Flight Club, said ""fare errors"" were not uncommon but in almost 70% of cases the airline would honour the tickets. He said: ""They honour it because it's bad PR to cancel tickets. ""This is an odd one. In cases where tickets are cancelled it is usually because the ticket was supposed to be say Â£400 but was sold for Â£40. ""In this case the error doesn't seem to have been that big and a typical customer could well have thought this was a genuine fare.""

The lives of 456 patients were shortened by the use of opiates and the panel found another 200 were ""probably similarly affected"". The report follows several inquiries into the prescribing of sedatives at Gosport War Memorial Hospital. Health and social care secretary, Jeremy Hunt, apologises to families for what they have been through. A fresh review, led by former Bishop of Liverpool James Jones, spoke to more than 100 families and analysed 800 death certificates. Relatives said they hoped it would end their ""harrowing"" wait for answers. MP George Hollingbery said: âI
have two families in the Meon Valley in touch with me who lost loved ones at
the hospital, including one who saw both her parents die there. ""I have made it
clear to them that lessons from what happened and the accountability of those
involved would be raised in the House. âThe
government will now respond fully to the report in the Autumn. The families,
who have worked so hard to find answers for 20 years, need reassurance that all
authorities will ensure such deaths cannot happen again.â Hampshire Constabulary's chief Constable, Olivia Pinkney, has added this afternoon that it is ""already apparent"" from reading the 370 page report that the panel has had sight of information not previously seen by her police force. She said: ""It is important that a process is put in place to ensure that all of the
relevant agencies come together, to enable decisions about next steps to be made
in a way that is well considered and transparent to all of the families."" A doctor is expected to prolong life, not shorten it. Who is Dr Barton? A doctor is expected to prolong life, not shorten it. Who is Dr Barton? Rachel Power, Chief Executive of the Patients Association, said: âWe have heard of many instances of poor care over the years, but to
deliberately shorten the lives of patients represents the very worst betrayal
of patients that any doctor can commit. âThe report makes clear that leaders, clinicians and nurses at the hospital
were all aware of what was happening, but that the failure to act ran from top
to bottom. âAlthough the NHS has made progress in recent years, it is hard to feel
confident that failings of this sort are impossible in todayâs health service.âWhen patients and their families raise concerns in future they must be
properly listened to and given full and open answers.â Concerns were first raised about treatment at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital in 1998. Matthew McClelland, director of fitness to practise at the Nursing and
Midwifery Council, said: ""I want to pay tribute to the families who have fought
for 20 years to understand what happened to their loved ones at Gosport. ""It's clear that we and others badly let them down and I am very sorry for the
role we have played in that. ""We will now carry out a careful review of the report to see what action we
may need to take and what lessons we can learn. ""What we do know is that our communications with some of the families was
unacceptable and for some of those who lost loved ones, we added to their
distress. ""This report is a stark reminder that patients and
their families must always be at the heart of what we do."" Vernon Gregory died at the hospital in 1989. His daughter Linda spoke following the disclosure of the report today. She said: âNot only was my dad, in the
1980s at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, laying in a coma due to being overdosed
and left to die, two years ago my mum was found also in a coma by myself at
another hospital after going in for routine care, rather like my father, and
she never came out alive. âSomething needs to be done soon in all hospitals to prevent
such things ever happening again.â When asked whether an outside police force should now
investigate the new findings, she said âitâs difficult to say but maybe yes, call in an outside forceâ. Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said if police decide to bring criminal prosecutions they would have the support of the government. New Forest East MP Julian Lewis asked if Mr Hunt would agree that people who ""are found wilfully to have administered lethal drug doses unnecessarily they deserve to lose their liberty."" Mr Hunt replied: ""I don't think anyone
in this House wouldn't share (his) sentiments but we have to let the law take
its course now and we have to make sure that justice is done, and it has been
denied for too long."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long-time campaigner Gillian Mackenzie, whose mother Gladys
Richards died aged 91 at the hospital in 1998, welcomed the report and hoped it
would mean those involved would âget their comeuppanceâ. She added: âTheyâll have to bring 15 of the strongest cases
into the criminal court because thatâs where it deserves to go, whether thatâs
my case or not. âAs far as Iâm concerned they have to get a conviction for
all the rest of the families.â Gillian Mackenzie Ken Woolleyâs father John died at the hospital in 1996 after
being admitted for a broken hip. He said: âAs soon as we saw him the next day he was unable
to communicate due to the drugs theyâd given him. âThere was another 11 days where he still couldnât
communicate before he died.â Ken Woolley Asked how he felt about the report, Mr Woolley, from Portsmouth, said: âVindication, upset, distress, anger. âSomething has to come of this â they have to get to the bottom of it.â He added he was not against Hampshire Constabulary leading a new investigation despite criticism for their previous inquiries. âThere will be a new focus and significant pressure this time so they should be able to do the job.â They are the scandals that haunt the NHS. How can they happen time and time again? Bridget Reeves' grandmother was one of the more than 450 people to die at the hospital in Gosport. Alongside its report, the panel haspublished an online archive,externalof
documentation. The panel is aware that some documents include personal opinions
of individuals and statements about individuals, where those concerned have not
had the opportunity to respond to comments or criticism. In reading the
disclosed documents it is important to be sensitive to this situation. Kate Blackwell QC, who served on the panel, said: ""One family member said that in fact for her, this was the beginning. ""Twenty years or so too late but eventually, they were being recognised and the fault of the hospital was being recognised. She added: ""They were confident that today's report is the start of the process that should have taken place a long time ago."" The Rt Rev Jones said there had been
""lots of tears"" and ""grieving"" when families were presented with the findings of
the report this morning. He said the report did not
explore why the practice of prescribing may have taken place at the
hospital. ""Questions about motive are beyond the
terms of reference for the panel, but those are questions that will need to be
prosecuted."" Bridget Reeves also said this had been an ""inexcusable failure"" of the patients. She said: ""It is scandalous and immoral. They have grossly failed by abusing people's human rights. ""It is more than catastrophic, this sort of behaviour in our NHS is chilling and precarious."" Bridget Reeves added that during the complaints process ""every government body locked together with no chance of impartiality and ultimately the truth."" She said: ""They are all clearly desensitised. Our families whose lives ended so inhumanely, the insensitivity of it all."" Miss Reeves said that none of the families of hospital victims would have allowed their loved ones to be admitted had they known about the police investigation. She added: ""The people of Gosport have the right to know."" Bridget Reeves, whose grandmother Elsie Divine, 88, died at
the hospital in 1999, said: âThis has been sinister, calculated and those
implicated must now face the full rigour of the criminal justice system. âAccountability must take precedent here. âThese horrifying, shameful, unforgivable actions need to be
disclosed in a criminal court for a jury to decide and only then can we put our
loved ones to rest.â Bridget Reeves The Nursing and Midwifery
Council (NMC) has responded to the Gosport Independent Panel Report. Director of
Fitness to Practise, Matthew McClelland, said: ""I want to
pay tribute to the families who have fought for 20 years to understand what

Republicans scramble amid border crisisPresident Trump meets lawmakers as an outcry grows over separated migrant families.US & Canada,"This video can not be played The sound of migrant children separated from parents Republicans are scrambling to draft a bill to address the growing outcry over the policy of separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border. President Donald Trump told a group of House Republicans he would back any immigration bill they passed, a White House spokesman said. The Republican-controlled Congress is under pressure to change the policy, following widespread condemnation. But the president says it is necessary to stop illegal border crossings. ""We had a great meeting,"" Mr Trump said after seeing Republican lawmakers on Tuesday. It is unclear if any progress was made but White House spokesman Raj Shah said Mr Trump had told the group he would endorse their immigration legislation. The president made clear that separating parents and children was ""certainly not an attractive thing and does look bad"", Representative Tom Cole said. Psychological impact on separated children Staff demand Microsoft end immigration work Why US is separating migrant children from parents Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump said children had to be taken away if their parents were jailed for illegally crossing the US border. ""When you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally - which should happen - you have to take the children away,"" he said. US immigration officials say 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 parents between 5 May and 9 June amid a ""zero-tolerance"" crackdown on illegal immigration brought in by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Babies and toddlers have been sent to three ""tender age"" shelters after being separated from their parents, the Associated Press news agency reported. Doctors and lawyers who visited the shelters described the infants as hysterical, crying, and acting out,external, according to the AP report. On Wednesday UK Prime Minister Theresa May told Britain's Parliament:""The pictures of children being held in what appear to be cages are deeply disturbing. This is wrong."" In an interview with Reuters news agency, Pope Francis said he supported recent statements by US Catholic bishops who called the policy ""contrary to our Catholic values"" and ""immoral"". French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who in the past has praised Mr Trump's policy of curbing immigration, told French TV that she disagreed with splitting children from parents. On Tuesday Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray Caso said the practice was ""cruel and inhuman"", and clearly violated human rights. The US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, two leading business groups, said the policy was ""contrary to American values"". Governors from at least eight US states - including two Republicans - have reversed their decision to send National Guard troops to the US-Mexico border. What is Trump's family-separation endgame? Who decided to take the children away? Fenced enclosures hold migrant children A new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll suggests that most Americans oppose the policy, with only 28% supporting it. This video can not be played The US teens training in border patrol Under the ""zero-tolerance"" approach unveiled in May, all undocumented border crossers are criminally charged and jailed. Migrant children cannot be held with their parents, and are kept in separate facilities maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services. Under previous US administrations, undocumented immigrants caught crossing the border for the first time tended to be issued with court summonses. But the Trump administration points out that most of those migrants never showed up for court. This video can not be played US child migrants: Five things to know The White House has been disputing the terminology used to describe its crackdown. It describes the holding centres where children have been pictured in metal chain-link enclosures with concrete floors as ""shelters"" instead of ""cages"". The House of Representatives is preparing this week to vote on a moderate immigration bill. The compromise would limit, but not ban outright, family separations. It would also offer an eventual path to citizenship for undocumented adult immigrants, known as Dreamers, who entered the US as children. The Republican legislation would also provide $25bn (Â£19bn) in funding for border security, including Mr Trump's planned US-Mexico wall. Mixed messages on US migrant policy House Republicans were reportedly working on a revised plan,externalthat would mean children would be detained for longer than is currently allowed but kept with their parents, the Associated Press reports. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also said he ""hoped to reach out to the Democrats"" about crafting a bipartisan deal. However Democrats argue that no congressional action is required and the president can simply reverse his own policy.

"US child separations wrong, says MayThe PM calls pictures of children in cages ""disturbing"" but says the president's visit must go ahead.UK Politics","This video can not be played Theresa May: US child detention ""disturbing"" and ""wrong"" Theresa May has condemned the forced separation of migrant children from their parents at the US-Mexico border, but dismissed calls to cancel President Donald Trump's visit to the UK. The PM said the images of children being kept in what look like cages was ""deeply disturbing"" and ""wrong"". But she said Mr Trump's visit next month should go ahead to ensure ""shared interests"" could be discussed. Where she disagreed on something, she would tell Mr Trump, Mrs May insisted. Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Trump official booed at Mexican restaurant She was challenged on the issue at Prime Minister's Questions by the SNP's Ian Blackford and a host of Labour MPs, including former leader Ed Miliband.

The Republican-controlled Congress is under pressure to change the border policy, following widespread condemnation. But the president says it is necessary to stop illegal border crossings. The ""zero-tolerance"" policy - brought in by US Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month - means that adults who try to cross the border, many planning to seek asylum, are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As a result, hundreds of minors are now being housed in detention centres, and kept away from their parents.

House of CommonsParliament The Commons today heard the first details of the proposed""settled status"" schemefor EU nationals who continue to live in the UK after the country has left the EU. Settled status will cost Â£65, or Â£32.50 for children under 16. It will be available to all EU citizens once they have lived in the UK for more than five years; for citizens applying before they have lived in the UK for five years, they will be granted pre-settled status. In other events, the government were criticised by Labour for their response to an NAO report published which says that Universal Creditcould cost more than the current systemit is due to replace.

Earl Attlee does go on to elaborate that when he joined the Lords, he was serving in the TA, but hasn't visited an army base for a number of years... EU citizens will have to answer three questions to stay in the UK after Brexit, says Sajid Javid. Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament Universities minister Sam Gyimah says the government recognises that ""the programme has played an important role in achieving some tremendous outcomes"". He says he's pleased the UK will continue to participate until the end of 2020, and says that the continued participation ""is a matter of future negotiations"". The government has ""made the EU very aware of the UK's desire to continue in the programme"" and are looking very closely at the options of continuing ""as a third country for a fair contribution"". Mr Gyimah agrees that value for money is vital and says discussion needs to be based on an assessment of UK priorities. ""We will ensure the UK secures the best deal."" Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament Shadow education minister Gordon Marsden says that education programmes like this help with social mobility, something which he says the government claims they want to address. He says ""it is still very unclear"" what will happen after the programme ends in 2020. ""We continue to believe that it is imperative that future involvement in this programme is on the agenda,"" he says. He says that education and culture ministers should be around the negotiating tables debating the future of this programme. The Russell Group has said that it will likely be less costly to maintain membership of it, rather than universities trying to replicate their own schemes, he adds. Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Kirsty Blackman suggests to Huw Merriman that ""of course the costs will double if the participants double"" and the benefits increase as well. She says the UK needs to continue it's links with Europe however it can after Brexit, and the Erasmus+ is a huge opportunity for that. ""We need to make clear how strong our interest is in this continuing...the more the government can do to state that case, the better for our students, our universities and for our communities."" Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament A series of Conservative MPs step up to share their support for the scheme, with Vicky Ford, who declares an interest of having helped ""put the plus on Erasmus+"", enthusing about the benefits. Erasmus graduates are 44% more likely than others to be in management roles in 10 years time, she says. Rachel Maclean quotes her own son's enthusiastic words, and Huw Merriman says he shares the same passion for the ability of students to learn from abroad. Mr Merriman does say however that he is concerned by the rising costs, which have doubled, and suggests it is a clear example of how people have fallen out of love with the European project. Ms Ford intervenes to defend the spending. Erasmus+ programme House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Lloyd Russell-Moyle is now opening a debate on the future of the Erasmus+ programme, which allows young people to study across Europe and is not guaranteed to continue after Brexit. Support for the scheme, he says, cuts across political parties and across the Brexit debate. Mr Russell-Moyle, who worked towards establishing and running the current scheme before becoming an MP, suggests MPs are united by a deep concern at the lack of full commitment to it's future by the government. Uncertainty over the scheme's future, he says, ""puts at risk the future existence of one of this country's most successful exports - higher education."" PM tweets Allow Twitter content?

Armed forces reserves House of LordsParliament Conservative Lord De Mauley opens the debate on the contribution of the Armed Forces reserves by speaking of his own time in the Territorial Army during the Wilson government. He gives a history of the changing fortunes of the reserve forces, and then speaks of the challenges they are now facing. Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament Immigration Minister Caroline Nokes says the government has done a great deal of work to enable civil society to play an increased role in the resettlement of refugees. She gives one example of where Â£1m has been given to a group working to support refugees and assist their integration. Indeed, she says, many in society are ""well placed to wrap their arms around"" resettled refugees. This week, she says, she spoke with a group of US teenagers and expressed her dismay at the treatment of children at the hands of Trump's government. She was pleased that they shared her response. Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament Shadow Home Office Minister Afzal Khan says that while the prime minister has been right to criticise President Donald Trump over the US's treatment of immigrant children, her government follows similar policies. The government must halt their approach of making the lives of refugees and asylum seekers so awful that they don't want to come to the UK, he says - as if so-called ""pull factors"" were what caused them to flee their homes and there weren't enough ""push factors"" in the first place. UK future trade relations House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Whitty, who echoes Baroness McIntosh of Pickering in stressing the importance of this debate, expresses surprise that he is the only backbencher wishing to speak. He looks back to his younger days, when even then the ""far left circles"" he spent time were filled with constant disagreement over the benefits of a world trade. There is now no universal support for free trade, he suggests, such is the frustration. It's not just world trade that has problems, he says, suggesting that when the world order is blamed rather than the government then ""democracy is in a bit of a mess"". The rise of populism, which he describes as ""an idea the lower orders find attractive and the elites deplore"", is understandable in this situation, and he says it raises questions over whether World Trade Organisation rules are working.

UK future trade relations House of LordsParliament Baroness McIntosh of Pickering is opening a debate on the UK's future trade relations following the failure to reach an agreement at the G7 Summit in Canada, which the prime minister described as ""difficult"" with ""strong consequences"". She warns the UK faces many economic challenges following the introduction of high tariffs by the US, combined with the decision to leave the EU, and asks how we will replace the huge existing EU markets we currently access when no obvious alternatives exist. ""No matter how difficult we might think our relations and negotiations with the EU have been, future negotiations with the World Trade Organisations may be far worse."" Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament The SNP's immigration and asylum spokesperson Stuart C. McDonald says that the current system ""is not fit for purpose"" and too many decisions are made incorrectly. He says that by encouraging safe passage, the UK would undermine traffickers who help people travel illegally. He says there is little evidence to show that children are often sent ahead to make it legal for the rest of the family to join. Denmark and the UK are the only countries which have restrictions on family reunions, he states. He used to be an immigration solicitor, and he says with his knowledge of the system, legal aid for family reunions is necessary. EU Citizens Statement House of LordsParliament Baroness Williams of Trafford has repeated the statement made in the House of Commons outlining the new EU citizen settlement scheme for those that wish to remain in the UK after Brexit. Labour spokesperson Lord Rosser in response asks what restrictions there will be on those that take up the scheme, as well as how many are expected to to take up the option. He says the government must have a clear view of what it expects from the EU in terms of UK citizens in the EU after Brexit, warning some comments made today would not be helpful in negotiations. He warns the government to remember its previous failings, mentioning the Windrush scandal, and to ensure it does not repeat such mistakes. He asks further questions around staffing and funding, and also what will happen if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. He says he would accept a written response to his questions if preferred. Refugee family reunion House of CommonsParliament Angus MacNeil says that people all over the country have been proven to be welcoming to refugee families who move into their area. In Canterbury, an area of the south east which he says the tabloids frequently portray as overcrowded, has an excellent record of taking in refugee children. He says he is ""lost"" between the idea of ""stupidity and evil"" at the current situation of children in the United States being separated from their parents when they're accused of trying to get into the country illegally.

'Nighthawks' damaging Hadrian's Wall,"Nighthawks have also targeted a preserved section of wall, which was built by the men of the Twentieth Legion of the Roman Army Illegal treasure hunters have damaged part of Hadrian's Wall, experts claim. So-called nighthawk metal detectorists are blamed for more than 50 holes found around the 1,900-year-old Brunton Turret section, near Hexham, Northumberland. Historic England said those responsible were searching for loot such as Roman coins and military regalia. Other areas of the ancient wall, a World Heritage site, have been targeted. The Brunton Turret section of the wall was built by the Twentieth Legion of the Roman Army. Illegal 'nighthawks' target Corbridge site Is 'nighthawking' stealing our past? Historic England said it was working with police to try and find those responsible. But it added it was not practical to install security measures like CCTV along the stretch of the wall. The 73-mile (117km) wall stretches between Wallsend in North Tyneside and Bowness on Solway in Cumbria and has about 160 scheduled monuments, which include Roman camps, forts and signal stations. Anyone using a metal detector without authorisation on these sites is committing a criminal offence. Historic England wants visitors to Hadrian's Wall and Tyne Valley residents to report illegal metal detecting which is ""causing loss and damage to our shared cultural heritage"". More than 50 holes have been dug by so-called nighthawks, Historic England said Mike Collins, the organisation's inspector of ancient monuments, said: ""We know that the majority of the metal detecting community complies with the laws and regulations regarding discovery and recovery of objects from the land. ""But the small number of people who steal artefacts and damage ancient sites are breaking the law and robbing us all of the knowledge and understanding that objects from the past can give us."" He said the majority of items taken were sold on, some via online auction sites, with others being bought by individual collectors. Mark Harrison, head of heritage crime and policing advice for Historic England, added: ""We may never see or fully understand the objects taken or damaged because they have been removed from their original sites with no care or record as to their history or context. ""Historic England will continue to work with Northumbria Police, the Crown Prosecution Service and the metal detecting community to identify the small criminal minority who are intent on causing loss and damage to our shared cultural heritage and to bring them to justice.""

'Grenfell 2' looms if cladding not banned,"Natasha Elcock, who escaped Grenfell Tower, called for the cladding to be banned straight away Another disaster like the Grenfell Tower fire is looming if the government does not act to ban combustible cladding, survivors have said. Speaking to MPs on the housing select committee, they warned ""Grenfell two is in the post"" while it stays in use. Cladding on the tower is thought to have contributed to the rapid spread of fire during the blaze on 14 June 2017. The government is consulting on a proposed ban but survivor Natasha Elcock told MPs: ""We shouldn't wait."" The chairman of the committee, Clive Betts, said Ms Elcock and other former Grenfell residents who had accepted the invitation to speak to the committee at the House of Commons, had delivered a ""very powerful message"" to government. A total of 72 people died as a result of fire in west London. Cladding ban considered after Grenfell Tests show scale of fire safety problem Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Ms Elcock, who escaped from the 11th floor of Grenfell Tower, was giving evidence to the committee as a representative of Grenfell United, the official organisation for the bereaved families of the fire, as well as as those residents who survived. Asked what her message was to the government on the cladding, she said: ""I think it should be banned. ""No-one should go through what we've gone through, absolutely not, but also no-one should go to sleep at night knowing they've got combustible cladding wrapped round their building."" Cladding has been removed from some tower blocks in the country, but has not been banned She said that while she understood some things needed to be consulted on, ""things are not happening quick enough"", adding: ""It has been a year - a year - and it is quite evident there was something really wrong with what was put on that building. ""Our world was turned upside down 12 months ago and as survivors and a bereaved community, we shouldn't be fighting for what is right for other people. ""We will if we have to, but we shouldn't have to. It should be banned and it should be banned now. We shouldn't wait."" The first anniversary of the fire was marked earlier this month Edward Daffarn, who lived on the 16th floor of the tower,had written a blog six months before the blaze warning of the risk. Also representing Grenfell United, he told the committee: ""There are 300 buildings with this cladding on... [it] is a disgrace. ""Grenfell two is in the post unless you act and act quickly. The government needs to take responsibility for this, step in, end people's misery, end people's fear and act."" Jacqui Haynes, who chairs the Lancaster West Residents' Association and lived next to the tower, added: ""We are all sitting here, knowing the potential of those materials, knowing after the disaster what the possibilities are, and therefore we are all culpable sitting here with that knowledge. ""How can that be? How is that a discussion?"" Jacqui Haynes, who lived next to the tower, said those who knew the risks were ""culpable"" if another fire happened Mr Daffarn also told the committee of a ""vast chasm of mistrust"" between the residents and Kensington and Chelsea Council. Sophie Earnshaw, from the North Kensington Law Centre, said the council ""had a chance to remedy this"", but instead they put ""a lot of pressure"" on survivors who felt they had to accept unsuitable offers of accommodation after the fire. The councilpromised all affected residents would be provided with a permanent homewithin a year. However, of those 203 households, around 20 still do not have a permanent home. Tomassina Hessel, also of the Lancaster West Residents' Association, said the community were ""made to look ungrateful"" for turning down homes, when actually they were not suitable - including homes with views of the tower, flats on high levels and properties that had not had fire risk assessments. Edward Daffarn blogged about the fire risks at Grenfell Tower before the blaze Leader of the council, Elizabeth Campbell, later gave evidence to the committee and said 90% of people had accepted permanent homes - showing they felt those properties were suitable. She told MPs: ""We have really tried to give people a choice. It is not just a property, it is a home. ""We have tried to personalise it, but that has taken time. ""What we don't want to happen is for someone to feel they are forced or pushed."" She added: ""We absolutely do care, we are totally committed to working with everyoneâ¦ and we are committed to getting people houses as quickly as possible."" The public inquiry into the firecontinued in central London earlier, with an expert saying the disaster was unlike any other flat fire because the flames spread in all directions. Professor Luke Bisbytold the inquiry that previous tall building fires abroad saw the flames going upwards, but at Grenfell, they spread both horizontally and downward. He also said he believed the fire escaped from the kitchen of a flat on the fourth floor through a side window, before catching on the plastic at the rear of cladding panels, which were installed as part of a refurbishment to the tower. He said he had identified a cavity behind cladding on the pillars which allowed fire to race to its top in less than 30 minutes.

32Red's ÃÂ£2m penalty for problem gambler,"Online gambling operator 32Red has been hit with a Â£2m penalty for failing to protect a problem gambler. One customer was allowed to deposit Â£758,000 with the firm with no money laundering or social responsibility  checks. The Gambling Commission said the penalty also related to money laundering failures. Kindred, which owns 32Red, said it accepted the penalty and was ""working hard"" to improve its processes. The Gambling Commission's investigation focused on 32Red's dealings with the customer between November 2014 and April 2017 during which time there were at least 22 incidents indicating the customer was a problem gambler. ""Instead of checking on the welfare of a customer displaying problem gambling behaviour, 32Red encouraged the customer to gamble more - this is the exact opposite of what they are supposed to be doing,"" said Richard Watson, the commission's executive director said. ""Operators must take action when they spot signs of problem gambling and should be carefully reviewing all the customers they are having a high level of contact with."" There had also been previous incidents highlighting the gambler's problems but instead of scrutinising these, the customer was offered bonuses to carry on placing bets. The Gambling Commission said 32Red should have reviewed the customer's accounts in August 2016 but one was only conducted in January 2017, when a win of more than Â£1m was instantly gambled again. 888 hit with record Â£7.8m penalty The customer took five weeks to respond to requests about their financial position and failed to offer support when the information was provided, the commission said. The payslip and report of commission for work was ""not credible and showed volatility in receipted income"", according to the Gambling Commission. These showed a monthly net income of Â£13,000 but average monthly deposits were in excess of Â£45,000. The customer's average monthly net salary was actually Â£2,150. The Â£2m penalty includes Â£709,046 divestment of the financial gain, a Â£1.3m payment to be used on the National Responsible Gambling Strategy, intended to tackle problem gambling, and Â£15,000 towards the cost of the investigation. Asked if the customer had stolen the money to gamble, the Gambling Commission  spokesman said: ""The source of the customer's wealth was not known to 32Red because they failed to fulfil their anti-money laundering obligations. We cannot comment on any other proceedings that may be active."" Thelargest penalty imposed by the Gambling Commissionwas the Â£7.8m penalty on betting firm 888 in August 2017. 32Red was taken over by Kindred, a Swedish online betting company, in June 2017.

"Staff demand Microsoft end immigration workAs outrage grows over family separations, employees want the firm to end its work with US Border Patrol.","Microsoft boss Satya Nadella is being put under pressure by his rank-and-file to end its work with US Border Patrol A letter signed by more than 100 Microsoft employees has called on it to stop working with the US Border Patrol. The call comes as the Trump administrationfaces intense criticism over the separation of childrenfrom their families at the Mexican border. The letter, posted on an internal message board andpublished by the New York Times,external, said the employees ""refuse to be complicitâ. Microsoft has shared a response penned by its chief executive Satya Nadella. ""I am appalled at the abhorrent policy of separating immigrant children from their families,""he wrote,external. ""This new policy implemented on the border is simply cruel and abusive, and we are standing for change. ""I want to be clear: Microsoft is not working with the US government on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border."" More on this story Why US is separating migrant children from parents Psychological impact on separated children Mixed messages on US migrant policy However, the company does have a $19.4m (Â£14.7m) contract with the US Immigration, Customs and Enforcement agency, known as ICE. Mr Nadella said this was to support tasks involving email, calendar, messaging and document management. In January,Microsoft posted information,externalabout how its cloud computing platform, Azure, was being used to facilitate data âsecurity and complianceâ. The post read: âWe're proud to support this work with our mission-critical cloud.â The signees of the letter to Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella demand the company ends this association with ICE, and ""other clients who directly enable ICEâ. Their efforts chime with the thoughts being expressed by employees at many of Silicon Valleyâs top firms. On Tuesday, some of the regionâs top chief executives made statements on the issue. âThe stories and images of families being separated at the border are gut-wrenching,âwrote Sundar Pichai,external, Googleâs chief executive, on Twitter. ""Urging our government to work together to find a better, more humane way that is reflective of our values as a nation.â Apple boss Tim Cook, speaking after an event in Ireland,told the Irish Times,externalthe situation was âinhumaneâ. ""Itâs heartbreaking to see the images and hear the sounds of the kids. Kids are the most vulnerable people in any society. I think that whatâs happening is inhumane, it needs to stop.â Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg said,external: ""We need to stop this policy right now."" Other condemnations have come from the bosses at AirBnB, Twilio and Box. A fundraiser on Facebook had raised more than $6m on Tuesday,external, growing at a rate of thousands of dollars every minute. It is the largest amount ever raised on the platform. Employee rebellion recently saw Google drop its contract with the US Department of Defense. It had been aiding the development of software designed to increase the accuracy of drone strikes. A number of Google employees resigned and thousands more signed a petition against the project, known as Maven, fearing it would be the first step in artificial intelligence being used to kill people. _______ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Canada legalises recreational cannabis use,"The Senate passed the bill, with 52 votes in favour and 29 against Canada's parliament has passed a law legalising the recreational use of marijuana nationwide. The Cannabis Act passed its final hurdle on Tuesday in a 52-29 vote in the Senate. The bill controls and regulates how the drug can be grown, distributed, and sold. Canadians will be able to buy and consume cannabis legally as early as this September. The country is the second worldwide to legalise the drug's recreational use. Legalising cannabis: What you need to know Uruguay became the first country to legalise the sale of cannabis for recreational usein December 2013, while a number of US states have also voted to permit it. Cannabis possession first became a crime in Canada in 1923 but medical use has been legal since 2001. Pot advocates concerned about legalisation Marijuana brands aim for high-end retail in Canada The bill will likely receive Royal Assent this week, and the government will then choose an official date when the law will come into force. Prime Minister Justin Trudeau tweeted that until now, ""it's been too easy for our kids to get marijuana - and for criminals to reap the profits"". Allow Twitter content?

But some groups objected to the new law, with opposition Conservative politicians and indigenous groups among those voicing concerns. The government is expected to give the provinces and territories, as well as municipalities, eight to 12 weeks to set up the new marijuana marketplace. This timeframe will also allow industry and police forces to prepare for the new legal framework. In 2015,Canadians were estimated to have spent about C$6bn ($4.5bn, Â£3.4bn) on cannabis- almost as much as they did on wine. It is likely that by mid-September, Canadians will be able to buy cannabis and cannabis oil grown by licensed producers at various retail locations. Canadians across the country will also be able to order the drug online from federally licensed producers, and grow up to four plants at home. This video can not be played Take a look inside the world's largest legal cannabis farm Adults will be able to possess up to 30 grams (one ounce) of dried cannabis in public. Edibles, or cannabis-infused foods, will not be immediately available for purchase but will be within a year of the bill coming into force. The delay is meant to give the government time to set out regulations specific to those products. The minimum legal age to buy and consume marijuana has been set federally at 18 but some provinces have chosen to set it at 19. Canada, provinces reach pot tax deal Cannabis and Canada: Why has drug policy changed? Provinces are in charge of how it is sold and have the power to set various other limits on its use within their jurisdiction - like where it can be smoked. But the federal government has set guidelines for plain packaging with little branding and strict health warnings. It will also impose restrictions on promotions targeting young people, promotion through sponsorships, or depictions of celebrities, characters or animals in advertisements. It will be illegal to possess more than 30 grams of cannabis in public, grow more than four plants per household and to buy from an unlicensed dealer. There will still be some restrictions on cannabis use in Canada Penalties will be severe. Someone caught selling the drug to a minor could be jailed for up to 14 years. Some critics say the penalties are too harsh and not proportional to similar laws like those around selling alcohol to minors. Cannabis is banned in most countries but a number of places have decriminalised its use in recent years.The UK government said recently it would review the use of medicinal cannabis. It is legal for medicinal purposes in 14 European countries, Israel, Argentina, Puerto Rico, Panama, Mexico, Turkey, Zambia and Zimbabwe. In the US, medicinal use is allowed in 29 states and the District of Columbia, Nine of the states have legalised both medical and personal cannabis use. Spain, the Netherlands, Portugal, Slovenia, Jamaica, Chile, Peru, Colombia, Ecuador and Luxembourg are among countries that have relaxed legislation regarding personal use. The new law has not been met with universal praise. Conservative Party leader Andrew Scheer has previously said he was apprehensive it would normalise cannabis use and make it more accessible. Leo Housakos, a Conservative senator from Quebec, tweeted to say that he thought the law would be ""catastrophic for Canadian generations to come"". Allow Twitter content?

One specific concern being raised is the legal minimum age being set at 18 instead of 25, as was recommended by multiple experts. However, the government's own task force recommended 18, warning that setting the age limit too high could continue to encourage youth to buy marijuana on the illegal market. Opponents also question the potential public health impact of legalisation. Meanwhile, indigenous groups and politicians have voiced fears that their communities were not adequately consulted in the run-up to the vote. Indigenous services minister Jane Philpott and health minister Ginette Petitpas Taylor had to write a letter to the chair and deputy chair of the Senate's Committee on Aboriginal Peoples earlier in June promising a full report to parliament addressing their concerns, narrowly averting a delay to the law's passage. This legislation fulfils a 2015 campaign promise by Mr Trudeau, the leader of the Liberal Party. The prime minister has argued that Canada's nearly century-old laws criminalising use of the drug have been ineffective, given that Canadians are still among the world's heaviest users. Polls have repeatedly indicated that a solid majority of Canadians are supportive of the move. The decision to legalise recreational use of marijuana in Canada comes as global trends shift away from criminal prohibition of the widely used drug.

Republicans scramble amid border crisis,"This video can not be played The sound of migrant children separated from parents Republicans are scrambling to draft a bill to address the growing outcry over the policy of separating migrant families at the US-Mexico border. President Donald Trump told a group of House Republicans he would back any immigration bill they passed, a White House spokesman said. The Republican-controlled Congress is under pressure to change the policy, following widespread condemnation. But the president says it is necessary to stop illegal border crossings. ""We had a great meeting,"" Mr Trump said after seeing Republican lawmakers on Tuesday. It is unclear if any progress was made but White House spokesman Raj Shah said Mr Trump had told the group he would endorse their immigration legislation. The president made clear that separating parents and children was ""certainly not an attractive thing and does look bad"", Representative Tom Cole said. Psychological impact on separated children Staff demand Microsoft end immigration work Why US is separating migrant children from parents Earlier on Tuesday Mr Trump said children had to be taken away if their parents were jailed for illegally crossing the US border. ""When you prosecute the parents for coming in illegally - which should happen - you have to take the children away,"" he said. US immigration officials say 2,342 children were separated from 2,206 parents between 5 May and 9 June amid a ""zero-tolerance"" crackdown on illegal immigration brought in by Attorney General Jeff Sessions. Babies and toddlers have been sent to three ""tender age"" shelters after being separated from their parents, the Associated Press news agency reported. Doctors and lawyers who visited the shelters described the infants as hysterical, crying, and acting out,external, according to the AP report. On Wednesday UK Prime Minister Theresa May told Britain's Parliament:""The pictures of children being held in what appear to be cages are deeply disturbing. This is wrong."" In an interview with Reuters news agency, Pope Francis said he supported recent statements by US Catholic bishops who called the policy ""contrary to our Catholic values"" and ""immoral"". French far-right leader Marine Le Pen, who in the past has praised Mr Trump's policy of curbing immigration, told French TV that she disagreed with splitting children from parents. On Tuesday Mexican Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray Caso said the practice was ""cruel and inhuman"", and clearly violated human rights. The US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable, two leading business groups, said the policy was ""contrary to American values"". Governors from at least eight US states - including two Republicans - have reversed their decision to send National Guard troops to the US-Mexico border. What is Trump's family-separation endgame? Who decided to take the children away? Fenced enclosures hold migrant children A new Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll suggests that most Americans oppose the policy, with only 28% supporting it. This video can not be played The US teens training in border patrol Under the ""zero-tolerance"" approach unveiled in May, all undocumented border crossers are criminally charged and jailed. Migrant children cannot be held with their parents, and are kept in separate facilities maintained by the Department of Health and Human Services. Under previous US administrations, undocumented immigrants caught crossing the border for the first time tended to be issued with court summonses. But the Trump administration points out that most of those migrants never showed up for court. This video can not be played US child migrants: Five things to know The White House has been disputing the terminology used to describe its crackdown. It describes the holding centres where children have been pictured in metal chain-link enclosures with concrete floors as ""shelters"" instead of ""cages"". The House of Representatives is preparing this week to vote on a moderate immigration bill. The compromise would limit, but not ban outright, family separations. It would also offer an eventual path to citizenship for undocumented adult immigrants, known as Dreamers, who entered the US as children. The Republican legislation would also provide $25bn (Â£19bn) in funding for border security, including Mr Trump's planned US-Mexico wall. Mixed messages on US migrant policy House Republicans were reportedly working on a revised plan,externalthat would mean children would be detained for longer than is currently allowed but kept with their parents, the Associated Press reports. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell also said he ""hoped to reach out to the Democrats"" about crafting a bipartisan deal. However Democrats argue that no congressional action is required and the president can simply reverse his own policy.

The Gambling Commission's investigation focused on 32Red's dealings with the customer between November 2014 and April 2017 during which time there were at least 22 incidents indicating the customer was a problem gambler. ""Instead of checking on the welfare of a customer displaying problem gambling behaviour, 32Red encouraged the customer to gamble more - this is the exact opposite of what they are supposed to be doing,"" said Richard Watson, the commission's executive director said. ""Operators must take action when they spot signs of problem gambling and should be carefully reviewing all the customers they are having a high level of contact with."" There had also been previous incidents highlighting the gambler's problems but instead of scrutinising these, the customer was offered bonuses to carry on placing bets. The Gambling Commission said 32Red should have reviewed the customer's accounts in August 2016 but one was only conducted in January 2017, when a win of more than Â£1m was instantly gambled again. 888 hit with record Â£7.8m penalty The customer took five weeks to respond to requests about their financial position and failed to offer support when the information was provided, the commission said. The payslip and report of commission for work was ""not credible and showed volatility in receipted income"", according to the Gambling Commission. These showed a monthly net income of Â£13,000 but average monthly deposits were in excess of Â£45,000. The customer's average monthly net salary was actually Â£2,150. The Â£2m penalty includes Â£709,046 divestment of the financial gain, a Â£1.3m payment to be used on the National Responsible Gambling Strategy, intended to tackle problem gambling, and Â£15,000 towards the cost of the investigation. Asked if the customer had stolen the money to gamble, the Gambling Commission  spokesman said: ""The source of the customer's wealth was not known to 32Red because they failed to fulfil their anti-money laundering obligations. We cannot comment on any other proceedings that may be active."" Thelargest penalty imposed by the Gambling Commissionwas the Â£7.8m penalty on betting firm 888 in August 2017. 32Red was taken over by Kindred, a Swedish online betting company, in June 2017.

Australia golf champion Peter Thomson dies,"Peter Thomson holds his third Open Championship trophy in 1956 Peter Thomson, one of Australia's greatest golfers and a five-time Open Championship winner, has died aged 88. Thomson had been suffering from Parkinson's disease for more than four years and died at his home in Melbourne on Wednesday, Golf Australia said. In 1954, he became the first Australian to claim the Open Championship in Britain. He is survived by his wife, Mary, four children, 11 grandchildren and four great-grandchildren. Among numerous accolades, Thomson was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1979 and an Officer of the Order of Australia (AO) in 2001. Only four other golfers - Harry Vardon, JH Taylor, James Braid and Tom Watson - have won as many Open Championships. Thomson also had great success on the American circuit. In addition to his playing achievements, he went on to be president of the Australian PGA for 32 years and helped establish the Asian Tour. Tributes posted online celebrated him as a towering figure of the sport. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

NHS 'closed ranks' over hospital deaths,"A former health minister has accused the NHS of closing ranks after the deaths in hospital of elderly patients from alleged overprescribed painkiller drugs. Norman Lamb said the NHS and elements of Whitehall had refused to face up to ""hard and uncomfortable facts"". The Liberal Democrat MP served as a health minister between 2012-15 during the coalition government. He was speaking to the BBC on the eve of the publication of a report into hundreds of deaths at Gosport War Memorial Hospital near Portsmouth in the 1990s. The former bishop of Liverpool James Jones has spent the last four years chairing an independent panel which has been examining the deaths of elderly patients who were allegedly prescribed the painkiller diamorphine. Jones chaired the independent Hillsborough panel. Dr Jane Barton, a local GP who cared for the some of the patients at Gosport, was found guilty in 2010 by the General Medical Council of ""serious professional misconduct"" after it concluded that she had prescribed potentially hazardous levels of drugs. Dr Barton was not struck off and she chose to retire after the findings. Police examined 92 cases among the 833 death certificates signed by the GP. Dr Barton has previously denied wrongdoing and has maintained that she always acted in the interests of her patients. In an interview with BBC Newsnight Norman Lamb spoke of his anger when department of health officials advised him in 2013 that a public enquiry should not be held after the publication of an official report into the deaths. The report by Professor Richard Baker of Leicester University found that opiate painkillers had ""almost certainly shortened the lives of some patients"". The Baker report was completed in 2003 but not published until ten years later once all the inquests had been completed. This video can not be played ""There's been a real systemic failure here,"" says former health minister Norman Lamb Lamb told BBC Newsnight: ""I just think it's horrific and there has been a real systemic failure here, a closing of ranks in my view and a sense that ordinary people just weren't being listened to at all, and an unwillingness by the NHS to face up to some really serious allegations about what happened in that hospital."" The former minister recalled his reaction when he was advised by department of health officials in 2013, in an email sent to him on holiday in France, that a public enquiry should not be held. He said: ""I was incandescent about this so I immediately sensed that there might have been a conspiracy to cover this up whilst I was out of the country. To this day I dont know whether it was cock up or cover up but I was very clear in my mind that there must on no account be that statement made the next day."" Lamb said he persuaded ministerial colleagues to launch the enquiry. The findings will be published tomorrow. A spokesperson for the Department of Health and Social Care said: ""Norman Lamb, in his capacity as a Minister at the Department of Health at the time, was instrumental in the decision to set up a panel investigation into the tragic events at Gosport. The Government, along with local NHS organisations and authorities, will receive a copy of the report tomorrow and we expect the findings to be studied closely and carefully by all relevant parties.""

LiveReaction to hospital deaths report,"As many as 650 people have died after being given powerful painkillers inappropriately, it has been found. The lives of 456 patients were shortened by the use of opiates and the panel found another 200 were ""probably similarly affected"". The report follows several inquiries into the prescribing of sedatives at Gosport War Memorial Hospital. Health and social care secretary, Jeremy Hunt, apologises to families for what they have been through. A fresh review, led by former Bishop of Liverpool James Jones, spoke to more than 100 families and analysed 800 death certificates. Relatives said they hoped it would end their ""harrowing"" wait for answers. MP George Hollingbery said: âI
have two families in the Meon Valley in touch with me who lost loved ones at
the hospital, including one who saw both her parents die there. ""I have made it
clear to them that lessons from what happened and the accountability of those
involved would be raised in the House. âThe
government will now respond fully to the report in the Autumn. The families,
who have worked so hard to find answers for 20 years, need reassurance that all
authorities will ensure such deaths cannot happen again.â Hampshire Constabulary's chief Constable, Olivia Pinkney, has added this afternoon that it is ""already apparent"" from reading the 370 page report that the panel has had sight of information not previously seen by her police force. She said: ""It is important that a process is put in place to ensure that all of the
relevant agencies come together, to enable decisions about next steps to be made
in a way that is well considered and transparent to all of the families."" A doctor is expected to prolong life, not shorten it. Who is Dr Barton? A doctor is expected to prolong life, not shorten it. Who is Dr Barton? Rachel Power, Chief Executive of the Patients Association, said: âWe have heard of many instances of poor care over the years, but to
deliberately shorten the lives of patients represents the very worst betrayal
of patients that any doctor can commit. âThe report makes clear that leaders, clinicians and nurses at the hospital
were all aware of what was happening, but that the failure to act ran from top
to bottom. âAlthough the NHS has made progress in recent years, it is hard to feel
confident that failings of this sort are impossible in todayâs health service.âWhen patients and their families raise concerns in future they must be
properly listened to and given full and open answers.â Concerns were first raised about treatment at the Gosport War Memorial Hospital in 1998. Matthew McClelland, director of fitness to practise at the Nursing and
Midwifery Council, said: ""I want to pay tribute to the families who have fought
for 20 years to understand what happened to their loved ones at Gosport. ""It's clear that we and others badly let them down and I am very sorry for the
role we have played in that. ""We will now carry out a careful review of the report to see what action we
may need to take and what lessons we can learn. ""What we do know is that our communications with some of the families was
unacceptable and for some of those who lost loved ones, we added to their
distress. ""This report is a stark reminder that patients and
their families must always be at the heart of what we do."" Vernon Gregory died at the hospital in 1989. His daughter Linda spoke following the disclosure of the report today. She said: âNot only was my dad, in the
1980s at Gosport War Memorial Hospital, laying in a coma due to being overdosed
and left to die, two years ago my mum was found also in a coma by myself at
another hospital after going in for routine care, rather like my father, and
she never came out alive. âSomething needs to be done soon in all hospitals to prevent
such things ever happening again.â When asked whether an outside police force should now
investigate the new findings, she said âitâs difficult to say but maybe yes, call in an outside forceâ. Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said if police decide to bring criminal prosecutions they would have the support of the government. New Forest East MP Julian Lewis asked if Mr Hunt would agree that people who ""are found wilfully to have administered lethal drug doses unnecessarily they deserve to lose their liberty."" Mr Hunt replied: ""I don't think anyone
in this House wouldn't share (his) sentiments but we have to let the law take
its course now and we have to make sure that justice is done, and it has been
denied for too long."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long-time campaigner Gillian Mackenzie, whose mother Gladys
Richards died aged 91 at the hospital in 1998, welcomed the report and hoped it
would mean those involved would âget their comeuppanceâ. She added: âTheyâll have to bring 15 of the strongest cases
into the criminal court because thatâs where it deserves to go, whether thatâs
my case or not. âAs far as Iâm concerned they have to get a conviction for
all the rest of the families.â Gillian Mackenzie Ken Woolleyâs father John died at the hospital in 1996 after
being admitted for a broken hip. He said: âAs soon as we saw him the next day he was unable
to communicate due to the drugs theyâd given him. âThere was another 11 days where he still couldnât
communicate before he died.â Ken Woolley Asked how he felt about the report, Mr Woolley, from Portsmouth, said: âVindication, upset, distress, anger. âSomething has to come of this â they have to get to the bottom of it.â He added he was not against Hampshire Constabulary leading a new investigation despite criticism for their previous inquiries. âThere will be a new focus and significant pressure this time so they should be able to do the job.â They are the scandals that haunt the NHS. How can they happen time and time again? Bridget Reeves' grandmother was one of the more than 450 people to die at the hospital in Gosport. Alongside its report, the panel haspublished an online archive,externalof
documentation. The panel is aware that some documents include personal opinions
of individuals and statements about individuals, where those concerned have not
had the opportunity to respond to comments or criticism. In reading the
disclosed documents it is important to be sensitive to this situation. Kate Blackwell QC, who served on the panel, said: ""One family member said that in fact for her, this was the beginning. ""Twenty years or so too late but eventually, they were being recognised and the fault of the hospital was being recognised. She added: ""They were confident that today's report is the start of the process that should have taken place a long time ago."" The Rt Rev Jones said there had been
""lots of tears"" and ""grieving"" when families were presented with the findings of
the report this morning. He said the report did not
explore why the practice of prescribing may have taken place at the
hospital. ""Questions about motive are beyond the
terms of reference for the panel, but those are questions that will need to be
prosecuted."" Bridget Reeves also said this had been an ""inexcusable failure"" of the patients. She said: ""It is scandalous and immoral. They have grossly failed by abusing people's human rights. ""It is more than catastrophic, this sort of behaviour in our NHS is chilling and precarious."" Bridget Reeves added that during the complaints process ""every government body locked together with no chance of impartiality and ultimately the truth."" She said: ""They are all clearly desensitised. Our families whose lives ended so inhumanely, the insensitivity of it all."" Miss Reeves said that none of the families of hospital victims would have allowed their loved ones to be admitted had they known about the police investigation. She added: ""The people of Gosport have the right to know."" Bridget Reeves, whose grandmother Elsie Divine, 88, died at
the hospital in 1999, said: âThis has been sinister, calculated and those
implicated must now face the full rigour of the criminal justice system. âAccountability must take precedent here. âThese horrifying, shameful, unforgivable actions need to be
disclosed in a criminal court for a jury to decide and only then can we put our
loved ones to rest.â Bridget Reeves The Nursing and Midwifery
Council (NMC) has responded to the Gosport Independent Panel Report. Director of
Fitness to Practise, Matthew McClelland, said: ""I want to
pay tribute to the families who have fought for 20 years to understand what
happened to their loved ones at Gosport. ""Itâs clear that we and others badly
let them down and I am very sorry for the role we have played in that. ""We will now
carry out a careful review of the report to see what action we may need to take
and what lessons we can learn. ""What we do know is that our communications with some of the families was unacceptable and for some of those who lost loved ones, we added to their distress. ""While the way we regulate nurses and midwives has changed significantly and improved in recent years, this report is a stark reminder that patients and their families must always be at the heart of what we do."" Families of some of the patients who died due to the use of powerful painkillers have come together outside Portsmouth Cathedral, where the report was revealed today. Â© 2025 BBC.

Hospital deaths inquiry extended,"Inquests into the deaths of 10 patients, seven of whom are pictured, were held in 2009 The end date of an investigation into dozens of suspicious deaths of elderly patients at a hospital in Hampshire has been pushed back. A review of the deathsat Gosport War Memorial Hospital between 1988 and 2000 found an ""almost routine use of opiates had almost certainly"" shortened the lives of some patients. The investigation, launched in 2014, was due to conclude in December 2017. The government said the work was now likely to end in spring 2018. Police investigated the deaths of 92 patients but brought no prosecutions. During a written parliamentary statement, health minister Philip Dunne said: ""As a consequence of the greater number of families now in contact with the Panel and the increase in the volume of material the Panel is reviewing, the Panel now expects to complete its work in spring 2018.""

GCHQ boss urges co-operation on plots,"GCHQ played a critical role in foiling at least four European terror plots in the past year and the co-operation must continue after Brexit, the intelligence agency's head has said. Jeremy Fleming said the sharing of intelligence data should not be allowed to ""lag behind the pace of the threat"". The UK's future use of EU security measures and tools has come under scrutiny since the Brexit vote. The government is seeking a bespoke co-operation deal with the EU. Speaking after a meeting with officials at Nato in Brussels, Mr Fleming, said: ""It's also important, post-Brexit, that we have mechanisms that allow us to share insight and expertise."" UK 'can't keep European Arrest Warrant' Europol head fears loss of UK influence after Brexit Inside GCHQ's operations centre The BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera said Mr Fleming's comments could be seen as a message to UK officials involved in negotiations with the EU that politics should not intrude in any future arrangements. It was also a reminder to those in Europe about the extent to which Britain contributes vital intelligence, our correspondent added. Mr Fleming, who took up his post as director of GCHQ in March 2017, highlighted the importance of the existing UK-EU security links, saying they save lives. He said: ""This visit comes at a pivotal time of course as the UK leaves the EU and as we agree a treaty on security to ensure that the UK and EU member states continue to work together to keep us all secure in the future."" Mr Fleming became director of GCHQ in March 2017 ""We're leaving the EU but not Europe. And after Brexit, the UK will continue to work with the EU and the EU member states. We have excellent relationships with intelligence and security agencies right across the continent."" He said ""protecting our nations and our people"" was becoming more complex. He highlighted the use of online platforms by both the Islamic State group and criminal gangs. Mr Fleming also referred to an increased threat from ""aggressive foreign powers"" with ""military provocation, cyber intrusion and disinformation to impose their agendas"". He said the Russian government has shown its ""blatant disregard for the consequences of its actions"", adding that thepoisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, blamed by the UK on Moscow, had concerned the UK's Nato allies. Mr Fleming said: ""These threats are more complex and more global and none of us can defend against them alone.

Five injured in Tube station explosion,"Police said the cause of the explosion appeared to be a battery short circuiting Five people were injured in an explosion at a Tube station. Witnesses described smelling ""burning rubber"" and seeing ""six-foot flames"" at the entrance to Southgate Underground station in Enfield. Police said the ""minor explosion"", at about 19:00 BST on Tuesday, was thought to have been caused by a battery. Paramedics treated five people at the scene and took two to hospital. Police said they were ""working to establish the full facts"". London Mayor Sadiq Khan said the explosion had been ""confirmed as non suspicious"" and thanked the emergency services ""for a swift and professional response"". James Ayton, 34, from Southgate, was on the ""packed"" escalator when he saw a ""quick burst"" of flames at the top. He said they were ""six foot plus"" and everyone ""legged it"" upon hearing a ""rapid whooshing sound"". ""The Tube had just unloaded. The escalator was full,"" he said. ""A few people on the escalator got trampled on. There was screaming. ""An old woman got trampled on. I had to carry a woman up the stairs. I think she was in shock to be honest. She couldn't walk, shaking."" Witnesses described smelling ""burning rubber"" at the entrance to the station He said he saw a Tube worker pick something up that was on fire and extinguish it but added: ""I think that was secondary rather than the cause."" Haluk Ozkan was about to get on a bus outside the station when he smelled something burning. The finance worker, 26, who was with his partner at the time, said: ""We were just outside the exit. We could smell a burning smell, like burning rubber."" ""We thought the bus engine had over-heated,"" he added. ""We then saw people rushing to get out of the station. Not necessarily running or panicking, but moving quickly. ""Then my partner saw a station staff member pointing a fire extinguisher at something and heard it go off, but we didn't see what it was directed at."" The Met said officers are ""working to establish the full facts"" A London Ambulance spokesperson said: ""We were called at 19:02 BST to an incident at Station Parade, N14. ""We have treated three patients at the scene for minor injuries and have taken two people to hospital."" Specialist officers said the cause of the explosion appeared to be a battery short circuit. Enquires are ongoing to establish the ""full facts"", a Met spokesman added. Cordons were put in place and the station was closed, although services are running this morning.

The FBI said I was my parents' stolen baby,"When a one-day-old baby, Paul Joseph Fronczak, was stolen from a Chicago hospital in 1964, the terrible story made headlines across America. Then, two years later, an abandoned boy was identified as the missing baby and handed over to the relieved parents. Years later, Paul began to investigate what had happened - and was shocked by what he found. Paul Fronczak was 10 when he went hunting for Christmas presents in his parents' basement. He pushed aside a sofa to get into the crawl space. There, he discovered three mysterious boxes full of letters, sympathy cards and newspaper clippings. One headline read: ""200 search for stolen baby."" Another: ""Mother asks kidnapper to return baby."" He recognised his parents in the pictures, looking distraught and much younger. Then he read that their baby son, Paul Joseph, had been kidnapped. ""Wow, that's me!"" he thought. It was a sensational tale. On 26 April 1964 his mother, Dora Fronczak, had given birth to a baby boy in the Michael Reese hospital in Chicago. She had nursed the baby throughout the day - when he wasn't sleeping with other babies in the nursery. But the following morning a woman dressed as a nurse came into Dora's room and took him to be examined by a doctor. She never returned. Hospital staff realised something had gone wrong, and a frantic search was soon under way. However, the hospital didn't notify the authorities - or the baby's parents - until that afternoon. At 3pm they called the father, Chester Fronczak, at the factory where he worked as a machinist. ""My dad had to leave work, go to the hospital and tell his wife that the baby was missing,"" says Paul. ""You think you're safe - you're in a hospital - and that's where your baby is kidnapped."" The biggest manhunt in Chicago's history was then launched, involving 175,000 postal workers, 200 police officers and the FBI. They had searched 600 homes by midnight, but to no avail. Excited by his discovery, Paul ran upstairs with a handful of clippings to ask his mother if they were about him. Dora reacted angrily, telling him off for snooping. Then she admitted: ""Yes, you were kidnapped, we found you, we love you, and that's all you need to know."" Paul knew not to bring up the subject again, and he didn't - for another 40 years. But his curiosity was not satisfied and often, when he was alone in the house, he would sneak back into the crawl space to read more. That was how he learned about the next part of the story - how he came to live with the Fronczaks. After the kidnapping, Dora and Chester stayed in hospital for a week, waiting for news. When they returned home, they were hounded by the press. Despite all the publicity, there were no credible leads - their baby had disappeared without trace. The investigation was quietly shelved. Then, in March 1966, nearly two years later, Dora and Chester received a letter from the FBI - a toddler had been found in Newark, New Jersey, who matched their son's description. The boy had been abandoned in a pushchair in a busy shopping centre the previous July and had been placed with a foster family, the Eckerts. They had baptised him Scott McKinley and were so fond of him they were considering adopting him. Before they could, however, a New Jersey police detective had the idea that the boy might be the missing baby from Chicago. A social worker holds the little foundling with a bruised face - soon to be baptised as Scott The FBI began to test that hunch. There wasn't much to go on - there was no record of Paul Joseph's blood type, nor had the hospital taken the baby's fingerprints or footprints. All they had was a single photograph taken on the day he was born - and the shape of the baby's ear in that picture was very similar to that of the abandoned toddler. ""They ended up testing over 10,000 boys that could possibly be Paul, and I was the only one they couldn't fully exclude,"" says Paul. The Fronczaks were elated to hear the news. ""Back then the FBI was the elite authority, and when they tell you something you believe it,"" says Paul. Three months later they drove from Chicago to meet the boy who might be their son in the offices of the New Jersey children's services. All three had been put through a series of psychological tests before the meeting. Dora and Chester had also had to be approved to adopt the child now officially known as Scott. ""An FBI agent walked me in and they let us get acquainted for a while,"" says Paul. ""My mum had only spent less than a day with her son before he was taken out of the hospital. And then, years later, she sees this child."" Dora has since told Paul that she felt the world was watching her. ""She could either say, 'I'm not sure,' and put this child back into the system, or say, 'Yes, that's my son,' - and even if it was not, save this child from what could be a horrible life."" Dora said it was her son. ""She did what she thought was right, and I'm glad she did,"" says Paul. They took him to Chicago and formally adopted him. The Fronczaks were loving parents, if - understandably - over-protective. Sometimes, that led to clashes. Paul was sent to a Catholic school with a strict dress code, but he liked rock music and wore his hair long. Once, during a heated argument over the length of his hair, Dora said: ""I wish they'd never found you."" That stuck with Paul. ""Even to this day just thinking about it, I feel it in my soul,"" he says. Paul with long hair After graduating from high school, Paul left home to be a bass player with a rock band in Arizona. Five years later, when the band broke up, he returned to Chicago but soon got restless and joined the army for a year. Afterwards he moved around, working as a salesman and, later, as a model and actor. Eventually he settled in Las Vegas. ""I moved probably at least 50 times in my life and I've had well over 200 jobs. And no matter where I go or what I do, I've always had those paper clippings with me,"" he says. In 2008 Paul married for the second time and soon he and his wife, Michelle, a teacher, were expecting a daughter. Paul was delighted. But when the obstetrician asked about their families' medical histories, it hit Paul that he wasn't really sure how to answer. Ever since finding out about the kidnapping, he had wondered if he was really his parents' son. ""I actually thought: 'What are the chances of me being this one baby taken from Chicago?' ""I was found so far away, it just seemed so unfathomable."" He had always felt that he did not fit in. His parents seemed closer to his younger brother, Dave. They were all quiet and reserved, whereas Paul liked loud music and fast motorbikes. They looked different, too. ""Dave looked exactly like my dad - mannerisms, facial expressions, the body-build, everything. And I looked like neither."" Paul with his father, Chester, and brother, Dave Now the question began to haunt him - was he really the stolen baby? ""For years I had wanted to do a DNA test with my parents,"" says Paul. ""Not because I wasn't happy, I just wanted to know the truth. I had always found a reason not to do it - I didn't want to hurt them - but there came a point when I needed to know."" He had also been put off by the expense. But one day in 2012 Paul spotted over-the-counter DNA kits for sale and bought some. When his parents came over from Chicago for a visit, Paul plucked up the courage to broach the subject, about an hour before they were due to leave. ""Have you ever wondered if I'm your real son?"" he asked. Caught by surprise, his parents admitted that they had. ""Would you like to find out?"" Minutes later, everyone had swabbed their cheeks and the kits were sealed. Then Paul took his parents to the airport. But by the time their plane landed a few hours later, Dora and Chester had changed their minds. They rang Paul, asking him not to send off the kits - he was their son, and that was the end of it. ""I kept those samples in my desk drawer for a couple of weeks,"" says Paul. ""I wrestled with that every day because I love my parents, I wanted to respect their wishes, but sometimes you just have to do what you feel is right. How can you be wrong, trying to find the truth?"" So he sent the samples off. More from BBC Stories Inside the North Korean place that doesn't exist Life after Mr Heroin He was at work when he got a phone call about the results. After answering some security questions he was told there was ""no remote possibility"" that he was Paul Fronczak, Dora and Chester's biological son. ""I just felt like my life as I knew it was ended. I felt the colour drain from my face. I couldn't think. I got all sweaty,"" says Paul. ""Everything I thought I knew about myself - my birthday, my medical history, being Polish, being Catholic, even being a Taurus - went out the window, and for a second I didn't know who I was."" The results raised two urgent questions. Who were Paul's parents, if not Dora and Chester Fronczak? And what had happened to the real Paul? Before he had even told his parents the news, Paul called a local investigative journalist, George Knapp, to ask for help. Soon Paul Joseph Fronczak was a national news story once again. His family - who shunned the media - were furious, and didn't speak to him for over a year. ""You've got to understand, the main reason I did this was to find my parents' real child,"" says Paul. ""They were the most amazing parents. The best gift I could give them would be to find their kidnapped child, and I thought the best way to do this would be to invoke the help of the media."" This video can not be played Paul Fronczak describes the moment he got his DNA results One consequence of going public was that the FBI reopened the Fronczak kidnapping case. They had located 10 boxes full of original case files in Chicago - but because the DNA results proved that he was not the stolen baby, Paul had no right to see any of it. He did, however, speak to one of the retired FBI agents who worked on the original case, Bernie Carey, who admitted that some of the team had not been convinced they had found the right child. Paul had more luck with the search for his biological parents. A team of volunteers called the DNA Detectives took on the case free of charge. Led by the genetic genealogist, CeCe Moore, they used a combination of DNA testing and classic investigation techniques: searching newspapers and public records, trawling through social media, and endless phone interviews. Paul meets the genealogists working on the case - Michelle Trostler, CeCe Moore, Allison Demski and Carol Rolnick Although Paul had been found in New Jersey, they traced his family to Tennessee. Meanwhile his DNA test had revealed Ashkenazi Jewish roots. ""I knew one side of the family had to have a Jewish grandparent,"" says Moore. But there were also many setbacks. It was months before they made their breakthrough - a conversation with one of Paul's potential relatives, who mentioned that there were some missing twins in the family. ""That's when we knew we were finally heading in the right direction,"" says Moore. Genealogist Michelle Trostler in front of the ""wall of stickies"" she assembled for the case It was on 3 June 2015, two years after they had begun their investigation, that she spoke to Paul on the phone. ""What do you think of the name Jack?"" she asked him. Paul said, ""It's a strong name. It's a good name."" Moore said, ""Well that's your name."" That was how he found out he was born Jack Rosenthal, and that he was six months older than he had always thought - his new birthday was 27 October 1963. And there was a kicker: he had a twin sister, Jill. But she, like him, had vanished. So now Paul had a third person to find. ""I don't think you could hear that you have a twin, and not seek that person for the rest of your life,"" says Moore. Meeting his relatives was exciting at first. Paul, who had always been drawn to music, was delighted to discover that his cousin, Lenny Rocco, was a musician too - he had been a doo-wop singer in the 1950s. ""To me, that really proves that you don't have to be raised by your real parents to have those same qualities and traits - like musical ability, I was never exposed to it, but I was drawn to it,"" says Paul. ""I've played in bands all my life, and when I got to meet my real family, I got to sit down and play with Lenny's band."" Paul and his cousin, Lenny Rocco Moore, who has reunited thousands of families, sees this kind of thing all the time. ""People meet each other that were raised in completely different households and there are so many similarities,"" she says. ""It's not just how they look, it's the choices they've made in life - who they've married, what they've named their children, what occupation they chose, even down to the oddest details, like the password on their phone. I do believe that much more is coded in our DNA than we realise - it can't be coincidence."" But not all of his relatives welcomed him with open arms, and Paul soon discovered there was a dark side to his biological family. His mother, Marie, had been a heavy drinker, and his father, Gilbert, had come back from the war in Korea ""an angry man"". There is evidence that Paul and his twin sister Jill - who had two older sisters and a younger brother - had been badly neglected. They were always crying, the family says, and one cousin remembers seeing the babies sitting ""in a cage"". Nobody knows exactly what happened, but whenever family members asked about the twins they were told that another member of the family was looking after them - when in fact it seems that no-one was. Paul thinks that ""something tragic"" may have befallen Jill, and that that may have prompted the decision to get rid of Jack, ""because they couldn't explain just one twin"". In his book, The Foundling, Paul describes the twists and turns of his obsessive - and sometimes daring - search for answers. At one point he digs up the garden of the house where the Rosenthals had once lived, hoping in vain to find the remains of his twin sister. ""My real parents were really not very nice people. I'm thankful that they abandoned me because it allowed me to be with the Fronczaks. They saved my life,"" says Paul. Two years after their fall-out over the DNA results, Paul made peace with his adoptive parents, and for the first time he sat down with them to really talk about what happened. Dora told him what she had been through. ""I know now that those events shaped my mum into the way she is today,"" says Paul. ""My mum has this never-ending guilt of handing Paul over to the nurse. Even though she knows that in a hospital that's what you do - the nurse says, 'We need your baby,' you hand the baby over. But it's something that she's wrestled with her whole life."" Dora also gave Paul a photo album and letters that had been passed on by the Eckerts, the foster family who had looked after him for a year and baptised him Scott McKinley. ""My mum had this photo album all my life and had never even mentioned it. It makes me kind of misty because these are the first pictures I have of me being a child. Even my real family have no baby pictures of me - my grandmother had a photo album with all the kids in chronological order, and the page with the twins on it was ripped out."" Paul as a young boy Paul's father, Chester, died last August, but Paul speaks to his mum every couple of days. Dora will be 82 on 27 October - coincidentally, they now share a birthday. Dora has mixed feelings about the book. ""She wishes that I hadn't been quite so open and honest about everything,"" he says. ""But I wrote an honest book."" Paul is as determined as ever to find out what really happened to Dora's son. He still has a private investigator working on the case, and says the next step is to exhume a body. In fact, he wants to exhume two bodies. ""We have a really strong lead on a possible biological Paul - and the other is possibly my twin sister."" Exhumation is a complex and costly process, but Paul is undeterred. There are still many unanswered questions. ""The story is by no means anywhere near finished,"" he says. He and his second wife are now divorced, although still good friends. Paul admits that his obsession with the investigation may have contributed to their break-up. ""It got to the point where every waking minute I was doing something involved with this search,"" he says. He regrets nothing, however. ""This was something that I had to do. It has made me feel more at peace."" It has also helped him to understand things about himself, such as why he could never seem to settle down. ""The first couple of years of my life really shaped who I am: I'm able to walk away from anybody, any job, any situation and never look back. I think that's part of having three childhoods, three identities at such a young age. It's about adapting. It's about survival. It's about getting to the next day."" CeCe Moore also wonders how all this affected the young Paul. She is curious about what happened to him in the months when he was reportedly being examined by the FBI. ""What made them come to the conclusion that he was Paul Fronczak? Were there signs of trauma that perhaps were misinterpreted as a baby that had been kidnapped, rather than a baby that had a somewhat abusive life?"" she asks. Paul and his daughter, Emma Paul's daughter, Emma, is now nine - she thinks it's funny to call him Jack, and sometimes does, to tease him. But he has decided not to change his name yet. ""I'm going to stay Paul until they find Paul. The day I find Paul, I'm going to hand him his birth certificate, and I'm going to claim mine.""

Staff demand Microsoft end immigration work,"Microsoft boss Satya Nadella is being put under pressure by his rank-and-file to end its work with US Border Patrol A letter signed by more than 100 Microsoft employees has called on it to stop working with the US Border Patrol. The call comes as the Trump administrationfaces intense criticism over the separation of childrenfrom their families at the Mexican border. The letter, posted on an internal message board andpublished by the New York Times,external, said the employees ""refuse to be complicitâ. Microsoft has shared a response penned by its chief executive Satya Nadella. ""I am appalled at the abhorrent policy of separating immigrant children from their families,""he wrote,external. ""This new policy implemented on the border is simply cruel and abusive, and we are standing for change. ""I want to be clear: Microsoft is not working with the US government on any projects related to separating children from their families at the border."" More on this story Why US is separating migrant children from parents Psychological impact on separated children Mixed messages on US migrant policy However, the company does have a $19.4m (Â£14.7m) contract with the US Immigration, Customs and Enforcement agency, known as ICE. Mr Nadella said this was to support tasks involving email, calendar, messaging and document management. In January,Microsoft posted information,externalabout how its cloud computing platform, Azure, was being used to facilitate data âsecurity and complianceâ. The post read: âWe're proud to support this work with our mission-critical cloud.â The signees of the letter to Microsoft chief executive Satya Nadella demand the company ends this association with ICE, and ""other clients who directly enable ICEâ. Their efforts chime with the thoughts being expressed by employees at many of Silicon Valleyâs top firms. On Tuesday, some of the regionâs top chief executives made statements on the issue. âThe stories and images of families being separated at the border are gut-wrenching,âwrote Sundar Pichai,external, Googleâs chief executive, on Twitter. ""Urging our government to work together to find a better, more humane way that is reflective of our values as a nation.â Apple boss Tim Cook, speaking after an event in Ireland,told the Irish Times,externalthe situation was âinhumaneâ.

I think that whatâs happening is inhumane, it needs to stop.â Facebook's Mark Zuckerberg said,external: ""We need to stop this policy right now."" Other condemnations have come from the bosses at AirBnB, Twilio and Box. A fundraiser on Facebook had raised more than $6m on Tuesday,external, growing at a rate of thousands of dollars every minute. It is the largest amount ever raised on the platform. Employee rebellion recently saw Google drop its contract with the US Department of Defense.

GCHQ boss urges co-operation after Brexit,"GCHQ played a critical role in foiling at least four European terror plots in the past year and the co-operation must continue after Brexit, the intelligence agency's head has said. Jeremy Fleming said the sharing of intelligence data should not be allowed to ""lag behind the pace of the threat"". The UK's future use of EU security measures and tools has come under scrutiny since the Brexit vote. The government is seeking a bespoke co-operation deal with the EU. Speaking after a meeting with officials at Nato in Brussels, Mr Fleming, said: ""It's also important, post-Brexit, that we have mechanisms that allow us to share insight and expertise."" UK 'can't keep European Arrest Warrant' Europol head fears loss of UK influence after Brexit Inside GCHQ's operations centre The BBC's security correspondent Gordon Corera said Mr Fleming's comments could be seen as a message to UK officials involved in negotiations with the EU that politics should not intrude in any future arrangements. It was also a reminder to those in Europe about the extent to which Britain contributes vital intelligence, our correspondent added. Mr Fleming, who took up his post as director of GCHQ in March 2017, highlighted the importance of the existing UK-EU security links, saying they save lives. He said: ""This visit comes at a pivotal time of course as the UK leaves the EU and as we agree a treaty on security to ensure that the UK and EU member states continue to work together to keep us all secure in the future."" Mr Fleming became director of GCHQ in March 2017 ""We're leaving the EU but not Europe. And after Brexit, the UK will continue to work with the EU and the EU member states. We have excellent relationships with intelligence and security agencies right across the continent."" He said ""protecting our nations and our people"" was becoming more complex. He highlighted the use of online platforms by both the Islamic State group and criminal gangs. Mr Fleming also referred to an increased threat from ""aggressive foreign powers"" with ""military provocation, cyber intrusion and disinformation to impose their agendas"". He said the Russian government has shown its ""blatant disregard for the consequences of its actions"", adding that thepoisoning of a former Russian spy and his daughter in Salisbury, blamed by the UK on Moscow, had concerned the UK's Nato allies. Mr Fleming said: ""These threats are more complex and more global and none of us can defend against them alone. They require a pooling of resource, expertise and, critically, data so that we can investigate and disrupt our adversaries.""

'Harrowing' wait for patient deaths report,"Inquests into the deaths of 10 patients, six of whom are pictured, were held in 2009 Families of hundreds of people who died at a scandal-hit hospital hope a report published later could end a decades-long wait for the truth. The report follows several inquiries into the prescribing of sedatives at Gosport War Memorial Hospital. A fresh review,led by former Bishop of Liverpool James Jones, spoke to more than 100 families and analysed 800 death certificates. Relatives said they hoped it would end their ""harrowing"" wait for answers. Bishop Jones previously urged families with concerns to contact the inquiry Bishop Jones chaired the Hillsborough Independent Panel whose work in examining documents and evidence led to the new inquests into the deaths at the 1989 disaster. He said the Gosport Independent Panel's report, which was commissioned in 2014, would first be shared with affected families at Portsmouth Cathedral before it is made public. So far, the only person to face disciplinary action has been Dr Jane Barton, who was found guilty of failings in her care of 12 patients at the hospital between 1996 and 1999. Dr Jane Barton was found guilty of serious professional misconduct in 2010 The panel's investigation is expected to focus on those who died while under the care of the hospital's Department of Medicine for Elderly People. A campaign by a number of families led to inquests into 10 deaths at the hospital which found drugs were a contributory factor in some cases. Elsie Devine, 88, from Fareham, was admitted to the hospital in 1999 with confusion and kidney problems. Her notes showed she had been sitting up and chatting happily, but she was given powerful sedatives, lost consciousness and never recovered. In 2009, an inquest found the drugs she had been given were not appropriate for her condition and had contributed to her death. Sent to Gosport War Memorial Hospital to recover from a hip operation, Gladys Richards, 91, from Lee-on-Solent, later died after being given opiates and sedatives. An inquest jury found they""more than insignificantly"" contributed to her death. Elsie Devine 88, from Fareham, was admitted to the hospital in 1999 with confusion and kidney problems The panel would not disclose the total number of deaths discussed in its report, but Bishop Jonespreviously urged families with concerns over the treatment of their deceased relativesin the 1980s and early 2000s to come forward. His team had been due to return its findings last December, but the deadline was extended as more families came forward and the volume of material being reviewed increased. As well as speaking to more than 100 families and analysing about 800 death certificates, the panel also analysed documents from the police, coroners, the NHS and other organisations before writing its report. The panel also included geriatric medicine specialist Dr Colin Currie, investigative journalist David Hencke, former Scotland Yard Commander Duncan Jarrett and pathology and medical records expert Dr Bill Kirkup. At its launch four years ago, former Care Minister Norman Lamb said the new inquiry would address what he called ""unanswered questions"" about the care of those who died. Mr Lamb described the families' wait for answers as ""scandalous"". ""There has been a real systemic failure here. . .a closing of ranks in my view,"" he added. This video can not be played ""There's been a real systemic failure here,"" says former health minister Norman Lamb Concerns over deaths at the hospital were first raised in 1998, with previous investigations focusing on the prescribing of sedatives at the hospital. A report first compiled by Prof Richard Baker in 2003 and published 10 years later found evidence of an ""almost routine use of opiates"" since 1998. This had, he said, ""almost certainly shortened the lives of some patients"". While it was not possible to identify the origin of the practice, he wrote, it could not be ruled out that a small number of those who died would otherwise have been discharged from hospital alive. Police previously investigated the deaths of 92 patients at the hospital but no prosecutions were brought. The only person to face disciplinary action was Dr Barton. A General Medical Council hearing in 2010 found she had prescribed ""potentially hazardous"" levels of drugs to patients who later died at the hospital. She told the council she had to work under ""unreasonable pressure"" with an ""excessive and increasing burden"" in caring for patients. Despite the council's findings, the Crown Prosecution Servicesaid there was insufficient evidence for a prosecution on gross negligence manslaughter charges. Elsie Devine's granddaughter, Bridget Reeves, said she had a room in her house ""filled with boxes and boxes of paperwork"" about her grandmother's death. ""My mother has campaigned just relentlessly for justice - for the truth - and I don't think, unless you walk in our shoes, you can understand exactly what it's been like,"" she said. ""It's been harrowing - I mean it's nearly 20 years for us."" Ms Reeves is among the relatives who previously criticised the decision to form an independent panel. ""The frustration is that when we started we wanted a public inquiry but we were told very clearly that the cost would be far too great,"" she said. Gladys Richards' daughter Gillian McKenzie was the first relative to approach the police about a death at the hospital in 1998. She said she hoped there would be a debate in parliament following the report findings and there would be ""enough pressure"" for criminal proceedings to commence. ""There has to be justice and somebody has to be answerable,"" she said.

'Impossible' French exam 'a disgrace'Students fear it's 'au revoir' to university after Eduqas French paper.,"Students and parents want an urgent review after errors in an A-level paper left candidates guessing answers. Candidates took to Twitter to complain that sound files provided in a French listening exam were jumbled up and did not coincide with the questions. One student said she was waving ""au revoir"" to her university chances after the exam. The board, Eduqas, has admitted mistakes on the paper, taken by more than 800 students in England. One Twitter user, Ellie, called the paper a disgrace and said it was beyond a joke. ""Two years wasted, Eduqas, two years,"" she said. ""Please tell me I'm not the only one who completely guessed every answer for question 4."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sonata said: ""Learning French clearly is not enough for Eduqas and WJEC. Apparently the exam is a guessing game."" And Urania Jerasi commented ""Half of the skills we needed to pass apparently was to guess what the producers of the exam were thinking while writing it... They were probably thinking of baguettes. Disappointed but not surprised."" Smool said: ""If Eduqas don't give us all an A as compensation for that torture then I'm throwing baguettes."" Parents joined in, calling for an urgent response from the board and asking how the exam would be marked. ""How will you adjust final mark for those thrown by false question?"" asked one. Other Twitter users said the board had made a similar mistake in its Spanish A-level listening exam. In a statement, Eduqas said: ""We can confirm that there was an issue with the recording on yesterday's French examination and how it related to the rubric on one question, which may have impacted some students. ""A similar issue was noted on the Spanish examination taken by students on Monday June 11. ""We have contacted centres to inform them that a special consideration application can be made on behalf of those candidates. ""Our examiners and the awarding committee members will be made aware of the situation. ""Candidate responses will be considered carefully during the marking and awarding processes to ensure that no candidate is disadvantaged.""

"Rural residents hang up on mobile bankingLess than a quarter of those living in rural areas use a smartphone for banking, regulator finds.","Consumers in rural areas of the UK are far less likely to use their smartphones for banking than their urban counterparts, a survey says. The findings, from the UK's financial regulator, are set to reignite the debate over bank branch closures - particularly in rural locations. However, its report also suggests that those in rural areas are more satisfied with their financial circumstances. The Financial Conduct Authority also exposed a north-south savings divide. The data comes from a renewed assessment of a survey of 13,000 people's financial lives by the FCA. The survey,first published in Octoberlast year, found an estimated 4.1 million people are in financial difficulty due to missed domestic or credit bills. An older population and patchy broadband and mobile coverage will be among the reasons for a take-up rate of just 23% in mobile banking and a 54% take-up of internet banking in rural areas, compared with 45% and 78% respectively in urban areas. The report also reveals there is greater reliance on bank branches in rural areas, but also more difficulty in reaching those branches owing, in part, to health conditions. Andrew Bailey, FCA chief executive, said: ""This survey shows just how different the experience of financial services is for consumers across the country. That's important for us, as we shape financial services policy. But it is also important for firms, as they decide how best to serve their customers."" The report comes shortly after consumer group Which? reported an ""alarming"" acceleration in bank branch closures, with about 60 closing every month. It found that 2,868 branches will have closed between 2015 and the end of 2018. It questioned the use of technology as a viable alternative, but banks said closures of branches were a last resort and that Post Offices served many of the same functions. ""Looking after every customer, especially those in vulnerable circumstances, is a priority for the financial services sector,"" a spokesman for banking trade body UK Finance said. ""We will read the findings of the FCA's report with interest and look forward to working closely with the regulator to support customers"". Hannah Maundrell, from comparison website Money.co.uk, said: ""Millions of consumers in the UK are facing financial difficulty due to missed bills - without easy access to sort out these sort of debts, the lack of branches coupled with a lack of decent broadband and mobile signal in rural communities could create a perfect storm and really needs to be investigated."" The FCA's report also revealed that household average income in rural areas, at Â£41,000, was lower than the national average of Â£46,000. Just over half of retired people in rural areas relied mainly on the state pension, compared to 37% in urban areas. Yet, the proportion of people in the countryside who said they were highly satisfied with their financial circumstances (27%) was greater than those in towns and cities (20%). That may be a response to the fact that debts in rural areas are generally lower than the national average. Banks close 2,900 branches in three years, says Which? Essential bill arrears 'more likely among women' Crackdown on high-interest lending announced by FCA The FCA's main report,published last year,external, revealed that 25.6 million consumers could be vulnerable to financial harm. This new analysis of the figures outlines a regional difference, with a notable north-south divide in terms of income and levels of saving. For example, the north east of England has the lowest levels of savings and investments of any English region, with 17% of adults in the region not holding any savings or investments at all. This compares to 15% in the north west of England, 10% in the south west and 8% in the south east. Incomes are lower in these northern regions, although mortgage debts are also among the lowest. The survey suggests that attitudes towards finances in Northern Ireland are ""more downbeat"" than the rest of the UK. Two-thirds of adults (67%) in Northern Ireland have no cash savings or savings of less than Â£5,000, compared with 57% of adults across the UK. It also has the highest levels of debt across the UK, with adults in Northern Ireland owing Â£3,990 on average in unsecured debt. This is the first survey of its kind by the FCA. The next data on residents' financial circumstances will be collected in 2019.
