"Trump offers Democrats carrot and stickThe president offers to work with Democrats, but vows ""a warlike posture"" if they investigate him.","This video can not be played Trump hopes for ""beautiful bi-partisan situation"" US President Donald Trump has said he is ready to work with Democrats after they won control of the House of Representatives in mid-term elections. But during a testy news conference, he vowed to adopt a ""warlike posture"" if Democrats investigated him. The Republican president also clashed repeatedly with reporters at the White House, ordering them to be quiet.

Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Donald Trump came to the East Room of the White House with olive branch in hand, but it sometimes seemed like his fingers were crossed behind his back. He told the nation he would love to work with Democrats - that it might, in fact, be a good thing that they won control of the House of Representatives - but he refused to back away from any of his divisive campaign rhetoric. Previous presidents who have suffered mid-term setbacks have professed humility and said they learned valuable lessons. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, whose parties lost the House in the middle of their first terms, used the defeats to recalibrate for successful re-election campaigns. Mr Trump entertains no such thoughts, instead calling Tuesday night's results ""very close to complete victory"". The president may say he wants ""unity and peace and love"" - but it's clear it will have to be on his terms. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed for a majority in the 435-seat House of Representatives. But Republicans are on course to increase their representation from 51 to 54 in the 100-seat Senate. That will allow Mr Trump's party greater leeway over judicial and executive appointments. In the upper chamber, they captured Democratic seats in Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota, won a marquee battle in Texas, and currently look set to win a tight Florida race. Republican challenger Rick Scott won 50.2% of the vote against incumbent Democratic senator Bill Nelson. Under Florida law an automatic recount is triggered when a final margin is less than 0.5%, and while an initial count will not be complete until Saturday it looks set to fall within that margin. Republican senatorial candidate Martha McSally is also ahead in Arizona, with nearly all precincts reporting. Democrats held on to vulnerable seats in Montana, New Jersey and West Virginia and ousted a Republican incumbent in Nevada, but it was cold comfort. In the 36 governors' races, Republicans won an ugly battle in Florida and appeared on the cusp of victory in Georgia.

Do celebrities really influence voters?,"Rihanna, Beyonce and Taylor Swift all put their star power behind candidates Whenever an election comes around, there are always celebrities who throw their support behind their favoured candidates and hope their fans will follow their lead at the ballot box. In Tuesday's US mid-term elections, however, many of the high-profile stars who had publicly supported candidates were left disappointed. So how much is a celebrity endorsement actually worth? Beyonce's last-minute backing for Democratic Senate hopeful Beto O'Rourke, who also had the support ofTravis ScottandLin-Manuel Miranda, among others, couldn't help him upset Republican rival Ted Cruz in Texas. In Florida,Rihanna's endorsement wasn't enough to make Democrat Andrew Gillum the state's first black governor. Oprah Winfrey,DiddyandWill Ferrellwere among the stars to stand up for another Democrat, Stacey Abrams, in her bid to become governor of Georgia. At the time of writing, Abrams was trailing Republican Brian Kemp as the last votes were being counted. Taylor Swiftmadeperhaps the most high-profile celebrity intervention in the campaignwhen she broke her silence about politics and shared a photograph of herself and her mother waving American flags next to a billboard for Democratic Senate candidate Phil Bredesen.

Swift had mixed fortunes, though - Jim Cooper, who she supported for the House of Representatives, did win. The history of celebrity endorsements goes back to the birth of modern celebrity. Warren Harding won the 1920 US presidential campaign with the backing of a raft of film stars of the day. In 1960, John F Kennedy had the support of Rat Pack members Sammy Davis Junior and Dean Martin. More recently,research conducted by the University of Maryland,externalcredits Oprah with bringing Barack Obama more than a million votes in the 2008 Democratic Presidential Primary process. Oprah Winfrey helped Barack Obama win the Democratic presidential nomination in 2008 However, after the 2004 presidential election,a study found,externalthat friends and family were more influential than celebrities on young voters. ""Celebrities may have looked pretty, but they were not particularly influential on first-time voters,"" the report said. A survey in Ohio in 2016,externalconcluded that star endorsements had no effect on most voters' intentions in that year's presidential race - and some celebrities actually put people off. An endorsement from Beyonce was, apparently, the biggest turn-off. Scott Lucas, professor of American Studies at the University of Birmingham, told the BBC that there are two types of celebrity influence. US mid-term election results 2018: Maps, charts and analysis How these elections broke records What the results mean for Trump People are more likely to listen to the likes of Oprah and George and Amal Clooney because their campaigning work in politics, civil rights and activism gives them more credibility, he argues. ""I would distinguish that type of celebrity influence from let's say, listening to [Robert] De Niro because he flips off the president. I think you've got to have more of a constructive approach."" Although he's recentlydistanced himselffrom politics, Kanye West is someone else who is not in the ""constructive"" category. The rapper has been a vocal admirer of President Trump, upsetting many of his fans and other hip-hop figures. ""If Kanye had said something that was comprehensible and that was meaningful, then Kanye has got a contribution,"" Prof Lucas says. ""But when Kanye does what he does, he becomes a figure of fun and everybody on the Republican side was quite happy for him to drop out of politics, whatever that meant."" Kanye West famously wore Donald Trump's Make America Great Again cap John Curtice, professor of politics at the University of Strathclyde, believes that while celebrities provide a way of generating coverage and possibly help get a politician's message across, they can come with disadvantages. The classic example in the UK, he says, was when comedian Kenny Everett appeared alongside Margaret Thatcher at the 1983 Conservative Party Conference, where his appeals to ""bomb Russia"" and kick Labour leader Michael Foot's walking stick away were probably not what the prime minister had hoped for. ""Celebrities are fine so long as they generating favourable publicity,"" Prof Curtice says. ""But they can sometimes end up generating unfavourable publicity because they're not necessarily always politically nuanced."" Some have interpreted the result as a personal blow for Swift Back to the US 2018 mid-terms, and Prof Lucas says it wasn't a surprise that Taylor Swift couldn't give Phil Bredesen the necessary push to beat Republican Marsha Blackburn in traditionally Republican Tennessee. ""Tennessee is one of the deepest red states in the union, so it was always going to be an up tail battle to take it,"" he says. But he adds: ""If you look at the youth vote in Tennessee and if you look at the youth vote across the US, then Taylor makes a difference."" In the two days after the star posted her original message on 7 October,Vote.org received,external212,871 new voter registrations across the country, with the most in the 18 to 24 age group. In October 2016, there were an average of around 13,000 per day. According to CNN,external, exit polls showed that around 69% of voters aged between 18-29 chose Bredesen on Tuesday. Nationally, 67% of that age group voted Democrat. In 2014, 54% of voters in that age group voted Democrat, CNN said. That rise clearly isn't down to Taylor. There are many factors - especially the change of occupant in the White House - that mean young voters are more motivated to vote, and to vote Democrat. But Prof Lucas believes the influence of figures like Swift in helping to mobilise a young electorate could be key in the next presidential race in two years' time. ""If I'm looking at 2020, if you get an increase in voter participation among 18-24s like we had yesterday and it keeps going, everything shifts in US politics,"" he says. ""That's where Taylor becomes important because they did get a surge in voter registration, especially among young people.""

Man Utd stage late recovery to beat JuventusManchester United score two goals in the final five minutes to beat the Italian champions in Turin.,"Juan Mata's free-kick was the first goal Juventus have conceded in the Champions League this season Manchester United stunned Juventus with two goals in the final five minutes to beat the Italian champions in Turin and give themselves a good chance of qualifying for the Champions League knockout stages. Juan Mata curled in a free-kick with five minutes to go, before Ashley Young's set-piece was bundled into his own net by Juventus defender Alex Sandro. Cristiano Ronaldo had put the hosts ahead with an outstanding volley against his former club. Ronaldo watched Leonardo Bonucci's long pass over his shoulder before lashing it past United goalkeeper David De Gea for his first goal in the competition since signing for the Serie A leaders. Juventus had hit the frame of the goal either side of half-time, with Sami Khedira striking a post and Paulo Dybala curling an effort on to the bar. Jose Mourinho's side offered little attacking threat at the other end, until substitute Mata beat goalkeeper Wojciech Szczesny with a well-placed free-kick from the edge of the box in the 86th minute. Three minutes later and another United free-kick proved Juventus' undoing, as Young's in-swinging delivery was inadvertently turned in under pressure by Sandro from close range. The visitors' late double keeps them second in Group H and two points above Valencia, whobeat Young Boys 3-1in the early kick-off, with two games still to play. Did Mourinho's celebrations go too far or show passion? United 'one final' from knockout stage - Mourinho Why Juve are much more than Ronaldo Jose Mourinho was confronted by Juventus defender Leonardo Bonucci after cupping his ear to the home fans United have made a habit of staging late recoveries this season, although manager Mourinho bemoaned his side's inability to do so when they were beaten by Juventus at Old Trafford last month. But, while comeback wins over Newcastle and Bournemouth in the Premier League offered relief rather than the chance to rejoice, this victory was more reminiscent in its nature of United's Champions League triumph over Bayern Munich in 1999. Mourinho's side look a long way from winning the competition 20 years on, but his players' reaction at the final whistle - and Mourinho's cupped ear to the Juventus fans - showed how important taking three points in Turin was to the Reds. Juventus had won three from three and were yet to concede a goal in the Champions League this season before Mata's strike, while United's late winner inflicted only the Serie A champions' second loss at home in the group stages in 36 games. United - without Belgium forward Romelu Lukaku, who is also a doubt for Sunday's Manchester derby - opted for Alexis Sanchez to lead the line, but the Chilean had a bigger influence on the visitors' defensive performance than he did their attack. The same could be said for Anthony Martial, who tracked Juventus right-back Mattia De Sciglio relentlessly as United defended resolutely before Ronaldo's opener. But United, who had just three shots on target, proved clinical in attack when it mattered and will progress from the group if they beat Young Boys at home later this month and Valencia fail to beat Juventus. Cristiano Ronaldo ended a run of six games without a Champions League goal by scoring against his former club It was always going to happen, wasn't it? Ronaldo scoring his first Champions League goal for Juventus against former club United. The Portugal forward, who joined the Italian outfit from Real Madrid for Â£99.2m in the summer, was without a goal in the competition since scoring against Juve for his former side in April. But Ronaldo's first in Europe for the Serie A leaders was worth waiting for, showing superb technique to volley in Bonucci's well-weighted long pass for the opener. The five-time Champions League winner had struggled to make an impact on the tie before his moment of brilliance, though it was from his pull-back that Khedira struck a post in the first half. Dybala was unlucky to not put the hosts ahead moments after Khedira's chance when he cut inside and curled a dipping effort against the crossbar, while De Gea had earlier produced an instinctive save after Juan Cuadrado's cross was deflected goalwards by Nemanja Matic. But when the goal came, it was worthy of a player who has won the Ballon D'Or five times, and the 33-year-old celebrated in trademark fashion - lifting up his shirt to reveal his muscular physique. Ronaldo thought he had stolen the show, but the Portuguese, and his Juventus team-mates, were upstaged by United's late twist. Juan Mata was only on the field 11 minutes, but proved pivotal to Manchester United's comeback after showing great composure to pull the visitors level with the moment of brilliance Jose Mourinho's side needed. Manchester United manager Jose Mourinho on BT Sport:""A point or three would have changed little for Juventus, but three points makes a big difference to us. ""It is a big victory for us, not just because we needed the points but because it was away from home against an amazing team. ""They are a fantastic team with an amazing record at home. We had to come and not feel inferior. They have more potential than us. Everybody knows their ambitions."" Manchester United goalscorer Juan Mata:""What a nice last five minutes. It is a very good night for us to get three points against Juventus in Italy. It is amazing. ""They have fantastic players and are a top team. We come back to Manchester with three points and that is football."" Juventus lost a Champions League group stage home game for the first time since December 2009, when Bayern Munich beat them, ending a 19-game unbeaten run. United have won more away Champions League matches at Juventus than any other side have in the history of the competition, with three. United have come back to win a Champions League game with two goals in the final five minutes of a match for the first time since the 1999 final against Bayern Munich. Juan Mata scored his first Champions League goal since netting against Wolfsburg in September 2015. Cristiano Ronaldo ended a drought of 20 shots and 453 minutes without a goal in the Champions League. United make the short trip to Etihad Stadium on Sunday to face rivals Manchester City, kick-off 16:30 GMT, while their next Champions League outing is against Young Boys at Old Trafford on 27 November. Juventus face a big game of their own on Sunday, visiting manager Allegri's former club AC Milan in Serie A in a 19:30 kick-off. They host Valencia next in Europe.

The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words,"It's the story that has dominated Donald Trump's presidency. But it's complicated. Let's take a step back. US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to sway the election in favour of Mr Trump. A special counsel looked into whether anyone from his campaign colluded in the effort. After two years, we have a 448-page report in which the special counsel finds no evidence the campaign conspired with Russia. No, Robert Mueller also looked at 10 instances where the president obstructed justice. But he was unable to decide whether they amounted to a crime. His report also found that the Russian government did interfere in the election. Not really. We found out he tried to fire Mr Mueller. He had called it a witch hunt from the start. No. It was conducted by the hugely respected Mr Mueller, a Republican who used to run the FBI. There were several meetings between senior members of Mr Trump's team with Russian officials. Several meetings were not initially disclosed. Ex-National Security Adviser Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about meeting the Russian ambassador to the US before Mr Trump took office. The president's son, Donald Jr, met a Russian lawyer who said she had ""dirt"" on Hillary Clinton during the campaign. He brought charges against several of Mr Trump's inner circle. Ex-adviser Roger Stone has been charged with lying to Congress about his contacts with Wikileaks, which released emails belonging to Democratic officials that had allegedly been hacked by Russians. Mr Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen admitted lying to Congress, campaign finance violations and tax evasion and received a 36-month prison sentence. And former campaign chairman Paul Manafort lied to the FBI about his work in Ukraine, according to special counsel Robert Mueller, with whom he had been co-operating. Manafort has been jailed for bank fraud. Since he fired the man leading one of the investigations, ex-FBI Director James Comey, there were questions about whether he obstructed justice.

All you need to know about Trump Russia story,"Donald Trump has been dogged by suspicion over his ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin For nearly two years the Trump-Russia affair has dominated front pages and mired the president's administration in conflict and controversy. But what is it exactly? How did it begin? And what did it find out? The inquiry, led by widely respected former director of the FBI Robert Mueller, focused on alleged collusion between Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign team and Moscow. The report stated that no evidence of a conspiracy was found, but it did lay out 10 instances where the president possibly obstructed justice. Mr Mueller has said his report did not exonerate the president, but that charging a sitting president was not an option. Here's a breakdown on one of the most high-profile political inquiries in US history. Mr Trump's campaign and transition teams were accused of conspiring with Russian agents to influence the US election in the then Republican candidate's favour. US intelligence agencies concluded in 2016 that Russia was behind an effort to tip the scales of the US election against Hillary Clinton, with a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media. Both the Russian and US presidents had poured scorn on suggestions of ""collusion"", with Mr Trump calling it ""the greatest political witch hunt in history"". At least 17 Trump associates had contacts with Russians or Wikileaks, which released hacked documents, during the campaign or transition, according toan analysis of public records by the New York Times,external, with at least 100 face-to-face interactions, phone calls or electronic messages with Russians or Kremlin-linked figures and at least 51 individual communications. Trump aides known to have had contact with Russians include the president's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, his son Donald Trump Jr, former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn, Attorney General Jeff Sessions and former personal lawyer Michael Cohen. Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The president's supporters point out that interactions with foreign nationals are routine during any White House campaign, but three Trump associates have now admitted lying about these encounters. The special counsel has indicted more than 30 people, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team or administration, an adviser and long-time ally, and 26 Russians, as well as three Russian companies. A former prosecutor, Mr Mueller went on to become the second-longest serving FBI director in history, after J Edgar Hoover. His Senate confirmation vote as FBI director went 98-0 in his favour. A special Senate vote to extend his term beyond the usual 10 years to 12 passed 100-0. With a team of experienced lawyers drawn from private practice and from the Department of Justice, as well as FBI officers, Mr Mueller worked quietly from an unassuming building in south-west Washington, not issuing any public comment during the investigation. What is a special counsel? America's most mysterious public figure On 22 March, he submitted his report to Attorney General William Barr, who replaced Jeff Sessions after he was forced to resign. The448-page report,externalpainted a mixed picture of the president's conduct. While it did not establish that the Trump campaign criminally conspired with Russia to meddle in the election, it built an extensive obstruction-of-justice case against the president. Mr Mueller said the report did not exonerate the president but stopped short of saying Mr Trump committed a crime. Eight new things in the Mueller report ""If we had confidence after a thorough investigation of the facts that the president clearly did not commit obstruction of justice, we would so state,"" the report says. ""Based on the facts and the applicable legal standards, we are unable to reach that judgement. Accordingly, while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him."" It also revealed Mr Trump instructed a White House lawyer to try and remove Mr Mueller over alleged ""conflicts of interest"", but the lawyer resigned. Around 10% of the public report is redacted. As well as the special counsel inquiry by Mr Mueller under the aegis of the justice department there have been four congressional investigations: The Senate and House Intelligence Committees and the Senate Judiciary Committee are investigating alleged Kremlin meddling and any collusion with Trump aides The House Oversight Committee is scrutinising links between Trump associates and Russian officials The Judiciary Committee has issued more than 80 document requests in a broad probe that goes beyond alleged contacts between the campaign and Moscow Meanwhile federal prosecutors at the Southern District of New York and in Washington are looking at other areas related to Russia All of the House inquiries were plagued by political squabbling amongst lawmakers, and closed without leading to any charges or claims of Russian collusion. Democrats have reopened the investigations after gaining a majority in the House in January. The Senate committee has yet to release its findings. Before the redacted report was released, Mr Barr, who was attorney general under the late George HW Bush between 1991 and 1993, spent two days poring over Mr Mueller's report beforeissuing his interpretation to Congress. There was a lot of speculation that an obstruction of justice legal case against the president could be considered. One of the possibilities raised was that it could look into Mr Trump's sacking of James Comey as head of the FBI. But legal experts had warned that the charge carried a fairly high threshold - proof of ""corrupt intent"". In his summary, Mr Barr says, quoting Mr Mueller's report: ""The special counsel states that 'while this report does not conclude that the president committed a crime, it also does not exonerate him'."" Mr Barr then says that, after consulting Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, there was insufficient evidence ""to establish that the president committed an obstruction-of-justice offence"". Mr Mueller gave a rare statement in May about the investigation, and announced his office was officially shutting down. His statement largely reaffirmed what was in the report released with redactions last month. He said if his team had had confidence that Mr Trump ""clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so"". Mr Mueller added that ""the Constitution requires a process other than the criminal justice system to formally accuse a sitting president of wrongdoing,"" in what was seen as a reference to the ability of Congress to start an impeachment process. The special counsel said he did not believe it was ""appropriate to speak further"" about the investigation and that he would not provide any information that was not in his team's report. But the end of the special counsel investigation does not mark the end of the story. The former FBI director will face questions from two congressional committees about his report on the Donald Trump campaign and Russia. The congressional probes could stretch into 2020 and several of the prosecutions Mr Mueller initiated could be continued by lawyers within the Department of Justice. This video can not be played What to expect from Mueller hearings Mr Barr has said that it is his objective to get as much information to Congress and the public as possible, consistent with prosecutorial guidelines and confidentiality requirements. Democrats in Congress have called for whatever information Mr Mueller produces to be released publicly in its entirety. Back in February 2017, before Mr Mueller was appointed as special counsel, the FBI was investigating Michael Flynn over his contacts with Russian officials. Then-head of the FBI, Mr Comey, attended a briefing in the Oval Office at the White House, along with Vice-President Mike Pence and Mr Sessions. According to a detailed account of the meeting written by Mr Comey immediately afterwards, the president asked Mr Pence and Mr Sessions to leave the room before suggesting Mr Comey end the Flynn investigation. The FBI director's notes quote the president as saying: ""I hope you can see your way clear to letting this go, to letting Flynn go. He is a good guy. I hope you can let this go."" Mr Comey prepared memos from his notes and shared them with other senior FBI officials, saying he was concerned about the nature of the meeting. A few months later, in May, the president sacked Mr Comey, citing ""this Russia thing"", a move that shocked Washington and led to talk of a cover-up. Part of the inquiry focuses on a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in New York City involving Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, his son-in-law Jared Kushner, then-campaign chairman Paul Manafort and an influential Russian lawyer, Natalia Veselnitskaya. The meeting occurred after a Russian intermediary contacted Mr Trump Jr with a promise to provide material that would ""incriminate"" Hillary Clinton - the Democratic candidate - and be ""very useful to your father"". It was part of the Russian government's ""support"" for Mr Trump, he noted. Mr Trump Jr replied: ""I love it."" Mr Trump Jr later defended the meeting, saying Ms Veselnitskaya offered only ""inane nonsense"" and nothing came of it, but he also told Fox News' Sean Hannity ""in retrospect, I probably would have done things a little differently"". In an initial statement to explain the meeting one year after it occurred, Mr Trump Jr claimed that it had been held to discuss Russian adoptions. But in a follow-up statement he said that the actual purpose had been about political opposition research. In June 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that the meeting was ""to get information on an opponent, totally legal and done all the time in politics"". President Trump's lawyers say he dictated his son's first misleading explanation, leading to questions of whether the president sought to obstruct a Department of Justice inquiry. See our fullRussia timeline. The arrest of Mr Stone, a long-time adviser and close confidant to Mr Trump, marks a significant development in this legal drama. The charges against him are linked to an alleged Russian-led hack into the emails of Democratic Party officials. Mr Stone denies suggestions of criminal misconduct. The information contained in the emails was released by Wikileaks during the 2016 US presidential election campaign. Stone: Trump ally, political strategist and Nixon fan It means that, for the first time, a member of Mr Trump's inner circle is facing charges directly related to Russian election meddling. Mr Papadopoulos's role in the drama begins with a May 2016 drink in a London bar with an Australian diplomat. He told the envoy that Russia had ""political dirt"" on Hillary Clinton - a conversation which was later reported by Australian authorities to the FBI and may have prompted the bureau's investigation into the campaign. In late October 2017, court documents emerged showing Mr Papadopoulos had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. He falsely claimed he had met two figures with Russian connections before joining the Trump campaign in March 2016. In fact, he met them after joining the campaign. After lying to the FBI, he deleted an incriminating Facebook account and destroyed a phone. Emails reveal that he communicated with high-level figures in the Trump campaign. He was pictured in March 2016 seated at a foreign policy meeting with Mr Trump, Jeff Sessions and others, in a photo Mr Trump shared on Twitter. Just before he began a two-week sentence in a Wisconsin prison in late November 2018 however, he sent a tweet saying he had ""never met a single Russian official"". On his release, he announced he was publishing a book entitled ""Deep State Target: How I got caught in the crosshairs of the plot to bring down President Trump"". In January 2017, a secret dossier was leaked to the press. It had been compiled by a former British intelligence official and Russia expert, Christopher Steele, who had been paid to investigate Mr Trump's ties to Russia. The dossier alleged Moscow had compromising material on Mr Trump, including claims he was once recorded with prostitutes at a Moscow hotel during a 2013 trip for one of his Miss Universe pageants. Mr Trump emphatically denies this. The file purported to show financial and personal links between Mr Trump, his advisers and Moscow. It also suggested the Kremlin had cultivated Mr Trump for years before he ran for president. Mr Trump dismissed the dossier, arguing its contents were based largely on unnamed sources. It was later reported that Mr Steele's report was funded as opposition research by the Clinton campaign and Democratic National Committee. Fusion GPS, the Washington-based firm that was hired to commission the dossier, had previously been paid via a conservative website to dig up dirt on Mr Trump. It didn't, exactly. Hacking voter machines, and rigging elections generally, is very, very difficult. Hacking people? That would be easier. The special counsel charges show that Russia effectively ran a two-pronged operation. The first prong in mid-2016 allegedly involved sending rafts of so-called ""phishing"" emails to figures in the Democratic Party - an unsophisticated method used by everyone from state-sponsored actors to low-level scammers for duping people into giving up their passwords. Hackers gained access to the Democratic National Committee's systems and the personal email of Clinton campaign chair John Podesta. They leaked tens of thousands of emails revealing the inner workings of the Clinton campaign and the party's operations, along with mundane, embarrassing details. The second prong allegedly involved flooding social media networks, especially Facebook, with bogus stories designed to smear the Democrats and undermine the Clinton campaign. According to testimony by Facebook before Congress, Russia-backed content reached as many as 126 million Americans on the social network during and after election. In August 2016, an envelope arrived at the White House marked for the eyes of President Barack Obama and three senior aides. According to theWashington Post,external, the envelope had come by courier from the CIA, and contained a bombshell revelation - Mr Putin was directing a state-sponsored effort to interfere with the US election. The FBI was already looking at ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, but the CIA memo seemed to confirm Russian efforts to throw the election Mr Trump's way. According to reporting in the Post and elsewhere, the Obama administration agonised over whether to divulge the alleged operations. Reportedly fearful of appearing to attempt to interfere politically, they stayed relatively quiet. Other intelligence agencies were slow in reaching the same conclusion as the CIA, and congressional Republicans were reluctant to offer support to a public condemnation of Moscow. Warnings were issued to Russian officials, but it wasn't until the main US intelligence agencies agreed, in late September, that President Obama directed them to make a public statement. To avoid appearing partisan, the statement would not carry his name. The president is celebrating the findings of the special counsel's report revealed by Mr Barr, but there are a variety of ongoing investigations into Mr Trump's conduct and that of his businesses. Several of them pose a legitimate threat to the president, both legal and political. However, it is effectively impossible to bring criminal charges against a sitting president, and any case would have to be brought by the executive branch, of which Mr Trump is the boss. This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? As for impeachment, it remains unlikely at this stage. A majority in the House of Representatives is first required to approve an article of impeachment, and the Democratic leaders in that chamber appear reluctant to make such a move until the multiple investigations are concluded. In the event of a successful House vote, the Senate holds a trial presided over by the Supreme Court chief justice, and a two-thirds majority vote is required in the Senate to convict the president. That's a high bar - two presidents, Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson, have been acquitted at this stage. With a Republican majority in the 100-seat Senate, at least 19 members of Mr Trump's own party would have to break ranks to remove him from office.

Trump hails 'tremendous' mid-term vote,"This video can not be played Trump hopes for ""beautiful bi-partisan situation"" US President Donald Trump has hailed ""tremendous success"" in the mid-term elections after a night of mixed results for his Republican party. The Democrats won the House of Representatives, which will enable them to thwart the president's agenda. But the Republicans consolidated their grip on the Senate, ensuring he can still make key appointments. Mr Trump said the outcome ""defied history"" as the ruling party does not usually gain seats in the mid-terms. Results in maps and charts Five key things we learned Live reaction At a feisty news conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump offered an olive branch to Democrats, proposing both parties work together on joint legislative priorities. But he said that if Democratic-controlled congressional committees started serving legal writs against his administration, Republicans would do likewise and gridlock would ensue. This video can not be played Donald Trump listed some of the losing Republicans candidates who didn't embrace him and his message In ill-tempered exchanges, Mr Trump called a CNN correspondent ""a rude, terrible person"" and told an NBC reporter: ""I'm not a big fan of yours either."" He told a black reporter who asked whether his self-professed nationalism would embolden white nationalists that it was ""such a racist question"". The president also mocked Republicans who did not ""embrace"" him on the campaign trail, and went on to lose their election races. ""They did very poorly,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""I'm not sure that I should be happy or sad but I feel just fine about it."" This video can not be played The story of election night in two minutes House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has promised her party will serve as a counterweight to the White House. Ms Pelosi - who is favourite to become speaker, a position she held from 2007-11 - told supporters: ""Today is more than about Democrats and Republicans. It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration."" Meanwhile the Florida Senate race is heading for a recount after Republican Rick Scott got 50.21% and incumbent Bill Nelson 49.79% of the vote. A margin of less than half a percentage point automatically triggers a recount. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed for a majority in the 435-seat lower chamber. They could now launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest. The Democrats could also more effectively block his legislative plans, notably his signature promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico. In the Senate, Democrats were facing an uphill battle because they were defending 26 races, while just nine Republican seats were up for grabs. The Republicans are on course to increase their representation from 51 to 54 in the 100-seat Senate upper chamber. Mr Trump has threatened to retaliate for any Democratic investigations with his own probes in the Senate into alleged ""leaks of classified information"". Allow Twitter content?

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Even handing over power to Democrats in the House may have a bit of a silver lining for the president. Now he will have someone to blame if the economy takes a turn for the worse (and, given business cycle realities, it might). He's got a ready-made explanation for why he can't get anything done in the next two years - and a pitch for what needs to change in the next election. Day in and day out, he'll have a set of clear political opponents to contrast himself with.

Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lost control of the House in their first term in office and went on to win re-election.

Takeaway bosses jailed for allergy death,"Harun Rashid (left) and Mohammed Abdul Kuddus both denied causing Megan Lee's death A takeaway owner and manager, who caused a teenage girl's death by sending her a meal containing peanuts, have been jailed for manslaughter. Megan Lee, 15, suffered irreversible brain damage after having an allergic reaction to food from Royal Spice in Oswaldtwistle, Lancashire, in 2016. Mohammed Abdul Kuddus and Harun Rashid werefound guilty in October. At Manchester Crown Court earlier, Kuddus was jailed for two years and Rashid for three. In sentencing, Mrs Justice Yip told them Megan was responsible enough to highlight her allergies when placing the order but ""sadly the same responsibility was not at your end"". Megan Lee died two days after she was admitted to Royal Blackburn Hospital Judge Yip said the takeaway had no systems or processes to manage allergen control. She said she hoped ""the message is heard"" that food suppliers who fail to take proper care ""will face significant custodial sentences if a death results"". After the verdicts in October, Megan's father Adam warned takeaway owners ""do not play Russian roulette with precious lives"". Judge Yip added: ""Like Mr and Mrs Lee, I hope that this tragic case adds to the growing awareness in the food industry of what can happen if allergies are not taken seriously."" Royal Spice was closed down following Megan's death but later reopened under new ownership She added that Kuddus and Rashid, both fathers, had expressed genuine remorse. She told them: ""Neither of you actually foresaw the death of anyone. It never occurred to you that you would be responsible for the death of a young girl. ""You must now live with the guilt of what you have done and the suffering you have caused Megan's family and to your own families."" Owner Kuddus, 40, of Belper Street, Blackburn, had admitted two health and safety charges on behalf of himself and the takeaway, but both he and Rashid, 38, of Rudd Street, Haslingden, denied manslaughter. Their trial heard Megan suffered an acute asthma attack after eating food from Royal Spice on 30 December 2016, which her friend had ordered with a note reading ""prawns, nuts"" to show her allergies. She died two days later in hospital. The teenager's meal, which included an onion bhaji, a seekh kebab and a Peshwari naan, was found to have the ""widespread presence"" of peanut protein. In a statement read outside court after the verdicts, Mr Lee and his wife Gemma said their lives would never be the same after Megan's death.

Pakistan frees Christian woman Asia Bibi,"This video can not be played Asia Bibi's escape from Pakistan death row Asia Bibi, a Pakistani Christian woman acquitted of blasphemy after spending eight years on death row, has been freed from prison. Last week's Supreme Court ruling sparked violent protests from Islamists and the government agreed to their demand to stop her leaving Pakistan. News of her release led to some confusion, with reports she had been taken to another country. But the foreign office later said she was still in Pakistan. The case is highly sensitive and Information Minister Fawad Hussein said journalists had been ""extremely irresponsible"" in reporting she had left the country without official confirmation. Those reports were based on comments from her lawyer, Saiful Malook, who has been granted temporary asylum in the Netherlands after facing death threats. Asia Bibi's husband had said they were in danger and pleaded for asylum. A number of Western countries are understood to have held discussions with Asia Bibi's family about granting them asylum. Pakistan's 'historic' Asia Bibi ruling Why Pakistan's Christians are targeted Blasphemy laws around the world The mother-of-five was released from prison in the city of Multan on Wednesday and the foreign office says she is in ""a safe place in Pakistan"". Also known as Asia Noreen, she was convicted in 2010 of insulting the Prophet Muhammad during a row with neighbours. The Pakistani government has said it will start legal proceedings to prevent her going abroad after agreeing the measure to end the violent protests. Asia Bibi's acquittal sparked protests by Islamists Many of the protesters were hardliners who support strong blasphemy laws and called for Asia Bibi to be hanged. One Islamist leader said all three Supreme Court judges also ""deserved to be killed"". A spokesman for the hardline Tehreek-e-Labaik (TLP) party, which blocked roads in major cities for several days, said Asia Bibi's release was in breach of their deal with the government. ""The rulers have showed their dishonesty,"" TLP spokesman Ejaz Ashrafi told Reuters. The deal also saw officials agree not to block a petition for the Supreme Court to evaluate Asia Bibi's acquittal in the light of Islamic Sharia law. The trial stems from an argument Asia Bibi had with a group of women in June 2009. They were harvesting fruit when a row broke out about a bucket of water. The women said that because she had used a cup, they could no longer touch it, as her faith had made it unclean. Prosecutors alleged that in the row which followed, the women said Asia Bibi should convert to Islam and that she made offensive comments about the Prophet Muhammad in response. She was later beaten up at her home, during which her accusers say she confessed to blasphemy. She was arrested after a police investigation. Acquitting her, the Supreme Court said that the case was based on unreliable evidence and her confession was delivered in front of a crowd ""threatening to kill her"". Islam is Pakistan's national religion and underpins its legal system. Public support for the strict blasphemy laws is strong. Hard-line politicians have often backed severe punishments, partly as a way of shoring up their support base. Christians: Pakistan's 'forgotten minority' The last hours of a Christian sanitary worker in Pakistan But critics say the laws have often been used to exact revenge after personal disputes, and that convictions are based on thin evidence. The vast majority of those convicted are Muslims or members of the Ahmadi community who identify themselves as Muslims but are regarded as heretical by orthodox Islam. Since the 1990s scores of Christians have also been convicted. They make up just 1.6% of the population. The Christian community has been targeted by numerous attacks in recent years, leaving many feeling vulnerable to a climate of intolerance. Since 1990, at least 65 people have reportedly been killed in Pakistan over claims of blasphemy.

Should there be a tax on red meat?,"A ""meat tax"" could prevent almost 6,000 deaths per year in the UK, according to researchers, but should politicians be telling people what they can and can't eat? Scientists at the University of Oxford say governments should consider imposing price hikes on red meat - such as beef, lamb and pork - to reduce consumption. They say it would save lives and more than Â£700m in UK healthcare costs, according to new research. Various research has linked eating red meat to an increased risk of heart disease, stroke and diabetes. In 2015 the World Health Organization warned that processed meats, like bacon, sausages and ham, could cause cancer, while unprocessed red meat could also increase your risk. And eating lots of red meat doesn't just have an impact on your own health. Researchers at the University of Oxford said meat eaters were also increasing the burden on the health service and the economy, due to a loss of workforce from ill health. There is also a growing awareness of the environmental impact of eating red meat. The high levels of land and water use and carbon emissions associated with its production meancutting down is one of the key ways individuals can help tackle climate change. This video can not be played Dr Marco Springmann tells Today eating only one portion of red meat a week could help tackle global warming Researchers say a meat tax could cut consumption of processed meat by about two portions per week in high-income countries. In the UK, the study suggests a tax of 14% on red meat and 79% on processed meat. This would mean the price of a 227g Tesco Sirloin Steak would increase from Â£3.80 to Â£4.33. And for a pack of eight pork sausages from Sainsbury's the price would increase from Â£1.50 to Â£2.69.

The tax has already had an effect, with some leading brands reducing the sugar content in their products to avoid the levy. But whether it means consumers buy fewer sugary drinks remains to be seen. Will the sugar tax work? The impact of charging 5p for single-use carrier bags suggests financial incentives can change behaviour. The number of plastic bags handed out by supermarkets in Englandhas drastically decreased since the change was introduced. Howeverthe government has been less keen on the idea of a ""latte levy""on disposable coffee cups. Ministers prefer the idea of shops offering discounts to customers bringing their own cups rather than an extra charge. Attempts by the government to tell people what to do don't always go down well. Christopher Snowdon from the Institute for Economic Affairs, a free market think tank, said taxing food was ""the next battleground for the nanny state"". Last month climate minister Claire Perry told BBC News it was not the government's place to tell people they can't eat steak and chips, despite the environmental impact. Mr Snowdon also argued it would be ""absurd"" to raise the cost of living through a meat tax. There's also the concern that it targets foods bought by those on lower incomes. Allow Twitter content?

5G will let users 'ditch home broadband',"Many families currently pay for a separate mobile and home broadband services 5G mobile data will be so reliable and fast most homes will no longer need a separate home broadband connection, according to one of the companies planning to launch a UK service. Three UK's chief executive told BBC News there would be enough capacity on 5G to cope with demand, meaning households would be able to save money by ending their fixed-line contracts. He predicts consumers will use 13 times as much mobile data in 2025 as today. But one expert warned against ""hype"". Three has said it intends to launch its first 5G services in the UK assoon as the middle of next year,external. Its announcement coincides with news from BT's mobile division, EE, that it hasswitched on nine 5G trial sites in London,external. Vodafone and Telefonica-owned O2 have also bought spectrum to launch 5G services of their own in the country. In theory, 5G could offer download speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second or even 20Gbps - although these are unlikely to be attained for many years if at all. Most handsets are not yet capable of pushing 4G speeds to their limits, so UK networks are under pressure to convince the public of the need to upgrade having spent more than had been predicted on the spectrum auctioned to date. When can I buy a 5G phone and how much will it be? Will 5G be necessary for self-driving cars? Hologram phone calls - sci-fi or serious possibility? As part of its pitch, Three is making the case that 5G will offer a ""genuine alternative"" to fixed-line copper  and fibre services. Mr Dyson has led Three UK since 2011 ""Maybe not for the whole country, but certainly a significant majority of the country, I strongly believe 5G can offer a good enough home broadband experience for people to effectively ditch their copper [or fibre] connection,"" said David Dyson, Three UK's chief executive. ""The challenge in terms of why we can't do that today is that the mobile networks don't have the capacity with 3G or 4G. 5G changes all of that."" Capacity refers to the amount of data that can be handled at any one time rather than the speed. Three already provides a 4G-based ""unlimited data"" home broadband service in London, called Relish, which it acquired last year. But Mr Dyson said the business had to be careful how many people it signed up, to prevent its service degrading. This, he said, would not be a problem with 5G. But one industry-watcher said it was still unclear how reliable the technology would be. ""Stability is important for video streaming at HD and Ultra HD quality levels, and paramount for the gaming community,"" said Andrew Ferguson, from the news site Thinkbroadband. ""Full-fibre services are going to beat 5G as you have a connection as stable as the one that will be feeding the mobile masts and thus the variables of signal strength dropping due to a bus passing the home are avoided."" The government is currently pursuing a target of ""full-fibre"" broadband coverage to the whole UK by 2033, in which high-speed optical cables are used to bring data right up to buildings without having to rely on slower copper for part of the journey. At present, only 5% of all properties have access to the full-fibre connections,according to the regulator Ofcom,external. But Three's chief executive suggested the cost involved could help make 5G a more attractive option. ""Fibre-to-the-home for the small number of customers who value it and need it will probably provide a faster speed,"" Mr Dyson said. ""But I think for the majority of people, 5G will be a genuine alternative. ""It's still quite unclear to me, as I'm sure it is to many people, what is going to be the price of all these fibre-to-the-home deployments when it actually arrives ""It's expensive to dig up roads. It takes a lot of time and money. ""It's much cheaper and quicker to provide that connectivity via a wireless connection."" What is 5G and what will it mean for you? When can I buy a 5G phone and how much will it be?

LiveReaction to Sessions' resignation,"US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has announced he is resigning from his role as the top law official It follows months of criticism from President Trump over the Department of Justice's handling of the Russia inquiry The announcement came a day after mid-term elections, in which Democrats took control of the House of Representatives But Republicans have retained control of the Senate, with key victories in Indiana, Texas and North Dakota Trump announced that Matthew Whitaker, chief of staff at the Department of Justice, will be the new acting attorney general Ritu Prasad and Max Matza Our main story will keep you up to speed on the aftermath of Attorney General Jeff Sessions' firing. As things stand, there's a whole slew of questions about the fate of Robert Mueller's Russia inquiry now that Trump's pick for acting attorney general appears to favour an end to the investigation. With Democrats soon to be in control of the House, they'll have the ability to launch investigations and consider impeachment. However, Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi - who could become the next House Majority Speaker - and President Trump have vowed to work together. But will the drama around America's top law enforcement official coupled with the new makeup of Congress lead to more compromise or commotion? Jeff Sessions is the latest official to leave the Trump team. Here's our running list of everyone who has left - or been asked to leave - by Donald Trump.

Aleem MaqboolBBC North America correspondent He may be claiming a ""big victory"" in these mid-term elections, but it's clear Donald Trump recognises he's in for - if nothing else - lots of irritation over the next two years. Through winning control of the House of Representatives, Democrats will have much more power to scrutinise the actions of the White Houseâ¦ and things like the president's tax affairs or even alleged sexual misconduct by him. Having said that, an increase in the majority of his party in the Senate - he believes because he supported most of the Senators who won - means President Trump will continue to have his own way in cabinet and judicial appointments. Speaking of whichâ¦he'll very soon be asking the Senate to confirm a new attorney general. In his first major act after the election, Donald Trump fired his last one - Jeff Sessions. He was incensed that Mr Sessions stepped aside - to avoid conflict of interest - from overseeing the investigation into Russia's alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump's message to election candidates and political appointees alike today is that if they do his bidding, he'll stand by them and they'd survive. But if they didn't - they'd be out in the cold.

Ministers invited to read draft EU deal,"Cabinet ministers have been invited to read the UK's draft deal with the EU although it's not yet complete. Theresa May has said the withdrawal deal is 95% done - but there is no agreement yet on how to guarantee no hard border in Northern Ireland. This is proving to be the most contentious area, with the UK prime minister under pressure from her own party as well as the EU. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Gove wants to see Brexit legal advice A leaked plan for presenting a Brexit deal? But as yet there is no withdrawal deal in place, and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""clear that more work is needed"". Mrs May has described the withdrawal agreement - covering issues like citizens' rights, the transition period and Gibraltar - as being 95% complete. Leaving the Cabinet Office after studying the incomplete draft agreement, Environment Secretary Michael Gove told Sky News it was a ""great document"". The UK and the EU cannot agree on the precise arrangements to avoid new border checks in Northern Ireland. BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming Brussels is more concerned about the form in which the backstop exists, not how it's exited from. The EU is exploring the concept of a UK-wide customs arrangement to deal with the Irish border issue. But some member states want extra guarantees on rules and regulations if they are to offer the UK quota-free and tariff-free access to the single market. Some question if it's legally possible to agree during the Brexit talks instead of in the detailed negotiations over the future relationship that will begin after exit day. Others fret that they're being kept in the dark by the EU negotiators. But Brussels is united on two issues: the ultimate insurance policy remains a Northern Ireland-only element to the backstop, and the UK can't decide to withdraw from it on its own. Both sides agreed to put in place a ""backstop"", also referred to as an insurance policy, that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a frictionless border. This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides. One option for the backstop is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border. But how long this would last, and how the arrangement could be terminated, has not yet been settled. The government is under pressure from some Tories, as well as Labour, to publish the precise legal advice about how the arrangement would work. Meanwhile, former prime minister David Cameron has said he ""fully supports"" his successor's handling of the process. Speaking ahead of a visit to the Treasury, where he was to look at documents for his memoirs, Mr Cameron said the prime minister should be ""left to get on"" with negotiating a deal.

Building boss out over ÃÂ£75m pay row,"This video can not be played Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his pay The boss of Persimmon Jeff Fairburn has been forced out after a row over his Â£75m pay award. Persimmon said he left by ""mutual agreement and at the request of the company"". It said the issue was having a ""negative impact"" on the firm's reputation and on ""Jeff's ability to continue in his role"". Last month Mr Fairburn walked away from a BBC interview when asked about his pay. ""I'd rather not talk about that,"" he told a BBC reporter when asked in October about the pay award. Mr Fairburn had seen his pay package reduced from Â£100m after a public outcry. He will now keep Â£75m worth of shares when he leaves at the end of next month. The company said it could not claw back any of the share awards, known as a long-term incentive award (LTIP). It added that he would receive no further pay after he left on 31 December. He will be given up to Â£10,000 to cover any legal fees, the company said. Roger Devlin, Persimmon's chairman, said there was ongoing ""distraction"" over the Â£75m pay award and a change of leadership was needed. However, he also pointed out that the company's stock market value had doubled since Mr Fairburn took over in 2013. Mr Devlin, who was appointed chairman in June, also said that under his tenure the company had also handed more than Â£2.2bn to shareholders. Speaking on a call with analysts, Mr Devlin noted that the financial performance could not trump other factors. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the ""disastrous [BBC] TV interview... may well have been the final straw"". Your boss offers you a pay deal that will only see you do well if the company does well. All the directors agree, and the shareholders are nearly unanimous in their support. The company does well - much better than expected - and your promised bonanza duly arrives. Hooray! Or rather, oh no, if your name is Jeff Fairburn. There was no issue with the way he ran the company, it was just reputational damage caused by the Â£75m pay award. The public concern was stoked by the feeling that some of Persimmon's success was thanks to public subsidy - the Help to Buy programme has helped fuel the housing market, with Persimmon one of the beneficiaries. There is also a wider concern - which is beginning to surface among economic commentators - that the big housebuilders are simply doing too well, with their enormous returns to shareholders over recent years the result not of good management but of the exploitation of what has become an oligopoly. Mr Fairburn had previously said he would give a ""substantial proportion"" of the bonus to charity in an attempt to defuse the row. However, he acknowledged that had not worked, partly because he never disclosed how much would be handed over. ""It is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down,"" he said. The bonus was based on awards of shares, the value of which rose sharply when low interest rates and a government house buying scheme helped raise Persimmon's performance. When the LTIP was set up in 2012 the shares were trading at Â£4 but by the time bonuses were handed out last year the shares were trading at Â£24. As there was no cap on the award of shares, it meant there was no limit to the payout. Chairman Roger Devlin replaced Nicholas Wrigley, whose resignation was announced in December. Jonathan Davie, the non-executive director who was head of the remuneration committee, left at the same time. The company said they had resigned because they realised the bonus scheme should have had a cap. The company took further steps to attempt to defuse the row before April's annual general meeting by announcing that Mr Fairburn's bonus payout would be cut by Â£25m by reducing the number of shares he was entitled to. At that meeting AGM 48.5% of investors' votes were cast against the remuneration report. Euan Stirling of Aberdeen Standard Investments said Persimmon's reputation had been ""tarnished"". Ashley Hamilton Claxton, from Royal London Asset Management, said the company's move was ""understandable"", but was sorry to see ""changes to what we believe have been one of the best management teams in the industry"". David Jenkinson, currently managing director, will be appointed as interim chief executive from 31 December. He had also been caught up in the pay row, as along with Mr Fairburn, and chief financial officer Mike Killoran he stood to share in a Â£200m payout. Mr Jenkinson's share awards were cut by Â£2.5m to Â£40m ahead of the AGM. The company said Mr Jenkinson's pay would not change while he was interim chief executive.

What this all means for Trump,"This video can not be played The story of election night in two minutes The Democrats have clawed their way back to a measure of power in the US federal government. The era of unified rule for Donald Trump and the Republicans is over. Calling just two years an ""era"" may be a stretch, of course, but in the age of Trump even days and weeks can seem like an infinite and expanding series of news cycles. For the duration of his presidency, Mr Trump has benefited from a friendly Congress - generally supportive of his words and deeds, accommodating of his policy priorities and deferential when it comes to oversight. In two months, when the new Democratic-controlled House arrives in Washington, all that will change. The House of Representatives, which reliably churned out hard-line immigration legislation, Obamacare repeal and steep cuts to social programmes under Republican rule - even though many of the bills died in the Senate - will now start offering up progressive priorities. First on the list, according to the likely Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, is a package of government ethics and election reform measures. Now it's Democrats' turn to see their efforts languish in the Senate, but liberals finally have a platform to showcase what they would do with full control of Congress - and, perhaps, the presidency in 2020. Meanwhile, Mr Trump's only hope of achieving any signature laws is by working across the aisle - which may be a heavy lift for a man who spent the past few months disparaging his political opponents in the starkest of language at rallies across the country. This video can not be played What losing the House means for Donald Trump's presidency. Of more immediate concern for the president, however, is that Democrats now have some teeth behind their efforts to scrutinise his administration. The House Intelligence Committee, which ran the chamber's investigation into 2016 Russian investigation meddling, will be under the control of outspoken Trump antagonist Adam Schiff, who has pledged to look deeper into the president's foreign financial dealings. It may not be long before the president's tax returns, that Holy Grail for some of the president's liberal antagonists, are revealed to the public. Other members of the Trump administration may also be open to scrutiny. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke may be first under the spotlight following accusations that he took official actions that benefited his business interests. Results page: Winners, losers and races too close to call Live updates and reaction as counting continues Democrats win House in blow to Trump Then there's the i-word - impeachment. It takes a simple majority of the House to undertake the first step to removing a president, and the Democrats now have that majority. Up until now, members of the Democratic congressional leadership have been downplaying the prospect of starting that particular ball rolling. If Special Counsel Robert Mueller files his report into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump 2016 presidential campaign in the coming days (weeks or months) and it contains damning information, that calculus could quickly change. Although the president may be in for a rude awakening from House Democrats, the Republicans' ability to hold - and expand - their majority in the Senate is unequivocally good news for Mr Trump. Democrats had moments to cheer The Republican Party's conservative pipeline to the federal judiciary remains open. The president has already appointed 84 judges to the courts, including two Supreme Court justices. Democrats are left hoping that the four liberal members of the bench remain in good health for the next two years. It will now also be less difficult for the Senate to confirm new high-level Trump administration officials who might have been blocked or significantly delayed if Democrats had taken over. This makes it easier, say, for the president to fire and replace ""beleaguered"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions with someone who would curtail Mr Mueller's Russia probe. At some point the president may even decide to nominate a new director of the Environmental Protection Agency, a position that has been filled on an interim basis since Scott Pruitt resigned under an ethical cloud on 6 July. Beyond the nuts-and-bolts reality of partisan control of Congress, the mid-terms have larger implications for Mr Trump's political power - and his prospects for re-election. For two years he's governed the nation with an eye toward satisfying his loyal base both with policy and rhetoric - on trade, immigration, government regulation and foreign policy. Unlike his predecessors, he's made little effort to broaden his national appeal. That probably helped his party win some Senate seats in states where the president remains popular, but the verdict was far from universal. Joe Manchin once again defied political gravity in West Virginia, and contests in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania that may have seemed in reach in the days after the president's 2016 victory were comfortable wins for the Democratic incumbents. Meanwhile, the preach-to-the-choir strategy may have proven costly in suburban, traditionally Republican congressional districts with wealthier, better-educated populations. These voters stuck by Mr Trump in 2016, but they deserted his party in droves this year. If that trend continues, states like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan may prove more difficult for the president to carry in a 2020 re-election campaign. Mr Trump has liked to boast about all the House Republicans who won special elections during his administration, but this time around, as voters headed to the polls across the nation, his political losses had a sizeable body count. If Mr Trump is eying his re-election prospects - and, let's be honest, that's what every first-term president does pretty much from inauguration day on - Tuesday's results have some bright spots, however. Gone are the days of allies leading the House A Trump-adoring Republican, Ron DeSantis, won the governor's mansion in Florida, as did Republicans in Iowa and Ohio. If Mr Trump's party can win state-wide in those battleground states in the current political climate, there's no reason to think they can't swing the president's way again in two years. Even handing over power to Democrats in the House of Representatives may have a bit of a silver lining for the president. Now he'll have someone to blame if the economy takes a turn for the worse (and, given business cycle realities, it might). He's got a ready-made explanation for why he can't get anything done in the next two years - and a pitch for what needs to change in the next election. Day in and day out, he'll have a set of clear political opponents to contrast himself with. Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lost control of the House in their first term in office and went on to win re-election. History, serving as a guide, predicted this would probably be a bad night for the president. History also indicates that while the road may be rocky, better days could be ahead.

Winners and losers: Results in maps and charts,"In a dramatic election night President Donald Trump's Republican Party retained control of the Senate and the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed to take control of the House. It is the first time the party has held the majority in the lower house of Congress for eight years. The loss of the House will make it harder for President Trump to push his policies forward. What this all means for Trump Meanwhile, the Republicans have kept control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and will increase their majority. They gained Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota from the Democrats, while the Democrats gained seats in Nevada and Arizona. As it happened Key takeaways so far A really simple guide to the mid-terms There was talk before the election of a rising ""blue wave"" - Democrats increasing their vote share across the country. The Democrats increased their vote share in 239 districts, but they didn't win all of them. In West Virginia's 3rd district, there was a 20% swing towards the Democrats, but the seat still went to Republican Carol Miller. One Democrat who substantially increased her party's share was Sharice Davids, the joint-first Native American Congresswoman. She improved the Democrats' vote by 13% to win Kansas' 3rd district. The Republicans raised their vote share in just 67 districts. There will be more women in the House than in any previous year, while the total number of women in Congress overall will be at a record high after the mid-terms, overtaking the current tally of 107.

What is it like to prevent a suicide?,"Gillian says she now has an ""unusual"" and ""unbelievable"" bond with Tommy ""I'm not a hero,"" says Gillian Assor, six months after preventing a suicide on a railway bridge near London. ""I just happened to be walking past."" According to figures from the British Transport Police, 2018 has seen a 20% rise in members of the public intervening to stop people killing themselves on railways. In May, while out walking her dog, Gillian became one of those people. ""At first I didn't know what it was,"" she tells the BBC, recounting her journey back home past the bridge. ""But as we got closer, I realised it was a person. ""They were crying, hysterically crying and making noises."" At that moment, Gillian decided to investigate, but it would not be until months later that she would realise the true impact of her actions. ""I knew I had to have a plan,"" says Gillian. She feared the man might be aggressive, either verbally or physically, but says she knew that, no matter what, she ""wasn't going to walk past him"". Slowly, with her dog, she approached and called out to ask if the man ""was OK"". ""No I'm not,"" he shouted back. 'His death was the missing piece of the jigsaw' The day my friend stopped me walking into the sea ""I could see that he was in a really bad state,"" says Gillian. ""He was angry but he was crying as well."" She says she decided ""she was going to be brave"" and approach him. Gillian persuaded him to sit down with her on the Tarmac in the middle of the bridge with ""him on one side, me on the other and the dog in between us"". From experience of her daughter's anxiety, Gillian knew of the importance of ""grounding"", so began to ask basic questions such as his name and where he was from to ""break his emotion"". His name was Tommy. He was 23 years old. After ""10 or 15 minutes"", Tommy began to calm down but was ""still monosyllabic"". At that point, a train passed below them. It made Gillian wonder whether he ""would have gone"" if she had not been there. If you or someone you know is struggling with issues raised by this story, find support throughBBC Action Line. Tommy told Gillian why he was on the bridge, but that, she says, is a matter that will remain between them. Eventually, she persuaded Tommy to call his parents and let them know where he was. She waited until they arrived - about 25 minutes after she first approached Tommy - then retreated. ""I was a bit blown away, thinking: 'Did that just happen?'"" Gillian only spoke to her mother and a friend about her experience - but later in the year realised people she had never met were discussing her story online. One Sunday morning, her husband showed her a Facebook post. It began: ""I know I'm asking the impossible, and I know this is like looking for a needle in a haystack, but four months ago I tried to take my life and and a stranger stopped me with her dog..."" Gillian, Tommy and Gillian's dog, who sat between them on the bridge As she read the post, Gillian realised she was the stranger. She decided not to reply on the thread - ""I thought, it's not about me and it shouldn't be about me. It was about him."" Her husband sent Tommy a private message, explaining the stranger was his wife. The pair spoke on the phone that day. Three days later they arranged to meet in a local pub. ""I saw him walking from the other side of the pub, he flung his arms around me and I thought: 'Bless him.'"" He clung to her for more than a minute, saying: ""You saved my life. You saved my life."" They spent an hour together, which Gillian describes as ""special"". ""Since then we've walked the dog a few times and we're in contact two or three times a week,"" she says. ""It is the most overwhelming feeling I've ever had, other than giving birth. ""He's in my heart now. The bond is there and it is unbelievable. ""It's a very unusual bond - it's not spiritual, it's just an invisible and not tangible thing in my heart."" Tommy is still waiting for counselling on the NHS, Gillian says, but the pair have planned a trip back to the bridge where they met ""to make a nice, new experience"".

"Building boss out over ÃÂ£75m pay rowPersimmon said Jeff Fairburn was leaving because the ""negative impact"" on its reputation over his pay.","This video can not be played Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his pay The boss of Persimmon Jeff Fairburn has been forced out after a row over his Â£75m pay award. Persimmon said he left by ""mutual agreement and at the request of the company"". It said the issue was having a ""negative impact"" on the firm's reputation and on ""Jeff's ability to continue in his role"". Last month Mr Fairburn walked away from a BBC interview when asked about his pay. ""I'd rather not talk about that,"" he told a BBC reporter when asked in October about the pay award. Mr Fairburn had seen his pay package reduced from Â£100m after a public outcry. He will now keep Â£75m worth of shares when he leaves at the end of next month. The company said it could not claw back any of the share awards, known as a long-term incentive award (LTIP). It added that he would receive no further pay after he left on 31 December. He will be given up to Â£10,000 to cover any legal fees, the company said. Roger Devlin, Persimmon's chairman, said there was ongoing ""distraction"" over the Â£75m pay award and a change of leadership was needed. However, he also pointed out that the company's stock market value had doubled since Mr Fairburn took over in 2013. Mr Devlin, who was appointed chairman in June, also said that under his tenure the company had also handed more than Â£2.2bn to shareholders. Speaking on a call with analysts, Mr Devlin noted that the financial performance could not trump other factors. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the ""disastrous [BBC] TV interview... may well have been the final straw"". Your boss offers you a pay deal that will only see you do well if the company does well. All the directors agree, and the shareholders are nearly unanimous in their support. The company does well - much better than expected - and your promised bonanza duly arrives. Hooray! Or rather, oh no, if your name is Jeff Fairburn. There was no issue with the way he ran the company, it was just reputational damage caused by the Â£75m pay award. The public concern was stoked by the feeling that some of Persimmon's success was thanks to public subsidy - the Help to Buy programme has helped fuel the housing market, with Persimmon one of the beneficiaries. There is also a wider concern - which is beginning to surface among economic commentators - that the big housebuilders are simply doing too well, with their enormous returns to shareholders over recent years the result not of good management but of the exploitation of what has become an oligopoly. Mr Fairburn had previously said he would give a ""substantial proportion"" of the bonus to charity in an attempt to defuse the row. However, he acknowledged that had not worked, partly because he never disclosed how much would be handed over. ""It is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down,"" he said. The bonus was based on awards of shares, the value of which rose sharply when low interest rates and a government house buying scheme helped raise Persimmon's performance. When the LTIP was set up in 2012 the shares were trading at Â£4 but by the time bonuses were handed out last year the shares were trading at Â£24. As there was no cap on the award of shares, it meant there was no limit to the payout. Chairman Roger Devlin replaced Nicholas Wrigley, whose resignation was announced in December. Jonathan Davie, the non-executive director who was head of the remuneration committee, left at the same time. The company said they had resigned because they realised the bonus scheme should have had a cap. The company took further steps to attempt to defuse the row before April's annual general meeting by announcing that Mr Fairburn's bonus payout would be cut by Â£25m by reducing the number of shares he was entitled to. At that meeting AGM 48.5% of investors' votes were cast against the remuneration report. Euan Stirling of Aberdeen Standard Investments said Persimmon's reputation had been ""tarnished"". Ashley Hamilton Claxton, from Royal London Asset Management, said the company's move was ""understandable"", but was sorry to see ""changes to what we believe have been one of the best management teams in the industry"". David Jenkinson, currently managing director, will be appointed as interim chief executive from 31 December. He had also been caught up in the pay row, as along with Mr Fairburn, and chief financial officer Mike Killoran he stood to share in a Â£200m payout. Mr Jenkinson's share awards were cut by Â£2.5m to Â£40m ahead of the AGM. The company said Mr Jenkinson's pay would not change while he was interim chief executive.

5G will let users 'ditch home broadband'The chief executive of Three UK says UK homes could benefit from giving up their fixed-line connections.,"Many families currently pay for a separate mobile and home broadband services 5G mobile data will be so reliable and fast most homes will no longer need a separate home broadband connection, according to one of the companies planning to launch a UK service. Three UK's chief executive told BBC News there would be enough capacity on 5G to cope with demand, meaning households would be able to save money by ending their fixed-line contracts. He predicts consumers will use 13 times as much mobile data in 2025 as today. But one expert warned against ""hype"". Three has said it intends to launch its first 5G services in the UK assoon as the middle of next year,external. Its announcement coincides with news from BT's mobile division, EE, that it hasswitched on nine 5G trial sites in London,external. Vodafone and Telefonica-owned O2 have also bought spectrum to launch 5G services of their own in the country. In theory, 5G could offer download speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second or even 20Gbps - although these are unlikely to be attained for many years if at all. Most handsets are not yet capable of pushing 4G speeds to their limits, so UK networks are under pressure to convince the public of the need to upgrade having spent more than had been predicted on the spectrum auctioned to date. When can I buy a 5G phone and how much will it be? Will 5G be necessary for self-driving cars? Hologram phone calls - sci-fi or serious possibility? As part of its pitch, Three is making the case that 5G will offer a ""genuine alternative"" to fixed-line copper  and fibre services. Mr Dyson has led Three UK since 2011 ""Maybe not for the whole country, but certainly a significant majority of the country, I strongly believe 5G can offer a good enough home broadband experience for people to effectively ditch their copper [or fibre] connection,"" said David Dyson, Three UK's chief executive. ""The challenge in terms of why we can't do that today is that the mobile networks don't have the capacity with 3G or 4G. 5G changes all of that."" Capacity refers to the amount of data that can be handled at any one time rather than the speed. Three already provides a 4G-based ""unlimited data"" home broadband service in London, called Relish, which it acquired last year. But Mr Dyson said the business had to be careful how many people it signed up, to prevent its service degrading. This, he said, would not be a problem with 5G. But one industry-watcher said it was still unclear how reliable the technology would be. ""Stability is important for video streaming at HD and Ultra HD quality levels, and paramount for the gaming community,"" said Andrew Ferguson, from the news site Thinkbroadband. ""Full-fibre services are going to beat 5G as you have a connection as stable as the one that will be feeding the mobile masts and thus the variables of signal strength dropping due to a bus passing the home are avoided."" The government is currently pursuing a target of ""full-fibre"" broadband coverage to the whole UK by 2033, in which high-speed optical cables are used to bring data right up to buildings without having to rely on slower copper for part of the journey. At present, only 5% of all properties have access to the full-fibre connections,according to the regulator Ofcom,external. But Three's chief executive suggested the cost involved could help make 5G a more attractive option. ""Fibre-to-the-home for the small number of customers who value it and need it will probably provide a faster speed,"" Mr Dyson said. ""But I think for the majority of people, 5G will be a genuine alternative. ""It's still quite unclear to me, as I'm sure it is to many people, what is going to be the price of all these fibre-to-the-home deployments when it actually arrives ""It's expensive to dig up roads. It takes a lot of time and money. ""It's much cheaper and quicker to provide that connectivity via a wireless connection."" What is 5G and what will it mean for you? When can I buy a 5G phone and how much will it be?

"Man, 98, fighting for life after robbery","Peter Gouldstone is being treated in hospital after sustaining bruising and a head injury A 98-year-old man is fighting for his life after he was attacked and robbed in his home. Peter Gouldstone was found with bruising and a head injury at a house in Evesham Road, in the Bounds Green area of north London, on Tuesday. His son Simon said he ""feared the worst"" when he found his beaten father in a ""semi-conscious state"". The Met Police described it as a ""brutal and senseless"" attack. No arrests have been made. Simon Gouldstone said his father was house-bound and suffers from a heart condition. He described him as ""a low key, peaceful and supportive sort of person"" who lived in ""a fairly peaceful neighbourhood."" Simon Gouldstone said his father was house-bound and suffers from a heart condition Emma Austen, who lives near Mr Gouldstone, said the community is trying to do everything it can to help him and his family. ""A lot of us didn't know him, but we just really want to help in anyway we possibly can"", she said. ""If that's via fundraising, helping his family, writing cards - we just want to help. It's a truly awful thing to have happened."" The 98-year-old was found seriously injured in his home in Evesham Road Pio Gomes, 78, another neighbour of Mr Gouldstone, said he rarely saw the pensioner outside his home since his wife died several years ago. ""I used to take his bins out for him because he wasn't steady,"" he said. ""Of course it affects you because it's worrying. It's callous. Who could have done this to an old man like him?"" One elderly woman, who did not want to be named, said she rang Mr Gouldstone's son after noticing his garage door was open, which was ""unusual"". She said: ""His son came and then police and an ambulance were here until it was dark. ""I've known him for many years and he has a charming family. It's not nice."" A police cordon was set up in the alleyway behind the row of terraced houses During a search of Mr Gouldstone's home, police officers found a television and other personal belongings had been taken. Det Insp Paul Ridley said his bedroom had been ""ransacked"". ""It was an absolutely horrendous attack on a vulnerable man who has medical conditions,"" he said. ""The level of violence used was beyond belief."" Mr Gouldstone spoke to a family member by phone on 5 November at 14:00 GMT - police believe the attack took place in the 20-hour window between then and when he was found. He remains in a life-threatening condition at an east London hospital.

Helicopter checks after Leicester crash,"This video can not be played The widely shared footage shows the helicopter taking off Safety checks have been ordered on helicopters of a similar design to the one involved in a crash which killed the owner of Leicester City. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) has issued an emergency Airworthiness Directive focusing on the tail rotor of the AW169. Club owner Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha and four others died in the crash at the King Power stadium on 27 October. The safety checks are described as a ""precautionary measure"". (L-R): Vichai Srivaddhanaprabha, Kaveporn Punpare, Nusara Suknamai, Izabela Roza Lechowicz and Eric Swaffer died in the crash The AgustaWestland AW169, manufactured by Italian aerospace company Leonardo, has not been involved in any recorded accidents before, and the EASA directive emphasises the cause of the crash has not been identified. It states: ""While the helicopter was on a take-off phase at low forward speed, a loss of yaw control has been observed. ""As a precautionary measure, Leonardo issued ASB 169-120 for AW169 helicopters to provide inspection instructions to check correct installation of the tail rotor (TR) servo-actuator."" A huge number of tributes have been left outside the club's stadium Servo-actuators are part of the tail rotor flight control system and play a vital part in maintaining stability of the aircraft. The directive says inspections are to be carried out within 24 hours or within five flight hours, whichever occurs first. It adds: ""The incorrect installation of the TR servo-actuator, if not detected and corrected, depending on the flight condition, could possibly result in loss of control of the helicopter."" The results of inspections should be reported to the manufacturer. The directive also states it is ""an interim action"" and further action may follow. The Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) is conducting an investigation into the cause of the crash having taken the wreckage to a facility in Farnborough, Hampshire.

What this all means for TrumpWinners and losers: Results in maps and chartsFive key things we learned from mid-termsFirst and new facesVideoVideoThe story of the night in two minutes,"This video can not be played The story of election night in two minutes The Democrats have clawed their way back to a measure of power in the US federal government. The era of unified rule for Donald Trump and the Republicans is over. Calling just two years an ""era"" may be a stretch, of course, but in the age of Trump even days and weeks can seem like an infinite and expanding series of news cycles. For the duration of his presidency, Mr Trump has benefited from a friendly Congress - generally supportive of his words and deeds, accommodating of his policy priorities and deferential when it comes to oversight. In two months, when the new Democratic-controlled House arrives in Washington, all that will change. The House of Representatives, which reliably churned out hard-line immigration legislation, Obamacare repeal and steep cuts to social programmes under Republican rule - even though many of the bills died in the Senate - will now start offering up progressive priorities. First on the list, according to the likely Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, is a package of government ethics and election reform measures. Now it's Democrats' turn to see their efforts languish in the Senate, but liberals finally have a platform to showcase what they would do with full control of Congress - and, perhaps, the presidency in 2020. Meanwhile, Mr Trump's only hope of achieving any signature laws is by working across the aisle - which may be a heavy lift for a man who spent the past few months disparaging his political opponents in the starkest of language at rallies across the country. This video can not be played What losing the House means for Donald Trump's presidency. Of more immediate concern for the president, however, is that Democrats now have some teeth behind their efforts to scrutinise his administration. The House Intelligence Committee, which ran the chamber's investigation into 2016 Russian investigation meddling, will be under the control of outspoken Trump antagonist Adam Schiff, who has pledged to look deeper into the president's foreign financial dealings. It may not be long before the president's tax returns, that Holy Grail for some of the president's liberal antagonists, are revealed to the public. Other members of the Trump administration may also be open to scrutiny. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke may be first under the spotlight following accusations that he took official actions that benefited his business interests. Results page: Winners, losers and races too close to call Live updates and reaction as counting continues Democrats win House in blow to Trump Then there's the i-word - impeachment. It takes a simple majority of the House to undertake the first step to removing a president, and the Democrats now have that majority. Up until now, members of the Democratic congressional leadership have been downplaying the prospect of starting that particular ball rolling. If Special Counsel Robert Mueller files his report into possible collusion between Russia and the Trump 2016 presidential campaign in the coming days (weeks or months) and it contains damning information, that calculus could quickly change. Although the president may be in for a rude awakening from House Democrats, the Republicans' ability to hold - and expand - their majority in the Senate is unequivocally good news for Mr Trump. Democrats had moments to cheer The Republican Party's conservative pipeline to the federal judiciary remains open. The president has already appointed 84 judges to the courts, including two Supreme Court justices. Democrats are left hoping that the four liberal members of the bench remain in good health for the next two years. It will now also be less difficult for the Senate to confirm new high-level Trump administration officials who might have been blocked or significantly delayed if Democrats had taken over. This makes it easier, say, for the president to fire and replace ""beleaguered"" Attorney General Jeff Sessions with someone who would curtail Mr Mueller's Russia probe. At some point the president may even decide to nominate a new director of the Environmental Protection Agency, a position that has been filled on an interim basis since Scott Pruitt resigned under an ethical cloud on 6 July. Beyond the nuts-and-bolts reality of partisan control of Congress, the mid-terms have larger implications for Mr Trump's political power - and his prospects for re-election. For two years he's governed the nation with an eye toward satisfying his loyal base both with policy and rhetoric - on trade, immigration, government regulation and foreign policy. Unlike his predecessors, he's made little effort to broaden his national appeal. That probably helped his party win some Senate seats in states where the president remains popular, but the verdict was far from universal. Joe Manchin once again defied political gravity in West Virginia, and contests in Wisconsin, Michigan, Ohio and Pennsylvania that may have seemed in reach in the days after the president's 2016 victory were comfortable wins for the Democratic incumbents. Meanwhile, the preach-to-the-choir strategy may have proven costly in suburban, traditionally Republican congressional districts with wealthier, better-educated populations. These voters stuck by Mr Trump in 2016, but they deserted his party in droves this year. If that trend continues, states like Arizona, Pennsylvania and Michigan may prove more difficult for the president to carry in a 2020 re-election campaign. Mr Trump has liked to boast about all the House Republicans who won special elections during his administration, but this time around, as voters headed to the polls across the nation, his political losses had a sizeable body count. If Mr Trump is eying his re-election prospects - and, let's be honest, that's what every first-term president does pretty much from inauguration day on - Tuesday's results have some bright spots, however. Gone are the days of allies leading the House A Trump-adoring Republican, Ron DeSantis, won the governor's mansion in Florida, as did Republicans in Iowa and Ohio. If Mr Trump's party can win state-wide in those battleground states in the current political climate, there's no reason to think they can't swing the president's way again in two years. Even handing over power to Democrats in the House of Representatives may have a bit of a silver lining for the president. Now he'll have someone to blame if the economy takes a turn for the worse (and, given business cycle realities, it might). He's got a ready-made explanation for why he can't get anything done in the next two years - and a pitch for what needs to change in the next election. Day in and day out, he'll have a set of clear political opponents to contrast himself with. Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lost control of the House in their first term in office and went on to win re-election. History, serving as a guide, predicted this would probably be a bad night for the president. History also indicates that while the road may be rocky, better days could be ahead.

Winners and losers: Results in maps and chartsFive key things we learned from mid-termsFirst and new facesVideoVideoThe story of the night in two minutes,"In a dramatic election night President Donald Trump's Republican Party retained control of the Senate and the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed to take control of the House. It is the first time the party has held the majority in the lower house of Congress for eight years. The loss of the House will make it harder for President Trump to push his policies forward. What this all means for Trump Meanwhile, the Republicans have kept control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and will increase their majority. They gained Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota from the Democrats, while the Democrats gained seats in Nevada and Arizona. As it happened Key takeaways so far A really simple guide to the mid-terms There was talk before the election of a rising ""blue wave"" - Democrats increasing their vote share across the country. The Democrats increased their vote share in 239 districts, but they didn't win all of them. In West Virginia's 3rd district, there was a 20% swing towards the Democrats, but the seat still went to Republican Carol Miller. One Democrat who substantially increased her party's share was Sharice Davids, the joint-first Native American Congresswoman. She improved the Democrats' vote by 13% to win Kansas' 3rd district. The Republicans raised their vote share in just 67 districts. There will be more women in the House than in any previous year, while the total number of women in Congress overall will be at a record high after the mid-terms, overtaking the current tally of 107.

This is subject totheir terms and conditionsand the BBC does not have access to this data. What do the midterm results mean for women in Congress? The 2018 mid-terms is set to be historical for voter turnout. With just a few seats left to be re-counted, 49.2% of those allowed to vote have done so. This is higher than any year since 1914. In 2014, just 37% of those eligible voted. Some 115 million votes were cast in the House in 2018, according to estimates by the US Elections Project, up from 83 million in 2014. How the mid-term elections broke records In the House, Democrats increased their vote share in hundreds of seats, with vote share dropping in just 47 seats. Boundary changes also helped them, as changes in Pennsylvania saw them gain four seats in the state, compared to 2016. They also gained two seats in the southern tip of Florida, a classic swing state. Compared with the last Congressional election in 2016, Republicans lost support in those counties with the most university-educated white women. While minorities are much more likely to vote Democrat. And in rural areas, there was strong support for Republican candidates. President Trump's core constituencies of white working class voters also appear to have turned out for the party in House races.

Children found in refrigerated lorry,"A man suspected of being the driver of the lorry has appeared in court Twenty-one people, including children as young as 12, have been found inside a refrigerated lorry entering the UK. The group, thought to be from Vietnam, was concealed among a load of sparkling water at the port of Newhaven in Sussex on Thursday. Details of the Border Force operation have only just emerged, but a criminal investigation is under way. A Romanian man, believed to be the driver, has been charged with assisting unlawful entry into the UK. It had earlier been reported 15 children had been found in the lorry, but the figure was later revised by the Home Office. A spokesman said the group included 17 people claiming to be aged between 12 and 17 who ""presented themselves as Vietnamese"". ""A total of 11 were later confirmed to be minors. They were passed into the care of social services,"" he said. The truck was stopped at the port of Newhaven on Thursday A spokesman for East Sussex County Council added: ""Age assessments were carried out... and concluded that five were in fact adults aged over 18."" He said the children were placed with foster carers or in supported housing. One of the children had since absconded from council care, he said. The lorry was stopped on its arrival from Dieppe in France. The children did not require medical treatment. The adults - five women and five men - were interviewed by immigration officials, the Home Office said. An 18-year-old man and a woman aged 27 have been removed from the UK. The eight other adults, aged between 21 and 28, have been told they must report regularly to the Home Office while their cases are assessed. Andrut Duma, 29, appeared before magistrates on Saturday accused of immigration offences and has been remanded in custody until a hearing at Lewes Crown Court on 26 November.

"JK Rowling sues former PA for ÃÂ£24,000The Harry Potter author claims the ex-employee used her money to fund shopping sprees for luxury goods.Scotland","Harry Potter author JK Rowling has launched a Â£24,000 legal claim against a former employee for allegedly using her money to go on shopping sprees. Ms Rowling, 53, claims Amanda Donaldson broke strict working rules by using her funds to buy cosmetics and gifts. Ms Donaldson worked as a personal assistant for the writer between February 2014 and April 2017, before being sacked for gross misconduct. The 35-year-old from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, has denied the claims. Legal papers lodged at Airdrie Sheriff Court allege Ms Donaldson wrongly benefited to a value of Â£23,696.32 by spending on a business credit card and taking Harry Potter merchandise. It is claimed Ms Donaldson had responsibility for funds and was provided with a credit card for buying items in connection with business and personal affairs only. She had to submit statements and receipts once a month to the accountants and also had access to a safe containing foreign money. But discrepancies were picked up in February last year on statements revealing a high volume of personal spending by Ms Donaldson. She had a meeting with an accountant to discuss use of the card and was suspended. Ms Rowling has alleged Ms Donaldson made a series of unauthorised payments, including: Â£823 at Bibi Bakery Â£1,482 at luxury candle company Jo Malone Â£3,629 in cosmetic firm Molton Brown Â£2,139 in card shop Paper Tiger Â£1,636 in Starbucks. Ms Rowling also claims Ms Donaldson, who controlled memorabilia requests from fans, used her position to steal a Harry Potter motorised Hogwarts Express worth Â£467.56, a Harry Potter Wizard Collection worth Â£2231.76 and a Harry Potter Tales of Beedle The Bard Set worth Â£395. Ms Rowling says the toys were taken without her ""knowledge or consent"". It is alleged Ms Donaldson bought two cats worth Â£1,200 and withdrew Â£400 in cash for a deposit for a restaurant lunch but that Ms Rowling's husband Neil Murray discovered no deposit had been paid. The author also claimed her former employee took Â£7,742-worth of foreign money from a safe. Ms Rowling claims her husband, Neil Murray, discovered that a Â£400 deposit for lunch at a restaurant was not paid Ms Donaldson has denied the claims and said Ms Rowling had ""not suffered any loss and is not entitled to damages"" from her. A spokeswoman for Ms Rowling said: ""I can confirm JK Rowling has taken legal action against her former personal assistant, Amanda Donaldson, following her dismissal for gross misconduct involving a substantial breach of trust. ""As the case is not yet concluded we are not able to comment further and there won't be any comment from JK Rowling."" Ms Donaldson was unavailable for comment. The case before Sheriff Derek O'Carroll is due back in court later this year.

"Children found in refrigerated lorryEleven children and 10 adults, thought to be Vietnamese, were found in the vehicle at Newhaven port.Sussex","A man suspected of being the driver of the lorry has appeared in court Twenty-one people, including children as young as 12, have been found inside a refrigerated lorry entering the UK. The group, thought to be from Vietnam, was concealed among a load of sparkling water at the port of Newhaven in Sussex on Thursday. Details of the Border Force operation have only just emerged, but a criminal investigation is under way. A Romanian man, believed to be the driver, has been charged with assisting unlawful entry into the UK. It had earlier been reported 15 children had been found in the lorry, but the figure was later revised by the Home Office. A spokesman said the group included 17 people claiming to be aged between 12 and 17 who ""presented themselves as Vietnamese"". ""A total of 11 were later confirmed to be minors. They were passed into the care of social services,"" he said. The truck was stopped at the port of Newhaven on Thursday A spokesman for East Sussex County Council added: ""Age assessments were carried out... and concluded that five were in fact adults aged over 18."" He said the children were placed with foster carers or in supported housing. One of the children had since absconded from council care, he said. The lorry was stopped on its arrival from Dieppe in France. The children did not require medical treatment. The adults - five women and five men - were interviewed by immigration officials, the Home Office said. An 18-year-old man and a woman aged 27 have been removed from the UK. The eight other adults, aged between 21 and 28, have been told they must report regularly to the Home Office while their cases are assessed. Andrut Duma, 29, appeared before magistrates on Saturday accused of immigration offences and has been remanded in custody until a hearing at Lewes Crown Court on 26 November.

5G will let users 'ditch home broadband'The chief executive of Three UK says UK homes could benefit from giving up their fixed-line connections.Technology,"Many families currently pay for a separate mobile and home broadband services 5G mobile data will be so reliable and fast most homes will no longer need a separate home broadband connection, according to one of the companies planning to launch a UK service. Three UK's chief executive told BBC News there would be enough capacity on 5G to cope with demand, meaning households would be able to save money by ending their fixed-line contracts. He predicts consumers will use 13 times as much mobile data in 2025 as today. But one expert warned against ""hype"". Three has said it intends to launch its first 5G services in the UK assoon as the middle of next year,external. Its announcement coincides with news from BT's mobile division, EE, that it hasswitched on nine 5G trial sites in London,external. Vodafone and Telefonica-owned O2 have also bought spectrum to launch 5G services of their own in the country. In theory, 5G could offer download speeds of up to 10 gigabits per second or even 20Gbps - although these are unlikely to be attained for many years if at all. Most handsets are not yet capable of pushing 4G speeds to their limits, so UK networks are under pressure to convince the public of the need to upgrade having spent more than had been predicted on the spectrum auctioned to date. When can I buy a 5G phone and how much will it be? Will 5G be necessary for self-driving cars? Hologram phone calls - sci-fi or serious possibility? As part of its pitch, Three is making the case that 5G will offer a ""genuine alternative"" to fixed-line copper  and fibre services. Mr Dyson has led Three UK since 2011 ""Maybe not for the whole country, but certainly a significant majority of the country, I strongly believe 5G can offer a good enough home broadband experience for people to effectively ditch their copper [or fibre] connection,"" said David Dyson, Three UK's chief executive. ""The challenge in terms of why we can't do that today is that the mobile networks don't have the capacity with 3G or 4G. 5G changes all of that."" Capacity refers to the amount of data that can be handled at any one time rather than the speed. Three already provides a 4G-based ""unlimited data"" home broadband service in London, called Relish, which it acquired last year. But Mr Dyson said the business had to be careful how many people it signed up, to prevent its service degrading. This, he said, would not be a problem with 5G. But one industry-watcher said it was still unclear how reliable the technology would be. ""Stability is important for video streaming at HD and Ultra HD quality levels, and paramount for the gaming community,"" said Andrew Ferguson, from the news site Thinkbroadband. ""Full-fibre services are going to beat 5G as you have a connection as stable as the one that will be feeding the mobile masts and thus the variables of signal strength dropping due to a bus passing the home are avoided."" The government is currently pursuing a target of ""full-fibre"" broadband coverage to the whole UK by 2033, in which high-speed optical cables are used to bring data right up to buildings without having to rely on slower copper for part of the journey. At present, only 5% of all properties have access to the full-fibre connections,according to the regulator Ofcom,external. But Three's chief executive suggested the cost involved could help make 5G a more attractive option. ""Fibre-to-the-home for the small number of customers who value it and need it will probably provide a faster speed,"" Mr Dyson said. ""But I think for the majority of people, 5G will be a genuine alternative. ""It's still quite unclear to me, as I'm sure it is to many people, what is going to be the price of all these fibre-to-the-home deployments when it actually arrives ""It's expensive to dig up roads. It takes a lot of time and money. ""It's much cheaper and quicker to provide that connectivity via a wireless connection."" What is 5G and what will it mean for you? When can I buy a 5G phone and how much will it be?

Children 'don't know wall crush dad dead',"Wall victims clockwise from top left: Mahamadou Jagana Jagana, Almamo Kinteh Jammeh, Saibo Sumbundu Sillah, Bangally Tunkara Dukuray and Ousman Kaba Diaby A widow whose husband died alongside four others in a wall collapse at a scrap yard in 2016 has still not told her children, an inquest heard. Alimamo Jammeh, 45, was one of five workers killed instantly by the ""catastrophic failure"" of the 15ft (4.6m) of concrete, a jury heard. His wife, Awa Dibba, told a hearing his ""little children ask every day for their dad"". The inquest in Birmingham is set to last two and a half weeks. Ousmane Diaby, 39, Bangally Dukureh, 55, Saibo Sillah, 42, and Muhamadou Jagana, 49, also died at Hawkeswood Metal Recycling, Birmingham, in July 2016. Jurors heard all five men - four from the Gambia and one from Senegal - had been working in Spain, where they had found it increasingly difficult to find employment. After coming to the UK, they began working at the plant in Nechells. West Mids news: Footballer guilty of car park assault, plus more Birmingham and Solihull coroner Emma Brown said: ""They were clearing out a scrap metal storage bay when one of the walls, made of heavy concrete blocks, fell on to them."" When emergency services arrived, ""it was identified that all five men were deceased"", she said. Relatives of the men could be seen crying while others had their heads in their hands as Ms Brown read out post-mortem examination results. Two pathologists reported each man suffered ""devastating blunt force injuries"", which were mainly to the chest, head and pelvis, she said. All had to be identified by their fingerprints, the hearing was told. In evidence, Mr Diaby's widow Aminata Kaba said she learned of his death as word spread on Whatsapp, the inquest heard. She said she was approached by people who got the news on the messaging app. ""Someone told me that someone had put it in WhatsApp because they did not know his close family in Birmingham,"" she said. Emergency crews rushed to the scene in Nechells on 7 July ""Then we went to the mosque and they said someone has died called Ousmane Diaby and that's how I knew about his death. ""Then my husband's uncle heard about it and told me about his death."" Widows of other victims described the effect of the deaths on them and their children. Mr Dukuray's wife Hawa Kaba said the loss of her husband had been ""absolutely devastating"". ""Since my husband's death my son has become very quiet and withdrawn,"" she said. ""I have found life a huge struggle and I miss him daily."" Mr Jammeh's wife Awa Dibba said she had still not told her children about their father's death. ""Almamo worked so hard and loved his family,"" she said. ""The little children ask every day for their dad, they don't know he has died."" The bodies of the men were recovered several days after the wall collapsed Det Insp Nigel Harrison from West Midlands Police told the hearing there was ""catastrophic failure of a wall"" and the men's death would have been ""instantaneous."" He added: ""Due to the weight of the metal ingots in the adjacent bay, the amount of force pushing against the wall caused it to collapse and fall onto the victims."" Ms Brown set out the four main topics for the inquests, which include events at the plant, the medical cause of death, the cause of the wall's collapse and the construction, maintenance and risk assessment of the site. West Midlands Police detectives and the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) are continuing to investigate the incident.

Firm made staff drink urine and eat bugs,"If you miss your sales target, bon appÃ©tit Managers at a Chinese firm have been jailed for making staff who failed to reach sales targets drink urine and eat cockroaches, local media report. Police took action after videos emerged showing workers being whipped with a belt and drinking a yellow liquid. Social media posts alleged staff were also told to eat cockroaches if they did not meet targets. Three managers were jailed for five and 10 days over the incident, the South China Morning Post reports. A widely-shared video posted on Chinese social media site Weibo shows a male employee standing in the middle of a circle, getting whipped with a belt. The video quickly went viral on Weibo Other staff, said to be employees of the home renovation company in the city of Guizhou, can be seen drinking yellow liquid from plastic cups while holding their noses. Screenshots of what were said to be messages from the managers threaten staff that they will have to eat cockroaches for poor performances. According to media reports, other forms of shaming and punishment at the firm have included drinking toilet water or vinegar and getting their head shaved. Social media post said the yellow liquid was urine The company had reportedly failed to pay their employees' salary for the past two months and staff was scared to speak up fearing they would lose the pay if they'd quit.

Gove wants to see Brexit legal advice,"The government is facing calls to reveal legal advice on how a post-Brexit plan for Northern Ireland's border could work. Environment Secretary Michael Gove wants cabinet ministers to see the full details of the so-called ""backstop"" that would prevent a hard border. And Northern Ireland's DUP - which supports the government in key votes - wants it released in full. The border is proving the main sticking point in reaching a Brexit deal. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said it was ""clear that more work is needed"". A leaked plan for presenting a Brexit deal? Ministers 'want EU deal by end of month' May launches Brexit 'business councils' Will one of these men lead the EU? Both sides have agreed to put in place a backstop, also referred to as an insurance policy, that would only be triggered if a future trade deal is not in place by the end of 2020 - or if this final deal does not ensure a frictionless border. This is because there have been warnings that a return of visible border checks could undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland as well as damaging businesses operating on both sides. One option for a backstop is for the whole of the UK to remain temporarily aligned to the EU's customs union, avoiding the need for customs checks at the border. BBC political correspondent Iain Watson said Mr Gove was concerned that legally, under this arrangement, Northern Ireland could have to continue to follow EU rules while the rest of the UK would merely mirror them. He wants to see the full legal advice, fearing cabinet members will only see a summary before having to decide whether to back a deal with Brussels. Allow Twitter content?

The DUP - whose votes Theresa May relies on to win key votes in the Commons - has gone further, saying the legal advice should be released to the public. DUP chief whip Sir Jeffrey Donaldson told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's in the public interest we understand fully what's happening here. ""It's because it affects the whole UK, therefore it shouldn't just be the DUP that sees this advice, or the government. ""If the House of Commons is going to have a meaningful vote on a deal that includes, and upon which this legal advice is very, very important, then I think people are entitled to know what that advice is."" Sir Keir Starmer, Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, said it was ""essential"" MPs saw the legal advice before voting on any deal. ""At this crucial stage, Parliament should not be kept in the dark nor should the government try to bounce MPs into an agreement without all the facts,"" he added. But Conservative MP Anna Soubry said there was a convention not to publish legal advice so government lawyers were not put off from providing ""robust"" opinions. ""If you are a lawyer giving advice to your client you don't expect that to be disclosed to a wider audience,"" she told the BBC. Downing Street said it did not comment on legal advice. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire told the BBC there would be ""good informed conversation between cabinet ministers"". If a deal is reached with the EU, MPs will be asked to approve it in a crucial House of Commons vote before Brexit day on 29 March. Labour votes could be vital to the government's hopes. Sir Keir said it was not the opposition's ""duty"" to back Mrs May's deal. ""We can't be expected, with a gun to our head, to back the prime minister whatever she comes back with,"" he told the Today programme. Sir Keir, who is holding talks with EU figures in Brussels, insisted Labour could persuade the EU to back its proposed Brexit plan of a customs union with freedom for the UK on trade deals and immigration. In response, the Tories said Labour would ""take the country back to square one"" on Brexit. Cabinet ministers met at Downing Street on Tuesday where they agreed they wanted to reach a deal with the EU by the end of the month. The EU says it will only schedule a special summit to agree a deal if enough progress has been made in the negotiations. The government will need to convince both critics within the Tory party and other parties to support any deal that is reached. In full: The notes of a plan for selling Brexit deal And on Tuesday, leaked notes showed how this might be presented. The proposals included key speeches from Theresa May, and interventions from supportive business and foreign leaders. One of those mentioned, Labour Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, told the Today programme this was ""news to me"". The government dismissed the notes, saying: ""The misspelling and childish language in this document should be enough to make clear it doesn't represent the government's thinking.""

Building boss out over Â£75m pay row,"This video can not be played Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his pay The boss of Persimmon Jeff Fairburn has been forced out after a row over his Â£75m pay award. Persimmon said he left by ""mutual agreement and at the request of the company"". It said the issue was having a ""negative impact"" on the firm's reputation and on ""Jeff's ability to continue in his role"". Last month Mr Fairburn walked away from a BBC interview when asked about his pay. ""I'd rather not talk about that,"" he told a BBC reporter when asked in October about the pay award. Mr Fairburn had seen his pay package reduced from Â£100m after a public outcry. He will now keep Â£75m worth of shares when he leaves at the end of next month. The company said it could not claw back any of the share awards, known as a long-term incentive award (LTIP). It added that he would receive no further pay after he left on 31 December. He will be given up to Â£10,000 to cover any legal fees, the company said. Roger Devlin, Persimmon's chairman, said there was ongoing ""distraction"" over the Â£75m pay award and a change of leadership was needed. However, he also pointed out that the company's stock market value had doubled since Mr Fairburn took over in 2013. Mr Devlin, who was appointed chairman in June, also said that under his tenure the company had also handed more than Â£2.2bn to shareholders. Speaking on a call with analysts, Mr Devlin noted that the financial performance could not trump other factors. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the ""disastrous [BBC] TV interview... may well have been the final straw"". Your boss offers you a pay deal that will only see you do well if the company does well. All the directors agree, and the shareholders are nearly unanimous in their support. The company does well - much better than expected - and your promised bonanza duly arrives. Hooray! Or rather, oh no, if your name is Jeff Fairburn. There was no issue with the way he ran the company, it was just reputational damage caused by the Â£75m pay award. The public concern was stoked by the feeling that some of Persimmon's success was thanks to public subsidy - the Help to Buy programme has helped fuel the housing market, with Persimmon one of the beneficiaries. There is also a wider concern - which is beginning to surface among economic commentators - that the big housebuilders are simply doing too well, with their enormous returns to shareholders over recent years the result not of good management but of the exploitation of what has become an oligopoly. Mr Fairburn had previously said he would give a ""substantial proportion"" of the bonus to charity in an attempt to defuse the row. However, he acknowledged that had not worked, partly because he never disclosed how much would be handed over. ""It is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down,"" he said. The bonus was based on awards of shares, the value of which rose sharply when low interest rates and a government house buying scheme helped raise Persimmon's performance. When the LTIP was set up in 2012 the shares were trading at Â£4 but by the time bonuses were handed out last year the shares were trading at Â£24. As there was no cap on the award of shares, it meant there was no limit to the payout. Chairman Roger Devlin replaced Nicholas Wrigley, whose resignation was announced in December. Jonathan Davie, the non-executive director who was head of the remuneration committee, left at the same time. The company said they had resigned because they realised the bonus scheme should have had a cap. The company took further steps to attempt to defuse the row before April's annual general meeting by announcing that Mr Fairburn's bonus payout would be cut by Â£25m by reducing the number of shares he was entitled to. At that meeting AGM 48.5% of investors' votes were cast against the remuneration report. Euan Stirling of Aberdeen Standard Investments said Persimmon's reputation had been ""tarnished"". Ashley Hamilton Claxton, from Royal London Asset Management, said the company's move was ""understandable"", but was sorry to see ""changes to what we believe have been one of the best management teams in the industry"". David Jenkinson, currently managing director, will be appointed as interim chief executive from 31 December. He had also been caught up in the pay row, as along with Mr Fairburn, and chief financial officer Mike Killoran he stood to share in a Â£200m payout. Mr Jenkinson's share awards were cut by Â£2.5m to Â£40m ahead of the AGM. The company said Mr Jenkinson's pay would not change while he was interim chief executive.

England dominate Sri Lanka on day two,"Moeen Ali was England's most successful bowler with four wickets First Test, Galle (day two) England 342(Foakes 107)& 38-0:Jennings 26* Sri Lanka 203:Mathews 52; Moeen 4-66, Rashid 2-30, Leach 2-41 England lead by 177 runs Scorecard England bowled out Sri Lanka on day two of the first Test to move into a dominant position in Galle. Debutant Ben Foakes reached his first Test century before falling for 107 as England added 21 to their overnight total to post 342. The tourists then produced a fine all-round bowling performance, with Moeen Ali taking 4-66, to bowl the hosts out for 203 in 68 overs. England reached 38-0 at the close, 177 runs ahead. Jack Leach and Adil Rashid took two wickets each for England, with seamers James Anderson and Sam Curran getting one apiece. Sri Lanka were 64-4 at lunch before a patient partnership of 75 between Dinesh Chandimal and Angelo Mathews, which was ended when Rashid dismissed Chandimal for 33 shortly before tea. Moeen then had Mathews caught at short leg from the first ball after tea and the final five wickets fell in 18.3 overs in the evening session. England are now in a strong position to secure their first overseas Test victory since October 2016 and end a 13-game winless run away from home. TMS podcast: Foakes' records put England in control & Leach on Crohn's disease Relive the action on day two England have not won any of their past four away Test series - drawing against Bangladesh and losing to India, Australia and New Zealand England's first-innings total had looked like a par score at best but their bowlers have put Joe Root's side in one of their most dominant positions in an overseas Test in recent years. The team's quick bowlers are expected to play a less significant role in this series as spin comes to the fore but Anderson had Dimuth Karunaratne caught behind from the second ball of the hosts' innings. For a few overs at least, both he and Sam Curran, who shared the new ball, found a hint of swing; the latter trapped Kaushal Silva lbw in the fourth over. Once the swing stopped, Root introduced his spinners, with Jack Leach coming into the attack after the seventh over, and all three impressed. Playing in his second Test, Leach bowled accurately and had Kusal Mendis caught at slip for his first wicket of the match, while Moeen bowled Dhananjaya de Silva in his first over shortly before lunch. Mathews and Chandimal offered some resistance but then Rashid produced a fine leg-spinner that dipped and turned sharply to have Chandimal stumped. After tea Moeen then turned the game decisively in England's favour. He took the three quick wickets of Mathews, Niroshan Dickwella and Akila Dananjaya before Leach and Rashid returned to take the final two wickets. Leach and Moeen did the majority of the work throughout the day, bowling 39 overs combined to Rashid's nine, but all three were impressive. Ben Foakes became the fifth wicketkeeper to make a century on Test debut Foakes had done the majority of the work needed to reach his century on day one by helping his team recover from 103-5 to close on 321-8, and without him England's dominant position would not have been possible. He had been calm throughout his first day in Test cricket and continued in that vein on day two, stroking the first ball of the day for four through extra cover. Leach was dismissed with Foakes on 95, increasing the possibility of Foakes being left stranded before reaching three figures but Anderson survived the remainder of the over, giving Foakes the chance to reach the landmark. The Surrey wicketkeeper-batsman then pulled a boundary behind square on the leg side to move to 99 and hit a fine back-foot drive through mid-on to complete his century from 200 balls. In doing so he became only the second England wicketkeeper to score a hundred on his debut - following Matt Prior in 2007 - and just the fifth wicketkeeper to do so for any team in Tests. He then claimed the joint-fastest dismissal by a keeper on his Test debut when taking a catch off Anderson to dismiss Karunaratne on the second ball of the hosts' innings. Foakes also showed good glovework to stump Chandimal off Rashid and took a smart catch when standing up to the stumps as Moeen claimed the scalp of Akila. For Sri Lanka this was a seriously disappointing day. The hosts had England in trouble at 103-5 on day one but might now need rain to avoid defeat. Their batsmen seemed not to learn from the wickets of the England top order on day one, with a number of them also falling to attacking shots. Dhananjaya departed in a similar fashion to Ben Stokes on day one, trying to sweep fine but getting bowled around his legs, and Chandimal, struggling with an injury, came aggressively down the pitch and was stranded out of his ground. And where England's lower order - Foakes, Curran and Rashid notably - were able to drag the tourists to a respectable total, Sri Lanka's final batsmen fell chipping to close fielders. Former England captain Michael Vaughan on The Cricket Social Outstanding from England. They have played the proper way since lunch on the first day and Sri Lanka need rain or streakers from here. England can go and bat for the whole day tomorrow. Get one or two players to 100 - that can give them confidence for the rest of the tour and beyond. Take out the first session - England's last five sessions have been high class. The pitch will only get worse to bat on. England will have to go some way to allow Sri Lanka to get back into the Test match. England gave Rangana Herath a guard of honour when he walked to the crease to bat in his final Test match England spinner Jack Leach, speaking to BBC Sport:""A great day. It couldn't have gone much more to plan really. The guys had a word and said we did what we set out to do today. ""Foakesy got his hundred which was great and we got as many runs as we could, and then it was a case of trying to build some pressure on them and get some early inroads. We managed to do that, Jimmy and Sammy bowled brilliantly and that took a lot of pressure off us spinners. ""Mo, Rash and myself bowled well. Mo deserved his four wickets. It was great to be involved in that group of spinners, I really enjoyed it. ""I feel like we complement each other nicely. We have a good relationship off the field which helps, we are always trying to bounce ideas off each other. It's a fun group to be part of with Saqqy [England's spin bowling coach Saqlain Mushtaq] as well. It's been good so far."" England centurion Ben Foakes, speaking to Sky Sports:""I was pretty calm this morning and I got a bit nervous when Jimmy Anderson came out with five to go. It was meant to be my day! ""It was amazing to get a hundred - such a relief and a great feeling. My brother got here last night. That's amazing and my mum is getting here in about an hour. ""Getting a few runs settled me down and with Jimmy bowling you know you're in the game, so to get a catch early was great. As the wicket dried out it is spinning more and staying low. It's tricky."" James Anderson responded to Foakes' comments that he was ""nervous"" when Anderson came to the crease by joking on Instagram that it was ""nice when your team-mates have faith in your ability"" Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser 'Bergvall is headline act as young Spurs show incredible maturity' West Ham to appoint Potter after sacking Lopetegui Tottenham's Bentancur taken off on stretcher after injury against Liverpool Paddyâs loaf-changing experience inside the bread factory Paddy McGuinness visits the factory he used to work in to find out how they bake 1.4 million loaves a week Dara Ã  Briain and Isy Suttie discover strange-but-true tales The pair are joined by astronaut Helen Sharman to learn about how humans learned to survive in space A round-up of 2024's top sports stories.

"JK Rowling sues former PA for Â£24,000","Harry Potter author JK Rowling has launched a Â£24,000 legal claim against a former employee for allegedly using her money to go on shopping sprees. Ms Rowling, 53, claims Amanda Donaldson broke strict working rules by using her funds to buy cosmetics and gifts. Ms Donaldson worked as a personal assistant for the writer between February 2014 and April 2017, before being sacked for gross misconduct. The 35-year-old from Coatbridge, Lanarkshire, has denied the claims. Legal papers lodged at Airdrie Sheriff Court allege Ms Donaldson wrongly benefited to a value of Â£23,696.32 by spending on a business credit card and taking Harry Potter merchandise. It is claimed Ms Donaldson had responsibility for funds and was provided with a credit card for buying items in connection with business and personal affairs only. She had to submit statements and receipts once a month to the accountants and also had access to a safe containing foreign money. But discrepancies were picked up in February last year on statements revealing a high volume of personal spending by Ms Donaldson. She had a meeting with an accountant to discuss use of the card and was suspended. Ms Rowling has alleged Ms Donaldson made a series of unauthorised payments, including: Â£823 at Bibi Bakery Â£1,482 at luxury candle company Jo Malone Â£3,629 in cosmetic firm Molton Brown Â£2,139 in card shop Paper Tiger Â£1,636 in Starbucks. Ms Rowling also claims Ms Donaldson, who controlled memorabilia requests from fans, used her position to steal a Harry Potter motorised Hogwarts Express worth Â£467.56, a Harry Potter Wizard Collection worth Â£2231.76 and a Harry Potter Tales of Beedle The Bard Set worth Â£395. Ms Rowling says the toys were taken without her ""knowledge or consent"". It is alleged Ms Donaldson bought two cats worth Â£1,200 and withdrew Â£400 in cash for a deposit for a restaurant lunch but that Ms Rowling's husband Neil Murray discovered no deposit had been paid. The author also claimed her former employee took Â£7,742-worth of foreign money from a safe. Ms Rowling claims her husband, Neil Murray, discovered that a Â£400 deposit for lunch at a restaurant was not paid Ms Donaldson has denied the claims and said Ms Rowling had ""not suffered any loss and is not entitled to damages"" from her. A spokeswoman for Ms Rowling said: ""I can confirm JK Rowling has taken legal action against her former personal assistant, Amanda Donaldson, following her dismissal for gross misconduct involving a substantial breach of trust. ""As the case is not yet concluded we are not able to comment further and there won't be any comment from JK Rowling."" Ms Donaldson was unavailable for comment. The case before Sheriff Derek O'Carroll is due back in court later this year.

US Democrats win House in blow to Trump,"This video can not be played The story of election night in two minutes The Democrats have taken control of the US House of Representatives in the mid-term elections, dealing a blow to President Donald Trump. A Democratic majority in the lower chamber for the first time in eight years will restrict his ability to steer his programme through Congress. But Mr Trump's Republicans are set to strengthen their grip on the Senate. Tuesday's vote was seen as a referendum on a polarising president, even though he is not up for re-election till 2020. The election confirms a historical trend for the party that is not in the White House to make gains in the mid-terms. This video can not be played Nancy Pelosi: taking the House will help restore ""checks and balances"" House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi - who is set to become speaker, a position she held from 2007 to 2011 - told cheering supporters in Washington: ""Thanks to you, tomorrow will be a new day in America.""

The Democrats took control of the House, having gained more than the 23 seats they need to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Americans voted for all 435 seats in the House. The Democrats could now launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest. They could also more effectively block his legislative plans, notably his signature promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico. But analysts say dealing with a hostile House may suit the president, who is known both for his partisan style and ability to switch positions. They say he could either choose to accuse the Democrats of obstruction or try to reach deals to get legislation through. New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (C) is the youngest woman ever elected to the US House at 29 years old Female candidates performed particularly well. Two 29-year-old Democrats - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Abby Finkenauer - are due to be the youngest women ever to win House seats. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are the first Muslim women and Sharice Davids and Debra Haaland the first Native American women to be elected to Congress. All are Democrats. How the mid-term elections broke records Republicans are on course to increase their representation in the 100-seat Senate from 51 to 54. This ensures Mr Trump will still have a majority to confirm his executive and judicial appointments. Democrats were always facing an uphill battle in the Senate this year because they were defending 26 races, while just nine Republican seats were up for grabs. Key gains for the Republicans came in Indiana, Missouri, Florida and North Dakota, where they unseated Democrat incumbents. But a Republican incumbent lost to a Democrat in Nevada. In Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz fended off a strong challenge by Democratic rising star Beto O'Rourke. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington With control of the House, the Democrats will be able to block Donald Trump's legislative agenda and will have much more oversight. They will have key committees that will be able to look into allegations of collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's presidential campaign.  They might delve in Mr Trump's personal finance. In addition, there have been allegations of corruption made against senior administration officials. The Democrats will be able to dig deep into that. The Republican maintaining control of the Senate is very important because if they stick together, they can confirm any of Mr Trump's appointments to his administration or to the judiciary. The president has already appointed 84 conservative judges to the federal judiciary. Expect that trend to continue. What this all means for Trump Young votes stamp their mark on politics Florida restores voting rights to convicts Why US mid-term elections matter Governors - who head the executive branch in state governments - have been chosen in 36 out of 50 states. In Florida, a progressive Democrat conceded after an ugly battle against Trumpist conservative Ron DeSantis. But in Georgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams - who ran to become the first black female governor in the US - refused to give in as her Republican opponent Brian Kemp took a commanding lead after a bitter campaign. Democrat Jared Polis is projected to win in Colorado, becoming the first openly gay man to be a governor. Democrats also captured governorships in Michigan, Illinois and Kansas.

Trump hails 'Big Victory' despite losses,"This video can not be played Trump hopes for ""beautiful bi-partisan situation"" US President Donald Trump has hailed ""tremendous success"" in the mid-term elections after a night of mixed results for his Republican party. The Democrats won the House of Representatives, which will enable them to thwart the president's agenda. But the Republicans consolidated their grip on the Senate, ensuring he can still make key appointments. Mr Trump said the outcome ""defied history"" as the ruling party does not usually gain seats in the mid-terms. Results in maps and charts Five key things we learned Live reaction At a feisty news conference on Wednesday, Mr Trump offered an olive branch to Democrats, proposing both parties work together on joint legislative priorities. But he said that if Democratic-controlled congressional committees started serving legal writs against his administration, Republicans would do likewise and gridlock would ensue. This video can not be played Donald Trump listed some of the losing Republicans candidates who didn't embrace him and his message In ill-tempered exchanges, Mr Trump called a CNN correspondent ""a rude, terrible person"" and told an NBC reporter: ""I'm not a big fan of yours either."" He told a black reporter who asked whether his self-professed nationalism would embolden white nationalists that it was ""such a racist question"". The president also mocked Republicans who did not ""embrace"" him on the campaign trail, and went on to lose their election races. ""They did very poorly,"" Mr Trump told reporters. ""I'm not sure that I should be happy or sad but I feel just fine about it."" This video can not be played The story of election night in two minutes House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi has promised her party will serve as a counterweight to the White House. Ms Pelosi - who is favourite to become speaker, a position she held from 2007-11 - told supporters: ""Today is more than about Democrats and Republicans. It's about restoring the Constitution's checks and balances to the Trump administration."" Meanwhile the Florida Senate race is heading for a recount after Republican Rick Scott got 50.21% and incumbent Bill Nelson 49.79% of the vote. A margin of less than half a percentage point automatically triggers a recount. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed for a majority in the 435-seat lower chamber.

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington Even handing over power to Democrats in the House may have a bit of a silver lining for the president. Now he will have someone to blame if the economy takes a turn for the worse (and, given business cycle realities, it might). He's got a ready-made explanation for why he can't get anything done in the next two years - and a pitch for what needs to change in the next election. Day in and day out, he'll have a set of clear political opponents to contrast himself with. This video can not be played The BBC's Anthony Zurcher explains what losing the House means for Donald Trump's presidency. Both Bill Clinton and Barack Obama lost control of the House in their first term in office and went on to win re-election. History, serving as a guide, predicted this would probably be a bad night for the president. History also indicates that while the road may be rocky, better days could be ahead.

Kidnapped schoolchildren freed in Cameroon,"The freed students being helped into a truck by paramilitary force in Bamenda Schoolchildren kidnapped from a boarding school in Cameroon's North-West region have met the regional governor after being freed. The 78 boys and girls and three others were seized early on Sunday in the region's capital, Bamenda. A driver was also released, but the school's principal and a teacher are still being held. The government has accused separatists in the English-speaking region of being behind the kidnapping. The Anglophone separatists have denied they were involved. The secessionist movement took up arms last year to demand independence for the North-West and South-West regions - the two English-speaking regions in a country where French is the most widely spoken official language. Africa Live: Updates as the children are freed Cameroon's English-speaking rebels The kidnapped students, aged between 11-17 years old, were ""frightened and traumatised but in good shape"", Rev Fonki Samuel, Presbyterian Church Moderator in Cameroon, told the BBC Focus on Africa programme. He said that they were being given food and being checked by the doctors before being reunited with their parents. One of the hostages, 17-year-old, Alain, said the kidnappers forced them to run after seizing them. He told Reuters news agency that they were not mistreated and the captors gave them food. ""They gave us kontchap [a mix of corn and beans] to eat... It was not enough but they still gave us some. They also gave us water,"" he said. Rev Samuel said the Bamenda's Presbyterian Secondary School - where the students were seized - had been closed. According to the Presbyterian Church of Cameroon, the students were abandoned in one of their buildings in the town of Bafut, about 24km (15 miles) from Bamenda. ""The release was done peacefully... by unidentified gunmen. They [students] were brought into the church premises,"" Rev Samuel said. ""The first information we got from them [kidnappers] is their call and they were telling us they intended to release the children yesterday [Tuesday] morning... but unfortunately it rained so heavily that could not happen. ""So [on] the evening of yesterday, surprisingly and by God's grace, the children were brought back to us."" The North-West and South-West are Cameroon's two English-speaking regions Rev Samuel told the BBC that 78 students, not 79 as earlier reported, had been released. He also revealed that Sunday's kidnapping was the second such case at the school in less than a week. In the earlier 31 October incident, 11 boys were taken and then released. It is unclear who the kidnappers were but the church paid a ransom of $4,000 (Â£3,000) to secure their release, he said. The army had been deployed to try and find the children taken on Sunday. Rev Samuel told the BBC he was not concerned about who was behind the kidnapping, only ""overwhelmed and happy"" that the schoolchildren had been freed. He said, ""armed groups, gangsters and thieves"" could be taking advantage of the insecurity in the region to kidnap people, and blame it on the government and separatists. Cameroon's authorities have blamed the kidnap on Anglophone separatist militias - who have called for schools in English-speaking regions to be closed. They want to create an independent state called Ambazonia. There have been a spate of kidnappings in the Anglophone regions at other schools but Sunday's incident involved the largest number abducted at one time, the AP reports. It said that the separatists had set fire to at least 100 schools and taken them over as training grounds. On Tuesday, anxious parents gathered at the Presbyterian Secondary School to try to get information about their children. Parents gathered at the Presbyterian Secondary School in Bamenda after getting news their children had been kidnapped A video of the hostages released on Monday showed one of the captives saying they had been seized by ""Amba Boys"" - the widely-used term to describe the separatist rebels. An Anglophone group, the Ambazonia International Policy Commission (AIPC), has however denied that the separatists were behind the kidnapping, noting that the person recording the video appears to have a poor grasp of Pidgin-English, the language spoken widely in the Anglophone area of the country. One of the kidnappers was also apparently heard speaking French. English-speakers in Cameroon have long complained that they face discrimination from Cameroon's Francophone majority. They say that they are excluded from top civil service jobs and that government documents are often only published in French, even though English is also an official language.

John Lewis chairman Mayfield to step downJohn Lewis Partnership says Sir Charlie Mayfield will depart in 2020 after 13 years in the role.Business,"The John Lewis Partnership is searching for a new chairman after Sir Charlie Mayfield said he would step down in 2020. The departure comes at a challenging time for the partnership, which posted a99% fall in half-year profits in September. A replacement for Sir Charlie is not expected to be announced in the second half of 2019. He said he was giving notice now to allow time for a successor to be found. Sir Charlie said: ""Although my departure is still a considerable way off, the appointment of my successor is a key responsibility. ""It is for this reason I have decided to lay out the timetable now to enable an open and thorough process to select the next chairman of the partnership."" Both internal and external candidates for the job will be considered. A furniture and room design area in the John Lewis Oxford Street store Sir Charlie became chairman of the John Lewis Partnership, which owns Waitrose supermarkets as well as the department store chain, in 2007. He has been at the helm over many years of growth, but more recently it has struggled to cope with rising costs, higher business rates and a weaker pound. Its most recent financial results showed profits for the six months to 28 July fell to just Â£1.2m, down from Â£95m for the same period last year. At the time Sir Charlie blamed stiff competition, saying it was facing down the most promotional market for nearly a decade. The department store pledges to be ""never knowingly undersold"" - cutting prices to match those of competitors, which have also been discounting. ""This year there has been twice as many extravaganza days as there were a year ago and actually the discounts have been even deeper,"" he told the BBC in September. ""We're never knowingly undersold at John Lewis, so of course we are matching that, and that affects margins."" It was an ""extremely valuable"" promise, Sir Charlie added.

Murder victim's family flee London 'danger',"Beniamin Pieknyi died from blood loss after being stabbed in the chest The family of a Romanian man stabbed to death weeks after moving to England have said they see London as a dangerous place where ""terrible things can happen in the blink of an eye"". Beniamin Pieknyi, 21, was walking through a shopping centre when he was chased and stabbed in March. His brother and sister lived with him but have since returned to Romania. On Monday,Mayor Sadiq Khan warned it could take a generation to turn the tide of violent crime in the capital. Vladyslav Yakymchuk, 23, who pleaded guilty to the murder was sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum term of 24 years on Wednesday. It comes at a time whenfive people have been stabbed to death in London in less than a week. Beniamin Pieknyi (right) had been living in Milton Keynes with his brother Mihael and sister Iulia Beniamin Pieknyi had simply beenin the wrong place at the wrong time. Born and raised in Lupeni, Romania, he moved to Milton Keynes at the start of this year to live with his brother Mihael and sister Iulia as he wanted to settle and work in Britain. Yet the family have now returned to Romania amid fear and distress over what happened to him. ""I've come to realise that terrible things can happen in the blink of an eye, and if you say the wrong thing to the wrong person you could end up dead,"" Iulia Pieknyi said. The 21-year-old worked at a takeaway with his brother. On 20 March, he worked a half day so he could travel to Stratford, in the east London borough of Newham, to meet up with his friend Alexander Suciu. His brother Mihael Pieknyi worked until midnight that day. After his shift he and a friend bought a box of beer to share with his brother when he got back from London. However, he never heard from him. ""I thought this was odd. I waited all night and heard nothing until I got a call from his friend's sister,"" Mr Pieknyi said. ""She was crying and told me Beniamin 'was no more'."" Nine charts on rising knife crime Is England experiencing a crime wave? Violent crime 'a public health issue' Vladyslav Yakymchuk was arrested in Harrods and pleaded guilty to murder His brother had become thelatest victim in a series of separate violent deaths across London in early 2018. CCTV from the Stratford Centre before the attack showed Yakymchuk - along with Alexis Varela, 19, Moses Kasule, 20, Kevin Duarte, 19, and 18-year-old Mario Zvavamwe - hassling other members of the public. The Met Police said the group had a history of hanging around the shopping centre, which is less than a mile from several of the main venues of the London 2012 Olympics, and were known to cause trouble and ""harass innocent people"". On the day Beniamin Pieknyi was killed, the group could be heard shouting and goading ""this is our area"". An argument ensued after Duarte hit Alexander Suciu on the head. The row escalated into a fight, with Kasule kicking Mr Pieknyi to the ground. Yakymchuk took Mr Suciu's glasses, while Kasule threw punches at him. The brawl was broken up by a security guard who attempted to escort the pair away. Yards away from the shopping centre's exit, Mr Pieknyi was cornered and stabbed by Yakymchuk in the chest. Vladyslav Yakymchuk, 23, of no fixed address, sentenced to life imprisonment with a minimum 24-year term after pleading guilty to murder, violent disorder and possession of a bladed article Kevin Duarte, 19, of no fixed address, convicted of manslaughter and violent assault sentenced to 12 years Moses Kasule, 20, of Stratford, convicted of manslaughter and violent assault sentenced to 12 years Mario Zvavamwe, 18, of Romford, acquitted of manslaughter, but found guilty of violent disorder sentenced to 30 months Alexis Varela, 19, of Dagenham, acquitted of manslaughter, but found guilty of violent disorder sentenced to 40 months, to run concurrent with a 12-month sentence for a separate violent disorder conviction Beniamin Pieknyi died at the scene of the attack at the Stratford Centre on 20 March The 21-year-old's body was flown back to Romania, where his funeral was held on 27 May. ""It took a while to accept the truth and when I did, my entire life crumbled around me,"" Iulia Pieknyi said. ""I had no drive anymore - my work, my house were not important anymore."" Can Chicago cure London's violence? Gang crime down while violent offences increase London 'still unsafe' In a victim impact statement, Mr Pieknyi's aunt Cristina Pieknyi described her nephew as a ""very quiet boy, hardworking and someone who liked to help people"". She has been representing the family at the Old Bailey because the rest of the family could not afford to attend. ""They have spent all of their savings on the repatriation and funeral costs,"" she said. Mihael Pieknyi and his family are still coming to terms with his brother's murder. ""We are in shock. My mother doesn't sleep and my sister, Iulia, does not want to come back and live in this country,"" Mr Pieknyi said.

'Eye-roll' Farage student gets marriage offers,"This video can not be played Harriet Ellis shows off her best Farage eye-roll A university student says she's received marriage offers after rolling her eyes at Nigel Farage on TV. A clip of Harriet Ellis looking less than impressed while sitting behind the former UKIP leader during a Channel 4 Brexit debate went viral on Monday. The 21-year-old says she's since been swamped with messages of support - with people calling her a ""hero"". ""I've had marriage proposals too, which my boyfriend definitely isn't too happy about,"" Harriet tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A clip she posted on Twitter showing her expression has had more than 60,000 likes and 7,000 retweets. The University of Birmingham student says the reaction to her eye-roll has been ""mad"". ""Most people have been really nice and they're saying really nice things about how I'm speaking for people across the country. ""There's even been people calling me a hero, which I'm not.

But it was too late and the debate was about to start."" As the Classics student left the event, a member of the audience rushed over and told her to turn on her phone at once. ""This guy came up to me and said 'Have you checked your phone?' I replied 'No' and he said 'Your phone is about to blow up'. ""He showed me the video and it had 3,000 views at that point. I thought 'OK cool' and then it just kept blowing up until even JK Rowling liked it. ""That was really strange."" Harriet says other things that prompt an eye-roll include pineapple on pizzas Harriet voted for Brexit in 2016 but says it was Mr Farage's talk of an apparent ""Remainer's Brexit"" that prompted her eye-roll reaction. ""I think anything Nigel Farage says would make me eye-roll,"" she explains. ""But it was just the fact that he said 'We've got a Remainer's Brexit' when we absolutely haven't. ""We've got a Brexit fuelled by the wishes of the Leave campaign and Theresa May is not giving us a Remainer's Brexit at all."" Allow Twitter content?

How will the Tube strike affect you?,"Major interchange stations such as London Bridge were busy during the strike London Underground passengers are facing fresh disruption as drivers on the Central Line stage a 24-hour strike. Talks have failed to prevent the walkout and unions have warned of further strikes and a ""network-wide shutdown"" in the run-up to Christmas. The strike action caused other lines to be busier than usual, such as on the Jubilee Line at Stratford station Workers on the Central Line and the Waterloo & City Line began their industrial action at 00:01 on Wednesday. Transport for London (TfL) said both lines would have very limited or no service throughout the day, with normal services resuming on Thursday. Live updates on Tube strike and other London news from London A planned 24-hour strike on the Piccadilly Line, which was due to start at 12:00, was called off on Tuesday afternoon. The Rail, Maritime and Transport (RMT) union said it was suspending the action after talks. RMT says London Underground has a culture of ""bullying staff"" Members of the RMT union and drivers' union Aslef are walking out in disputes over industrial relations, including staffing and working conditions. The RMT said the strikes were over ""a comprehensive breakdown in industrial relations, a failure to employ enough drivers, a wholesale abuse of agreed procedures and the victimisation of a trade union member"". Its general secretary Mick Cash said the union was ""frustrated"" with Tube bosses' handling of a ""full raft of issues"". He criticised London Underground for a culture that ""revolves around refusing to employ enough drivers, bullying staff and expecting our members to pick up the pieces when the service breaks down"". Finn Brennan, Aslef's organiser on London Underground, said the union was calling for ""a rapid change of approach from management, working inside existing agreements instead of trying to circumvent or reinterpret them"". He added: ""The issues underlying this dispute - fair treatment at work and complying with agreements - aren't just confined to a couple of areas."" TfL said agreements had been made ""on all but a few points following extensive discussions"". But it claimed both unions were demanding the reinstatement of two drivers sacked over serious safety breaches - one who deliberately opened the doors of a train in a tunnel and another who failed a drugs test before a shift. TfL rail services from Ilford station were in high demand during the Central Line strike Passengers queued to get into Ilford station in east London The strikes are likely to cause travel chaos during the morning and evening rush hours. TfL warned passengers of widespread disruption and said: Services on other Tube lines are running as normal but interchange stations along the affected lines ""will be much busier than usual"" Stations such as Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus may need to be temporarily closed to prevent overcrowding Extra buses will be put on but said roads ""will be busier than usual"" In addition to the travel disruption caused by strike action, there weresevere delays,externalbetween London Paddington and Heathrow Airport because of urgent repair works. Meanwhile, South Western Railway services to and from London Waterloowere delayed by a points failure,external. An empty Piccadilly line train stopped at Stamford Brook station during a previous strike Nick Dent, director of line operations for London Underground, said the strike action by RMT and Aslef was ""totally unjustified"". ""Our commitment to the safety of our customers and staff is absolute and something we will never compromise on,"" he added.

Firm made staff drink urine and eat bugsManagers at the Chinese firm have been given jail time for punishing staff with extreme measures.China,"If you miss your sales target, bon appÃ©tit Managers at a Chinese firm have been jailed for making staff who failed to reach sales targets drink urine and eat cockroaches, local media report. Police took action after videos emerged showing workers being whipped with a belt and drinking a yellow liquid. Social media posts alleged staff were also told to eat cockroaches if they did not meet targets. Three managers were jailed for five and 10 days over the incident, the South China Morning Post reports. A widely-shared video posted on Chinese social media site Weibo shows a male employee standing in the middle of a circle, getting whipped with a belt. The video quickly went viral on Weibo Other staff, said to be employees of the home renovation company in the city of Guizhou, can be seen drinking yellow liquid from plastic cups while holding their noses. Screenshots of what were said to be messages from the managers threaten staff that they will have to eat cockroaches for poor performances. According to media reports, other forms of shaming and punishment at the firm have included drinking toilet water or vinegar and getting their head shaved. Social media post said the yellow liquid was urine The company had reportedly failed to pay their employees' salary for the past two months and staff was scared to speak up fearing they would lose the pay if they'd quit. Police in Zunyi county police arrested three managers and they were later sentenced to jail time. It's the latest in a string of cases of Chinese firms employing unusual measures to punish, shame or encourage their staff. Previous reports have alleged cases of employees slapping each other at a company event to boost motivation, and staff forced to crawl on a public road or kiss rubbish bins as a punishment or for team building.

Girl Scouts sue Boy Scouts for name switchThe Boy Scouts programme will be renamed Scouts BSA after they agreed to welcome in all children.US & Canada,"The Boy Scouts leader said they changed the programme's name to make the group more inclusive The Girl Scouts of the United States of America have filed a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America for dropping ""boy"" from the scout group's name. The Boy Scouts of America announced in Maythey would rename the Boy Scouts programme Scouts BSAas they prepare to allow girls as members. But the Girl Scouts say the change could erode their brand, calling the move ""uniquely damaging"" to them. Their lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction against trademark breaches. ""Only GSUSA has the right to use the Girl Scouts and Scouts trademarks with leadership development services for girls,"" papers filed in a Manhattan federal court said. The switch could ""marginalise"" the Girl Scouts, the complaint reads. It reportedly says the switch has already caused confusion, with some believing their organisation had merged with the Boy Scouts. In response, the Boy Scouts of America issued a statement saying it was reviewing the suit, and that it believed ""there is an opportunity for both organizations to serve girls and boys in our communities"". This video can not be played What makes this Girl Scout group special? In October 2017,the Boy Scouts board of directors voted unanimously to open the programme to all children. The Cub Scouts, for ages seven to 10, opened its local clubs to all children in 2018. Boy Scouts, for ages 11 to 17, will follow its footsteps next year when the programme name change becomes official. Butthe Girl Scouts protested the decision at the time, with the group's president Kathy Hopinkah Hannan accusing them of a ""covert campaign"" to recruit girls to tackle a ""well-documented"" declining membership. The Boy Scouts reportedly have close to 2.3m members in the US, down about a third since 2000, compared with around 2 million members for the Girl Scouts.

Flexible office space 'set to soar',"Flexible working spaces are set to grow by up to 30% annually for the next five years across Europe, according to property firm Jones Lang Lasalle (JLL). And it says that will change the way thousands of businesses of all sizes organise their work force. JLL described it as one of the biggest shifts in the property industry. Firms like WeWork and IWG offer office space and services, allowing clients to shrink or grow their number of desks, or the period they need them for. Founded in the US in 2010, WeWork is already London and New York's largest private office occupier. So far this year, flexible workspace operators have taken up one sixth of all new commercial property in the UK capital and last year their footprint outside the capital tripled with Manchester and Birmingham seeing the fastest growth. Initially popular with small start-up companies, these facilities are increasingly being used by large multi-national organisations who need to expand or reduce their workforce in line with the volume of work they have. Dan Brown of JLL says: ""The consumerisation of real estate is reshaping business models."" The rapid growth in this ""office on demand"" business has seen the value of WeWork balloon to $20bn and is not without risk. One technology investor warned that it was beginning to look like ""a bubble"". Some property investors have pointed out that when any company buys up a huge amount of the stock of office space in the hope of selling it on in bits and pieces, there is a risk you can be left with a lot of empty offices if the economy takes a turn for the worse. WeWork has borrowed heavily to finance its expansion and the ratings agencies have given it a ""junk"" or risky credit score. However, the flexibility of this new model is proving popular with small employers and workers who enjoy the modern collaborative feel of a shared office, as well as larger employers who are not forced to sign long leases on expensive, bespoke, trophy buildings. Perks such as free beer for tenants of WeWork offices in New York proved so popular that the company was forced to impose a four pint limit per person after reports of inappropriate behaviour. Four pints is still enough to create a feel good mood about one of the biggest disruptions for decades in the way we think about heading to ""the office"".

Heathrow disruption after runway lights fault,"Delays hit passengers at Heathrow following a ""technical issue"" with runway lighting Passengers at Heathrow Airport faced delays and cancellations following a ""technical issue"" affecting the runway lights. There were delays to one in seven flights due to land at Heathrow between 6:00 GMT and 8:59, according to aviation data firm FlightStats. One flight from the United States was delayed for more than three hours. Heathrow said the problem was fixed but advised travellers to check with their airline before coming to the airport. British Airways initially warned it was diverting some flights. It now says contingency plans have been activated and it expects to operate a full schedule but with some delays. Earlier, passengers due to fly into Heathrow reported they had not been allowed to take off. The longest delay was to a United Airlines flight from Newark in New Jersey which was more than three hours behind schedule. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

'Old' weather satellite lifts off,"Artwork: The Metop satellites circle the globe probing the state of the atmosphere Europe has launched a front-line weather satellite into orbit that has components that are over a decade old. The Metop-C spacecraft took off from French Guiana late on Tuesday local time, and will circle the globe, gathering data that will feed into daily forecasts. The satellite was procured at the same time as its two predecessors, but was then stored for later use. A British instrument onboard was manufactured 17 years ago. The Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) will detect water in the atmosphere - everything from fog to the heavy rain inside a hurricane. Europe's meteorological agencies say they have no qualms about Metop-C's capabilities. The spacecraft have had a big impact on the accuracy of forecasts The spacecraft was routinely pulled out of hibernation and had its systems checked to see they are still functional. The polar-orbiting Earth observer is fully expected to carry through its duties until the next-generation of technologies take over early next decade, states Dr Dieter Klaes fromEumetsat,external, the intergovernmental organisation that operates European weather satellites. ""Metop-C was regularly tested. Whenever these satellites have been in storage, there is a health review,"" he told BBC News. ""The instruments are switched on and tested and we see whether there has been a degradation.The European Space Agency (Esa),externaland industry did a tremendous job to put all the spacecraft parts - in terms of payload module, service module and instruments - into a shape where they're ready for launch.""

All three platforms in the Metop series were purchased from European industry at the turn of the millennium. It is the most efficient and cheapest way to acquire these multi-billion-euro systems. Metop-A was the first to launch, in 2006; Metop-B followed in 2012. Both satellites were expected to work for at least five years, and their continued operation today is a boon to weather forecasters. They will now get additional data to ingest in numerical models with the launch of Metop-C. Metop-C being prepared for launch at the European spaceport in French Guiana The satellites are different from their geostationary spacecraft ""cousins"" which image developing weather activity from a vantage point some 36,000km above the equator. The polar orbiting satellites fly much lower, only 800km above the ground. Their job is to probe atmospheric conditions, detailing parameters such as humidity and temperature at different heights. The introduction of the Metops has had an astounding impact on forecast quality. Assessments indicate the data from the first two platforms reduced errors in the 24-hour lookahead by 27%. And there have been big gains also in medium-range forecasts - those that go out to several days hence. Eumetsat operates Europe's weather spacecraft from its headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany. But the satellites' design and procurement is overseen by Esa. It is currently working on Metop-SG (Second Generation). These spacecraft will have much more advanced instrumentation, and in a change to the current observing strategy - those instruments will be deployed across pairs of platforms. The Microwave Humidity Sounders were batch-bought The British MHS will be succeeded by the MicroWave Sounder (MWS). It will have significantly improved performance. The first Metop-SG pairing is set to roll out at the end of 2022. These are interesting times in satellite meteorology because we are starting to see very small spacecraft being launched to monitor the state of the atmosphere.

Persimmon boss to leave over Â£75m pay row,"This video can not be played Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his pay The boss of Persimmon Jeff Fairburn has been forced out after a row over his Â£75m pay award. Persimmon said he left by ""mutual agreement and at the request of the company"". It said the issue was having a ""negative impact"" on the firm's reputation and on ""Jeff's ability to continue in his role"". Last month Mr Fairburn walked away from a BBC interview when asked about his pay. ""I'd rather not talk about that,"" he told a BBC reporter when asked in October about the pay award. Mr Fairburn had seen his pay package reduced from Â£100m after a public outcry. He will now keep Â£75m worth of shares when he leaves at the end of next month. The company said it could not claw back any of the share awards, known as a long-term incentive award (LTIP). It added that he would receive no further pay after he left on 31 December. He will be given up to Â£10,000 to cover any legal fees, the company said. Roger Devlin, Persimmon's chairman, said there was ongoing ""distraction"" over the Â£75m pay award and a change of leadership was needed. However, he also pointed out that the company's stock market value had doubled since Mr Fairburn took over in 2013. Mr Devlin, who was appointed chairman in June, also said that under his tenure the company had also handed more than Â£2.2bn to shareholders. Speaking on a call with analysts, Mr Devlin noted that the financial performance could not trump other factors. Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell, said the ""disastrous [BBC] TV interview... may well have been the final straw"". Your boss offers you a pay deal that will only see you do well if the company does well. All the directors agree, and the shareholders are nearly unanimous in their support. The company does well - much better than expected - and your promised bonanza duly arrives. Hooray! Or rather, oh no, if your name is Jeff Fairburn. There was no issue with the way he ran the company, it was just reputational damage caused by the Â£75m pay award. The public concern was stoked by the feeling that some of Persimmon's success was thanks to public subsidy - the Help to Buy programme has helped fuel the housing market, with Persimmon one of the beneficiaries. There is also a wider concern - which is beginning to surface among economic commentators - that the big housebuilders are simply doing too well, with their enormous returns to shareholders over recent years the result not of good management but of the exploitation of what has become an oligopoly. Mr Fairburn had previously said he would give a ""substantial proportion"" of the bonus to charity in an attempt to defuse the row. However, he acknowledged that had not worked, partly because he never disclosed how much would be handed over. ""It is clearly now in the best interests of Persimmon that I should step down,"" he said. The bonus was based on awards of shares, the value of which rose sharply when low interest rates and a government house buying scheme helped raise Persimmon's performance. When the LTIP was set up in 2012 the shares were trading at Â£4 but by the time bonuses were handed out last year the shares were trading at Â£24. As there was no cap on the award of shares, it meant there was no limit to the payout. Chairman Roger Devlin replaced Nicholas Wrigley, whose resignation was announced in December. Jonathan Davie, the non-executive director who was head of the remuneration committee, left at the same time. The company said they had resigned because they realised the bonus scheme should have had a cap. The company took further steps to attempt to defuse the row before April's annual general meeting by announcing that Mr Fairburn's bonus payout would be cut by Â£25m by reducing the number of shares he was entitled to. At that meeting AGM 48.5% of investors' votes were cast against the remuneration report. Euan Stirling of Aberdeen Standard Investments said Persimmon's reputation had been ""tarnished"". Ashley Hamilton Claxton, from Royal London Asset Management, said the company's move was ""understandable"", but was sorry to see ""changes to what we believe have been one of the best management teams in the industry"". David Jenkinson, currently managing director, will be appointed as interim chief executive from 31 December. He had also been caught up in the pay row, as along with Mr Fairburn, and chief financial officer Mike Killoran he stood to share in a Â£200m payout. Mr Jenkinson's share awards were cut by Â£2.5m to Â£40m ahead of the AGM. The company said Mr Jenkinson's pay would not change while he was interim chief executive.

Supermarket bakeries 'unclear on allergies',"In-store supermarket bakeries are not required to label items made in-store, but they do need to provide information about potential allergens on request Three supermarket chains have given confusing or incorrect information on potentially lethal food allergens in their bakeries, the BBC has found. Branches of Asda, Sainsbury's and Tesco gave wrong or unclear details to Watchdog Live's undercover reporters. It comes after a 15-year-old girl died after eating a baguette from Pret A Manger, which did not specify the presence of sesame in the sandwich. The retailers said they would review their labelling and staff training. Undercover reporters for the BBC's consumer programme visited 24 supermarket bakeries, five of which showed cause for concern. The EU says that consumers must be made aware when one or more of 14 particular allergens - including nuts, sesame, milk, eggs and wheat - is used as an ingredient in food products. However, in the UK freshly handmade non pre-packaged food does not need to be individually labelled on packaging, but stores must ensure clear and accurate information is readily available. But that is not always the case, the programme found. In one Asda bakery, staff said an item did not contain the allergen sesame, when it was in fact listed as an ingredient for the product on the store's website. In other Asda stores, the programme found staff were able to give a general warning that products may contain nuts or seeds, without being able to identify specific allergens contained within the recipe. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse suffered a cardiac arrest after eating a baguette from Pret A Manger in 2016 In September a coroner ruled that sandwich chain Pret A Manger's labelling was inadequate, after a girl suffered a cardiac arrest after eating one of its baguettes. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse visited the Heathrow Airport branch in 2016 before getting a flight with her family. Despite having two EpiPen injections while on the flight, the teenager died in a hospital in Nice. Natasha's family said food labelling laws ""played Russian roulette with our daughter's life"". Since then the sandwich chain has said it will list all ingredients, including allergens on its freshly made products. Read more Reporters for the programme found Tesco did list allergens on most of its products, but not for unwrapped bread rolls, paninis and pastries in some stores. At one branch, an undercover reporter posing as someone with a milk allergy found a senior member of staff who was unable to locate any ingredients information for an unpackaged panini that contained milk. Sainsbury's did not list any of the 14 allergens on packaging or shelf labels in their in-store bakeries, but did tell customers to ""ask a bakery colleague"" about allergens. A staff member at one branch told an undercover reporter a raisin whirl was free of nuts - but when the staff member found a product information guide it listed almonds as an ingredient. Sainsbury's said it would update its labels ""to include more specific allergen information"". Tesco said it exceeded ""the current legal requirements"", but in light of the Watchdog investigation a spokesperson said the food retailer would be ""reviewing how allergy information is displayed moving forward"". Asda said in all the instances flagged up by Watchdog Live, its staff ""ultimately advised the customer not to buy the product"". But a spokesman added the supermarket was ""also working to implement detailed allergen labels on our in-store bakery products"". Watchdog Live's report can be seen on 7 November at 20:00 on BBC One Pret to label products after allergy death Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Marks and Spencer sales continue to fall,"This video can not be played M&S boss Steve Rowe says he is 'protecting the magic' Marks & Spencer has reported falling clothing and food sales and warned that it sees little improvement in sales this year. Like-for-like sales, which strip out the impact of new stores, were down 2.2% for the six months to the end of September. Food sales were down 2.9% and clothing and home sales slid 1.1%. M&S warned trading conditions for the remainder of the financial year will remain ""challenging"". ""We are expecting little improvement in sales trajectory,"" the firm said. M&S chief executive Steve Rowe told the BBC that food was ""trading behind our expectations"", but the retailer was ""reshaping"" its business with prices lowered on hundreds of food items. ""What we are doing is making sure we protect the magic of M&S,"" he said. Revenue fell 3.1% to Â£4.96bn, but underlying pre-tax profits ticked up 2% to Â£223.5m. Shares ended the day 0.5% lower at 300.9p, valuing the company at Â£5bn. How would influencers save M&S? By Dominic O'Connell, Today programme business presenter Marks & Spencer has an organisation that is ""silo-ed, slow and hierarchical"". Not the words of a hedge fund looking to short the shares of one of the nation's favourite retailers, but the verdict of the company's own chief executive, Steve Rowe. The damning judgement is delivered in the company's half-year results. They show the same pattern of trade of recent years - clothing in a slow slide, food a bit worse than expected, with like-for-like sales down nearly 3% - but are remarkable for their clear-eyed view of what needs to be done to break that pattern. Fewer stores - 100 will close - a better online offering, and in general a tightening-up of management and structures that should save Â£350m a year. Some critics will say that Mr Rowe is not going far enough, or fast enough, with some advocating a break-up of the company or other radical surgery. There is a clue, though, in the half-year figures as to why stronger medicine has not been adopted. The average leasehold commitment that M&S has on its stores is 20 years. Going faster in closing stores or shrinking them would be extremely expensive. Retail analyst Steve Dresser, director of Grocery Insight,tweeted,external: ""You can't run a business on meal deals and 25% off wines forever but these things take time to back out of. ""Closures of established stores will also impact food as it's not always the case they didn't perform - onerous leases also impacted."" M&S plans to close 100 shops by 2022, as announced in May - a move it says is ""vital"" for its future. Mr Rowe said the retailer was ""continuing to review"" its store closure programme and did not rule out further closures, especially as a third of its business would be online in future. He said 32 million people visited M&S stores every year, so the retailer had ""a broad range of customers"". ""What we have to do is have a broad range of merchandise available that suits all their tastes,"" he added. Chancellor plans High Street rates relief Primark blames weather for sliding sales Under its plan, M&S intends to have fewer, larger clothing and homeware stores in better locations. The retailer points out that its clothing and homeware business has ""an ageing customer base, a very wide range, a weak supply chain and and ageing store portfolio"". It is facing heightened competition from online retailers, as well as discounters such as Aldi, Lidl and Primark. Its directors were not awarded bonuses this year because of the disappointing results. How would Instagram stars save M&S? Can M&S get back in fashion?

'Old' weather satellite takes offEurope sends up a front-line weather satellite containing components made over a decade ago.Science & Environment,"Artwork: The Metop satellites circle the globe probing the state of the atmosphere Europe has launched a front-line weather satellite into orbit that has components that are over a decade old. The Metop-C spacecraft took off from French Guiana late on Tuesday local time, and will circle the globe, gathering data that will feed into daily forecasts. The satellite was procured at the same time as its two predecessors, but was then stored for later use. A British instrument onboard was manufactured 17 years ago. The Microwave Humidity Sounder (MHS) will detect water in the atmosphere - everything from fog to the heavy rain inside a hurricane. Europe's meteorological agencies say they have no qualms about Metop-C's capabilities. The spacecraft have had a big impact on the accuracy of forecasts The spacecraft was routinely pulled out of hibernation and had its systems checked to see they are still functional. The polar-orbiting Earth observer is fully expected to carry through its duties until the next-generation of technologies take over early next decade, states Dr Dieter Klaes fromEumetsat,external, the intergovernmental organisation that operates European weather satellites. ""Metop-C was regularly tested. Whenever these satellites have been in storage, there is a health review,"" he told BBC News. ""The instruments are switched on and tested and we see whether there has been a degradation.The European Space Agency (Esa),externaland industry did a tremendous job to put all the spacecraft parts - in terms of payload module, service module and instruments - into a shape where they're ready for launch.""

All three platforms in the Metop series were purchased from European industry at the turn of the millennium. It is the most efficient and cheapest way to acquire these multi-billion-euro systems. Metop-A was the first to launch, in 2006; Metop-B followed in 2012. Both satellites were expected to work for at least five years, and their continued operation today is a boon to weather forecasters. They will now get additional data to ingest in numerical models with the launch of Metop-C. Metop-C being prepared for launch at the European spaceport in French Guiana The satellites are different from their geostationary spacecraft ""cousins"" which image developing weather activity from a vantage point some 36,000km above the equator. The polar orbiting satellites fly much lower, only 800km above the ground. Their job is to probe atmospheric conditions, detailing parameters such as humidity and temperature at different heights. The introduction of the Metops has had an astounding impact on forecast quality. Assessments indicate the data from the first two platforms reduced errors in the 24-hour lookahead by 27%. And there have been big gains also in medium-range forecasts - those that go out to several days hence. Eumetsat operates Europe's weather spacecraft from its headquarters in Darmstadt, Germany. But the satellites' design and procurement is overseen by Esa. It is currently working on Metop-SG (Second Generation). These spacecraft will have much more advanced instrumentation, and in a change to the current observing strategy - those instruments will be deployed across pairs of platforms. The Microwave Humidity Sounders were batch-bought The British MHS will be succeeded by the MicroWave Sounder (MWS). It will have significantly improved performance. The first Metop-SG pairing is set to roll out at the end of 2022. These are interesting times in satellite meteorology because we are starting to see very small spacecraft being launched to monitor the state of the atmosphere. The new platforms are shoebox-sized, versus the 4-tonne Goliaths like Metop. ""New space"" companies - good examples would include Spire and Orbital Micro Systems - are looking to sell weather data and forecasts to private clients. Dr Josef Aschbacher, the director of Earth observation at Esa, told BBC News that his agency was evaluating the data from smallsats but it was too early to say how these novel systems would eventually fit into the general observing system. ""One should be careful not to make simple comparisons between the quality of a smallsat with a big sat,"" he said. ""Sometimes the illusion is created that you can just replace the big ones with the small ones. Smallsats provide what they are designed for - to be small, to be quick and for there to be many of them. Their measurements are therefore complementary to the more precise data from classical satellites like Metop.""

IVF hope for white rhino rescueA new study raises hopes of saving one of the last animals of its kind - the northern white rhino.Science & Environment,"Sudan was the last of his kind A new study raises hopes of saving one of the last animals of its kind. A victim ofï»¿ poaching, the northern white rhino population has been reduced to just two females, which are both unable to breed. DNA evidence shows the rhino is more closely related than previously thought to its southern white cousin. Creating rhino hybrids using IVF is likely to have a positive outcome, say scientists, although this option is considered a last resort. The white rhino split into two divided populations living in the north and south of Africa around one million years ago. But an extensive analysis of DNA from living rhinos and museum specimens shows the northern and southern populations mixed and bred at times after this date, perhaps as recently as 14,000 years ago. Najin (L) and Fatu: the only two remaining northern white rhinos ""Despite the fact that they started to diverge one million years ago, we show that they have been exchanging genes during that period, possibly as recently as the last ice age, when the African savannah expanded and reconnected the two populations,"" lead researcher Dr Michael Bruford of Cardiff University told BBC News. ""So, if they have been exchanging genes recently, this may imply that they could do so now."" Cross breeding using assisted reproductive technology could potentially act to rescue the northern white rhino from its current predicament, he said. The northern white rhino was once common throughout the north of the African continent, including Uganda, South Sudan, the DRC and Chad. Illegal hunting to meet demand for rhino horn caused a rapid decline in the wild, and the rhino sub-species was declared extinct on the wild in 2008. Earlier this year, Sudan, the last male northern white rhino, died at the age of 45. Two females are left - his daughter and granddaughter, who live inOl Pejeta Conservancy,externalin Kenya, where they are guarded around the clock. However, both have health problems of their own and cannot breed naturally. The southern white rhino is found in southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. Numbers dropped to a few hundred individuals around a century ago, but conservation efforts led to a recovery. About 20,000 exist in protected areas and private game reserves. The survival of the northern white rhino looks bleak, and relies on last-ditch hotly-debated conservation efforts, which involve IVF and cloning. A priceless store of frozen sperm from male northern white rhinos still exists, but conservationists are divided about how it should be used. In July,one teamtook eggs from female southern rhinos - which number around 20,000 in the wild - and fertilised them with frozen sperm from a male northern white rhino, to create hybrid embryos. Southern white rhino at Londolozi Reserve in South Africa The new study suggests this sort of approach might pay off, given that the two rhinos are closer genetically than once thought. ""We think it improves the chances,"" said Prof Bruford. ""It is difficult to predict what might happen if we cross the two subspecies but given the current options for the northern white rhino it becomes a more viable option, should other approaches fail."" Other options include using frozen tissue from a wider pool of northern white rhinos to generate stem cells that have the capacity to develop into eggs and sperm. This would avoid diluting the gene pool, but is more challenging to achieve.

"Man, 98, fighting for life after robberyThe pensioner is in hospital after a ""brutal and senseless"" attack in his home, police say.London","Peter Gouldstone is being treated in hospital after sustaining bruising and a head injury A 98-year-old man is fighting for his life after he was attacked and robbed in his home. Peter Gouldstone was found with bruising and a head injury at a house in Evesham Road, in the Bounds Green area of north London, on Tuesday. His son Simon said he ""feared the worst"" when he found his beaten father in a ""semi-conscious state"". The Met Police described it as a ""brutal and senseless"" attack. No arrests have been made. Simon Gouldstone said his father was house-bound and suffers from a heart condition. He described him as ""a low key, peaceful and supportive sort of person"" who lived in ""a fairly peaceful neighbourhood."" Simon Gouldstone said his father was house-bound and suffers from a heart condition Emma Austen, who lives near Mr Gouldstone, said the community is trying to do everything it can to help him and his family. ""A lot of us didn't know him, but we just really want to help in anyway we possibly can"", she said. ""If that's via fundraising, helping his family, writing cards - we just want to help. It's a truly awful thing to have happened."" The 98-year-old was found seriously injured in his home in Evesham Road Pio Gomes, 78, another neighbour of Mr Gouldstone, said he rarely saw the pensioner outside his home since his wife died several years ago. ""I used to take his bins out for him because he wasn't steady,"" he said. ""Of course it affects you because it's worrying. It's callous. Who could have done this to an old man like him?"" One elderly woman, who did not want to be named, said she rang Mr Gouldstone's son after noticing his garage door was open, which was ""unusual"". She said: ""His son came and then police and an ambulance were here until it was dark. ""I've known him for many years and he has a charming family. It's not nice."" A police cordon was set up in the alleyway behind the row of terraced houses During a search of Mr Gouldstone's home, police officers found a television and other personal belongings had been taken. Det Insp Paul Ridley said his bedroom had been ""ransacked"". ""It was an absolutely horrendous attack on a vulnerable man who has medical conditions,"" he said. ""The level of violence used was beyond belief."" Mr Gouldstone spoke to a family member by phone on 5 November at 14:00 GMT - police believe the attack took place in the 20-hour window between then and when he was found.

House searched in 'Grenfell bonfire' probeA video shared online shows a cardboard model of the tower being set alight by a laughing crowd.London,"The Justice4Grenfell campaign group said the video ""has caused great alarm and distress"" A house linked to an ""offensive"" video showing a model of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire has been searched by police. Six men - two aged 49, two aged 19 and the others 46 and 55 - were arrested on suspicion of a public order offence and have been released under investigation. A video shared on social media shows a cardboard model of the tower being set alight by a laughing crowd. Prime Minister Theresa May had called the video ""utterly unacceptable"". The men were arrested after handing themselves in. The footage shows a large model bearing a Grenfell Tower sign, complete with paper figures at the windows, being set on fire. Footage shows a large flammable model marked ""Grenfell Tower"" with paper figures at the windows, being set on fire Laughter can be heard off camera as the effigy is set alight, with onlookers shouting ""Help me! Help me!"" and ""Jump out the window!"". As the blaze takes hold, a voice can be heard to say ""All the little ninjas getting it at the minute"" while the camera focuses on a paper cut-out with a face covering. At the end of the clip a person can be heard saying: ""That's what happens when they don't pay their rent."" Grenfell fire: When does causing offence become a crime? Police searched a house in South Norwood, south London, taking away two clear plastic bags which appeared to contain gaffer tape and white tags. The officers were at the house for around two hours. Police officers left the South Norwood property taking evidence Rukayet Mamadu, a survivor of the fire, called the video the ""climax of intolerance of the system and society"". She told theVictoria Derbyshire programme: ""It's chilling, it's cold-blooded. I feel so bad, let alone people who lost relatives. ""This should be brought to justice."" A total of 72 people were killedin the devastating blaze at the west London tower block in June 2017. The men have been arrested undersection 4a of the Public Order Act 1986,external, which covers intentional ""harassment, alarm or distress"" caused via the use of ""threatening, abusive or insulting"" words or signs. Offences committed on a private residence where a person ""had no reason to believe"" it would be ""heard or seen by a person outside that or any other dwelling"" are protected from prosecution under the act. Moyra Samuels, from the Justice For Grenfell campaign group, called the video a ""disgusting attack"" Moyra Samuels, part of the Justice For Grenfell campaign group, told the BBC the video was ""a disgusting attack on vulnerable people"". Grenfell Tower: The fires that foretold the tragedy How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower Grenfell Tower was 'unsafe to live in' She added: ""We have no doubt that there are actually decent, generous people across Britain and this actual act doesn't represent ordinary British people. ""But there is a worrying rise of racism in this country at the moment. And that is concerning, because it's now starting to impact on us directly, which means that we actually need to be thinking what we do about this, and how we respond to this as a whole."" Natasha Elcock, from Grenfell United, said: ""Not only is it extremely upsetting to survivors and people who lost family, it's hateful and offensive to everyone that has been affected by the tragic events of that night."" Sir Martin Moore-Bick, who is leading the public inquiry into the Grenfell Tower fire, said he was ""very pleased to hear the authorities are taking the matter seriously"" at the start of Tuesday's evidence session.

Live results: Winners and losers,"In a dramatic election night President Donald Trump's Republican Party retained control of the Senate and the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed to take control of the House. It is the first time the party has held the majority in the lower house of Congress for eight years. The loss of the House will make it harder for President Trump to push his policies forward. What this all means for Trump Meanwhile, the Republicans have kept control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and will increase their majority. They gained Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota from the Democrats, while the Democrats gained seats in Nevada and Arizona. As it happened Key takeaways so far A really simple guide to the mid-terms There was talk before the election of a rising ""blue wave"" - Democrats increasing their vote share across the country. The Democrats increased their vote share in 239 districts, but they didn't win all of them. In West Virginia's 3rd district, there was a 20% swing towards the Democrats, but the seat still went to Republican Carol Miller. One Democrat who substantially increased her party's share was Sharice Davids, the joint-first Native American Congresswoman. She improved the Democrats' vote by 13% to win Kansas' 3rd district. The Republicans raised their vote share in just 67 districts. There will be more women in the House than in any previous year, while the total number of women in Congress overall will be at a record high after the mid-terms, overtaking the current tally of 107.

The 2018 mid-terms is set to be historical for voter turnout. With just a few seats left to be re-counted, 49.2% of those allowed to vote have done so. This is higher than any year since 1914. In 2014, just 37% of those eligible voted. Some 115 million votes were cast in the House in 2018, according to estimates by the US Elections Project, up from 83 million in 2014. How the mid-term elections broke records In the House, Democrats increased their vote share in hundreds of seats, with vote share dropping in just 47 seats. Boundary changes also helped them, as changes in Pennsylvania saw them gain four seats in the state, compared to 2016. They also gained two seats in the southern tip of Florida, a classic swing state. Compared with the last Congressional election in 2016, Republicans lost support in those counties with the most university-educated white women. While minorities are much more likely to vote Democrat. And in rural areas, there was strong support for Republican candidates. President Trump's core constituencies of white working class voters also appear to have turned out for the party in House races.

Car parts plants to close on Brexit worries,"This video can not be played Schaeffler workers leaving the Llanelli plant give their thoughts on the announcement More than 550 UK jobs are at risk after an automobile and industrial firm announced plans to close plants amid ""uncertainty surrounding Brexit"". Schaeffler plants in Llanelli and Plymouth are earmarked for closure, with the firm proposing to relocate production to plants outside the UK. It has started a 45-day consultation on the plans. In Plymouth, 350 staff are employed in the factory and 220 are at the Llanelli plant. The union Unite said it would ""fight for every job"". Assistant general secretary Tony Burke called the closures ""yet another body blow for the UK's automotive supply chain and the wider car industry"". He said it showed what was ""in store if the UK crashes out of the European Union without a deal that secures tariff free frictionless trade"" The firm said: ""The uncertainty surrounding Brexit was one factor amongst others in the analysis of the UK market."" Llanelli MP Nia Griffith said: ""I am worried obviously about the affect on families in the area... and the possible knock-on affect on other local businesses. ""It is important to try to offer the company any help to try to persuade them to change their minds."" She said Llanelli AM Lee Waters had already been talking to the Welsh economy secretary Ken Skates to see what was possible. The Schaeffler plant in Llanelli employs 220 people, with another 350 in Plymouth Luke Pollard, MP for Plymouth Sutton, said the closure was ""deeply worrying"" and showed the ""uncertainty of the hard Brexit"". ""We need to be in a customs union, close to the single market or we will lose even more jobs,"" he added. Johnny Mercer, the MP for Plymouth Moor View, said the closure was a ""short-sighted mistake"" by Schaeffler. Speaking about the possible impact on Llanelli, Councillor Deryk Cundy who represents Bynea, said the loss of ""well-paid"" jobs would be a massive blow. ""It will also affect Carmarthenshire and wider. We will need to form a taskforce. [We need] to persuade Schaeffler to rethink their decision,"" he said. Jones 'troubled' by Ford Brexit warning Brexit worries 'hit Channel ferry bookings' What would no-deal Brexit mean for UK business? Greig Littlefair, managing director of Schaeffler UK, said the firm wanted ""transparent and fair discussions with the employees affected"". Schaeffler, which employs more than 1,000 people at five facilities in the UK, will not be closing its largest plant in Sheffield. It is anticipated the UK reorganisation will take up to two years to implement. Juergen Ziegler, regional CEO Europe at Schaeffler, said: ""Brexit is clearly not the single decisive factor behind our decision-making for the UK market, but the need to plan for various complex scenarios has brought forward the timing."" The closures are part of the firm's ""Agenda 4 plus One"" reorganisation plan examining strategic and economic competitiveness and the long-term sustainability of facilities.

Analysis: Key takeaways so far,"This video can not be played What losing the House means for Donald Trump's presidency. The 2018 US mid-term election saw high turnout and a change in who controls one chamber of Congress. Here are some of the key takeaways I had as the results came in. The door to a Democratic-controlled Senate slammed shut with little suspense. Donald Trump will continue to have a Republican majority ready and willing to confirm his executive and judicial appointments. The only question now is the size of his party's advantage. In the House of Representatives, however, the story is different. The path of least resistance for Democrats to a majority in that chamber led through educated suburban districts that had long voted for Republicans, but contained voters that may have been uneasy with Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Results page: Winners, losers and races too close to call Live updates and reaction as counting continues Democrats win House in blow to Trump One by one, those districts were carried by the Democrats. In Virginia, Illinois and Florida, moderate Republicans lost. In places like Colorado, New Jersey, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Texas and New York Democrats are poised for victory. It won't feel like the tsunami many on the left were hoping for, but a steadily rising tide is still lifting Democrats to enough victories to give them control of the House for the first time in eight years. With that comes the ability to stop the Trump legislative agenda in its tracks and puts some teeth in congressional oversight of his administration. The partisan trenches in America are getting deeper. And after two years in the darkness, Democrats have a means to fight back. 21:30 EST (02:30 GMT)-Senate slipping away from Democrats Democrats always faced an uphill fight in the Senate, with 10 incumbents running in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016. Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on. Instead, he was the first to fall. Mr Donnelly certainly made every effort to stay afloat in the Hoosier state. He supported funding the president's border wall. He criticised the left wing of his own party. He backed anti-abortion legislation and gun rights. He said he was open to the president's suggested changes to birth-right citizenship. It was all to no avail. Mr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee, an open Republican-held seat where Republican Marsha Blackburn staved off what could have been a serious challenge by former Governor Bredesen. In West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding onto his seat. It's worth noting that he was the only Democrat to support the confirmation of embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power. It also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate. In a best-case scenario, a political tailwind would push all the at-risk candidates across the finish line. Instead, some survive while others falter. 20:30 EST (01:30 GMT)-Signs of a wavein the House? If a Democratic wave election is coming, Virginia congresswoman Barbara Comstock was always going to be the one the first to disappear beneath the deluge. Her defeat, which was announced relatively quickly, wasn't a big surprise. But it's also one of the first data points to suggest that Democrats are doing what they have to do to take back the House of Representatives. The southern Miami district that had long been the home of Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was expected to be another easy pickup for the Democrats - and it was. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump there by 20% in 2016. Republican Barbara Comstock lost a safe seat in Virginia, while Democrat Donna Shalala won in Florida And though the Republican, charismatic young Spanish-language television host Maria Salazar, ran a strong race against former Clinton administration health secretary Donna Shalala, even the best candidates can't hold back the tide in districts with such a decided partisan tilt. With polls closing all along the east coast, the biggest races are still too close to call. Democrats in the Senate who appeared poised to win easy re-elections - like Tim Kaine in Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio - did so. Tighter Senate matchups, in Florida and Indiana, appear headed to go down to the wire. In fact, in that Indiana race - where Joe Donnelly is seeking re-election - Democrats may be starting to sweat. Donald Trump won the state by 16% in 2016, and if the incumbent falls here, it could be bad news for the four other Democrats trying to stay afloat in states the president won by double-digits. The 2018 US mid-term election has already set records for early voting, and turnout appears to be up across the board. But what is on the minds of Americans as they head to the ballot box? A CBS News exit poll offers some clues. Donald Trump is a factor for 65% of American voters - and of those, 39% said they oppose him versus only 26% in support. The president has been ever-present in news coverage, holding numerous impromptu press sessions and formal interviews and criss-crossing the US, sometimes appearing at multiple rallies in the same day. Unlike past presidents facing potentially unfavourable mid-term elections, Mr Trump hasn't shied from the spotlight - and it looks like he's succeeded in making this vote about him. Overall, Donald Trump's approval rating among the electorate sits at 44% - which is nearly spot-on the currentRealClear Politics poll average,externalof 43.6%. If history is any guide, the party of a president with that level of support is in for a rough time in a mid-term election. Perhaps the most striking finding of the poll is that 43% of American mid-term voters named healthcare as the top issue for them. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the topic - attacking Republican attempts last year to repeal Obamacare health insurance reforms. If that's what voters are thinking about, it's an indication that Democrats accurately had the pulse of the electorate. Immigration, which has been Mr Trump's main focus in the final days of campaigning, is a distant second at 23%. The economy, which traditionally is at the top of voters' minds, is a close third with 21%. In what could be another bit of good news for Democrats, 80% of voters in the exit poll said it was important to elect women this year. Nearly 200 Democratic women are running for Congress this year, compared to just 59 Republicans. Other exit pollsshow similar numbers,external. And while the findings are far from definitive, they do suggest that the national playing field for Democrats this year is tilted in their favour.

IVF hope for white rhino rescue,"Sudan was the last of his kind A new study raises hopes of saving one of the last animals of its kind. A victim ofï»¿ poaching, the northern white rhino population has been reduced to just two females, which are both unable to breed. DNA evidence shows the rhino is more closely related than previously thought to its southern white cousin. Creating rhino hybrids using IVF is likely to have a positive outcome, say scientists, although this option is considered a last resort. The white rhino split into two divided populations living in the north and south of Africa around one million years ago. But an extensive analysis of DNA from living rhinos and museum specimens shows the northern and southern populations mixed and bred at times after this date, perhaps as recently as 14,000 years ago. Najin (L) and Fatu: the only two remaining northern white rhinos ""Despite the fact that they started to diverge one million years ago, we show that they have been exchanging genes during that period, possibly as recently as the last ice age, when the African savannah expanded and reconnected the two populations,"" lead researcher Dr Michael Bruford of Cardiff University told BBC News. ""So, if they have been exchanging genes recently, this may imply that they could do so now."" Cross breeding using assisted reproductive technology could potentially act to rescue the northern white rhino from its current predicament, he said. The northern white rhino was once common throughout the north of the African continent, including Uganda, South Sudan, the DRC and Chad. Illegal hunting to meet demand for rhino horn caused a rapid decline in the wild, and the rhino sub-species was declared extinct on the wild in 2008. Earlier this year, Sudan, the last male northern white rhino, died at the age of 45. Two females are left - his daughter and granddaughter, who live inOl Pejeta Conservancy,externalin Kenya, where they are guarded around the clock. However, both have health problems of their own and cannot breed naturally. The southern white rhino is found in southern Africa, including South Africa, Namibia, and Zimbabwe. Numbers dropped to a few hundred individuals around a century ago, but conservation efforts led to a recovery. About 20,000 exist in protected areas and private game reserves. The survival of the northern white rhino looks bleak, and relies on last-ditch hotly-debated conservation efforts, which involve IVF and cloning. A priceless store of frozen sperm from male northern white rhinos still exists, but conservationists are divided about how it should be used. In July,one teamtook eggs from female southern rhinos - which number around 20,000 in the wild - and fertilised them with frozen sperm from a male northern white rhino, to create hybrid embryos. Southern white rhino at Londolozi Reserve in South Africa The new study suggests this sort of approach might pay off, given that the two rhinos are closer genetically than once thought. ""We think it improves the chances,"" said Prof Bruford. ""It is difficult to predict what might happen if we cross the two subspecies but given the current options for the northern white rhino it becomes a more viable option, should other approaches fail."" Other options include using frozen tissue from a wider pool of northern white rhinos to generate stem cells that have the capacity to develop into eggs and sperm. This would avoid diluting the gene pool, but is more challenging to achieve.

Relief at social networks as defences hold,"The last time the US went to the polls, it was nothing short of a disaster for the biggest social media companies. Multiple congressional hearings later, a huge concern - would Facebook, Twitter and others be capable of protecting the integrity of the mid-term vote? But, as polls closed, there was good news for Silicon Valley. Measures put in place appear to have been mostly effective, with co-ordinated influence campaigns seeing limited efficacy, and voter suppression efforts often stopped at source. But, consider this phase one - experts warn the task may only just be beginning. ""I remain convinced that the real action will be after the election when we start to see the voter fraud, hacking claims start to roll in,"" suggested Bret Schafer from the Alliance to Secure Democracy, which runs a tool that tracks propaganda bot activity. Alex Stamos, Facebook's former head of security, told the BBC he expected bad actors may seek to aggressively spread misinformation the day after the vote, in an effort to undermine the integrity of the result. With regulators in multiple countries breathing down their necks, the consequences of another vote unduly influenced would have been dire for the social networking giants, which, after initially dismissing fears, now all admit they were too slow to react to abuses of their technologies. On Monday, Facebook announced it had removed 115 accounts that had displayed ""inauthentic"" behaviour, the term the site uses for fake or propaganda accounts. Thirty of those accounts were on the main Facebook site, while 85 were removed from image-sharing site Instagram. It had been told about the accounts by US law enforcement, it said. ""So far we haven't seen anything unexpected,"" Facebook told the BBC on Tuesday afternoon, California time. Earlier,Twitter said it removed 10,000 bot accounts,externalfrom its platform after being alerted by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. The accounts were seeking to convince people not to vote, by coordinating a hashtag campaign that suggested men should not vote in order to allow women to have the ultimate say. That ""campaign"", it later emerged, originated in message boards popular with members of the alt-right.An eye-opening report from NBC News discussed,externalhow misinformation efforts to tell people the vote was on Wednesday, not Tuesday, were perhaps being made more difficult by Twitter's moderators or algorithms. Independent analysis from the Atlantic Council,externalthink-tank suggests these posts reached only a handful - around 5,000 - of Twitter users. That's 5,000 too many, perhaps, but Twitter will consider that a resounding success on a platform where viral tweets can quickly garner an audience of millions. Some misinformation did slip through the cracks, however. In one example, retweeted more than 4,000 times, a misleadingly cut together video showed images of flag burning with clips of a well-known US news anchor laughing. But, soon after being discovered, the video was blocked on the platform. Bot activity was muted and, according to one activity tracker, actually down on previous days over the past month. In the hotly contested and highly polarised race between Republican Senator Ted Cruz and Democratic hopeful Beto O'Rourke, bot-powered posts made up just 15-16% of posts for each candidate. ""One possible explanation for low bot behaviour in Texas is more organic tweets - due to the popularity of the race - leading to a comparatively lower portion of bot activity,"" said Max Jenkins-Goetz, from RobHat, a firm that created bot tracker,botcheck.me,external. In particularly close races, in places such as Georgia and Michigan, bot accounts seemed to amplify views from genuine accounts, but mostly stopped short of pushing misinformation. In fact, according to another tracker -BotSentinel,external- the most popular terms among bots on polling days were things like ""MAGA"", ""vote red"" and ""God bless"". The US Department of Homeland Security set up what it called a ""situational awareness"" room to monitor various aspects of election security, including misinformation efforts and the integrity of its election infrastructure, such as the electronic voting machines that many had warned were hopelessly insecure.

In full: The notes setting out plan,"The BBC has seen a suggested detailed timetable of how the Government might try to sell a Brexit deal to the public and parliament.

Ireland warns UK over border,"The UK government has been told by Ireland to ""stand by its commitments"" on avoiding a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said an arrangement with a time limit would not be ""worth the paper it's written on"". The border issue is the main barrier to progress between the two sides. With time running out, Theresa May, who briefs her cabinet on Tuesday, has to get both the EU and her MPs on side. Kuenssberg: 10 pointers on where we are with Brexit Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop How will Parliament vote on a final deal? All you need to know about Brexit The European Union's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier has said divorce negotiations with the UK are not driven by a sense of revenge and that a no-deal, or a ""hard"" Brexit, would be a leap into the unknown for Britons living in the EU and EU citizens in the UK. Speaking at an event in Brussels, Mr Barnier also said any Brexit deal had to maintain an open Irish border to protect peace on the island that has seen decades of sectarian violence. The UK is due to leave the EU in March, and although 95% of the deal is said to be complete, the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland. It is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states. There have been warnings that a hard border would undermine the peace process in Northern Ireland. But unless negotiators can make decisive progress on how to guarantee no new visible checks, a special summit to finalise the UK's withdrawal will not take place. There is disagreement on whether the ""backstop"" they have agreed to put in place should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it can be time-limited or revoked by the UK. Please upgrade your browser Tory Brexiteers are concerned the UK could end up locked in a customs union with the EU without a fixed end point. Writing inThe Sun,external, former foreign secretary Boris Johnson said this would be an ""absolute stinker"" of a deal and warned of a ""surrender to Brussels"" with the UK staying tied to EU rules in years to come. Mrs May has insisted that any arrangement would be ""strictly time limited"". This, however, is not the view of the EU. On Twitter, Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a time-limited arrangement - or one that could be unilaterally ended by the UK - would never get EU backing. Allow Twitter content?

""Still necessary to repeat this, it seems,"" added the EU's deputy chief negotiator, Sabine Weyand. And Mr Varadkar said the UK had agreed to a legally-binding ""backstop"" to apply ""unless and until"" it is superseded by a new agreement. ""I think it's reasonable for us to expect a country like the United Kingdom and a government like the UK government to stand by its commitments,"" he said. Mr Varadkar described the UK as a ""divided kingdom"" over Brexit, saying this made it ""very difficult to come to an agreement"". While the EU has objected to a time-limited UK-wide arrangement, its suggestion of a backstop that is specific to Northern Ireland has been ruled out by Mrs May who says it would undermine the integrity of the UK by creating a new border down the Irish Sea. The prime minister says she does not think a ""backstop"" arrangement will be necessary as she wants to solve the border problem through the UK's long-term trade relationship with the EU, which has yet to be agreed. Mrs May spoke to Mr Varadkar by phone on Monday morning ""to take stock of the progress being made"", Downing Street said, adding that: ""In order to ensure that the backstop, if ever needed, would be temporary, the prime minister said that there would need to be a mechanism through which the backstop could be brought to an end."" The Irish government said Mrs May had ""raised the possibility of a review mechanism for the backstop"", and that Mr Varadkar had ""indicated an openness to consider proposals for a review, provided that it was clear that the outcome of any such review could not involve a unilateral decision to end the backstop"". Baroness Kennedy is among the legal figures supporting another Brexit referendum Meanwhile, 1,400 lawyers have signed a letter calling for another EU referendum to be held. Among the signatories of the letter are Labour peer Baroness Kennedy QC, former Court of Appeal judge Konrad Schiemann and David Edward, a former judge at the European Court of Justice. They say questions over the validity of the 2016 vote mean it should not be the public's final word, any more than the 1975 referendum on membership of what was then the European Economic Community. In the earlier referendum, voters faced a clear choice between alternatives once negotiations had been completed, the lawyers said. By contrast, during the 2016 vote, ""the nature of the negotiation process and its outcome were unknown"", said the letter. ""Voters faced a choice between a known reality and an unknown alternative. In the campaign, un-testable claims took the place of facts and reality."" The UK government has said asking the public to vote again would be a betrayal of the public's trust after the result of the referendum in 2016. A spokeswoman for the Department for Exiting the European Union said that the government was confident of a ""mutually advantageous"" deal with the EU. ""The people of the United Kingdom have already had their say in one of the biggest democratic exercises this country has ever seen and the Prime Minister has made it clear that there is not going to be a second referendum,"" she said.

As things stand, there's a whole slew of questions about the fate of Robert Mueller's Russia inquiry now that Trump's pick for acting attorney general appears to favour an end to the investigation. With Democrats soon to be in control of the House, they'll have the ability to launch investigations and consider impeachment. However, Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi - who could become the next House Majority Speaker - and President Trump have vowed to work together. But will the drama around America's top law enforcement official coupled with the new makeup of Congress lead to more compromise or commotion? Jeff Sessions is the latest official to leave the Trump team. Here's our running list of everyone who has left - or been asked to leave - by Donald Trump.

Aleem MaqboolBBC North America correspondent He may be claiming a ""big victory"" in these mid-term elections, but it's clear Donald Trump recognises he's in for - if nothing else - lots of irritation over the next two years. Through winning control of the House of Representatives, Democrats will have much more power to scrutinise the actions of the White Houseâ¦ and things like the president's tax affairs or even alleged sexual misconduct by him. Having said that, an increase in the majority of his party in the Senate - he believes because he supported most of the Senators who won - means President Trump will continue to have his own way in cabinet and judicial appointments. Speaking of whichâ¦he'll very soon be asking the Senate to confirm a new attorney general. In his first major act after the election, Donald Trump fired his last one - Jeff Sessions. He was incensed that Mr Sessions stepped aside - to avoid conflict of interest - from overseeing the investigation into Russia's alleged involvement in the 2016 presidential election. Mr Trump's message to election candidates and political appointees alike today is that if they do his bidding, he'll stand by them and they'd survive. But if they didn't - they'd be out in the cold.

"Live results: Winners, losers and too close to call","In a dramatic election night President Donald Trump's Republican Party retained control of the Senate and the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed to take control of the House. It is the first time the party has held the majority in the lower house of Congress for eight years. The loss of the House will make it harder for President Trump to push his policies forward. What this all means for Trump Meanwhile, the Republicans have kept control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and will increase their majority. They gained Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota from the Democrats, while the Democrats gained seats in Nevada and Arizona. As it happened Key takeaways so far A really simple guide to the mid-terms There was talk before the election of a rising ""blue wave"" - Democrats increasing their vote share across the country. The Democrats increased their vote share in 239 districts, but they didn't win all of them. In West Virginia's 3rd district, there was a 20% swing towards the Democrats, but the seat still went to Republican Carol Miller. One Democrat who substantially increased her party's share was Sharice Davids, the joint-first Native American Congresswoman. She improved the Democrats' vote by 13% to win Kansas' 3rd district. The Republicans raised their vote share in just 67 districts. There will be more women in the House than in any previous year, while the total number of women in Congress overall will be at a record high after the mid-terms, overtaking the current tally of 107.

Please be aware that by using this map you're accessing AP, a third party site. They collect data about how people use their results service. This is subject totheir terms and conditionsand the BBC does not have access to this data. What do the midterm results mean for women in Congress? The 2018 mid-terms is set to be historical for voter turnout. With just a few seats left to be re-counted, 49.2% of those allowed to vote have done so. This is higher than any year since 1914. In 2014, just 37% of those eligible voted. Some 115 million votes were cast in the House in 2018, according to estimates by the US Elections Project, up from 83 million in 2014. How the mid-term elections broke records In the House, Democrats increased their vote share in hundreds of seats, with vote share dropping in just 47 seats. Boundary changes also helped them, as changes in Pennsylvania saw them gain four seats in the state, compared to 2016. They also gained two seats in the southern tip of Florida, a classic swing state. Compared with the last Congressional election in 2016, Republicans lost support in those counties with the most university-educated white women. While minorities are much more likely to vote Democrat. And in rural areas, there was strong support for Republican candidates. President Trump's core constituencies of white working class voters also appear to have turned out for the party in House races.

Our pundit's key takeaways so far,"This video can not be played What losing the House means for Donald Trump's presidency. The 2018 US mid-term election saw high turnout and a change in who controls one chamber of Congress. Here are some of the key takeaways I had as the results came in. The door to a Democratic-controlled Senate slammed shut with little suspense. Donald Trump will continue to have a Republican majority ready and willing to confirm his executive and judicial appointments. The only question now is the size of his party's advantage. In the House of Representatives, however, the story is different. The path of least resistance for Democrats to a majority in that chamber led through educated suburban districts that had long voted for Republicans, but contained voters that may have been uneasy with Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Results page: Winners, losers and races too close to call Live updates and reaction as counting continues Democrats win House in blow to Trump One by one, those districts were carried by the Democrats. In Virginia, Illinois and Florida, moderate Republicans lost. In places like Colorado, New Jersey, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Texas and New York Democrats are poised for victory. It won't feel like the tsunami many on the left were hoping for, but a steadily rising tide is still lifting Democrats to enough victories to give them control of the House for the first time in eight years. With that comes the ability to stop the Trump legislative agenda in its tracks and puts some teeth in congressional oversight of his administration. The partisan trenches in America are getting deeper. And after two years in the darkness, Democrats have a means to fight back. 21:30 EST (02:30 GMT)-Senate slipping away from Democrats Democrats always faced an uphill fight in the Senate, with 10 incumbents running in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016. Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on. Instead, he was the first to fall. Mr Donnelly certainly made every effort to stay afloat in the Hoosier state. He supported funding the president's border wall. He criticised the left wing of his own party. He backed anti-abortion legislation and gun rights. He said he was open to the president's suggested changes to birth-right citizenship. It was all to no avail. Mr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee, an open Republican-held seat where Republican Marsha Blackburn staved off what could have been a serious challenge by former Governor Bredesen. In West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding onto his seat. It's worth noting that he was the only Democrat to support the confirmation of embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power. It also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate. In a best-case scenario, a political tailwind would push all the at-risk candidates across the finish line. Instead, some survive while others falter. 20:30 EST (01:30 GMT)-Signs of a wavein the House? If a Democratic wave election is coming, Virginia congresswoman Barbara Comstock was always going to be the one the first to disappear beneath the deluge. Her defeat, which was announced relatively quickly, wasn't a big surprise. But it's also one of the first data points to suggest that Democrats are doing what they have to do to take back the House of Representatives. The southern Miami district that had long been the home of Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was expected to be another easy pickup for the Democrats - and it was. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump there by 20% in 2016. Republican Barbara Comstock lost a safe seat in Virginia, while Democrat Donna Shalala won in Florida And though the Republican, charismatic young Spanish-language television host Maria Salazar, ran a strong race against former Clinton administration health secretary Donna Shalala, even the best candidates can't hold back the tide in districts with such a decided partisan tilt. With polls closing all along the east coast, the biggest races are still too close to call. Democrats in the Senate who appeared poised to win easy re-elections - like Tim Kaine in Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio - did so. Tighter Senate matchups, in Florida and Indiana, appear headed to go down to the wire. In fact, in that Indiana race - where Joe Donnelly is seeking re-election - Democrats may be starting to sweat. Donald Trump won the state by 16% in 2016, and if the incumbent falls here, it could be bad news for the four other Democrats trying to stay afloat in states the president won by double-digits. The 2018 US mid-term election has already set records for early voting, and turnout appears to be up across the board. But what is on the minds of Americans as they head to the ballot box? A CBS News exit poll offers some clues. Donald Trump is a factor for 65% of American voters - and of those, 39% said they oppose him versus only 26% in support. The president has been ever-present in news coverage, holding numerous impromptu press sessions and formal interviews and criss-crossing the US, sometimes appearing at multiple rallies in the same day. Unlike past presidents facing potentially unfavourable mid-term elections, Mr Trump hasn't shied from the spotlight - and it looks like he's succeeded in making this vote about him. Overall, Donald Trump's approval rating among the electorate sits at 44% - which is nearly spot-on the currentRealClear Politics poll average,externalof 43.6%. If history is any guide, the party of a president with that level of support is in for a rough time in a mid-term election. Perhaps the most striking finding of the poll is that 43% of American mid-term voters named healthcare as the top issue for them. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the topic - attacking Republican attempts last year to repeal Obamacare health insurance reforms. If that's what voters are thinking about, it's an indication that Democrats accurately had the pulse of the electorate. Immigration, which has been Mr Trump's main focus in the final days of campaigning, is a distant second at 23%. The economy, which traditionally is at the top of voters' minds, is a close third with 21%. In what could be another bit of good news for Democrats, 80% of voters in the exit poll said it was important to elect women this year. Nearly 200 Democratic women are running for Congress this year, compared to just 59 Republicans. Other exit pollsshow similar numbers,external. And while the findings are far from definitive, they do suggest that the national playing field for Democrats this year is tilted in their favour.

Why US mid-terms matter,"This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? The looming US mid-term elections will shape American politics for the next two years and beyond. President Donald Trump himself is not up for re-election, so fewer voters are expected to turn out. But his ability to govern in the final two years of his first term will hinge upon the 6 November outcome. All 435 members of the House of Representatives, 35 seats in the 100-member Senate and 36 out of 50 state governors, along with many state and local offices. Republicans currently hold sway in both chambers of Congress and the White House. But there is giddy talk among Democrats of a ""blue wave"". With dozens of Republican lawmakers retiring this year, the minority party has a decent chance of taking over the House. Democrats need 20 or so seats to control the lower chamber. But in the Senate, Republicans are tipped to retain their majority and perhaps even consolidate it. That's because out of the upper chamber seats up for grabs this autumn, 26 are held by Democrats (including two independents who vote with them) and just nine by Republicans. Democrats may need to win all those races and pick up two Republican seats, leaving little margin for error. Ten of the Democratic seats are in states carried by Trump in 2016 - and five of those he won by double digits. All the results as they happen Live updates as counting begins across the US Trump's invincible, but for how much longer? The president's party has lost an average of 32 seats in the House and two in the Senate in every mid-term election since the American Civil War. President Trump is also historically unpopular, according to opinion polls. As an energised liberal base clamours to give 'Trumpism' a bloody nose, Democratic challengers are out-fundraising and out-polling a host of Republican incumbents. There's a lot of new talent. Anecdotal evidence suggests more women are running for office than ever before, chiefly on the left, and in some races all the Democratic candidates are under 30. Your simple guide to the US mid-termsIn case you're just joining us Why US mid-term elections matterThe big issues explained Hour-by-hour guide to election nightWhat to expect when Can we tell yet who has the edge?Analysis of what we know so far Follow the US election on the BBCHow to keep up with the results The mid-term electorate is usually whiter, older and more conservative. Yes, Trump's approval rating is low, but the Democratic party has no obvious standard-bearer and is widely viewed as rudderless since Hillary Clinton's shock defeat in 2016. Above all, the US economy is roaring like a fighter jet engine at maximum torque, with unemployment rates at rock bottom, consumer confidence high and wages actually rising. Expect to hear a lot about how this election isa referendum on Trump. This summer's primaries - when the party faithful anoint their candidates for November's election - will be a tug-of-war on the right between establishment and anti-establishment conservatives - and on the left, between populist progressives calling for Trump's impeachment and pragmatic centrists. Immigrationremains a cultural touchstone that both main parties hope will play to their advantage. Democrats believe the president's hardline rhetoric on the topic will help them entice younger voters, suburban moderates and minorities. Republicans are counting on Trump's tough posture to turn out conservatives who think Democrats care more about illegal immigrants than US citizens. Thegun controlmovement launched in the aftermath of February's high school shooting in Parkland, Florida, is also mobilising for the election. Meanwhile, a recentGallup poll,externalfound the top concern for US voters ishealthcare. Despite passing various measures to weaken the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have been unable to kill off Obamacare. Voters tend to punish the party in power for rising medical insurance costs, which under Trump are continuing to hit Americans in the pocket. If Republicans lose control of either chamber of Congress, the president's domestic agenda will be largely dead on arrival at Capitol Hill. If Democrats win the House, they get to decide which bills come to the floor and they'll control the committee chairmanships. That will entail aggressive oversight investigations of the president's administration, including alleged Russia collusion, Trump's business dealings and sexual assault allegations against him. But if Republicans hold on to the Senate, they will continue to approve Trump's cabinet nominees and appoint conservative judges to US courtrooms. If Democrats do do well in the mid-terms, it could actually work in Trump's favour. He will be able to pin blame on them for congressional gridlock, and there's a risk they could overplay their hand. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi (R) and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer Governors wield considerable influence over politics in their state capitols - and the lives of their constituents. Republicans currently control 33 out of 50 gubernatorial mansions and two-thirds of 99 state legislature chambers. But of the 36 state governorships on the ballot this year, 23 are being defended by Republican incumbents, tantalising targets for Democrats. Among the gubernatorial prizes are the presidential swing states of Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Pennsylvania. As Trump runs for re-election in 2020, governors will play a crucial role in mobilising donors, volunteers and activists. In 1994 the Republican party took control of the House and Senate, setting the stage for six years of battles with Democratic President Bill Clinton. The Democrats retook both chambers in 2006, enabling President Barack Obama to accomplish chunks of his agenda when he won office two years later. Republicans won back the House in 2010, curtailing Obama's ability to govern. In 2014, Republicans regained control of the Senate, and boosted their House majority to its largest since 1929.

Ministers 'want EU deal by end of month'Notes seen by the BBC appear to detail how a deal could be presented to MPs and the public.UK PoliticsComments,"Senior ministers have agreed they want to reach a Brexit deal with the EU by the end of November, sources say. ""Everyone saw the difficulties of leaving it longer,"" a senior cabinet source told the BBC. Meanwhile, the BBC has seen a detailed suggested timetable of how the government could try to sell a deal to MPs and the public. It includes speeches from Theresa May and support from business figures and foreign leaders. Kuenssberg: A plan for presenting a Brexit deal? In full: The notes of a plan for selling Brexit deal Ireland tells the UK to stick to its commitments The notes, which the government has dismissed, suggest the cabinet had hoped to review a Brexit withdrawal deal when it met earlier. Sources say a final deal was not presented to the cabinet but that ministers agreed they want a deal to be done this month and they could meet again later this week. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March but the two sides have not yet agreed on the terms of its departure, with the Irish border proving the main sticking point. If a deal can be reached with the EU in time, Mrs May will then need to persuade her party - and the rest of Parliament - to support it in a key Commons vote. The notes seen by the BBC outline how ministers could present the deal, saying: ""The narrative is going to be measured success, that this is good for everyone but won't be all champagne corks popping."" They refer to a speech by Mrs May to the CBI, saying: ""We have delivered on the referendum."" This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. And they go on to talk about the government ""lining up 25 top business voices...and lots of world leaders eg Japanese PM to tweet support for the deal"". It suggests the government would hope to declare they had made decisive progress and to get the deal through Parliament in less than three weeks. Car parts plants to close on Brexit worries But a government spokesman said: ""The misspelling and childish language in this document should be enough to make clear it doesn't represent the government's thinking. ""You would expect the government to have plans for all situations - to be clear, this isn't one of them."" The spokesman did not deny there were advanced plans for building support for a deal if and when it is concluded. Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Commons Brexit select committee, said Mrs May should concentrate on securing a deal rather than on how to sell an agreement that was not yet done. ""When you get a deal, you can think about how you are going to tell people about it,"" he told the BBC. Earlier, No 10 said the prime minister assured ministers that the cabinet would meet before the UK agreed to any deal on the terms of the UK's exit. The withdrawal deal is said to be 95% complete but the tricky bit is proving to be how to honour the commitment by both sides to guarantee no new hard border in Ireland. There is disagreement on whether this ""backstop"" should apply to Northern Ireland, or the whole of the UK - and on whether it should be time-limited or revoked by the UK. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab has dismissed claims that he might resign At the cabinet meeting it is understood ministers discussed the mechanism for governing the backstop and who should decide when it no longer applied. Attorney General Geoffrey Cox is understood to have set out the legal position for an independent review mechanism for the backstop. He is believed to have told ministers there is a legal ""spectrum"" of what is possible to prevent the UK from being trapped ""in limbo"". The Irish border is an issue because after Brexit it will become the UK's land border with the rest of the EU, which has a single market and customs union so products do not need to be checked when they pass between member states. EU negotiator Michel Barnier told a Belgian broadcaster that the Irish border remained the main hurdle to be overcome but if enough progress is made he would recommend that a summit is convened to finalise the deal. Meanwhile, the government has published the criteria for allocating scarce permits for British truckers who need to drive in the EU after Brexit. The permits will be shared out based on: vehicle emissions, number of international journeys in the previous year, number of international journeys as a percentage of all journeys, type of goods transported and an element of chance. The Department for Transport,externaldocument says the permits would be required for a no deal scenario BUT might also be required after the future economic partnership is agreed, depending on the type of deal.

The most surprising candidates,"It can be tough to keep up with the deluge of information and analysis that comes with the US mid-term elections. Despite all the noise, the key question remains whether or not Republicans will be able to keep control of both chambers of Congress. But with so much to consider and thousands of races taking place, some interesting stories can be lost. That's why we've picked out some candidates who have had memorable journeys to the ballot box on November 6. Plus, a politics professor explains how a compelling personal story can make a difference. Who? Democrat Sharice Davids, a gay ex-mixed martial arts fighter, is running in Kansas's third congressional district. What makes her interesting? Ms Davids could become the first Native-American woman elected to Congress. She is a member of the Ho-Chunk Nation, was raised by a single mother who worked as a drill sergeant, and has a law degree from a top US university. The 38-year-old won her first mixed martial arts fight in November 2013, but began to focus on politics after she was rejected by the Ultimate Fighting Championship. One quote:""I've been put down, pushed aside, knocked out. I've had to fight my whole life because of who I am and who I love."" Who? Martha McSally, a two-term Republican representative from Arizona, is running for Senate in the state. What makes her interesting? Ms McSally is the first US female fighter pilot to fly in combat and the first to command a fighter squadron. She was deployed to Iraq and Afghanistan and earned six medals during her 26-year military career. If elected, she will become the first woman to represent Arizona in the Senate. One quote:""I'm a fighter pilot and I talk like one. That's why I told Washington Republicans to grow a pair of ovaries and get the job done."" Who? Randy Bryce, a trade union activist and cancer survivor, is the Democratic candidate for Wisconsin's first district. What makes him interesting? Mr Bryce - nicknamed Iron Stache - came to prominence whenhis biographical campaign video,externalwent viral earlier this year. He is an ironworker and former soldier who has emphasised his working-class roots, but he has drawn some notable opposition from close to home. His brother featured in a Republican attack ad and has said he is voting against him. Awkward. One quote:""I spent the last 20 years of my life building the district."" Who? Peter Boykin, founder of the Gays for Trump group, is running for North Carolina's state legislature. What makes him interesting? He is a major outlier, because the vast majority of LGBT candidates running this year are Democrats. There are no gay Republican nominees for Congress or governor, according tothe LGBT Victory Fund,externalorganisation. Mr Boykin has been forthright in addressing this issue, telling the New York Times that the Republican Party had ""totally embraced"" him. One quote:""The liberal gay community preaches peace, love, and tolerance but they only extend it to people who think like they do."" A really simple guide to the US mid-terms You choose what happens in the mid-terms Should Donald Trump be worried? Who? Christine Hallquist, 62, who defeated three candidates to win the Democratic nomination for governor of Vermont. What makes her interesting? She could become the first ever transgender governor of a US state. Ms Hallquist transitioned in 2015 while working as the head of a state-wide energy company, a job she held for 12 years. Her nomination comes during an election year that has seen a record number of lesbian, gay and transgender candidates run for political office. One quote:""I just happen to be a leader who is transgender. Vermonters know that."" Who? Will Hurd, a 40-year-old former CIA officer and Republican representative, is contesting a close race for Texas's 23rd district. What makes him interesting? He managed covert operations in Afghanistan during a nine-year career with the CIA, and has become a regular on political talk shows. His district covers an extensive part of the US-Mexico border, and he has been vocal in his opposition to President Trump's immigration policies. Mr Hurd is a moderate in the party and his seat is high on the list of those the Democrats are hoping to take. One quote:""I've seen Russian intelligence manipulate many people over my professional career and I never would have thought that the US President would become one."" Who? Democrat Mallory Hagan, 29, who has swapped beauty pageants for the ballot box in Alabama's third district. What makes her interesting? She was crowned Miss America in 2013, having previously won the Miss New York and Miss Manhattan titles. Last year, top figures in the Miss America Organization resigned after leaked emails showed they had mocked a number of contestants including Ms Hagan. The experience prompted her to give politics a try. ""It taught me a lot about the power of my voice,"" she says on her website. But she faces a tough test in trying to unseat her Republican opponent, Mike Rogers, who has held the district for more than 15 years. One quote:""After looking at the numbers of women throwing their hats in the ring, I decided to do it."" Who? Antonio Sabato Jr, a TV actor and former Calvin Klein model, is the Republican candidate in California's 26th district. What makes him interesting? Mr Sabato has been plastered on a 90ft [27m] billboard in Times Square and has shown off his ballroom skills on TV's Dancing with the Stars. But in recent years it's his political views that have been in the spotlight. He says he was blacklisted by Hollywood directors for his early support of Mr Trump's presidential run. Mr Sabato has also repeatedly claimed - without evidence - that former President Barack Obama is Muslim. One quote:[On President Obama] ""If he's not a Muslim, we should call him President Barry."" This year's pool of candidates is a diverse one, with more women and LGBT people running than ever before. But will it make a difference? Yes, says Jennifer Lawless, a politics professor at the University of Virginia who specialises in campaigns and elections. ""A lot of these more diverse candidates can generate levels of enthusiasm among voters that have traditionally not been part of the electoral environment,"" she says. Prof Lawless also points out that most of the new, diverse, candidates are Democrats. Why is this? ""A lot are running based on their concerns about the Trump administration,"" she says. ""Many have personal experience where they feel like they have been targeted themselves."" The women lining up to topple Trump The US state about to elect a woman There are also a number of candidates who have compelling personal stories to tell and Prof Lawless says this can be helpful - to an extent. ""In a lot of cases these personal stories are a way for candidates to talk about themselves in a way that is genuinely authentic,"" she says. ""But there's not much evidence to suggest that voters specifically look at individual life stories,"" she adds. ""The most important thing is the ability to convey that you have the background and the experience to be an effective representative of the people.""

Girl Scouts sue Boy Scouts for name switch,"The Boy Scouts leader said they changed the programme's name to make the group more inclusive The Girl Scouts of the United States of America have filed a lawsuit against the Boy Scouts of America for dropping ""boy"" from the scout group's name. The Boy Scouts of America announced in Maythey would rename the Boy Scouts programme Scouts BSAas they prepare to allow girls as members. But the Girl Scouts say the change could erode their brand, calling the move ""uniquely damaging"" to them. Their lawsuit seeks damages and an injunction against trademark breaches. ""Only GSUSA has the right to use the Girl Scouts and Scouts trademarks with leadership development services for girls,"" papers filed in a Manhattan federal court said. The switch could ""marginalise"" the Girl Scouts, the complaint reads. It reportedly says the switch has already caused confusion, with some believing their organisation had merged with the Boy Scouts. In response, the Boy Scouts of America issued a statement saying it was reviewing the suit, and that it believed ""there is an opportunity for both organizations to serve girls and boys in our communities"". This video can not be played What makes this Girl Scout group special? In October 2017,the Boy Scouts board of directors voted unanimously to open the programme to all children. The Cub Scouts, for ages seven to 10, opened its local clubs to all children in 2018. Boy Scouts, for ages 11 to 17, will follow its footsteps next year when the programme name change becomes official. Butthe Girl Scouts protested the decision at the time, with the group's president Kathy Hopinkah Hannan accusing them of a ""covert campaign"" to recruit girls to tackle a ""well-documented"" declining membership. The Boy Scouts reportedly have close to 2.3m members in the US, down about a third since 2000, compared with around 2 million members for the Girl Scouts.

Can we tell yet who'll win?,"This is it. After primaries, debates, countless polls, months of campaigning and endless speculation, the US mid-term elections are almost here. In some states, early voting has been going on for weeks and turnout has surpassed previous records for non-presidential years. At this point Democrats are cautiously optimistic of their chances to take back some legislative power. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi has gone so far as to flat-out state that her party will win control of the House of Representatives. Such an outcome would have immediate and drastic implications for the president's ability to advance his political agenda and Democratic oversight of his administration. The ""mid-term wave"" - a sweeping electoral triumph that reshapes the national political map - is a recurring phenomenon in US politics. Is one about to crash on Republicans in Washington? For the purposes of this analysis, a mid-term wave is where one party picks up a combination of more than 20 seats in the US House of Representatives and the Senate. That's happened eight times in the last 70 years, notably in 1994 (a Republican wave against Bill Clinton) and 2010 (one against Barack Obama). Today, the Republican Party is near a modern-day high in seats in the House of Representatives, with a 241-to-194 seat majority, so it could be poised for a tumble. The Senate terrain may be friendlier for Republicans, with Democrats defending 10 seats in states Mr Trump won in 2016, but this year's political atmosphere is such that an electoral storm could be brewing. Democrats have the political wind at their back, but intervening events - like the fight over confirming Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court - have the potential to shake things up. What is the current state of play? Here are the measurements - and the history lessons - that will give us clues. Money makes the (political) world go round. Levels of cash pouring in for candidates, parties and independent groups are an indication of electoral muscle for advertising, organisation and get-out-the-vote efforts. They're also a reflection of the enthusiasm of each side's donor base. This video can not be played Why are US election campaigns never-ending? Ask America has the answer There's one component of campaign fundraising that tracks particularly closely with every wave election in the last 25 years, a period during which the role of money in political campaigns skyrocketed. In the Republican wave of 1994, individual donations to House candidates - which are limited under campaign finance law - tilted toward Republicans. The party then took control of the chamber for the first time since 1955. In 2006, the fundraising advantage flipped to the Democrats, as did control of Congress. Four years later, Republicans were back in the money - and back in charge of the House. In 2014, they built their biggest majority there in 83 years and won control of the Senate, as well. ""In mid-term waves, long-time incumbents can get kind of caught flat-footed when they're faced with a well-funded, competitive race,"" says Geoffrey Skelley of the University of Virginia Center for Politics. 2018 outlook: What was once a remarkable fund-raising advantage for Democratic House of representative candidates has become an astounding one. The latest figures show them more than doubling the Republican amount of contributions from individual donors. As of 2 November, they have brought in $649m (Â£500m), against ""only"" $312m for Republicans. Democratic enthusiasm is translating into open pocketbooks - and a rising financial tide is lifting all Democratic ships. It's not all gloom and doom for Republicans, however. They have plenty of deep-pocketed donors pouring their own money into independent expenditures, and the Republican Party itself is flooding money into key races across the US. When it comes to grass-roots enthusiasm and small-money donors, however, all the energy and excitement is clearly coming from the left. In the past month alone, Democrats have hit the accelerator and left the Republicans behind in a cloud of dust. Mid-term elections are said to be a referendum on the incumbent president. When presidents are unpopular, voters take out their frustration on their party in Congress. If the chief executive is riding high, the party is rewarded (or, at least, not excessively punished). A look at the Gallup presidential approval poll over the last 60 years tends to bear this out. Every time a president faced a net-negative rating in the month before the mid-terms - Ronald Reagan in 1982, Bill Clinton in 1994, George Bush in 2006 and Barack Obama in 2010 and 2014 - it meant lights-out for his party at the ballot box in November. The exceptions are also enlightening. Gerald Ford was plus-24 in October 1974, but his numbers - following his controversial pardoning of Richard Nixon the month before - were poised to take a nosedive, declining 15 points over the next three months. Democrats gained 48 seats in the House and five in the Senate - what would be known as the ""Watergate Class"" of Congress. Lyndon Johnson was around the break-even point in 1966, but unease about the Vietnam War and civil rights unrest, combined with his party's inflated congressional numbers after a big victory two years earlier, set Democrats up for a tumble. 2018 outlook: Donald Trump's approval ratings have been remarkably stable, given the tumult of his first year-and-a-half in office. He didn't have much of a ""honeymoon"" period following his election, so there haven't been many sharp changes. At the end of August, the president stood at 40% approval. On the eve of the mid-term elections his approval isâ¦ 40% That's not a good sign for Republicans. The president has defied political gravity in the past, but his unpopularity could be a weight that sinks his party on Tuesday. This involves asking people simply which party's House candidate they would support in the election. There are 435 individual House of Representatives races in every mid-term election, meaning at least 870 candidates from the two major parties plus a handful of prominent independents and third-party politicians. Each race is unique, every constituency has its own particular interests, and each congressional district has a demographic identity as unique as a fingerprint. It therefore seems implausible that the collective outcome of all those races could be boiled down to a simple poll asking whether a voter would prefer a nameless Democrat or a faceless Republican. The generic ballot question, however, has proven to be a remarkably accurate predictor of mid-term election prospects for the two major parties. ""The national generic ballot picks up the national political climate,"" says Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University who has crafted an election prediction model based largely on the generic ballot polling numbers. ""I view it as a measure of the political mood of the electorate."" In 1958, 1982 and 2006, the Democratic generic ballot advantage ballooned before the party's wave-election victories. When the Republican waves of 1994, 2010 and 2014 swept through, the Democratic advantage narrowed to low single digits (or even, at times during the election run-up, disappeared entirely). This year, Abramowitz says, the tipping point for Democratic control of the House sits around a seven-point generic ballot advantage. A lead bigger than that, and a wave could be on the horizon. 2018 outlook: The Democratic generic ballot lead has shifted over the course of the past year. In the late spring it narrowed to the point that it appeared Republicans were in excellent shape for November. By mid-September, however, the Democratic lead approached double-digits. That trend tailed off a bit, but the current eight-point margin is on the lower edge of where it has to be for a blue wave, even if it falls short of a tsunami. A simple guide to what these elections are The evangelical women who reject Trump Democrats dazzled by rising star in Texas Four ways US mid-terms are undemocratic Donald Trump and his fellow Republicans are pushing positive economic numbers as a reason why they deserve another two years of unified control in Washington. Historically, however, a growing economy is no guarantee of success for the president's party. In 1994, when the governing Democrats ceded Congress, the economy was expanding at more than 4%, although unemployment was a bit higher than the current mark, at 5.8%. In other wave years, 2006 and 2014, the economy wasn't in bad shape either. A struggling economy, on the other hand, can be a death sentence for the incumbent party's mid-term prospects. In 1958, Republicans in Congress faced a bloodbath largely due to that year's recession, which included a modern-record -10% first-quarter GDP contraction. Negative growth in 1974 and 1982 also probably contributed to Republican losses those years. ""You'd rather have a strong economy than a bad economy, but it doesn't mean you're going to escape the wrath of voters,"" says Abramowitz. 2018 outlook: Third-quarter gross domestic product growth is down a bit, after the second quarter hit 4.2%. Combined with unemployment at a 49-year low and signs of wage growth, however, the economic numbers are undoubtedly good. Mr Trump has decided to make immigration control his closing argument to mid-term voters - to the dismay of some Republicans who would prefer he focus laser-like on the robust economy. If history is a guide, however, the president may be right to look for a different issue, as a growing economy is no guarantee of electoral success. Set aside all the poll numbers, economic figures and expert analyses. Who has their finger on the pulse of the political climate better than anyone? Probably the politicians themselves. They're the ones whose names are on the ballots, and they're the ones who could be out of a job if a wave hits. Facing the prospect of embarrassing electoral defeat, some politicians may opt to ease into early retirement or get a head-start on colleagues searching for post-public-service gainful employment. ""We know historically that open seats are more difficult to defend,"" says Skelley. ""And because they're more difficult to defend, that gives the party that doesn't control them a better shot."" A look at modern retirement trends shows a mixed picture. The retirement figures in 2010 gave little hint of the carnage in store for Mr Obama's party. In 1994, however, a surge of Democratic retirements may have foreshadowed big Republican gains that autumn. 2018 outlook: If 1994's retirements were a harbinger of doom for Democrats, 2018's numbers could spell trouble for Republicans. Several key committee chairs and Speaker of the House Paul Ryan have already joined what's become a modern record for retirements from a majority party - a telling sign that they think Republicans may not be a majority much longer. Several incumbents - on the left and right - also were forcibly retired, as they lost primary races to grass-roots challengers. That could be another indication of an anti-incumbent mood in the electorate that, because there are more Republicans running for re-election than Democrats, could help fuel a Washington power shift.

Senate slipping out of Democratic reach,"The Democrats' hopes of winning control of the US Senate have been dealt a blow in the mid-term elections. A Donald Trump Republican ally is projected to unseat an incumbent in Indiana, but Democratic senators held on in West Virginia and New Jersey. Democrats also scored significant gains in the House of Representatives, and two US networks predict they will take control of the chamber. Republicans currently control both legislative chambers. President Trump is not up for re-election until 2020, but Tuesday's poll will shape his agenda for the remainder of his two years in office. Republicans look likely now to retain control of the Senate - they currently have a slim 51-49 majority, but only nine of the party's seats were up for grabs, while Democrats were defending 26 seats. Republican businessman Mike Braun was projected to oust first-term incumbent Joe Donnelly, a moderate Democrat in Indiana. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Mr Trump had ""closed the deal"" for Mr Braun after holding a rally in the state on Monday night. This video can not be played Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont: 'President is a pathological liar' Republican Marsha Blackburn won a Senate seat in Tennessee against Democrat Phil Bredesen, who was endorsed by pop star Taylor Swift. There was some consolation for Democrats as Senators Joe Manchin and Bob Menendez held on to their seats after tough campaigns in West Virginia and New Jersey respectively. Mr Manchin was the only member of his party to vote to confirm Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh, whose nomination narrowly survived sexual assault claims. A cliff-hanging vote count in Florida has Republican Rick Scott neck and neck with incumbent Democratic senator Bill Nelson. Republican Ted Cruz Cruz has a slight lead against his challenger, Democratic rising star Beto O'Rourke.

Two US networks - Fox and NBC - are projecting that the Democrats are expected to win the 23 seats they need to take over the House of Representatives. Americans voted for all 435 seats in the House. In suburban Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton ousted incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock, while another Democrat, Donna Shalala, flipped a Florida constituency against Republican Maria Salazar, a news anchor. New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is projected to have become the youngest woman ever elected to the US House at 29 years old. If Democrats do win the House, they are expected to launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest, while thwarting his legislative agenda.

All the results as they happen Live updates as counting begins across the US This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Democrats always faced an uphill fight in the Senate, with 10 incumbents running in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016. Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on. Instead, he was the first to fall. Mr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee. In West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding on to his seat. And in other previously Trump-friendly 2016 states - Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania - Democratic incumbents breezed to victory. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power. It also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate. In a best-case scenario, a political tailwind would push all the at-risk candidates across the finish line. Instead, some survive while others falter. Key takeaways from election so far After months of campaigning and billions of dollars in spending on adverts, leaflets and bumper stickers, voters came out in force. Around 40 million people cast early ballots according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. That figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million. In Texas, early voting exceeded the entire turnout in 2014. Some states showed signs of being overwhelmed by the voter influx, however. There were reports of electronic voting machine failures and congested polling stations - including in Georgia, Atlanta, Arizona, and New York. Relief at social networks as defences hold A Homeland Security official said the department had received ""sparse"" reports of tech failure, but that there seemed to have been no significant impact on people's ability to vote.

LIVE: See results as they come in,"In a dramatic election night President Donald Trump's Republican Party retained control of the Senate and the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives. The Democrats gained more than the 23 seats they needed to take control of the House. It is the first time the party has held the majority in the lower house of Congress for eight years. The loss of the House will make it harder for President Trump to push his policies forward. What this all means for Trump Meanwhile, the Republicans have kept control of the Senate, the upper chamber of Congress, and will increase their majority. They gained Indiana, Missouri and North Dakota from the Democrats, while the Democrats gained seats in Nevada and Arizona. As it happened Key takeaways so far A really simple guide to the mid-terms There was talk before the election of a rising ""blue wave"" - Democrats increasing their vote share across the country. The Democrats increased their vote share in 239 districts, but they didn't win all of them. In West Virginia's 3rd district, there was a 20% swing towards the Democrats, but the seat still went to Republican Carol Miller. One Democrat who substantially increased her party's share was Sharice Davids, the joint-first Native American Congresswoman. She improved the Democrats' vote by 13% to win Kansas' 3rd district. The Republicans raised their vote share in just 67 districts. There will be more women in the House than in any previous year, while the total number of women in Congress overall will be at a record high after the mid-terms, overtaking the current tally of 107.

The 2018 mid-terms is set to be historical for voter turnout. With just a few seats left to be re-counted, 49.2% of those allowed to vote have done so. This is higher than any year since 1914. In 2014, just 37% of those eligible voted. Some 115 million votes were cast in the House in 2018, according to estimates by the US Elections Project, up from 83 million in 2014. How the mid-term elections broke records In the House, Democrats increased their vote share in hundreds of seats, with vote share dropping in just 47 seats. Boundary changes also helped them, as changes in Pennsylvania saw them gain four seats in the state, compared to 2016. They also gained two seats in the southern tip of Florida, a classic swing state. Compared with the last Congressional election in 2016, Republicans lost support in those counties with the most university-educated white women. While minorities are much more likely to vote Democrat. And in rural areas, there was strong support for Republican candidates. President Trump's core constituencies of white working class voters also appear to have turned out for the party in House races.

A Democratic majority in the lower chamber for the first time in eight years will restrict his ability to steer his programme through Congress. But Mr Trump's Republicans are set to strengthen their grip on the Senate. Tuesday's vote was seen as a referendum on a polarising president, even though he is not up for re-election till 2020.

The Democrats took control of the House, having gained more than the 23 seats they need to take over the lower chamber of Congress. Americans voted for all 435 seats in the House. The Democrats could now launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest. They could also more effectively block his legislative plans, notably his signature promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico. But analysts say dealing with a hostile House may suit the president, who is known both for his partisan style and ability to switch positions. They say he could either choose to accuse the Democrats of obstruction or try to reach deals to get legislation through. New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (C) is the youngest woman ever elected to the US House at 29 years old Female candidates performed particularly well. Two 29-year-old Democrats - Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Abby Finkenauer - are due to be the youngest women ever to win House seats. Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib are the first Muslim women and Sharice Davids and Debra Haaland the first Native American women to be elected to Congress. All are Democrats. How the mid-term elections broke records Republicans are on course to increase their representation in the 100-seat Senate from 51 to 54. This ensures Mr Trump will still have a majority to confirm his executive and judicial appointments. Democrats were always facing an uphill battle in the Senate this year because they were defending 26 races, while just nine Republican seats were up for grabs. Key gains for the Republicans came in Indiana, Missouri, Florida and North Dakota, where they unseated Democrat incumbents. But a Republican incumbent lost to a Democrat in Nevada. In Texas Republican Senator Ted Cruz fended off a strong challenge by Democratic rising star Beto O'Rourke. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News, Washington With control of the House, the Democrats will be able to block Donald Trump's legislative agenda and will have much more oversight. They will have key committees that will be able to look into allegations of collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's presidential campaign.  They might delve in Mr Trump's personal finance. In addition, there have been allegations of corruption made against senior administration officials. The Democrats will be able to dig deep into that. The Republican maintaining control of the Senate is very important because if they stick together, they can confirm any of Mr Trump's appointments to his administration or to the judiciary. The president has already appointed 84 conservative judges to the federal judiciary. Expect that trend to continue.

What time can we expect a result?,"This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Millions in the US and across the world are following the election results as they come in. There are hundreds of races - which ones are worth keeping an eye on? Americans have been filling polling stations on Tuesday to elect 35 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives, as well as 36 state governors and countless state officials. Polls in many areas have closed. It is a crucial election for President Donald Trump, as his Republican Party currently controls both houses of Congress. Here are some of the key races to watch - and what's happened so far. A huge setback for Democrats as they lose their Senate seat in Indiana. That makes their path to seizing control of the upper chamber very narrow indeed. It's a state that Trump won easily in 2016. A key Kentucky district seen as a bellwether has been held by Republicans but there was some good news for Democrats in Virginia. Virginia congresswoman Barbara Comstock has lost her seat in the House to Democratic challenger Jennifer Wexton, and she's being seen by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher as the first possible casualty of a Democratic ""blue wave"". Democratic incumbent senators in the eastern part of the country have retained their seats, including Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren and Virginia's Tim Kaine. No surprises there. Independent Bernie Sanders has glided to an easy win in Vermont, securing a third term in the senate. Read Anthony's rolling blog How to follow the results on the BBC A really simple guide to the mid-terms Most polls closed in two of the most closely-watched governors' races,FloridaandGeorgia. In Florida,the Democratic Mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, a left-wing progressive who wants to become the state's first black leader, faces Republican Ron DeSantis, a Trumpist conservative. Ron DeSantis (left) and Andrew Gillum are fighting to become Florida's governor The fight for a Senate seat has put incumbent Bill Nelson, a Democrat who has served since 2000, against outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott, in what is one of the most expensive races in the country. President Trump loves Florida. A double Republican win here would give the White House a huge morale boost. In neighbouringGeorgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams hopes to become the country's first black female governor in one of the most contentious races in this year's mid-term election. She faces Republican Brian Kemp, Georgia's current secretary of state, the top official overseeing the election. The race between Stacey Abrams (D) and Brian Kemp (R) is one of the most fiercely contested The campaign, which has drawn national attention, has been embroiled in claims of voter suppression, and may not even be over on Tuesday: if neither candidate gets a majority of the vote, the decision will go to a run-off election on 4 December. In a House race of note, Republican Rep Karen Handel, elected in a closely-fought special election in 2017, faces gun control activist Lucy McBath, whose son was killed in a dispute about loud music, in the suburban Atlanta 6th district. Polls also close inSouth Carolina,VermontandVirginia, where Republican Rep Dave Brat is fighting for re-election in the Richmond-area (7th district) against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer. Mr Brat won his seat after famously defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014 in a Republican primary. A Brat defeat - if it comes on the heels of Democratic victories elsewhere - would be interpreted as a good sign for those cheering the Democratic cause. At 19:30, polls close inNorth Carolina,OhioandWest Virginia. An ugly, gloves-off fight that defines US election The Deep South woman vying to make history What are the claims of voter suppression? This was an action-packed hour that could decide who will control the Senate. But you'll need to pay close attention to know what's happening - there's a lot going on. Polls closed inNew Jersey, where the race for the 7th district is playing out between Rep Leonard Lance, who has represented the area since 2008, and Democrat Tom Malinowski. Democrats are hoping to make some gains in an area that is critical of President Trump. Democrats also have high hopes inPennsylvania, and one race worth watching is the 1st district. Republican Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate former FBI agent, faces Democrat Scott Wallace, who has spent huge sums of his own wealth to fund his campaign - his family's philanthropic foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, is reportedly worth more than $140m (Â£107m).

One to watch is the 7th district of west Houston suburbs, a former GOP stronghold that narrowly chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Republican Rep John Culberson faces Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. The race for the Senate in this traditional red state is between incumbent Ted Cruz, a former Republican presidential candidate, and Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a rising star who wants to become the party's first senator for Texas in three decades. He's been getting a lot of attention and raising loads of money, but a win for Mr O'Rourke looks unlikely.

Key takeaways from election results so far,"This video can not be played What losing the House means for Donald Trump's presidency. The 2018 US mid-term election saw high turnout and a change in who controls one chamber of Congress. Here are some of the key takeaways I had as the results came in. The door to a Democratic-controlled Senate slammed shut with little suspense. Donald Trump will continue to have a Republican majority ready and willing to confirm his executive and judicial appointments. The only question now is the size of his party's advantage. In the House of Representatives, however, the story is different. The path of least resistance for Democrats to a majority in that chamber led through educated suburban districts that had long voted for Republicans, but contained voters that may have been uneasy with Donald Trump's policies and rhetoric. Results page: Winners, losers and races too close to call Live updates and reaction as counting continues Democrats win House in blow to Trump One by one, those districts were carried by the Democrats. In Virginia, Illinois and Florida, moderate Republicans lost. In places like Colorado, New Jersey, Kansas, Pennsylvania, Texas and New York Democrats are poised for victory. It won't feel like the tsunami many on the left were hoping for, but a steadily rising tide is still lifting Democrats to enough victories to give them control of the House for the first time in eight years. With that comes the ability to stop the Trump legislative agenda in its tracks and puts some teeth in congressional oversight of his administration. The partisan trenches in America are getting deeper. And after two years in the darkness, Democrats have a means to fight back. 21:30 EST (02:30 GMT)-Senate slipping away from Democrats Democrats always faced an uphill fight in the Senate, with 10 incumbents running in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016. Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on. Instead, he was the first to fall. Mr Donnelly certainly made every effort to stay afloat in the Hoosier state. He supported funding the president's border wall. He criticised the left wing of his own party. He backed anti-abortion legislation and gun rights. He said he was open to the president's suggested changes to birth-right citizenship. It was all to no avail. Mr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee, an open Republican-held seat where Republican Marsha Blackburn staved off what could have been a serious challenge by former Governor Bredesen. In West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding onto his seat. It's worth noting that he was the only Democrat to support the confirmation of embattled Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power. It also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate. In a best-case scenario, a political tailwind would push all the at-risk candidates across the finish line. Instead, some survive while others falter. 20:30 EST (01:30 GMT)-Signs of a wavein the House? If a Democratic wave election is coming, Virginia congresswoman Barbara Comstock was always going to be the one the first to disappear beneath the deluge. Her defeat, which was announced relatively quickly, wasn't a big surprise. But it's also one of the first data points to suggest that Democrats are doing what they have to do to take back the House of Representatives. The southern Miami district that had long been the home of Republican Ileana Ros-Lehtinen was expected to be another easy pickup for the Democrats - and it was. Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump there by 20% in 2016. Republican Barbara Comstock lost a safe seat in Virginia, while Democrat Donna Shalala won in Florida And though the Republican, charismatic young Spanish-language television host Maria Salazar, ran a strong race against former Clinton administration health secretary Donna Shalala, even the best candidates can't hold back the tide in districts with such a decided partisan tilt. With polls closing all along the east coast, the biggest races are still too close to call. Democrats in the Senate who appeared poised to win easy re-elections - like Tim Kaine in Virginia and Sherrod Brown of Ohio - did so. Tighter Senate matchups, in Florida and Indiana, appear headed to go down to the wire. In fact, in that Indiana race - where Joe Donnelly is seeking re-election - Democrats may be starting to sweat. Donald Trump won the state by 16% in 2016, and if the incumbent falls here, it could be bad news for the four other Democrats trying to stay afloat in states the president won by double-digits. The 2018 US mid-term election has already set records for early voting, and turnout appears to be up across the board. But what is on the minds of Americans as they head to the ballot box? A CBS News exit poll offers some clues. Donald Trump is a factor for 65% of American voters - and of those, 39% said they oppose him versus only 26% in support. The president has been ever-present in news coverage, holding numerous impromptu press sessions and formal interviews and criss-crossing the US, sometimes appearing at multiple rallies in the same day. Unlike past presidents facing potentially unfavourable mid-term elections, Mr Trump hasn't shied from the spotlight - and it looks like he's succeeded in making this vote about him. Overall, Donald Trump's approval rating among the electorate sits at 44% - which is nearly spot-on the currentRealClear Politics poll average,externalof 43.6%. If history is any guide, the party of a president with that level of support is in for a rough time in a mid-term election. Perhaps the most striking finding of the poll is that 43% of American mid-term voters named healthcare as the top issue for them. Democrats have campaigned heavily on the topic - attacking Republican attempts last year to repeal Obamacare health insurance reforms. If that's what voters are thinking about, it's an indication that Democrats accurately had the pulse of the electorate. Immigration, which has been Mr Trump's main focus in the final days of campaigning, is a distant second at 23%. The economy, which traditionally is at the top of voters' minds, is a close third with 21%. In what could be another bit of good news for Democrats, 80% of voters in the exit poll said it was important to elect women this year. Nearly 200 Democratic women are running for Congress this year, compared to just 59 Republicans. Other exit pollsshow similar numbers,external. And while the findings are far from definitive, they do suggest that the national playing field for Democrats this year is tilted in their favour.

Woman who spent ÃÂ£16m in Harrods arrested,"Zamira Hajiyeva is said to have spent more than Â£4,000 pounds a day at Harrods A woman who spent Â£16m at Harrods and became the subject of the UK's first Unexplained Wealth Order has been arrested and faces extradition. Zamira Hajiyeva, 55, is the wife of an ex-state banker who is serving a 15-year prison sentence for embezzlement in their home country of Azerbaijan. Mrs Hajiyeva, who lives in a Â£15m house near the London store, became the first person to be served a UWO by the National Crime Agency last month. Her lawyers say she is no ""fraudster"". The UWO means she has to explain the origin of her fortune. It was revealed at Westminster Magistrates Court in London that Mrs Hajiyeva was arrested last week by officers from the Metropolitan Police acting on an extradition request from the authorities in the Azerbaijan capital, Baku. She faces two charges of embezzlement and has been held in custody since giving herself up voluntarily last Tuesday. At a bail hearing, prosecutors argued that she should not be released, claiming she posed a flight risk. Her legal team argued that though she was clearly a ""spendthrift"", she was not ""a fraudster"" or likely to flee the country. Hugo Keith QC added that her children were based in the UK, where she has also lived for almost a decade having left Azerbaijan after surviving a violent kidnapping. Senior district judge Emma Arbuthnot agreed that Mrs Hajiyeva could be released on bail - if she pays Â£500,000 as a guarantee, stays at her home in Knightsbridge, does not travel outside the M25 and reports to police every day. But prosecutors immediately appealed, meaning she will remain in custody. The appeal hearing is expected to take place on Thursday at the High Court. Mrs Hajiyeva also remains under investigation by the NCA. Last week, the agency seized jewellery belonging to her family that was worth more than Â£400,000 and was due to be auctioned at Christie's auction house.

A Donald Trump Republican ally is projected to unseat an incumbent in Indiana, but Democratic senators held on in West Virginia and New Jersey. Democrats also scored significant gains in the House of Representatives, and two US networks predict they will take control of the chamber. Republicans currently control both legislative chambers.

Republicans look likely now to retain control of the Senate - they currently have a slim 51-49 majority, but only nine of the party's seats were up for grabs, while Democrats were defending 26 seats.

In suburban Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton ousted incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock, while another Democrat, Donna Shalala, flipped a Florida constituency against Republican Maria Salazar, a news anchor. New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is projected to have become the youngest woman ever elected to the US House at 29 years old. If Democrats do win the House, they are expected to launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest, while thwarting his legislative agenda.

Key takeaways from election so far After months of campaigning and billions of dollars in spending on adverts, leaflets and bumper stickers, voters came out in force. Around 40 million people cast early ballots according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. That figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million. In Texas, early voting exceeded the entire turnout in 2014. Some states showed signs of being overwhelmed by the voter influx, however. There were reports of electronic voting machine failures and congested polling stations - including in Georgia, Atlanta, Arizona, and New York.

"What time can we expect a result?A really simple guide to the US mid-term electionsInvincible, but for how much longer?","This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Millions in the US and across the world are following the election results as they come in. There are hundreds of races - which ones are worth keeping an eye on? Americans have been filling polling stations on Tuesday to elect 35 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives, as well as 36 state governors and countless state officials. Polls in many areas have closed. It is a crucial election for President Donald Trump, as his Republican Party currently controls both houses of Congress. Here are some of the key races to watch - and what's happened so far. A huge setback for Democrats as they lose their Senate seat in Indiana. That makes their path to seizing control of the upper chamber very narrow indeed. It's a state that Trump won easily in 2016. A key Kentucky district seen as a bellwether has been held by Republicans but there was some good news for Democrats in Virginia. Virginia congresswoman Barbara Comstock has lost her seat in the House to Democratic challenger Jennifer Wexton, and she's being seen by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher as the first possible casualty of a Democratic ""blue wave"". Democratic incumbent senators in the eastern part of the country have retained their seats, including Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren and Virginia's Tim Kaine. No surprises there. Independent Bernie Sanders has glided to an easy win in Vermont, securing a third term in the senate. Read Anthony's rolling blog How to follow the results on the BBC A really simple guide to the mid-terms Most polls closed in two of the most closely-watched governors' races,FloridaandGeorgia. In Florida,the Democratic Mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, a left-wing progressive who wants to become the state's first black leader, faces Republican Ron DeSantis, a Trumpist conservative. Ron DeSantis (left) and Andrew Gillum are fighting to become Florida's governor The fight for a Senate seat has put incumbent Bill Nelson, a Democrat who has served since 2000, against outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott, in what is one of the most expensive races in the country. President Trump loves Florida. A double Republican win here would give the White House a huge morale boost. In neighbouringGeorgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams hopes to become the country's first black female governor in one of the most contentious races in this year's mid-term election. She faces Republican Brian Kemp, Georgia's current secretary of state, the top official overseeing the election. The race between Stacey Abrams (D) and Brian Kemp (R) is one of the most fiercely contested The campaign, which has drawn national attention, has been embroiled in claims of voter suppression, and may not even be over on Tuesday: if neither candidate gets a majority of the vote, the decision will go to a run-off election on 4 December. In a House race of note, Republican Rep Karen Handel, elected in a closely-fought special election in 2017, faces gun control activist Lucy McBath, whose son was killed in a dispute about loud music, in the suburban Atlanta 6th district. Polls also close inSouth Carolina,VermontandVirginia, where Republican Rep Dave Brat is fighting for re-election in the Richmond-area (7th district) against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer. Mr Brat won his seat after famously defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014 in a Republican primary. A Brat defeat - if it comes on the heels of Democratic victories elsewhere - would be interpreted as a good sign for those cheering the Democratic cause. At 19:30, polls close inNorth Carolina,OhioandWest Virginia. An ugly, gloves-off fight that defines US election The Deep South woman vying to make history What are the claims of voter suppression? This was an action-packed hour that could decide who will control the Senate. But you'll need to pay close attention to know what's happening - there's a lot going on. Polls closed inNew Jersey, where the race for the 7th district is playing out between Rep Leonard Lance, who has represented the area since 2008, and Democrat Tom Malinowski. Democrats are hoping to make some gains in an area that is critical of President Trump. Democrats also have high hopes inPennsylvania, and one race worth watching is the 1st district. Republican Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate former FBI agent, faces Democrat Scott Wallace, who has spent huge sums of his own wealth to fund his campaign - his family's philanthropic foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, is reportedly worth more than $140m (Â£107m).

One to watch is the 7th district of west Houston suburbs, a former GOP stronghold that narrowly chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Republican Rep John Culberson faces Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. The race for the Senate in this traditional red state is between incumbent Ted Cruz, a former Republican presidential candidate, and Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a rising star who wants to become the party's first senator for Texas in three decades. He's been getting a lot of attention and raising loads of money, but a win for Mr O'Rourke looks unlikely.

A cliff-hanging vote count in Florida has Republican Rick Scott neck and neck with incumbent Democratic senator Bill Nelson. Republican Ted Cruz Cruz has a slight lead against his challenger, Democratic rising star Beto O'Rourke. Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, has won election to US Senate from Utah, as expected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Two US networks - Fox and NBC - are projecting that the Democrats are expected to win the 23 seats they need to take over the House of Representatives. Americans voted for all 435 seats in the House. In suburban Virginia, Democrat Jennifer Wexton ousted incumbent Republican Barbara Comstock, while another Democrat, Donna Shalala, flipped a Florida constituency against Republican Maria Salazar, a news anchor. New York Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is projected to have become the youngest woman ever elected to the US House at 29 years old. If Democrats do win the House, they are expected to launch investigations into Mr Trump's administration and business affairs, from tax returns to potential conflicts of interest, while thwarting his legislative agenda.

The Sunshine State's governor race is too close to call between a left-wing progressive, Andrew Gillum, and a Trumpist conservative, Ron DeSantis. Democratic candidate Stacey Abrams could become the first female African-American governor in the US. Her Republican opponent Brian Kemp's office has been accused of voter suppression. To add to polling day tensions, broken voting machines led to longer queues and a return to paper ballots in some parts of the state. All the results as they happen Live updates as counting begins across the US This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Democrats always faced an uphill fight in the Senate, with 10 incumbents running in states that Donald Trump carried in 2016. Even though the president won Indiana by 16%, Joe Donnelly was supposed to be one of the endangered candidates with a better chance to hold on. Instead, he was the first to fall. Mr Trump barnstormed the critical Senate battleground states in the final days of the campaign, effectively making the contests as much about him as they were about the individual candidates. It appears to have been an effective strategy in places like Indiana and Tennessee. In West Virginia, however, Joe Manchin continued to defy political gravity by holding on to his seat. And in other previously Trump-friendly 2016 states - Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania - Democratic incumbents breezed to victory. In all it makes for a muddled picture that as much reflects regional identities, demographic differences and specific candidate strengths as it does Mr Trump's political power. It also, however, nearly closes the door on Democratic hopes to retake the Senate. In a best-case scenario, a political tailwind would push all the at-risk candidates across the finish line. Instead, some survive while others falter. Key takeaways from election so far After months of campaigning and billions of dollars in spending on adverts, leaflets and bumper stickers, voters came out in force. Around 40 million people cast early ballots according to the US Elections Project, a University of Florida-based information source. That figure in 2014 was just 27.5 million. In Texas, early voting exceeded the entire turnout in 2014. Some states showed signs of being overwhelmed by the voter influx, however. There were reports of electronic voting machine failures and congested polling stations - including in Georgia, Atlanta, Arizona, and New York. Relief at social networks as defences hold A Homeland Security official said the department had received ""sparse"" reports of tech failure, but that there seemed to have been no significant impact on people's ability to vote.

"What time are the election results?VideoVideoHang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'?","This video can not be played Hang on, what ARE the US 'mid-terms'? Millions in the US and across the world are following the election results as they come in. There are hundreds of races - which ones are worth keeping an eye on? Americans have been filling polling stations on Tuesday to elect 35 senators and all 435 members of the House of Representatives, as well as 36 state governors and countless state officials. Polls in many areas have closed. It is a crucial election for President Donald Trump, as his Republican Party currently controls both houses of Congress. Here are some of the key races to watch - and what's happened so far. A huge setback for Democrats as they lose their Senate seat in Indiana. That makes their path to seizing control of the upper chamber very narrow indeed. It's a state that Trump won easily in 2016. A key Kentucky district seen as a bellwether has been held by Republicans but there was some good news for Democrats in Virginia. Virginia congresswoman Barbara Comstock has lost her seat in the House to Democratic challenger Jennifer Wexton, and she's being seen by the BBC's Anthony Zurcher as the first possible casualty of a Democratic ""blue wave"". Democratic incumbent senators in the eastern part of the country have retained their seats, including Massachusetts' Elizabeth Warren and Virginia's Tim Kaine. No surprises there. Independent Bernie Sanders has glided to an easy win in Vermont, securing a third term in the senate. Read Anthony's rolling blog How to follow the results on the BBC A really simple guide to the mid-terms Most polls closed in two of the most closely-watched governors' races,FloridaandGeorgia. In Florida,the Democratic Mayor of Tallahassee, Andrew Gillum, a left-wing progressive who wants to become the state's first black leader, faces Republican Ron DeSantis, a Trumpist conservative. Ron DeSantis (left) and Andrew Gillum are fighting to become Florida's governor The fight for a Senate seat has put incumbent Bill Nelson, a Democrat who has served since 2000, against outgoing Republican Governor Rick Scott, in what is one of the most expensive races in the country. President Trump loves Florida. A double Republican win here would give the White House a huge morale boost. In neighbouringGeorgia, Democrat Stacey Abrams hopes to become the country's first black female governor in one of the most contentious races in this year's mid-term election. She faces Republican Brian Kemp, Georgia's current secretary of state, the top official overseeing the election. The race between Stacey Abrams (D) and Brian Kemp (R) is one of the most fiercely contested The campaign, which has drawn national attention, has been embroiled in claims of voter suppression, and may not even be over on Tuesday: if neither candidate gets a majority of the vote, the decision will go to a run-off election on 4 December. In a House race of note, Republican Rep Karen Handel, elected in a closely-fought special election in 2017, faces gun control activist Lucy McBath, whose son was killed in a dispute about loud music, in the suburban Atlanta 6th district. Polls also close inSouth Carolina,VermontandVirginia, where Republican Rep Dave Brat is fighting for re-election in the Richmond-area (7th district) against Democrat Abigail Spanberger, a former CIA officer. Mr Brat won his seat after famously defeating House Majority Leader Eric Cantor in 2014 in a Republican primary. A Brat defeat - if it comes on the heels of Democratic victories elsewhere - would be interpreted as a good sign for those cheering the Democratic cause. At 19:30, polls close inNorth Carolina,OhioandWest Virginia. An ugly, gloves-off fight that defines US election The Deep South woman vying to make history What are the claims of voter suppression? This was an action-packed hour that could decide who will control the Senate. But you'll need to pay close attention to know what's happening - there's a lot going on. Polls closed inNew Jersey, where the race for the 7th district is playing out between Rep Leonard Lance, who has represented the area since 2008, and Democrat Tom Malinowski. Democrats are hoping to make some gains in an area that is critical of President Trump. Democrats also have high hopes inPennsylvania, and one race worth watching is the 1st district. Republican Rep Brian Fitzpatrick, a moderate former FBI agent, faces Democrat Scott Wallace, who has spent huge sums of his own wealth to fund his campaign - his family's philanthropic foundation, the Wallace Global Fund, is reportedly worth more than $140m (Â£107m). This video can not be played What do American voters care about? Polls also closed inAlabama, Connecticut, Delaware, District of Columbia, Illinois, Maine, Maryland, Mississippi, Oklahoma, Rhode IslandandTennessee. InMissouri, two-term Democratic Sen Claire McCaskill hopes to keep her seat against Republican Josh Hawley. First polls closed inKansas, Massachusetts, Michigan,where Democrat Rashida Tlaib hopes to become the first Muslim woman in Congress,New HampshireandSouth Dakota. At 20:30, polls closed inArkansas. Mid-terms in charts: Should Donald Trump be worried? The evangelical women who reject Trump What happened at21:00 EST (02:00 GMT) Polls closed inTexas. One to watch is the 7th district of west Houston suburbs, a former GOP stronghold that narrowly chose Hillary Clinton over Donald Trump. Republican Rep John Culberson faces Democrat Lizzie Fletcher. The race for the Senate in this traditional red state is between incumbent Ted Cruz, a former Republican presidential candidate, and Democrat Beto O'Rourke, a rising star who wants to become the party's first senator for Texas in three decades. He's been getting a lot of attention and raising loads of money, but a win for Mr O'Rourke looks unlikely. It would suggest there's been a big swing to the Democrats nationwide if he gets over the line. This video can not be played Apathy isn't the only reason why so many Americans don't vote Polls close inColorado,Louisiana,Nebraska,New Mexico,New York,WisconsinandWyoming. InMinnesota, Republican Rep Erik Paulsen faces a big challenge from Democrat Dean Phillips in the Twin Cities suburbs (3rd district). Mrs Clinton won in the area by nine points. You're doing well if you're still keeping up. You might have the state of play now in the Senate and the House, but don't bet on it. Democrats dazzled by rising star in Texas Why more Native Americans are running for office What happened at22:00 EST (03:00 GMT) Polls closed inIowa, and a key race to watch is in Des Moines (3rd district), one of the areas that swung for Barack Obama in 2012 but backed Mr Trump two years ago. Republican Rep David Young faces Democrat Cindy Axne, a small business owner. InNevada, Republican Sen Dean Heller faces Democrat Rep Jacky Rosen, and Democrats are optimistic about winning this seat. Polls also closed inMontana, andUtah. First polls close inIdahoandNorth Dakota. Jon Tester's attempt to keep his Senate seat in Montana has irked the president personally - Mr Trump said he has never forgiven the Democratic senator for raising questions about his personal doctor, Ronny Jackson, when he was in the frame to be secretary of veterans' affairs. The big election issue that's not Trump We've hit the west coast. If you don't know which party has had a good night so far, you've probably been napping. Polls close inCalifornia, and it will be interesting to see how traditionally Republican areas will vote. One of the key races is taking place in the 45th district, in Orange County. Mitt Romney won there in 2012 but Mrs Clinton was favoured here in the last election. Republican Rep Mimi Walters faces Democrat Katie Porter, a law professor. Polls also close inOregonandWashington. Polls close inHawaii. Polls close inAlaskabetween now and 01:00 (06:00 GMT). Some nail-biter races could still be in the balance - but there should be champagne corks popping somewhere by this stage.
