Deselecting Labour MPs to be made easier,"Labour's annual conference is taking place in Liverpool Labour's annual conference has voted to make it easier for local party members to deselect sitting MPs. As well as lowering the threshold for forcing MPs to fight open selection battles, delegates also backed reforms to the rules governing Labour leadership contests. Both changes were comfortably backed at the party conference in Liverpool. But Momentum, which had been pushing for more extensive changes, described the measures as ""meagre"". Labour keeps option of fresh Brexit vote Labour: We'll make firms give staff shares The group, which was set up to support Jeremy Corbyn's leadership, backed the package as a compromise but said some key proposals had been ""watered down or blocked"", adding that the outcome ""could have been much worse"". Until now, Labour MPs faced a reselection contest only if 50% of a constituency's local branches and affiliated unions voted for it in a ""trigger ballot"". A proposal to cut this threshold to 33% won the backing of the party conference in Liverpool with 65% of delegates in favour. The deselection campaign is seen by some Labour MPs as an attempt to ""purge"" critics of Jeremy Corbyn. Two MPs on the right of the party - Frank Field, who quit the party's group in Parliament, and John Woodcock, who has resigned from the party - complained of a culture of bullying and intimidation in the party. Those on the left of the party say they are out of step with the direction of Labour and point to the fact Mr Field lost a vote of confidence among members of his local constituency party in Birkenhead in July. Other MPs including Kate Hoey and Gavin Shuker have recently lost no confidence votes, although these have no official force in the party and are not the same as ""trigger ballots"". Supporters of the expected new rules say they will end the ""job for life"" culture, while others said they did not go far enough. But calls during the debate for compulsory open selection contests before every general election were not heeded. Shuker vote 'not start of deselection' Why Corbyn allies want MP selection change Conference delegate Steve Arloff, from Bradford West Labour Party, said Labour MPs should not assume they have ""some God-given right to be selected unopposed, expecting it to be a job for life"". He went on: ""Many sitting MPs who have lost the respect and confidence of local parties cling on to their positions in Parliament with scant regard for the people who work their socks off to put them there. ""Hundreds of thousands of us members demand that things are done differently."" Unite general secretary Len McCluskey explained his union's position by saying it wanted to offer 100% support to Mr Corbyn. He said: ""The proposition being put forward by our leader is something I am prepared to trust. There are certain MPs who are almost asking to be deselected. ""They really don't want to be part of this exciting transformation that is taking place."" Jeremy Corbyn and Tom Watson pictured at the conference on Sunday Earlier, deputy leader Tom Watson told Sky News's Ridge On Sunday that mandatory reselection would be ""very destabilising for the party"". ""We are potentially close to a general election, maybe any day,"" said Mr Watson. ""What we don't want is MPs having to defend their positions in their local areas when they could be campaigning in Parliament for social policy that affects the many, not the few."" The rule change for future leadership contests does not alter the 10% threshold for the number of MPs' nominations which a candidate must gather to get on to the ballot paper. But it also requires them to get the backing of 5% of constituency parties or 5% of members of trade unions or affiliated organisations. By Iain Watson, BBC political correspondent So what was Sunday's row over MP deselections at the Labour Party conference really all about? First, it speaks to the increasing tensions within the party's left wing on how best to solidify the changes Jeremy Corbyn has introduced. But what upset many left wing delegates was what they saw as an old fashioned stitch-up worthy of the Blair era. They were given a straight choice between accepting or rejecting the NEC compromise - and no opportunity to vote for open selections. Which brings us to the second point: the row tells us that there are now far more delegates on the left of the party than in previous years, even after Jeremy Corbyn became leader.

Girl with allergy dies after Pret baguette,"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight A girl with a severe sesame allergy died after eating an airport Pret a Manger baguette, which did not list the ingredients. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, collapsed during a flight from Heathrow to Nice on 17 July 2016. Despite her father administering two EpiPen injections, Natasha, from Fulham, London, died within hours, West London Coroner's Court will hear. Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the death. Natasha's father, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, said in a statement: ""It's a daily battle and the pain is indescribable."" Mr Ednan-Laperouse, the founder of Wow Toys company, said: ""As a family now of three, my wife, son and I are still trying to adjust to life without our beloved girl. ""Everything we say and do is a reminder that she isn't with us - her empty bedroom, school uniform hanging in her wardrobe, her holiday bag packed for her holiday in Nice has never been unpacked. We can't bear to."" A spokesperson for Pret said: ""We were deeply saddened to hear about Natasha's tragic death, and our heartfelt thoughts are with her family and friends."" Natasha had eaten a baguette just before boarding the flight to Nice Natasha ate an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from the main Pret a Manger shop in Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport, said the family's solicitors, Leigh Day. It is believed the sesame was baked into the baguette, rather than contained in seeds on its crust, said Pret. The teenager collapsed on the British Airways flight and later died in hospital in Nice. An estimated 1 in 100 people have an allergy to sesame proteinaccording to the NHS.,externalReactions can vary from rashes and swelling, to breathing difficulties. Pret a Manger confirmed its products were not individually labelled with allergen or ingredient information.

Labour deselection row exposes tensions,"Unite's Len McCluskey backs the changes So what was Sunday's row over MP deselections at the Labour Party conference really all about? First, it speaks to the increasing tensions within the party's left wing on how best to solidify the changes Jeremy Corbyn has introduced. The left wing group Momentum wanted to see ""open selections"" where sitting MPs - many of whom didn't vote for Mr Corbyn as their leader - could be challenged between elections. Until now, this could only happen if 50% of local party branches agree. But although most unions are under left wing leadership they wanted to ensure they had a say in the process. So behind closed doors at Labour's National Executive Committee (NEC) last night, a compromise was agreed. Deselecting Labour MPs to be made easier It will be easier to deselect MPs. Indeed, the Unite leader Len McCluskey had to emphasise just how easy it would be, in order to assuage angry delegates. However, a third of union or local party branches will have to agree to pull the trigger on the starting gun for any contest. It won't be automatic. But what upset many left wing delegates was what they saw as an old fashioned stitch-up worthy of the Blair era. They were given a straight choice between accepting or rejecting the NEC compromise - and no opportunity to vote for open selections. That's why they very nearly threw out the whole conference agenda in protest. Which brings us to the second point: the row tells us that there are now far more delegates on the left of the party than in previous years, even after Jeremy Corbyn became leader. This is underlined by the fact that while the Momentum leadership is now backing the deselection compromise as a step forward, some of their own supporters see this as a sell out. Nonetheless, Momentum will come together again to harry for further change in the years ahead. And in doing so, the friction between the political and industrial wings of this new-look Labour is likely to increase.

"Look in mirror after attack, US tells Iran","This video can not be played The moment gunmen open fire on an Iranian military parade The US ambassador to the UN has urged Iran to ""look in the mirror"" for the causes of an attack on a military parade that killed 25 on Saturday. Nikki Haley said Iranian President Hassan Rouhani had ""oppressed his people for a long time"". She was responding to Mr Rouhani's fierce criticism of the US, in which he blamed it for enabling the attack. Two separate groups have claimed they carried out the shooting, but neither has provided evidence. Four gunmen opened fire at Revolutionary Guard troops in the south-western city of Ahvaz on Saturday, killing 25 people including soldiers and civilians watching a commemorative parade. One of the victims was a four-year-old girl. An anti-government Arab group - Ahvaz National Resistance - and the Islamic State (IS) group both claimed responsibility for the killings. A video released by the Islamic State group's news agency, Amaq, shows three men in a car who appear to be dressed in  Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC) uniforms, possibly on their way to carry out the shooting. The men do not identify themselves as members of IS in the video, but do talk about the importance of jihad. President Rouhani said the ""bully"" US, along with Gulf states it backed, had enabled the attack. But the US has denied responsibility and says it condemns ""any terrorist attack"", while a senior official for the United Arab Emirates - one of the countries Mr Rouhani was thought to be referring to - called the accusations ""baseless"". ""He's got the Iranian people... protesting, every ounce of money that goes into Iran goes into his military, he has oppressed his people for a long time and he needs to look at his own base to figure out where that's coming from,"" Ms Haley told CNN. ""He can blame us all he wants. The thing he's got to do is look in the mirror."" The gunmen shot at civilians and soldiers Mr Rouhani will face Donald Trump at the UN General Assembly this week. How will Trump treat Iran at the UN? Speaking on Sunday, before leaving for the UN in New York, Mr Rouhani vowed that Iran would ""not let this crime stand"". ""It is absolutely clear to us who committed this crime... and whom they are linked to,"" he said. He alleged that a Gulf country had supported the ""financial, weaponry and political needs"" of the attackers. He added: ""The small puppet countries in the region are backed by America, and the US is provoking them and giving them the necessary capabilities."" Mr Rouhani did not specify which ""puppet"" countries he was referring to - but his comments are widely thought to be directed at Iran's regional foe Saudi Arabia, and the UAE and Bahrain. Iran has previously alleged that Saudi Arabia supports separatist activity among Iran's Arab minority. Both countries have been struggling for regional political and religious dominance for decades, and are engaged in a number of proxy wars around the region, backing rival factions in Yemen and Syria. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (L) and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani The decades-old feud between them is exacerbated by religious differences - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. The UAE and Bahrain are closely allied with Saudi Arabia. Iran has also alleged that the gunmen had links to its bitter foe Israel. Iran considers Israel an illegitimate occupier of Muslim land - and has accused it of attempting to undermine the government. Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Iran also summoned diplomats from the UK, the Netherlands, and Denmark on Saturday, accusing their countries of harbouring Iranian opposition groups. The two sides have had thorny relations for decades. The US has accused Iran of running a clandestine nuclear weapons programme, which Iran denies. In 2015, under then-President Barack Obama, the US and Iran reached a landmark nuclear deal - also signed by China, Russia, the UK, France and Germany - where Iran limited its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. However, ties deteriorated after Mr Trump took office and then withdrew from the nuclear deal. Trump and Rouhani trade angry threats Iran nuclear deal: Key details US-Iran relations: A brief guide Since then, the US has brought sanctions back into place, despite opposition from EU partners, China and Russia, and warned that anyone trading with Iran would also be punished. The US has also expressed support for anti-government protesters in Iran. More generally, the US is deeply suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East - including its influence in Syria and Yemen - and is an ally of Israel and Saudi Arabia. Mr Trump is chairing a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday - and says the meeting will be focused on Iran. Moment gunmen open fire on Iran military parade.

Shuker vote 'not start of deselection',"Jeremy Corbyn said the selection process for the next General Election ""doesn't begin for some time"" A vote of no-confidence against Labour's MP for Luton South does not signal the start of a deselection process, leader Jeremy Corbyn has said. Local memberspassed the vote against Gavin Shukerearlier this month. The Labour leader told the BBC there had ""obviously been an issue"" with the local party, ""but that's not the start, or indeed the end, of any process"". Mr Shuker said it would be ""fairer"" if the party was ""honest"" and admitted that the vote was about deselection. Gavin Shuker wants ""to remain as the MP for Luton South for as long as the people of Luton South will take me"" Mr Shuker, who has openly criticised Mr Corbyn, won the seat in the 2017 election with close to a 14,000 majority. ""Clearly a huge number of new members have joined the Labour Party,"" he said. ""They want to be able to choose their own representatives but I think it would be fairer for all involved if we were honest about that and said the aim here is to try to deselect MPs across the patch. ""I want to remain as the MP for Luton South for as long as the people of Luton South will take me. ""The people who are disconcerted with my performance are disconcerted based on my position within the party, not my performance as a member of Parliament."" Mr Corbyn said that the vote did not change anything about Mr Shuker's role as an MP. ""He works hard to represent the constituency and he's obviously ever-present in Parliament, taking up issues there,"" he said. ""The selection process doesn't begin for the next General Election for some time.""

Corbyn would back members on new referendum,"Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said he would be ready to back another EU referendum, if party members want one. He said he would be ""bound"" by the outcome of a vote at the Labour Party conference - although he would prefer to have a general election. But Unite leader Len McCluskey said any referendum should not include the option of remaining in the EU. Meanwhile Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab ruled out a snap election this autumn, saying the idea was ""for the birds"". The Labour Party has never formally rejected the option of a further vote, but both Mr Corbyn and his deputy, Tom Watson, have indicated they would prefer it to be resolved by a general election. Pressed on the issue on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Corbyn, who has said he is not calling for another referendum, said ""our preference"" is for a general election that would then allow a Labour government to negotiate the UK's future relationship with Europe. He said: ""Let's see what comes out of conference. Obviously I'm bound by the democracy of our party."" Brexit is one of eight issues chosen for debate at the conference in a vote by delegates But he said it was ""conjecture"" to suggest any referendum backed at the conference would be on remaining or leaving the EU, adding: ""We don't know what it would be."" Brexit is among the eight issues to have been chosen in a ballot by Labour members and trade unions for debate in Liverpool. The others are Palestine, the economy, housing, schools, government contracts, in-work poverty and justice for the Windrush generation. Discussions are to take place on Sunday evening to decide the final text of each motion. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said much would depend on whether the Brexit motion clearly stated that Labour backed another referendum, or whether it would be more ambiguously worded so it did not tie the leadership's hands. Labour's Brexit poll policy 'could be a fudge' Brexit: What happens next? All you need to know about Brexit Brexit becomes Corbyn's PMQs focus Mr Corbyn also told the programme the UK ""could be"" close to a general election. Amid speculation that Labour could force a vote of no confidence in Prime Minister Theresa May if Parliament rejects any Brexit deal, he said: ""We will be putting our case to Parliament and we will see what happens after that. We are absolutely ready for it."" He said Labour would be prepared to vote down any deal Mrs May came back with, if it did not meet a series of tests Labour has set out. This video can not be played David Lammy: ""Can you hear us Jeremy Corbyn?"" The party has made several policy announcements ahead of its annual conference - which begins in Liverpool on Sunday - including: Plans to require businesses employing more than 250 people to reserve one-third of seats on boards for representatives of their workforce to help rein in a ""reckless corporate culture"" A proposed new tax for the owners of second homes in England, based on the value of the property, with the money raised being used to tackle homelessness Plans to make employers provide up to10 days paid leave for victims of domestic violence However, campaigners are using use the conference to pile pressure on the Labour leadership to support a further referendum. Thousands of people marched through the centre of Liverpool, to a rally at the Pier Head, where the conference is taking place. Protesters waved EU and other flags and chanted anti-Brexit slogans and ""it's not a done deal"" as they walked from St George's Hall. The event was organised by the cross-party People's Vote campaign for a referendum on the final Brexit deal. Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger was among those who joined the march in support of Labour members who want the conference to debate supporting a second vote. Some sections of the crowd chanted directly at Mr Corbyn, saying: ""Hey Jeremy, take a note, for the many, People's Vote."" In a speech, Tottenham MP David Lammy asked: ""Are you listening Jeremy Corbyn?"" Highlighting that people from across the UK were present, he said: ""They are saying squarely to the leadership of the Labour Party: 'Listen to us, hear us, give us a People's Vote'. ""When we have that People's Vote, let us ensure that the option to remain in the EU is on the ballot paper."" But Unite leader Mr McCluskey told the BBC's Pienaar's Politics: ""The referendum shouldn't be on 'do we want to go back into the European Union?'"" This video can not be played Labour Conference: Can Jeremy Corbyn keep the party united? He added: ""The people have already decided on that. We very rarely have referendums in this country. The people have decided against my wishes and my union's wishes but they've decided... For us to now enter some kind of campaign that opens up that issue again I think would be wrong."" According to a YouGov survey of 1,054 Labour members, commissioned by the People's Vote campaign, 86% wanted a final, public say on the outcome of Brexit negotiations, against 8% who opposed it. But the Brexit supporting Labour MP Kate Hoey described calls for another vote as the ""last gasp"" of people who had never wanted to accept the result of the 2016 referendum. She said another referendum was likely to be bigger than the last and, if a bigger majority voted to leave, ""we're still in the same position"". On Saturday shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned people calling for another referendum to take into account the ""real risk"" of stoking racial tensions and far-right populism. The UK is due to leave in March 2019 and Theresa May has been negotiating with other EU leaders on the UK's future relationship with the bloc. Talks hit a stumbling block at a summit in Salzburg on Thursday when EU leaders rejected Mrs May's plan for Brexit - known as theChequers agreement,external, and she warned them she wasready to walk awayrather than accept a ""bad deal"". In a statement on Sunday, the prime minister said ""many in Labour, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP are trying to thwart Brexit at every step and seeking to exploit this moment for political gain"" by calling for another referendum and extending Article 50 to delay Brexit.

Iran fumes at 'bully' US after attack,"This video can not be played The moment gunmen open fire on an Iranian military parade Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has fiercely criticised the US following a deadly attack on a military parade. Gunmen opened fire at Revolutionary Guard troops in the south-western city of Ahvaz on Saturday, in an attack claimed by both an anti-government Arab group, and Islamic State militants. Mr Rouhani said the ""bully"" US and the Gulf states it backed had enabled the attack. The US has denied this and says it condemns ""any terrorist attack"". Mr Rouhani will face Donald Trump at the UN General Assembly this week. Saturday's attack killed 25 people, including 12 soldiers, civilians watching the parade, and a four-year-old girl. Ahvaz National Resistance, an umbrella group that claims to defend the rights of the Arab minority in Iran's Khuzestan Province, said the group was behind the bloodshed, while IS also claimed the attack. Neither group provided evidence to show it was involved. How will Trump treat Iran at the UN? Speaking on Sunday, before leaving for the UN in New York, Mr Rouhani vowed that Iran would ""not let this crime stand"". ""It is absolutely clear to us who committed this crime... and whom they are linked to,"" he said. He alleged that a Gulf country had supported the ""financial, weaponry and political needs"" of the attackers. He added: ""The small puppet countries in the region are backed by America, and the US is provoking them and giving them the necessary capabilities."" ""The US showed the world their bullying nature and they keep continuing their unilateral policies."" However, US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley countered: ""He [Rouhani] has oppressed his people for a long time and he needs to look at his own base to figure out where that's coming from."" ""The United States condemns any terrorist attack anywhere,"" she told CNN, but added: ""He can blame us all he wants. The thing he's got to do is look at the mirror."" The gunmen shot at civilians and soldiers Mr Rouhani did not specify which ""puppet"" countries he was referring to - but his comments are widely thought to be directed at Iran's regional foe Saudi Arabia, and the UAE and Bahrain. On Sunday, Iran's foreign ministry summoned a UAE envoy in protest at ""biased statements"" made in support of the attack. An adviser to the UAE crown prince had tweeted that ""attacking a military target is not a terrorist act"" and ""moving the battle deeper inside in Iran is a declared option"". Iran has previously alleged that Saudi Arabia supports separatist activity among Iran's Arab minority.

France dismantles toxic car tyre 'reef',"The tyres were sunk in the 1980s but are being removed again in stages Teams of divers are painstakingly lifting an artificial reef made of tens of thousands of old car tyres from the seafloor south of France, after it was found to spread pollution from toxic chemicals. The operation is costing well over a million euros ($1.1m; Â£898,000) and is part-funded by the tyre manufacturer Michelin as well as the French state. The divers are supported by a boat with lifting equipment. Fish had been avoiding the area. Local fishing association leader Denis Genovese told AFP news agency that some types of fish swam around the collection of tyres, while ""no species really got used to it"". Once upon a time it was seen as a double solution - a way to get rid of old tyres, while creating habitats for marine life and stimulating marine organisms to grow on the rubber. In the 1980s local authorities agreed 25,000 tyres should be sunk into the waters 500m (1,640 feet) from the shore between Cannes and Antibes, on the French Riviera. In 2005, researchers found the tyres were leaking chemicals including heavy metals - a risk to human life - into the environment. Tyres 'major source' of ocean pollution All the plastic you can and cannot recycle In 2015, authorities told journaliststhe tyres were thought to be ""completely inert"" and to present no risk at the time they were sunk,external. Another documented issue is that stacks of tyres can collapse or disintegrate, disturbing life in the area. A first set of 25,000 tyres was removed in 2015, with 10,000 set to be lifted in the coming weeks and more next year. The operation is costing well over a million euros Artificial reefs using tyres have also been sunk in other parts of the world. Tens of thousands of tyres have been removed from the seabed at Fort Lauderdale, Florida. Around Gibraltar in the 1970s, the tyres were washed away by currents. Ships, cars and concrete blocks were later used instead.

""I knew that it would be a fun surprise as well for my now husband, who didn't know, and he was really over the moon to find out that I would make this choice for our day together. ""And I think the other members of the family had a similar reaction, and just appreciation for the fact that we understand how important this is for us and the role that we play.""

Sarah had been left infertile by the final pregnancy five months earlier. ""Our babies were with us, and it was a little secret just for me and my husband,"" she added.

Needles found in New Zealand strawberries,"There have been over 100 reports of needles being found in supermarket fruit in Australia The Australian scare over needles found in strawberries has spread to New Zealand after needles were found in a punnet of the fruit on sale in an Auckland supermarket. The Countdown supermarket chain said it had taken a brand of Australian strawberries off the shelves. There have been over 100 reports of needles being found in supermarket fruit in Australia. Many are thought to be copycat cases or social media stunts, however. Why would someone hide a needle in fruit? Australia's strawberry needle scare widens Apple and banana in Australia needle scares The strawberries in Auckland, imported from Western Australia, were sold in New Zealand Countdown stores nationwide last week. ""We take food safety very seriously,"" the company said in a statement. ""Customers can return any Choice brand of strawberries they may have at home to Countdown for peace of mind and a full refund."" The statement said there had been no reports of any illness or injury in New Zealand, but the chain advised customers to cut up any Australian strawberries before eating them. It added that the brand of strawberries affected by this withdrawal ""have not previously had any issues of this nature reported and had not been withdrawn from sale in Australia"". It has been nearly a week since the first needle was found in a punnet of strawberries bought in Queensland. Woolworths Australia, Countdown's parent company, has withdrawn needles from sale as a ""precautionary step"". The Australian government last week raised the maximum prison sentence for fruit tampering from 10 to 15 years, and there is a reward of A$100,000 (Â£55,000; $72,000) for anyone able to offer information. Growers have had to dump tonnes of unwanted fruit. They fear the scare, which has come during the peak of production, will damage sales in an industry worth about A$130m a year. Strawberry prices have already dropped around the country, with prices in Western Australia now below the cost of production, local media reported. On Monday, New Zealand's two largest food distributors - Countdown and Foodstuffs - said they had stopped importing Australian strawberries due to the scare.

Porsche to stop making diesel cars,"Porsche's CEO said customers who already have diesel cars will continue to be served The German carmaker Porsche says it will stop making diesel cars, and concentrate on petrol, electric and hybrid engines instead. It follows a 2015 scandal in which its parent company, Volkswagen, admitted it had cheated emissions tests for diesel engines. Diesel cars over a certain age have been banned in parts of some German cities in a bid to cut pollution. The Porsche chief executive said the company was ""not demonising diesel"". ""It is and will remain an important propulsion technology,"" Oliver Blume said. ""We as a sports car manufacturer, however, for whom diesel has always played a secondary role, have come to the conclusion that we would like our future to be diesel-free. ""Petrol engines are well suited for sporty driving."" Existing diesel car customers would continue to be served, he said. Porsche did not build its own diesel engines, preferring to use Audi ones. ""Nevertheless, Porsche's image has suffered, Mr Blume said. ""The diesel crisis caused us a lot of trouble."" What happened in the 2015 emissions scandal? How electric vehicles are moving into the fast lane A German public prosecutor fined Volkswagen â¬1bn (Â£900m) earlier this year, after finding the company had sold more than 10 million cars with emissions-test cheating software installed, between 2007 and 2015. The company had already set aside $30bn (Â£23bn) to settle fines, compensation and buying back cars in the US. Porsche is understood to be developing a fully-electric luxury car, with a multi-billion euro investment. The first car ever designed by its founder, in 1898, was electric. It was rediscovered in a garage a few years ago. The company's first diesel car was sold just 10 years ago. This is the first Porsche-designed vehicle, which had been stored in an Austrian garage since 1902 First Porsche was an electric car Volkswagen: The scandal explained German car giants face EU diesel probe How electric vehicles are moving into the fast lane Half of young people want electric cars VW fined â¬1bn over diesel scandal Electric vehicle sales surge in UK New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Mike Ashley blames greed for store closures,"Mike Ashley bought House of Fraser for Â£90m Sports Direct billionaire Mike Ashley has blamed ""greedy landlords"" for the closure of three House of Fraser department stores. Mr Ashley, who bought the retailer out of administration for Â£90m, announced on Sunday that 15 sites previously earmarked for closure will stay open. But stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon will close after the failure of negotiations over cuts in rents. Landlords have hit back, saying ""each party will have its own interests"". In a statement, House of Fraser said at least 20 stores have now agreed new rental terms, safeguarding about 3,500 jobs. However, in addition to the three closures, a fourth store in Bath is also at risk of closure as the businessman negotiates with council authorities, the outlet's landlord, over new rental terms. Hundreds of staff affected by the three store closures are now going through redundancy consultation. After buying House of Fraser in August,Mr Ashley said he was hopeful that most of the department store chain's 59 sites would remain open. His Sports Direct bought all the stores, including the 31 that had been earmarked for closure under a previous restructuring plan that has now been abandoned. Mr Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United football club, said on Sunday: ""I am disappointed that in my opinion a small number of greedy landlords still refuse to be reasonable. ""We've showed what we can achieve on the British high street when we work together with landlords. ""I would like to thank those landlords who have helped us to rescue approximately 3,500 jobs at the stores we have saved to date. ""I am calling on everybody to pull together, including landlords and local authorities in order to help to save as many House of Fraser stores and jobs as possible on the great British high street."" Anger mounts on House of Fraser gift cards Mike Ashley: I've been stabbed in the back Debenhams-House of Fraser tie-up eyed Mr Ashley has previously warned about ""greedy"" landlords, saying in August that ""time is running out"" to keep stores open. The British Property Federation, which represents landlords, defended their right to negotiate the best deal. Chief executive Melanie Leech said: ""What has been taking place is negotiations between House of Fraser and its landlords - a two-party process - where each party will have its own interests and one party simply can't cry 'unfair' in the media when it doesn't get what it wants."" She pointed out that many property owners are investors working on behalf of pension funds and savers. ""There will be a range of factors to consider on a store-by-store basis but what property owners won't be doing is simply leaving stores empty for the sake of it, that would be in no one's interests,"" she said. Among the latest stores to be rescued is the one in Birkenhead, the constituency of MP Frank Field, who has clashed with Mr Ashley over his treatment of Sports Direct workers. Mr Field described news that his local store was saved as ""tremendous"", adding: ""Six weeks ago, I wrote to Mike Ashley with an urgent plea to safeguard the future of our House of Fraser and the jobs of the store's staff. ""Thanks to the positive discussions that have taken place since then with the store's landlord, this cornerstone of our town centre is being given a chance to flourish once again,"" Mr Field said. The stores at which new rent terms have now been agreed are: Altrincham, Aylesbury, Birkenhead, Camberley, Carlisle, Darlington, Doncaster, Grimsby, High Wycombe, Lincoln, London (Oxford Street), Middlesbrough, Plymouth, Skipton, Telford, Huddersfield, Leeds, Maidstone, Solihull and Sutton Coldfield.

"Iran fumes at 'bully' US after attackPresident Rouhani says Gulf States, backed by the US, enabled the deadly gun attack that killed 25.Middle East","This video can not be played The moment gunmen open fire on an Iranian military parade Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has fiercely criticised the US following a deadly attack on a military parade. Gunmen opened fire at Revolutionary Guard troops in the south-western city of Ahvaz on Saturday, in an attack claimed by both an anti-government Arab group, and Islamic State militants. Mr Rouhani said the ""bully"" US and the Gulf states it backed had enabled the attack. The US has denied this and says it condemns ""any terrorist attack"". Mr Rouhani will face Donald Trump at the UN General Assembly this week. Saturday's attack killed 25 people, including 12 soldiers, civilians watching the parade, and a four-year-old girl. Ahvaz National Resistance, an umbrella group that claims to defend the rights of the Arab minority in Iran's Khuzestan Province, said the group was behind the bloodshed, while IS also claimed the attack. Neither group provided evidence to show it was involved. How will Trump treat Iran at the UN? Speaking on Sunday, before leaving for the UN in New York, Mr Rouhani vowed that Iran would ""not let this crime stand"". ""It is absolutely clear to us who committed this crime... and whom they are linked to,"" he said. He alleged that a Gulf country had supported the ""financial, weaponry and political needs"" of the attackers. He added: ""The small puppet countries in the region are backed by America, and the US is provoking them and giving them the necessary capabilities."" ""The US showed the world their bullying nature and they keep continuing their unilateral policies."" However, US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley countered: ""He [Rouhani] has oppressed his people for a long time and he needs to look at his own base to figure out where that's coming from."" ""The United States condemns any terrorist attack anywhere,"" she told CNN, but added: ""He can blame us all he wants. The thing he's got to do is look at the mirror."" The gunmen shot at civilians and soldiers Mr Rouhani did not specify which ""puppet"" countries he was referring to - but his comments are widely thought to be directed at Iran's regional foe Saudi Arabia, and the UAE and Bahrain. On Sunday, Iran's foreign ministry summoned a UAE envoy in protest at ""biased statements"" made in support of the attack. An adviser to the UAE crown prince had tweeted that ""attacking a military target is not a terrorist act"" and ""moving the battle deeper inside in Iran is a declared option"". Iran has previously alleged that Saudi Arabia supports separatist activity among Iran's Arab minority. Both countries have been struggling for regional political and religious dominance for decades, and are engaged in a number of proxy wars around the region, backing rival factions in Yemen and Syria. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (L) and Iranian President Hassan Rouhani The decades-old feud between them is exacerbated by religious differences - Iran is largely Shia Muslim, while Saudi Arabia sees itself as the leading Sunni Muslim power. The UAE and Bahrain are closely allied with Saudi Arabia. Iran has also alleged that the gunmen had links to its bitter foe Israel. Iran considers Israel an illegitimate occupier of Muslim land - and has accused it of attempting to undermine the government. Why Saudi Arabia and Iran are bitter rivals Iran and Saudi Arabia: Who's siding with whom Iran also summoned diplomats from the UK, the Netherlands, and Denmark on Saturday, accusing their countries of harbouring Iranian opposition groups. The two sides have had thorny relations for decades. The US has accused Iran of running a clandestine nuclear weapons programme, which Iran denies. In 2015, under then-president Barack Obama, the US and Iran reached a landmark nuclear deal - also signed by China, Russia, the UK, France and Germany - where Iran limited its nuclear activities in exchange for sanctions relief. However, ties deteriorated after Mr Trump took office and then withdrew from the nuclear deal. Trump and Rouhani trade angry threats Iran nuclear deal: Key details US-Iran relations: A brief guide Since then, the US has brought sanctions back into place, despite opposition from EU partners, China and Russia, and warned that anyone trading with Iran would also be punished. The US has also expressed support for anti-government protesters in Iran. More generally, the US is deeply suspicious of Iranian activity in the Middle East - including its influence in Syria and Yemen - and is an ally of Israel and Saudi Arabia. Mr Trump is chairing a UN Security Council meeting on Wednesday - and says the meeting will be focused on Iran. Moment gunmen open fire on Iran military parade.

"British 'pharmacist who joined IS' detainedThe man, who says he is from Birmingham, has been captured in Syria on suspicion of being an IS member.UK","The man was captured in Deir al-Zour, where US and Syrian Democratic Forces are fighting IS militants A British man who says he is a pharmacist from Birmingham has been detained in Syria on suspicion of being a member of the Islamic State group. Kurdish forces captured Anwar Miah in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour a month ago. A video of his capture has surfaced on Twitter and shows Mr Miah saying he has lived in Syria for nearly four years. It is believed he is being held in a prison in northern Syria, guarded by US special forces. Western intelligence agencies are questioning him, the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville said. In the video, Mr Miah, who is blindfolded in the back of a pick-up truck, says he has been working as a medic in IS territory for the last four years. Asked if he was with Daesh - another name for IS, he replies: ""I'm a doctor. I'm a qualified pharmacist from the UK. I studied medicine and pharmacy. ""I came here to work with the general people and to help people. I've been working in the hospitals since I came,"" he says. Pressed about whether he was working for IS, he adds: ""I work in the general hospitals. They were controlled by Daesh, I can't do anything about that. But all my work was with the public."" A pharmacist of the same name from Birmingham was stuck off the UK's pharmacy register in 2014 for falsifying work records.

Analysis: Pressure builds,"Labour deputy leader Tom Watson said Labour should be ready to back demands for a new Brexit vote Two significant shifts have happened on the eve of Labour conferenceâ¦ and they both involve the party's deputy leader. So far the party's deputy Tom Watson has stuck to the official line that a new referendum shouldn't be ""off the table"" - but that a general election is preferable. While not technically departing from that formulation, he is sounding far warmer to the idea of a new referendum now that a YouGov poll of Labour party members - commissioned by the People's Vote campaign - has suggested that 86% would back one. Hetold the Observer newspaper,externalthat while he would prefer Brexit to be debated in an election soon, the members' views must be respected. ""Jeremy and I were elected in 2015 to give the Labour party back to its members,"" he said. ""So if the people's party decide they want the people to have a final say on the deal, we have to respect the view of our members and we will go out and argue for it. That is what happens when you return the party to the members."" Labour deputy leader Tom Watson with leader Jeremy Corbyn at a post-Budget rally last year Mr Watson also suggested that if there were an early election then there would be pressure to make a referendum a manifesto commitment. His views are important because - like Jeremy Corbyn - he has a mandate from the membership. But the significance of another development should not be understated. At Saturday night's meeting, Labour's ruling National Executive Committee has decided to recommend the creation of an additional deputy leadership post. Labour 'must back members' on Brexit vote Brexit: What happens next? Labour backs paid leave for abuse victims Mr Watson supported the idea of being joined in the leadership team by a female deputy, as did many of the trade union members of the NEC. Jeremy Corbyn, as I understand it, wasn't in the meeting when the decision was taken but was at a party rally. But the timing of the election of the new deputy could be highly significant. If the full conference backs the creation of the new post, the NEC will draw up the timetable for the election. And if it is sooner rather than later, that raises the prospect of a candidate standing on a platform of a new EU referendum. If they get that mandate, the pressure on the existing leadership to change position could reach boiling point.

All you need to know about Brexit,"After months of negotiations, the UK and European Union finally agreed a deal that will define their future relationship, which comes into effect at 23.00GMT on 31 December. It has. The UK voted to leave the EU in 2016 and officially left the trading bloc - its nearest and biggest trading partner - on 31 January 2020. However, both sides agreed to keep many things the same until 31 December 2020, to allow enough time to agree to the terms of a new trade deal. It was a complex, sometimes bitter negotiation, but they finally agreed a deal on 24 December. The deal contains new rules for how the UK and EU will live, work and trade together. While the UK was in the EU, companies could buy and sell goods across EU borders without paying taxes and there were no limits on the amount of things which could be traded. Under the terms of the deal, that won't change on 1 January, but to be sure that neither side has an unfair advantage, both sides had to agree to some shared rules and standards on workers' rights, as well as many social and environmental regulations. You can read more detail on other aspects of the deal, including more on travel, fishing, and financial services,here. What's in the Brexit deal? Freedom to work and live between the UK and the EU also comes to an end, and in 2021, UK nationals will need a visa if they want to stay in the EU more than 90 days in a 180-day period. Northern Ireland will continue to follow many of the EU's rules in order to avoid a hardening of its border with the Republic of Ireland. This will mean however that new checks will be introduced on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Now that it's no longer in the EU, the UK is free to set its own trade policy and can negotiate deals with other countries. Talks are being held with the US, Australia and New Zealand - countries that currently don't have free trade deals with the EU. UK leader Boris Johnson signed the deal after the document was flown to the UK from Brussels in an RAF plane There may not be new taxes to pay at the border, but there will be new paperwork, and the potential for it to cause delays is a serious concern. ""This is the biggest imposition of red tape that businesses have had to deal with in 50 years,"" according to William Bain from the British Retail Consortium. The UK says it will delay making most checks for six months, to allow people to get used to the new system, but the EU will be checking paperwork and carrying out checks from day one. So if businesses are not prepared, or do not fill in the new paperwork correctly, it could cause delays and backlogs at ports like Dover. The government has known about this for years, and has made plans to divert trade to other ports around the country and has built lorry parks in Kent, to avoid gridlock on the roads. It's difficult to predict what the scale of any disruption might be, but government minister Michael Gove has said that UK businesses should prepare for some ""bumpy moments"". Sadly, no. Decisions are still to be made on data sharing and on financial services, and the agreement on fishing only lasts five years. Also while the UK and EU have agreed to some identical rules now, they don't have to be identical in the future, and if one side takes exception to the changes, they can trigger a dispute, which could ultimately lead to tariffs (charges on imports) being imposed on some goods in the future. Expect the threat of disputes to be a new constant in UK-EU relations. The last few years have seen many words and phrases enter our lives. We haven't used them here, but politicians do use them. Here's what some of them mean: Transition period:The 11-month period following the UK's exit from the EU (finishing at the end of 2020), during which time the UK has followed EU rules, to allow leaders to make a deal. Free trade:Trade between two countries, where neither side charges taxes or duties on goods crossing borders. Level playing field:A set of rules to ensure that one country, or group of countries, doesn't have an unfair advantage over another. This can involve areas such as workers' rights and environmental standards. Free trade agreements like the Brexit deal often include level playing field measures. Tariff:A tax or duty to be paid on goods crossing borders.

British 'pharmacist who joined IS' detained,"The man was captured in Deir al-Zour, where US and Syrian Democratic Forces are fighting IS militants A British man who says he is a pharmacist from Birmingham has been detained in Syria on suspicion of being a member of the Islamic State group. Kurdish forces captured Anwar Miah in the eastern province of Deir al-Zour a month ago. A video of his capture has surfaced on Twitter and shows Mr Miah saying he has lived in Syria for nearly four years. It is believed he is being held in a prison in northern Syria, guarded by US special forces. Western intelligence agencies are questioning him, the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville said. In the video, Mr Miah, who is blindfolded in the back of a pick-up truck, says he has been working as a medic in IS territory for the last four years. Asked if he was with Daesh - another name for IS, he replies: ""I'm a doctor. I'm a qualified pharmacist from the UK. I studied medicine and pharmacy. ""I came here to work with the general people and to help people. I've been working in the hospitals since I came,"" he says. Pressed about whether he was working for IS, he adds: ""I work in the general hospitals. They were controlled by Daesh, I can't do anything about that. But all my work was with the public."" A pharmacist of the same name from Birmingham was stuck off the UK's pharmacy register in 2014 for falsifying work records. The war against âIslamic Stateâ in maps and charts Who were the Islamic State 'Beatles'? At least three other British men who are accused of being members of IS are currently in Kurdish and US custody in Syria. They include two Londoners, Shafi El-Sheikh and Alexanda Kotey, who are alleged to be members of the notorious group dubbed the The Beatles. The pair were captured in January. US officials believe the cell they belonged to beheaded more than 27 Western hostages and tortured many more.

"PPI fuelling fraud culture, says Barclays boss","Arnold Schwarzenegger's head was featured in official adverts to highlight mis-selling The PPI insurance mis-selling scandal has turned many Britons into fraudsters, one of the UK's top bankers has claimed. Barclays chairman John McFarlane said it was ""inconceivable"" that all the claims fuelling a ""flat-screen television"" buying spree were genuine. ""The percentage of fraudulent claims is enormous,"" he told the Mail on Sunday. The Financial Conduct Authority said Â£32.2bn had been paid to claimants since 2011, with Â£353m paid in July. But it is thought that the total cost of mis-sold payment protection insurance policies could be around Â£50bn,and customers can continue making claims until August 2019. ""It is almost inconceivable to think that Â£50bn was mis-sold,""Mr McFarlane told the newspaper.,external""We have turned portions of Britain into fraudsters."" And he accused the government of being complicit in allowing a PPI compensation culture to develop. He said: ""It was in the government's interests [for claimants to receive compensation]: consumer spending rose and it weakened the banks, so the government is complicit here in the decline of the City... This is stimulation of the economy by buying flat-screen televisions."" Banks have had to set aside billions of pounds to settle compensation claims. In July,Barclays blamed PPI charges for taking a chunk out of profits in the first half of this year. In August,Lloyds Bank set aside another Â£460m, taking the amount allocated to settle claims to more than Â£18bn. However, Mr McFarlane's comment drew fire from consumer groups. Adam French, consumer rights expert at Which?, said: ""This is a slap in the face for consumers ripped off by the PPI scandal. Banks still have a long way to go to restore customers' trust in the industry, and comments like this will not help at all."" And Gillian Guy, chief executive of Citizens Advice, added: ""PPI is one of the largest banking scandals in this country's history. It was regularly mis-sold, it was expensive and it was often a poorly designed product that people neither wanted or needed. ""It is right that people are able to claim compensation. The banks dragged their feet when problems with PPI were first raised and they are paying the price for that inaction."" As many as 64 million PPI policies were sold from as long ago as the 1970s. The policies were designed to cover loan repayments if borrowers fell ill or lost their job. Not all of them were mis-sold, but sales were pushed on a huge scale to people who didn't want or need them or who could not use them. The scale of the PPI scandal and its associated compensation claims has prompted concerns that some unscrupulous claims management companies have abused the system. As well as using management companies, customers can make claims themselves by complaining directly to their provider or via the Financial Ombudsman Service. One year left for PPI compensation claims Barclays sets aside extra Â£700m for PPI PPI complaints soar by 40% in six months New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

'I thought every child looked after their mum',"This video can not be played Lucy Childs said a social worker wrote a letter of support to her university making her sound like Superwoman When she was seven years old Lucy Childs thought every child helped care for their parent. She helped wash and dress her mother, who has schizoaffective disorder andspina bifida, and she looked after her younger sister. But while she was teased for being a ""mummy's girl"" in the playground, Lucy had no idea her life was different. Now 22, she admits she just thought other children were doing a better job at looking after their parents. From a young age, Lucy, who grew up in the Rhondda village of Rhydyfelin, helped her mother with simple things, but the responsibility got more intense when her sister was born when she was just seven. ""On a good day my mother would read me stories but on a bad day, I would read to her,"" said Lucy, who said she was born a carer. ""It seems silly being a three-year-old reading bedtime stories to your mum, but that's what she needed. ""When I was seven, my sister was born, and although I had begged for a sibling, I soon realised it was a lot more work than I was expecting."" Lucy received support to help her complete her studies It was only when she hit breaking point when she was 17 that she looked for help from the council and realised she could get support as a young carer. She is now trying to help other young carers to deal with the responsibility. Still only a child herself, Lucy's young life spun from doting daughter to carer for a parent and small sibling. Not that she fully understood what being a carer meant. There was no time for playing, for spending time with friends or simply being a child. Her day began early to get her mum and sister out of bed and dressed, make breakfast and prepare lunch, all before getting her sister, and herself, to school on time. ""I was late quite a lot but my teachers didn't really mind because I was always ahead on my work. ""I was a bright kid and fought to keep people from knowing what I was doing by completing homework before it was due to keep teachers from looking too closely."" 'I wouldn't be here if it wasn't for him' I was tired at school, says young carer Young carers 'hidden' from schools Lucy hid her secret from those around her, first through naivety and then through fear. She innocently thought every child cared for their parents and siblings but as she gradually realised her life was far from ordinary, she was afraid of the repercussions of her secret getting out. ""I spent my break-times and lunchtimes ringing my mum to check she was ok, that she'd eaten and taken her tablets because sometimes she would forget. ""I get a lot of negative comments for doing that. I was called a ""mummy's girl"" because I spent all day worrying about her and my sister. Lucy was doing the housework while trying to complete homework and get to school on time ""Sometimes I took days off school to take my mum to appointments. I never told my friends because I thought that's why they took days off. ""It got to the point that I just thought they were dealing with caring for their parents better than I was. ""Missing out on sleep seemed like a small price to pay to keep up the charade. My mum and sister mean everything to me, and the thought of my mum being put into hospital and me and my sister going into care terrified me."" Carers 'more likely' to leave uni Young carers advice It was not until she sat and spoke with a teacher, who noticed how tired Lucy was looking ahead of her AS examinations, that she finally opened up on her double-life. It was an immediate weight off her shoulders and helped put her in touch with the help she desperately needed. Lucy graduated with a BSc Mathematics from University of South Wales With the support ofRhondda Cynon Taff council's young carers service,external, Lucy was able to complete her A-Levels, get a place at university and, this summer, graduate with a degree in mathematics. ""I doubted how anyone could help but their intervention helped turn my life around and become who I wanted to be,"" said Lucy. ""I'm about to start a second degree to become a teacher, to help kids that are in my position, and perhaps I can be that teacher that they need."" Lucy now regularly speaks about her experience to raise awareness of the problems faces by young carers Kerris Olsen- Jones, a youth carer support worker, described Lucy as a ""crusader"" to help other young carers by speaking publicly of her difficulties. ""Lucy is a totally different character now to when we first met her. ""She was timid, quiet and socially isolated. Being a teenager is a difficult time enough but to have a caring role is a lot to take. She had massive responsibility at home but didn't even realise she was a carer. ""Now she is confident and speaks about how difficult her situation was, she hopes to raise awareness make things better for other young people in the same position. ""I just hope people are listening."" What are the pressures of being a carer?

Girl dies of allergy after Pret baguette,"Natasha Ednan-Laperouse died in a hospital in Nice after collapsing on a BA flight A girl with a severe sesame allergy died after eating an airport Pret a Manger baguette, which did not list the ingredients. Natasha Ednan-Laperouse, 15, collapsed during a flight from Heathrow to Nice on 17 July 2016. Despite her father administering two EpiPen injections, Natasha, from Fulham, London, died within hours, West London Coroner's Court will hear. Pret a Manger said it was ""deeply saddened"" by the death. Natasha's father, Nadim Ednan-Laperouse, said in a statement: ""It's a daily battle and the pain is indescribable."" Mr Ednan-Laperouse, the founder of Wow Toys company, said: ""As a family now of three, my wife, son and I are still trying to adjust to life without our beloved girl. ""Everything we say and do is a reminder that she isn't with us - her empty bedroom, school uniform hanging in her wardrobe, her holiday bag packed for her holiday in Nice has never been unpacked. We can't bear to."" A spokesperson for Pret said: ""We were deeply saddened to hear about Natasha's tragic death, and our heartfelt thoughts are with her family and friends."" Natasha had eaten a baguette just before boarding the flight to Nice Natasha ate an artichoke, olive and tapenade baguette bought from the main Pret a Manger shop in Terminal 5 at Heathrow airport, said the family's solicitors, Leigh Day.

Scammers targeting more elderly peopleInvestigation finds the number of scams involving elderly victims has almost doubled in three years.UK,"Fraudsters scammed nearly 49,000 older people across the UK in the past year, equivalent to almost six reports every hour, a BBC investigation has found. The total number of reports has nearly doubled in the past three years, 5 live Investigates has learned. But one expert said the true number of elderly victims was likely to be in the millions. Police said more victims were coming forward but admitted they were the ""tip of the iceberg"". Among those to have been repeatedly scammed is a farmer in his 80s from Norfolk, who has lost Â£450,000 over six years after fraudsters convinced him he had won Â£1.5m in a lottery. His daughter-in-law, who asked not to be named, said: ""They said all he had to do was send them an administration fee, it started small about Â£300 and then he should receive the money. ""But they didn't stop at that, obviously he didn't get his money and they kept ringing. ""It's gone out of all proportion since that initial contact."" Hidden 'shame' of elderly scam victims 'Vishing' scams net Â£1.2m in north-east of Scotland in three weeks Trading Standards teams 'struggling to visit' scam victims Police and trading standards officers in Norfolk have been involved in his case but his family believes he is now ""addicted"" to his pursuit of a big-money payout and is still trying to send money. ""I think the scammers are absolutely evil,"" she said. ""But they are also very clever in how they do it and they make it sound very plausible, so much so that it sucked him in and probably hundreds of other people."" The 5 live Investigates team asked Action Fraud, the UK police's cyber-crime reporting centre, for a breakdown of the five most common types of frauds affecting older people reported to them over the past three years. It revealed: in 2016-17 there were 40,487 frauds affecting people aged over 60 reported and 48,981 last year - equivalent to nearly six crimes every hour this was up from 25,659 reports in 2015-16 last year 1,140 victims were aged over 90 and 13 were over 100 But Prof Keith Brown, of Bournemouth University, an expert who studies scams, claimed these reports represented as few as 5% of the true total. ""It's hugely under-reported - we're talking about millions of victims,"" he said. ""If this were burglary or street crime there would be a huge outcry, but it's hidden behind closed doors. ""Over the next few years this will become the next big scandal like the dawning realisation of the scale of child abuse."" If you suspect you've been a victim of a scam you can visitthe Action Fraud website.,external Action Fraud can also be contacted by calling 0300 123 2040. During 2017-18 so-called advanced fee frauds, which include victims being told they have won a lottery but must pay a fee to receive the prize, were the most common scams, with almost 20,000 cases - including 370 victims aged over 90. Computer software service fraud, in which victims are told their computer has been compromised by a virus, was the second most common crime with more than 12,300 cases last year. Prof Brown warned fraud costs UK consumers an estimated Â£10bn a year in losses,up from an estimated Â£4-6bn annually in 2016.,external He added: ""We're getting better at blocking mail scams coming through the post and the call blocking technology is improving, so increasingly fraudsters will turn to targeting their victims online."" Lara Xenoudakis, temporary detective chief inspector with the City of London Police, said more victims may be aware they can turn to Action Fraud for help but admitted the cases they saw did not represent the scale of the problem. ""Fraud is still very under-reported, the figures are only the tip of the iceberg,"" she said. ""People are embarrassed to report, they feel ashamed to have become a victim... there's nothing to be embarrassed about. Fraudsters are so experienced now and so believable, it is very easy to become a victim and it could happen to anybody."" 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 Live, 23 September at 11:00BST - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

Needles found in New Zealand strawberriesThe Australian scare over needles in strawberries spreads as needles are found in Auckland fruit.Australia,"There have been over 100 reports of needles being found in supermarket fruit in Australia The Australian scare over needles found in strawberries has spread to New Zealand after needles were found in a punnet of the fruit on sale in an Auckland supermarket. The Countdown supermarket chain said it had taken a brand of Australian strawberries off the shelves. There have been over 100 reports of needles being found in supermarket fruit in Australia. Many are thought to be copycat cases or social media stunts, however. Why would someone hide a needle in fruit? Australia's strawberry needle scare widens Apple and banana in Australia needle scares The strawberries in Auckland, imported from Western Australia, were sold in New Zealand Countdown stores nationwide last week. ""We take food safety very seriously,"" the company said in a statement. ""Customers can return any Choice brand of strawberries they may have at home to Countdown for peace of mind and a full refund."" The statement said there had been no reports of any illness or injury in New Zealand, but the chain advised customers to cut up any Australian strawberries before eating them. It added that the brand of strawberries affected by this withdrawal ""have not previously had any issues of this nature reported and had not been withdrawn from sale in Australia"". It has been nearly a week since the first needle was found in a punnet of strawberries bought in Queensland. Woolworths Australia, Countdown's parent company, has withdrawn needles from sale as a ""precautionary step"". The Australian government last week raised the maximum prison sentence for fruit tampering from 10 to 15 years, and there is a reward of A$100,000 (Â£55,000; $72,000) for anyone able to offer information. Growers have had to dump tonnes of unwanted fruit. They fear the scare, which has come during the peak of production, will damage sales in an industry worth about A$130m a year. Strawberry prices have already dropped around the country, with prices in Western Australia now below the cost of production, local media reported. On Monday, New Zealand's two largest food distributors - Countdown and Foodstuffs - said they had stopped importing Australian strawberries due to the scare.

Comcast outbids Fox for broadcaster SkyUS cable giant wins rare blind auction process set by the UK's Takeover Panel with ÃÂ£30bn offer.Business,"Game of Thrones is one of Sky's most popular shows US cable giant Comcast has submitted the highest bid in the auction for broadcaster Sky, valuing the company at more than Â£30bn. Comcast beat Rupert Murdoch's Fox in a rare blind auction process set by the UK's Takeover Panel. The firm's chairman and chief executive said it was ""a great day for Comcast"". Sky has recommended its shareholders accept the bid, saying it was an ""excellent outcome"" and ""represents materially superior value"". The UK company's 23m subscribers and Premier League football rights make it one of Europe's most profitable TV companies. Comcast's bid,externalequated to Â£17.28 per share, beating Fox's of Â£15.67 per share. The battle for Sky: Why it matters What next for Murdoch after Sky deal? Fox had looked set to take over the 61% of Sky it does not already own until Comcast topped its bid. In July, Fox raised its offer to Â£24.5bn, but this was trumped by a Â£26bn bid from Comcast. The process has also been beset by regulatory issues amid concerns over media plurality and the degree of Mr Murdoch's influence over the UK media landscape. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said: ""Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand, and accomplished management team. ""This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally. ""We now encourage Sky shareholders to accept our offer, which we look forward to completing before the end of October 2018."" Jeremy Darroch, Sky chief executive, said it was the ""beginning of the next exciting chapter for Sky"". He said: ""As part of a broader Comcast we believe we will be able to continue to grow and strengthen our position as Europe's leading direct to consumer media company."" In a statement, Fox said it was ""considering its options"" for the 39% shareholding it currently has in Sky. It added: ""We are proud to have played such a significant role in building the incredible value reflected today in Comcast's offer."" The future of Sky has been hanging in the balance for more than eight years. The process began when Mr Murdoch's News Corp company put forward a bid for full control of what was then BSkyB. That bid was scuppered by the phone-hacking scandal that engulfed Mr Murdoch's UK tabloid newspapers and tarnished the firm's reputation. The bid was revived in December 2016, by which time News Corp had been broken up, leaving 21st Century Fox as one of its successors. The process has been complicated byDisney's deal to buy most of Fox's assets, which is due to be completed next year if approved by international regulators. In the end this epic battle was settled by a very rare three round auction organised by the UK Takeover Panel. If the sealed bids had been very close, 21st Century Fox and its new owner Disney may have battled on.  But the Â£30.5bn tabled by Comcast was 10% more than Disney-backed Fox was offering and was described as a knockout blow by people close to the deal. Both companies wanted Sky and its 23 million subscribers to help them compete against new streaming competitors like Netflix and Amazon. The victory will be sweet revenge for Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast who lost out to Disney in a previous battle to buy 21st Century. In the end, Comcast perhaps needed it more urgently with their home market in the US dwindling. But the biggest cheers tonight will be from Sky shareholders - who have seen the value of the company driven up by two deep-pocketed rivals in the auction room. Comcast will pay them Â£17.28 a share - nearly double what they were worth a year ago. What next for Murdoch after Sky deal?

House of Fraser blames greed for closures,"Mike Ashley bought House of Fraser for Â£90m Sports Direct billionaire Mike Ashley has blamed ""greedy landlords"" for the closure of three House of Fraser department stores. Mr Ashley, who bought the retailer out of administration for Â£90m, announced on Sunday that 15 sites previously earmarked for closure will stay open. But stores in Edinburgh, Hull and Swindon will close after the failure of negotiations over cuts in rents. Landlords have hit back, saying ""each party will have its own interests"". In a statement, House of Fraser said at least 20 stores have now agreed new rental terms, safeguarding about 3,500 jobs. However, in addition to the three closures, a fourth store in Bath is also at risk of closure as the businessman negotiates with council authorities, the outlet's landlord, over new rental terms. Hundreds of staff affected by the three store closures are now going through redundancy consultation. After buying House of Fraser in August,Mr Ashley said he was hopeful that most of the department store chain's 59 sites would remain open. His Sports Direct bought all the stores, including the 31 that had been earmarked for closure under a previous restructuring plan that has now been abandoned. Mr Ashley, who also owns Newcastle United football club, said on Sunday: ""I am disappointed that in my opinion a small number of greedy landlords still refuse to be reasonable. ""We've showed what we can achieve on the British high street when we work together with landlords. ""I would like to thank those landlords who have helped us to rescue approximately 3,500 jobs at the stores we have saved to date. ""I am calling on everybody to pull together, including landlords and local authorities in order to help to save as many House of Fraser stores and jobs as possible on the great British high street."" Anger mounts on House of Fraser gift cards Mike Ashley: I've been stabbed in the back Debenhams-House of Fraser tie-up eyed Mr Ashley has previously warned about ""greedy"" landlords, saying in August that ""time is running out"" to keep stores open. The British Property Federation, which represents landlords, defended their right to negotiate the best deal. Chief executive Melanie Leech said: ""What has been taking place is negotiations between House of Fraser and its landlords - a two-party process - where each party will have its own interests and one party simply can't cry 'unfair' in the media when it doesn't get what it wants."" She pointed out that many property owners are investors working on behalf of pension funds and savers. ""There will be a range of factors to consider on a store-by-store basis but what property owners won't be doing is simply leaving stores empty for the sake of it, that would be in no one's interests,"" she said. Among the latest stores to be rescued is the one in Birkenhead, the constituency of MP Frank Field, who has clashed with Mr Ashley over his treatment of Sports Direct workers. Mr Field described news that his local store was saved as ""tremendous"", adding: ""Six weeks ago, I wrote to Mike Ashley with an urgent plea to safeguard the future of our House of Fraser and the jobs of the store's staff. ""Thanks to the positive discussions that have taken place since then with the store's landlord, this cornerstone of our town centre is being given a chance to flourish once again,"" Mr Field said. The stores at which new rent terms have now been agreed are: Altrincham, Aylesbury, Birkenhead, Camberley, Carlisle, Darlington, Doncaster, Grimsby, High Wycombe, Lincoln, London (Oxford Street), Middlesbrough, Plymouth, Skipton, Telford, Huddersfield, Leeds, Maidstone, Solihull and Sutton Coldfield.

Voting begins in criticised Maldives election,"Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, the opposition candidate for the presidency, with supporters at his final campaign rally The candidate of a united opposition front claims he has ousted the sitting president of the Maldives. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih holds an unbeatable lead over Abdulla Yameen, with 437 of 472 ballot boxes counted, media in the Indian Ocean islands say. But the national electoral commission has not yet announced any results. Observers had believed the election was rigged in favour of Mr Yameen, who favours closer ties with China, while Mr Solih leans towards India. President Yameen's government stands accused of crushing dissent. Police raided opposition headquarters on the eve of the vote. Mr Solih said his win was ""a moment of happiness, a moment of hope"" and urged a peaceful transition of power for the Indian Ocean archipelago. He said he had won by a 16% margin over Mr Yameen, with 92% of votes counted. The head of Mr Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party said the result would ""bring the country back to the democratic path"". President Abdulla Yameen has voted at a polling station in the capital, Male. Rights groups have accused his government of trying to rig the election. The European Union and US voiced concerns about the election, with both threatening to impose targeted sanctions if the democratic situation did not improve. The Maldives is made up of 26 coral atolls and 1,192 islands, and tourism is a vital part of its economy. More than 400,000 people live there but its future hangs in the balance due to climate change. Polls opened at 08:00 (03:00 GMT) on Sunday, and closed three hours later than expected, at 19:00, due to long queues. By Olivia Lang, BBC News If Abdulla Yameen hoped this election would allow him to consolidate power over the island nation, it has sorely backfired. Despite the odds, the opposition appears to have pulled off a decisive win. When the provisional results came in, Mr Solih was quick to claim victory and call for a peaceful transfer of power.  Mr Yameen, on the other hand, met the results with silence. In the streets of Male, there is cautious jubilation from opposition supporters, but also unease. They do not trust the president to concede without a fight. And as the wait grows longer, that unease will only spread. The archipelago has been gripped by political upheaval in recent years. In February the Supreme Court quashed the convictions of nine opposition figures, among them exiled ex-President Mohamed Nasheed, who was ousted from office in 2012. Political turmoil threatens the 'island paradise' Maldives president faces 'removal plot', BBC learns Ex-President seeks help from India and US But after President Yameen declared a state of emergency and ordered the arrest of two judges, the court reversed its decision. Maldivians wait in line to cast their votes The move was seen as a sign that Mr Yameen - who is seeking to win another five-year term - would not tolerate any challenge to his rule and sparked criticism from Washington, London and New Delhi. Some in India, meanwhile, called for an intervention in a small, neighbouring country once seen as firmly within its sphere of influence. Mr Nasheed also appealed for Indian military intervention. As part of Beijing's push to gain strategic influence and carve out new trading routes in the Indian Ocean and beyond, it has lent billions for huge infrastructural projects in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and operates key ports in those countries, to the chagrin of India. Under Mr Yameen, the Maldives has also welcomed Chinese money for major projects and signed a free trade agreement. More tourists from China now visit the Maldives than from any other country. Analysts say that Beijing fears any change in government that could affect its interests, while India is concerned about Mr Yameen's cosy ties with its regional rival. The Sinamale bridge, funded with Chinese grants and loans, connects the capital Male and the airport island Hulhule ""India sees it all in a very securitised sense that here are all these Chinese-backed ports around it,"" said Gareth Price, a South Asia expert at the think-tank Chatham House, referring to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Delhi thus sees China's lavishing of loans on the Maldives as part of a wider strategic ambition to secure another foothold in the Indian Ocean, he added. International monitors have been barred from the country for the election, and very few foreign media have been allowed in. On Saturday, police officers searched the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party office in Male without a warrant, the party said. A police spokesperson confirmed the raid to the BBC, without providing further details. The commission's spokesman said allegations of possible voter fraud ""don't have any basis in reality"" and that the vote counting process has not changed. More on the Maldives China claims victory in India border row Mr Yameen has shrugged off accusations of authoritarianism, saying during the campaign: ""No-one will come to greet me and shake my hand, if there is tyranny."" His half-brother, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, ran the country autocratically for three decades until the archipelago's first-ever democratic vote in 2008, which was won by Mr Nasheed. Mr Gayoom was jailed in June.

The allegations against Judge Kavanaugh became public last week, after it emerged Prof Ford had detailed the alleged assault in a confidential letter to the top Democratic senator on the judiciary committee, Dianne Feinstein, in July. As the judge neared confirmation, news about the letter leaked to US media. Ms Feinstein then confirmed she had passed it on to the FBI. After days of continued media speculation,Prof Ford went on record in a Washington Post article as the mystery accuser,external, detailing the alleged assault. This video can not be played Why it can take sexual assault allegations years to come out She said Mr Kavanaugh had tried to drunkenly remove her clothing at a party, pinned her to a bed and covered her mouth when she was 15 and he was 17. Since then, her lawyers have been in back-and-forth negotiations with the Judicial Committee, trying to agree on terms for her to testify. She had asked for a number of preconditions, including not testifying with Mr Kavanaugh in the room and the subpoenaing of his friend, Mark Judge, who she said had witnessed the alleged sexual assault. On Sunday, her legal team's statement said she would move forward with a hearing despite the Committee's ""refusal"" to subpoena Mr Judge. Some Republicans, including President Trump, have accused her and Democratic politicians of deliberately trying to delay and obstruct the judge's confirmation, and urged them to push forward the process. The feelings are strong on both sides - with both Prof Ford and Brett Kavanaugh and his wife receiving threats and rallies of support over the matter. This video can not be played Alumni of Ford's school: ""We believe her"" The choice of a new justice for the Supreme Court is pivotal, as it often gives the final word on highly contentious laws and its nine judges have an immense impact on US public life. As Mr Trump's pick, Brett Kavanaugh must first be approved by the Senate before he can take his seat - but before that vote can happen, he has to be approved by the Judiciary Committee, where Prof Ford will now testify. Why is the US top court so important? Meet the Supremes - who are the justices? The Senate is made up of 51 Republicans and 49 Democrats - so her testimony on the allegations could prove key.

"Voting begins in criticised Maldives electionThe island nation's Chinese-backed leader seeks another five-year term, with India watching closely.Asia","Ibrahim Mohamed Solih, the opposition candidate for the presidency, with supporters at his final campaign rally The candidate of a united opposition front claims he has ousted the sitting president of the Maldives. Ibrahim Mohamed Solih holds an unbeatable lead over Abdulla Yameen, with 437 of 472 ballot boxes counted, media in the Indian Ocean islands say. But the national electoral commission has not yet announced any results. Observers had believed the election was rigged in favour of Mr Yameen, who favours closer ties with China, while Mr Solih leans towards India. President Yameen's government stands accused of crushing dissent. Police raided opposition headquarters on the eve of the vote. Mr Solih said his win was ""a moment of happiness, a moment of hope"" and urged a peaceful transition of power for the Indian Ocean archipelago. He said he had won by a 16% margin over Mr Yameen, with 92% of votes counted. The head of Mr Solih's Maldivian Democratic Party said the result would ""bring the country back to the democratic path"". President Abdulla Yameen has voted at a polling station in the capital, Male. Rights groups have accused his government of trying to rig the election. The European Union and US voiced concerns about the election, with both threatening to impose targeted sanctions if the democratic situation did not improve. The Maldives is made up of 26 coral atolls and 1,192 islands, and tourism is a vital part of its economy. More than 400,000 people live there but its future hangs in the balance due to climate change. Polls opened at 08:00 (03:00 GMT) on Sunday, and closed three hours later than expected, at 19:00, due to long queues. By Olivia Lang, BBC News If Abdulla Yameen hoped this election would allow him to consolidate power over the island nation, it has sorely backfired. Despite the odds, the opposition appears to have pulled off a decisive win. When the provisional results came in, Mr Solih was quick to claim victory and call for a peaceful transfer of power.  Mr Yameen, on the other hand, met the results with silence. In the streets of Male, there is cautious jubilation from opposition supporters, but also unease. They do not trust the president to concede without a fight. And as the wait grows longer, that unease will only spread. The archipelago has been gripped by political upheaval in recent years. In February the Supreme Court quashed the convictions of nine opposition figures, among them exiled ex-President Mohamed Nasheed, who was ousted from office in 2012. Political turmoil threatens the 'island paradise' Maldives president faces 'removal plot', BBC learns Ex-President seeks help from India and US But after President Yameen declared a state of emergency and ordered the arrest of two judges, the court reversed its decision. Maldivians wait in line to cast their votes The move was seen as a sign that Mr Yameen - who is seeking to win another five-year term - would not tolerate any challenge to his rule and sparked criticism from Washington, London and New Delhi. Some in India, meanwhile, called for an intervention in a small, neighbouring country once seen as firmly within its sphere of influence. Mr Nasheed also appealed for Indian military intervention. As part of Beijing's push to gain strategic influence and carve out new trading routes in the Indian Ocean and beyond, it has lent billions for huge infrastructural projects in Pakistan and Sri Lanka, and operates key ports in those countries, to the chagrin of India. Under Mr Yameen, the Maldives has also welcomed Chinese money for major projects and signed a free trade agreement. More tourists from China now visit the Maldives than from any other country. Analysts say that Beijing fears any change in government that could affect its interests, while India is concerned about Mr Yameen's cosy ties with its regional rival. The Sinamale bridge, funded with Chinese grants and loans, connects the capital Male and the airport island Hulhule ""India sees it all in a very securitised sense that here are all these Chinese-backed ports around it,"" said Gareth Price, a South Asia expert at the think-tank Chatham House, referring to Pakistan and Sri Lanka. Delhi thus sees China's lavishing of loans on the Maldives as part of a wider strategic ambition to secure another foothold in the Indian Ocean, he added. International monitors have been barred from the country for the election, and very few foreign media have been allowed in. On Saturday, police officers searched the opposition Maldivian Democratic Party office in Male without a warrant, the party said. A police spokesperson confirmed the raid to the BBC, without providing further details. The commission's spokesman said allegations of possible voter fraud ""don't have any basis in reality"" and that the vote counting process has not changed. More on the Maldives China claims victory in India border row Mr Yameen has shrugged off accusations of authoritarianism, saying during the campaign: ""No-one will come to greet me and shake my hand, if there is tyranny."" His half-brother, Maumoon Abdul Gayoom, ran the country autocratically for three decades until the archipelago's first-ever democratic vote in 2008, which was won by Mr Nasheed. Mr Gayoom was jailed in June.

Comcast outbids Fox for broadcaster Sky,"Game of Thrones is one of Sky's most popular shows US cable giant Comcast has submitted the highest bid in the auction for broadcaster Sky, valuing the company at more than Â£30bn. Comcast beat Rupert Murdoch's Fox in a rare blind auction process set by the UK's Takeover Panel. The firm's chairman and chief executive said it was ""a great day for Comcast"". Sky has recommended its shareholders accept the bid, saying it was an ""excellent outcome"" and ""represents materially superior value"". The UK company's 23m subscribers and Premier League football rights make it one of Europe's most profitable TV companies. Comcast's bid,externalequated to Â£17.28 per share, beating Fox's of Â£15.67 per share. The battle for Sky: Why it matters What next for Murdoch after Sky deal? Fox had looked set to take over the 61% of Sky it does not already own until Comcast topped its bid. In July, Fox raised its offer to Â£24.5bn, but this was trumped by a Â£26bn bid from Comcast. The process has also been beset by regulatory issues amid concerns over media plurality and the degree of Mr Murdoch's influence over the UK media landscape. Brian Roberts, chairman and chief executive of Comcast, said: ""Sky is a wonderful company with a great platform, tremendous brand, and accomplished management team. ""This acquisition will allow us to quickly, efficiently and meaningfully increase our customer base and expand internationally. ""We now encourage Sky shareholders to accept our offer, which we look forward to completing before the end of October 2018."" Jeremy Darroch, Sky chief executive, said it was the ""beginning of the next exciting chapter for Sky"". He said: ""As part of a broader Comcast we believe we will be able to continue to grow and strengthen our position as Europe's leading direct to consumer media company."" In a statement, Fox said it was ""considering its options"" for the 39% shareholding it currently has in Sky. It added: ""We are proud to have played such a significant role in building the incredible value reflected today in Comcast's offer."" The future of Sky has been hanging in the balance for more than eight years. The process began when Mr Murdoch's News Corp company put forward a bid for full control of what was then BSkyB. That bid was scuppered by the phone-hacking scandal that engulfed Mr Murdoch's UK tabloid newspapers and tarnished the firm's reputation. The bid was revived in December 2016, by which time News Corp had been broken up, leaving 21st Century Fox as one of its successors. The process has been complicated byDisney's deal to buy most of Fox's assets, which is due to be completed next year if approved by international regulators. In the end this epic battle was settled by a very rare three round auction organised by the UK Takeover Panel. If the sealed bids had been very close, 21st Century Fox and its new owner Disney may have battled on.  But the Â£30.5bn tabled by Comcast was 10% more than Disney-backed Fox was offering and was described as a knockout blow by people close to the deal. Both companies wanted Sky and its 23 million subscribers to help them compete against new streaming competitors like Netflix and Amazon. The victory will be sweet revenge for Brian Roberts, the chief executive of Comcast who lost out to Disney in a previous battle to buy 21st Century. In the end, Comcast perhaps needed it more urgently with their home market in the US dwindling. But the biggest cheers tonight will be from Sky shareholders - who have seen the value of the company driven up by two deep-pocketed rivals in the auction room. Comcast will pay them Â£17.28 a share - nearly double what they were worth a year ago. What next for Murdoch after Sky deal?

"Iran blames Gulf foes for deadly attackIran's supreme leader says ""regional US puppets"" were behind a gun assault in Ahvaz that killed 25.Middle East","This video can not be played The moment gunmen open fire on an Iranian military parade Iranian leaders have accused US-backed Gulf states of being behind an attack on a military parade that killed 25 people, including a child. Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said ""puppets of the US"" were trying to ""create insecurity"" in Iran. Gunmen opened fire at Revolutionary Guard troops and officials in the south-western city of Ahvaz. Earlier an anti-government Arab group, Ahvaz National Resistance, and Islamic State (IS) both claimed the attack. However neither group provided evidence to show they were involved.

Iran has summoned diplomats from the UK, the Netherlands, and Denmark, accusing their countries of harbouring Iranian opposition groups, state news agency Irna reports. ""It is not acceptable that these groups are not listed as terrorist organizations by the European Union as long as they have not carried out a terrorist attack in Europe,"" said foreign ministry spokesman Bahram Qasemi. Reports say nearly half of those killed were members of the Revolutionary Guard, who are under Mr Khamenei's command. Mr Khamenei did not name the ""regional states"" that he believed were behind the attack. The attack targeted Revolutionary Guard troops However Iran has previously accused its regional rival, Saudi Arabia, of supporting separatist activity amongst Iran's Arab minority. Fars news agency said the attack started at 09:00 local time (06:30 BST), lasted about 10 minutes, and appeared to involve four gunmen. The attackers fired at civilians,externaland attempted to attack military officials on the podium, Fars reports. At least one child was injured in the attack Civilians including women and children, who were watching the military parade, were among those killed, Irna news agency said. The victims included a four-year-old girl and a military veteran in a wheelchair, a military spokesman said. Local journalist Behrad Ghasemi told AFP that firing continued for between 10 and 15 minutes and said at least one of the attackers was wearing a Revolutionary Guards uniform. ""First we thought it's part of the parade, but after about 10 seconds we realised it was a terrorist attack as bodyguards [of officials] started shooting,"" he said. ""Everything went haywire and soldiers started running. I saw a four-year old child get shot, and also a lady,"" he added. All four attackers were killed, state media said. Iran is marking the anniversary of the beginning of the 1980-88 war with Iraq with several military parades across the nation. By Siavash Mehdi-Ardalan, BBC Persian There have been two conflicting claims of responsibility: one from a low profile Arab militant group in Iran's Khuzestan region and one from IS. It makes some difference. The former would suggest a resurgence of separatist militancy after a seven-year lull. If it was IS, it would represent a failure by Iran's intelligence community to prevent a second major IS attack in its soil. Iran has not provided any evidence of foreign collusion but has vowed revenge. The Saudi reaction and more importantly the wording of the US administration's response may prove important as leaders of all three countries are set for a possible diplomatic clash at the UN General Assembly next week. There have been conflicting claims. A spokesman for the Ahvaz National Resistance, an umbrella group that claims to defend the rights of the Arab minority in Khuzestan, said the group was behind the attack. The spokesman did not say whether the group had links to other countries. The 'beauty' and the horror of the Iran-Iraq war Iran voices: 'We have the right to protest' IS's Amaq agency has also claimed it carried out the attack. However the group provided no evidence that it had been involved. IS has carried out a major attack in Iran before. In June last year,suicide bombers attacked parliament and the mausoleum of the Islamic Republic's founder Ayatollah Khomeini, killing 18 people. Iranian government and military officials have pointed the finger at Gulf states, the US and Israel, with all of whom Iran has longstanding tensions. A Revolutionary Guards spokesman claimed the attackers were ""trained and organised by two Gulf countries"" and had ties to the US and Israel. The US and Saudi Arabia accuse Iran of supporting Houthi rebels in the conflict in Yemen, where Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are fighting on the side of the internationally-recognised government of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi.

"Co-op to introduce compostable carrier bagsThe supermarket chain says the new biodegradable bags will be brought in at 1,400 of its stores.","The bags will cost 5p and double as a compostable bag for food waste Compostable bags are to replace single-use plastic bags in more than half of Co-op stores, the supermarket has said. It says around 60 million plastic carriers will be replaced with the new bags, which will cost 5p and double as a compostable bag for food waste. Material is certified as compostable if it means it will break down within 12 weeks under specified conditions. The retailer said the move was a first step towards its plan to ""phase out any packaging which cannot be reused"".

Shops will continue to sell reusable bags for 10p as well as larger Â£1 bags, it added. Co-op said it wants to ""phase out any packaging which cannot be reused"" Its retail chief executive, Jo Whitfield, said: ""The first step to remove single-use plastic will be to launch compostable carrier bags in our stores.

Why it's OK to have 'bad manners',"It is common to hear complaints about the behaviour of others, but who gets to decide what good manners really are? From trains to theatres to restaurants, the rules guiding our actions in public are often described as ""common sense"". And yet the line between ""acceptable"" and ""unacceptable"" behaviour varies across person and place. Think of the rows that frequently crop up about apparently mundane issues likewhether it's OK to apply make-up on trainsor toplay musicoruse your phone in a restaurant.,external Instead of saying that good behaviour is ""simply a question of manners"", should we be asking whether it's reasonable to expect others to conform to our ideals? At their most basic level, manners are a set of shared rules that help us show consideration for other people, rather than acting only in self-interest. This meaning can be traced all the way back to the Dutch scholar Erasmus and his 1530 text On Good Manners for Children, which encouraged an end to unhygienic practices like spitting and touching food. On one level, then, behaviour policing is a way to reinforce social rules that genuinely aim to make public space cleaner, safer and better for all. But manners can also be based on majority opinion and used to exert power. For example, whereas toenail clipping in public is clearly unsavoury, arguing that make-up should only be applied in private has a less rational basis. This can be seen as part of a wider urge to control the way other people use public space. One place where manners come sharply into focus is the theatre, where audiences are usually expected to sit in silence, in close proximity. Historically this was not always the case. In the 19th Century, audiences were retrained with new rules of behaviour favoured by elites. Previously free to engage with performances loudly and spontaneously, suddenly audiences were being told how to behave - through programme notes, posters and even getting lectured by those on stage. Now a similar thing is happening again. Audiences are increasingly being shamed forbringing in food,talking, and even usingiPadsandphones. But in my study of online guides to theatre etiquette, I found that the way people view such rules actually varies widely. For example, although many people think phones must be turned off completely, others say that silent mode is fine. ""Bad"" behaviour in theatre is often met with accusations of selfishness and a lack of consideration for others. Orlando Bloom halted a theatre performance of Killer Joe to ask someone to put away their iPad, according to audience members Yet it was apparent that people have different expectations - with some people preferring a ""dignified"" event, while others want a more ""sociable"" occasion. One of the biggest areas of disagreement is where to draw the line between appropriate and inappropriate levels of enthusiasm. Audiences have been criticised for singing along at musicals, cheering and laughing in the wrong places, or giving too many standing ovations. Those attending the show Motown the Musical in London last year were asked not to sing unless directed by the cast and to""moderate your enthusiasm"" while in the theatre,external. Another problem can be that some theatre-goers are especially quick to judge those who aren't just like them. It is a point illustrated by the American playwright Dominique Morisseau, who wrote about the experience of attending the theatre as a black woman andbeing asked to ""keep it down"",external. Although everyone has a different vision of acceptable behaviour, people tend to believe their own viewpoint is ""common sense"". The word ""obvious"" came up repeatedly when I was researching how people decide what is right and wrong. Discussing theatre food bans, one person might say it is clearly ""totally unacceptable"" to bring in any food or drink, while another might suggest not being allowed to is obviously ""ridiculous"". There is also a danger that rules intended to promote consideration for others actually fail to achieve their aim. For example, expecting theatre audiences to ""go to the toilet before the performance, never during"" ignores those with Crohn's disease, who may need to visit the bathroom regularly. And, astheatre-maker and comedian Jess Thomexplains, staying totally silent is also impossible for people with conditions like Tourette's syndrome, which provokes verbal and physical tics. A response to this has been anew theatre trend for relaxed performances, which allow audiences to speak, eat, drink, and move around as needed. What's wrong with doing make-up on a train? Breastfeeding mum forced to stand on train The lies we tell ourselves to avoid giving up a seat But should we expect people to conform to social norms, even if it means they are excluded as a result? It is a question which goes beyond theatre to all aspects of public life. For example, in America, graduations have resulted infamilies being criticised for cheering too loudly,externaland ""ruining"" the traditional solemnity of the event. Shaming strangers for their behaviour has many unanticipated real-world consequences. A survey of new mothers in Scotland found that a quarter had been made to feel uncomfortable about breastfeeding in public. It is a response which could help explain the relatively low rate of breastfeeding in the UK. More like this Would a bigger house make you happier? How a 'concrete floor' could get more women into power Are our online lives about to become 'private' again? What Airbnb really does to a neighbourhood There is a clear need to be considerate of others and to conform to social rules, particularly when their behaviour is a risk to others. But deciding what is ""acceptable"" can also mean making a judgement about what we should prioritise when it comes to happily coexisting. Should it be the preferences of those who want their experiences of travel, dining, and art to be free from annoying disturbances? Or the rights of those with noisy young children, disabilities, or simply a different set of values? For most of us, encountering moments of bad behaviour is a fleeting problem. Maybe the most considerate thing we can do is to try not to be so quick to judge. About this piece This analysis piece wascommissioned by the BBC from an expert working for an outside organisation.

Graduate's crisp-packet-gown protest,"Emily Stevenson said she designed the dress to apply pressure to Walkers to change their packaging A marine biology student who wore a home-made graduation gown made out of crisp packets has used her ceremony to highlight the effects of pollution. Emily Stevenson, 21, created the protest outfit to ""send a message to Walkers"" which she said should do more to reduce its non-recyclable packaging. Campaigners 38 Degrees claim Walkers makes 7,000 crisp packets per minute. The firm has said the packaging for all of its products would be recyclable, compostable or biodegradable by 2025. Currently itscrisp packets are made from a type of metallised plastic. More on this story and other Devon and Cornwall news Ms Stevenson said she was ""not a fashion person at all"" and the dress took her ""at least 20 hours"" to stitch together using needle and thread. It took the graduate more than 20 hours to create her protest dress She wore the creation to her graduation ceremony at Plymouth University on Monday after becoming inspired by the ""ancient crisp packets"" that she found littered on the beach. ""I was a bit worried people wouldn't get why I was doing it, but everyone loved it. ""They got it straight away, and everyone was asking for photos,"" she added. Crushed car falls off transporter near M1 TV head teacher resigns over 'vendetta' 'Miracle' fox survives car grille ordeal On its website Walkers states it is ""working tirelessly to tackle waste challenges"", but Ms Stevenson was unsatisfied with its plan to be 100% recyclable by 2025. ""Between now and 2025 they will have created another 28 billion non-recyclable crisp packets. I want them to reduce the time it will take to implement their plan."" A spokesperson for Walkers said protecting the planet was ""hugely important"" to the company and there were ""a number of initiatives"" it was undertaking to reduce the amount of packaging it used.

Chloe fulfils fashion dream and film role,"On the catwalk: Chloe was proud of herself for getting through a tricky plan The girl who won hearts with her ""wear odd socks for Down's syndrome"" video has landed her first film role. Five year-old Chloe Lennon's video clocked up millions of hits back in March whenshe set out to raise awareness for the condition. Since then she has started working with a model agency and has been proving there is nothing she cannot do. After shooting campaigns for two high-street fashion stores, she has just been signed up for a film. Chloe, from Irvine in North Ayrshire, is preparing to perform in a Scottish short film this month. The casting call did not specify any disability and Chloe beat all the other candidates to the role. Chloe modelled in a show featuring the designs of former Girls Aloud singer Kimberley Walsh Her mum Jade told the BBC: ""Last Monday I got an email saying her agent took a chance with it. They were specifically looking for a little Scottish girl. No mention of disability or a disabled model or Down's syndrome. ""I had to send a video of her reading a bit of the script."" Just two days later, Jade was told Chloe was booked for the job. Jade is determined Chloe's condition won't hold her back She said: ""The agency were so chuffed at another breakthrough for disability - because they hadn't asked for a disabled actor. ""So of all the Scottish five-year-olds, they picked Chloe, not on tokenism but on credit. They liked the way she acted."" ""It'll be another new experience for her - filming over two or three days. She calls it her 'pretending'. ""I can't wait for everyone to find out all about it when we are able to reveal the details."" After starting school in August, Chloe has been fitting modelling assignments into her spare time. Chloe enjoyed the whole backstage experience Chloe took to the model life She walked the runway at London Fashion Week in the Mini-Mode children's fashion show. Her mum said she worked hard to be ready. ""Five minutes a day after school we practised her walk,"" she said. ""Chloe has low muscle tone because of her Down's syndrome and so we practised to make sure she was happy."" And it was just as intense as any fashion show. ""It was hectic, outfits flying around, children running about, hair and make-up going on,"" Jade said.. ""But it was brilliant. Chloe loved it. She knows her model walk, she stands up straight and looks forward with her model face on. ""After she came off she ran up to me and said she'd done so well."" This video can not be played 'Hi everyone, my name is Chloe' She added; ""She knows what's going on, she did everything like she was supposed to, stopped, turned the same way. She knew she had achieved something. She was very proud of herself."" Chloe will become a familiar face when her two fashion campaigns go live. And she is getting more confident by the day. Chloe has done several photo shoots now Chloe is impressing the designers who are booking her She has spent the last six months taking part in photoshoots to give her experience, and according to Jade, she has transformed. She said: ""Chloe has always been sociable but with being in this industry she has just blossomed and it is through getting used to meeting different people. ""And it's helped her speech - I can't explain how much it has helped her. From doing little audition videos, it has helped her in so many other ways in her development."" Chloe's agency - Zebedee models - thinks she has what it takes to be a massive success. Director Zoe Proctor said: ""She has the most adorable personality. She is an open, sweet and very charming little girl. ""In this industry you have got to have personality and take direction well and Chloe has everything going for her. That's why she keeps getting snapped up for things.""

'When did eyebrows become so important?',"Comedian Gary Meikle is bemused by the world's eyebrow obsession A comedian's video rant about his daughter's eyebrows has gone viral. When Gary Meikle complained about 23-year-old Ainsley's obsession with having ""bangin"" brows, he had no idea so many people would share his pain. More than fifteen million views and thousands of comments and shares later, he has become an unofficial anti-brow ambassador. But the Glaswegian funnyman still doesn't know what microblading or an Instagram brow is. It all started in early September when Gary took to his car to film a vlog about his daughter's current preoccupation. Gary and his daughter Ainsley who is delighted her eyebrows have become a viral hit In the film, he complains: ""I've got a 23-year-old daughter who still lives at home and the hardest part of that, without a shadow of a doubt, is constantly having to remind and reassure her that her eyebrows are bangin'. ""What's happening ladies? When did eyebrows become the most important part of a woman's body? ""Now it's constantly: 'Do you like my eyebrows Dad, do you like my eyebrows?'"" His rant struck a chord and the number of views started rising. Beauty influencer Thuy Le shows off what has been dubbed Instagram eyebrows to her one million followers People could relate to his predicament. Gary toldBBC Radio Scotland's Kaye Adams programme: ""I just got into the car and went on a little rant. ""What women don't realise is that men don't notice them. The only ones we acknowledge are the very small percentage that look bad. About 99% of time we don't notice them [eyebrows]. ""My daughter drives me mad. It's constant.  I just agree with her but I am not seeing anything different. ""Men don't actually care about your eyebrows."" The three-minute video exploded on Facebook and was then shared on a nationwide social media account racking up millions of views. Gary moans in the clip: ""She'll post them on Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, Snapchat. They look the exact same! They look the exact same as they did before you had them done!"" Gary is a stand-up comedian and his daughter is often the source of his best material. As a single dad, he ends up sharing all his parenting struggles with his audience.He even used Ainsley's periods as comedy content. He said he ends up knowing far too much. ""We talk about everything. The make-up, the dress sense. She treats me like her mum because I am her mum and dad. Most of the time I just smile and nod and tune in when I hear important words."" But how does Ainsley feel being social media famous... for her eyebrows? Gary said: ""She thinks it is hilarious that she's got the most popular eyebrows right now and that hundreds of people are now commenting on her social media!"" Clara Bow in the 1920s, Jean Harlow in the 1930s and Lauren Bacall in the 1940s According to make-up artist and business owner Gillian Hoban from Inverness, brows have been the focus of make-up looks for a long time. In recent years, the thick, full-eyebrowed look reigned supreme butRihanna's September Vogue cover,externalshowed the superstar with her eyebrows seemingly removed and ultra-fine, pronounced arches pencilled in their place. The UK brow industry is reportedly worth Â£20m a year. Gillian said: ""We probably notice them more than we think but only register the bad ones. ""Some of them are extreme and look like they've been drawn on with a Sharpie. ""I think they've always been important - each era has had their different style. The 20s had drawn-on and the 90s had pencil-thin ones. ""In 10 years we'll look back on these current ones as fashion."" Brooke Shields in the 1980s, Drew Barrymore in the 1990s and Kate Bosworth in the 2000s Will Rihanna's eyebrows become the Vogue?

Instagram cleaner 'making chores fun',"Mrs Hinchliffe has beefed up her online security after the hack A woman whose Instagram cleaning videos attracted more than 300,000 followers says she wants to make chores fun. Sophie Hinchliffe - known as ""Mrs Hinch"" - has been ""overwhelmed"" by the success of her quirky ""stories"". Since she joined the site in March, thousands of people have become members of the ""Hinch Army"", even helping get the account back online after it was hacked. The 28-year-old, from Maldon, Essex, has now upped her online security. Mrs Hinchliffe said her ""stomach was in a knot"" when she couldn't get in to her @MrsHinchHome_X_ Instagram profile on Wednesday, but her fans pulled together to sort it out ""within hours"". Some of Mrs Hinchliffe's favoured cleaning products, all stored neatly in baskets for ease of access Mrs Hinchliffe posts pictures of her stylish home and cleaning tips She added: ""I had so many shares and tweets about it - the Army just pulled together. ""I had messages saying that if I had to close my account, they would follow me wherever I went. It made my heart melt."" Mrs Hinchliffe, who cleans for at least 30 minutes a day, has dubbed her cleaning cupboard ""Narnia"" and names her favourite cleaning products. Dream holiday ends in 'Â£21k nightmare' WATCH: Woman's surreal make-up an Instagram hit 'Do not wee on the pitch' warning These include ""Minkeh"" - a washing up pad - and ""Dave the Duster"".

'Girl in a mask' draws out school fears,"""The girl behind the mask"" by Jessi C'artoon Jessi Crowther has autism and has for years drawn cartoons to express her hidden feelings. Following her recent move from primary to secondary education, she shared her drawings in the hope it would help other children. Eleven-year-old Jessi wears a mask to school. Her friends and teachers may not know it - but the smiling face is the mask she wears to hide her inner feelings of stress and anxiety. Starting secondary school can be stressful for many 11-year-olds - but for children with autism, like Jessi, the move is not always the ""first day full of smiles"" image many parents share on social media at the beginning of term. For Jessi, who lives in Plymouth and goes by the pen-name Jessi C'Artoon, the nerves started to build in the weeks leading up to the big day. ""The Mask was about how scared I felt about moving from primary to secondary school,"" she said. ""I decided not to hide my feelings anymore. My dad actually cried when he saw it because he said it really spoke to him. ""When I posted The Mask on my Facebook page, my friend's mum commented saying their other daughter broke down and said 'This is exactly what I have been trying to tell you guys' and I felt really proud when I heard that. I think it helped them talk about it. ""I think lots of people who are sad or upset have a mask to show they are fine, but inside their heads they have a war going on between the positive and negative feelings and it muddles your brain a bit."" ""New school anxiety"" Jessi draws on paper and also uses a tablet to create her cartoons, one of which is called ""People are far out of reach"". It describes how, when she meets children she doesn't know, she feels she is ""far away in a corner and very small, while all the other children seem to be far away and very big"". ""People are far out of reach"" by Jessi C'Artoon ""I didn't want to go to my new school and felt very nervous because lots of things were going to happen and lots of children would be there who I wouldn't know,"" she added. ""I didn't feel up to dealing with new children and the motivation in me went down. ""But it's not good to keep your emotions to yourself and not tell anyone. Instead of words I decided to make the picture."" She is keen to stress her drawings are not all negative. ""Smol Jessi"" by Jessi C'Artoon ""I want my pictures to help people. I am a rescuer. Making things like drawings, music or poetry is sometimes easier and better than talking about it and it makes me feel really good that people use my drawings to share their emotions. ""You could probably express yourself in your own ways. If you can't draw very well you could use different techniques such as sign language or music. ""Sometimes I see people drawing and I look at their drawings and understand how they are feeling because I sometimes feel like that as well."" ""There are always people that reach out to you"" by Jessi C'Artoon ""Doing this makes me improve as a person. When somebody says that they really like my hard work, that makes me realise what I am doing is making people happy and making them come out. ""We all do it sometimes, smile on the outside when we don't feel like it on the inside. We ask people if they are OK because they look a bit tired or sad, and they say 'I'm fine' but on the inside they aren't really. They put a mask on to make them feel that no one can see how sad they are. It's OK to feel sad sometimes but you shouldn't have to hide it all the time."" So how is school, two weeks in? ""I am really happy. I'm still getting a little bit lost because it's much bigger and I need to know where all the classes are, but I am starting to know my way around a bit more, which makes it easier, and people are starting to recognise each other more.
