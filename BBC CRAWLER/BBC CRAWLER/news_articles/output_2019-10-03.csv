PM: Brexit plan 'genuine attempt to bridge chasm',"This video can not be played Government ""has proposed a new deal for Northern Ireland"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he has made a ""genuine attempt to bridge the chasm"" in order to get a fresh Brexit deal with the EU. He told MPs his plan - which would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods but leave the customs union - were a ""compromise"". But Jeremy Corbyn criticised the ""unrealistic and damaging proposals"". Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the new plans were welcome, but ""fall short in a number of aspects"". Outgoing European Council President Donald Tusktweeted,externalthe EU was ""open but still unconvinced"" about the plan, and would ""stand fully behind Ireland"". EU 'open but unconvinced' by UK PM's Brexit plan Reality Check: What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? PSNI 'won't police custom checkpoints' Coveney: 'It will be no-deal if Brexit plan is final offer' The European Commission said there were ""problematic points"" in the UK's proposal and ""further work is needed"". And the main Brexit-focused group at the European Parliament said the plans ""in their current form"" did not represent a deal MEPs could ratify. ""The proposals do not address the real issues that need to be resolved if the backstop were to be removed,"" the group added. But Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven said that, despite ""question marks"" over the proposals, they represented a ""good start for negotiations"". The EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he will be in a better position to judge possible future negotiations with the UK once he has spoken to his UK counterpart, David Frost. The UK government hopes to begin a period of intense negotiations with the aim of reaching a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October. The prime minister has said the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. In the Commons, Mr Johnson appealed to MPs to support his Brexit plan - a change in tone seen from the stormy scene in Parliament last week, as BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley pointed out: Allow Twitter content?

""This government has moved, our proposals do represent a compromise and I hope that the House can now come together in the national interest, behind this new deal,"" Mr Johnson said. His proposal aims to replace the Irish border ""backstop"" in the existing withdrawal agreement - which has been rejected three times by MPs. The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. It has proved to be the sticking point in negotiations. ""I believe this is our chance and their chance to get a deal,"" Mr Johnson told MPs. But he said the two sides were ""some way from a resolution"". Mr Johnson added that the plan would mean there was no need for checks or infrastructure at or near the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. This video can not be played ""These proposals would lead to an even worse deal"" But Labour leader Mr Corbyn said: ""The current proposals would damage the whole UK economy, the Northern Irish economy especially and would undermine the Good Friday agreement."" He said the proposals ""reject any form of customs union, something demanded by every business and industry body in Britain and every trade union"". ""They want to ditch EU standards on workers' rights, regulations and consumer standards and engage in a race to the bottom,"" he said. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the PM will ""never have the consent of Scotland"" for his Brexit deal, saying Mr Johnson ""doesn't grasp the reality of a workable backstop"". ""It is a half-baked plan from (the prime minister's adviser) Dominic Cummings and his Brexit fanatics,"" Mr Blackford said. ""The proposed deal is dead before it even left the podium of the Tory conference."" Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone"" This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes. Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said there was ""genuine fear"" about his proposals at the Northern Ireland border. She said his plan ""has been denounced as the worst of both worlds"", asking: ""Will the prime minister now go to the Northern Ireland border and listen to the people and communities there or does he not care?"" A simple guide to Brexit How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Where does Labour stand on Brexit? However, Conservative MPs voiced their support for the proposals. Brexiteer Sir Bill Cash welcomed the plan and the ""indications of progress in these negotiations"". Tory MP Steven Crabb commended Mr Johnson on the ""serious intent and effort he is adopting"", saying he is ""proving many of his doubters wrong"". He said the ""constructive tone"" of Mr Johnson ""stands in stark contrast to the opposition parties [who] continue to set their face against their own voters"". But the proposals will need the agreement of the EU in order to progress. Please upgrade your browser A European Commission spokesperson said on Thursday: ""There are, as we have said, problematic points in the UK's proposal and further work is needed, but that work needs to be done by the UK and not the other way around. ""We would remind you that it's the UK leaving the EU and not the EU leaving the UK. ""And we are doing everything in our power to ensure that that exit is on an orderly basis and we are willing to engage constructively with our counter-parts but we are not going to be the ones left holding the bag, the ball or any other kind of object."" The proposal was welcomed by the DUP but other political parties in Northern Ireland and business groups have dismissed it. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said he did not understand how the need for tariff checks could be avoided if Northern Ireland leaves the EU's customs union. As well as raising concerns about the need for customs checks, he also questioned Mr Johnson's plan to give the Northern Ireland Assembly a vote over entering into a ""regulatory zone"" with the EU. He said the views of the ""whole population of Northern Ireland"" should be represented, and no one party should have a ""veto"" over the idea. Ireland's deputy PM Simon Coveney said of Boris Johnson's offer, ""if that is the final proposal, there will be no deal"". His comments were met with anger from the Democratic Unionist Party, who described them as ""quite outrageous"". DUP leader Arlene Foster called for other EU leaders to ""prevail upon the Irish government"", adding that if the UK's proposals were rejected and it led to a no-deal Brexit ""the Irish prime minister is going to be responsible"". She added: ""He will go down in history as the man that instituted a hard border on the island of Ireland"". Guy Verhofstadt, chairman of the European Parliament Brexit steering committee, told the BBC's Katya Adler that Parliament was ""very sceptical"" of Mr Johnson's plan and said it was ""not a serious alternative"" to the backstop, but rather a ""repackaging of old proposals"".

Facebook encryption threatens safety - minister,"The home secretary says that if Facebook has a credible plan to protect its users then it is time to disclose the details UK Home Secretary Priti Patel and counterparts in the US and Australia have sent an open letter to Facebook calling on it to rethink its plans to encrypt all messages on its platforms. The policy threatens ""lives and the safety of our children"", they said. They said it could hamper international efforts to grant law enforcers faster access to private messages on social media, as agreed between the UK and US. Facebook said ""people have the right to have a private conversation online."" The head of Facebook-owned WhatsAppWill Cathcart had previously posted on Hacker News,external: ""End-to-end encryption protects that right for over a billion people every day."" Facebook said it is ""consulting closely with child safety experts, governments and technology companies and devoting new teams and sophisticated technology"" to keep people safe. The letter was signed by Ms Patel, the US Attorney General William P Barr, Acting US Homeland Security Secretary Kevin McAleenan and the Australian minister for Home Affairs Peter Dutton. It comes off the back of a data access agreement between the US and the UK  designed to remove the barriers to cross-border surveillance. It allows British law-enforcement agencies to demand from US tech firms data relating to terrorists, child-sexual abusers and other serious criminals. It is hoped it will dramatically speed up investigations - previously, the process of requesting data from US firms could take anything from six months to two years. This video can not be played What is encryption? Under the new agreement that could be cut to a matter of weeks or even days. But there is one major problem - messages sent over services using end-to-end encryption, such as WhatsApp, will remain unreadable. Following scandals over the misuse of personal data, the social network has focused on privacy and it now offers encryption as an option to users on its Messenger service. It also has plans to introduce it to Instagram. ""Tech companies like Facebook have a responsibility to balance privacy with the safety of the public,"" the letter read. It added: ""So far nothing we have seen from Facebook reassures me that their plans for end-to-end encryption will not act as barrier to the identification and pursuit of criminals operating on their platforms. ""Companies cannot operate with impunity where lives and the safety of our children is at stake, and if Mr Zuckerberg really has a credible plan to protect Facebook's more than two billion users, it's time he let us know what it is."" In 2018, Facebook made 16.8 million reports of child sexual exploitation and abuse content to the US National Centre for Missing and Exploited Children, which the National Crime Agency estimates have led to more than 2,500 arrests and 3,000 children made safe. Head of online child safety at the NSPCC Tony Stower said: ""It's an absolute scandal that Facebook are actively choosing to provide offenders with a way to hide in the shadows on their platform, seamlessly able to target, groom and abuse children completely undetected. ""The landmark agreement between the US and UK on accessing data will radically reduce the time it takes for police to get hold of the data they need from tech giants to bring offenders to justice. ""It should be a hugely important step forward in tackling online child abuse - if tech giants play their part too."" There has been some confusion about whether the Cloud Act could force firms such as Facebook to offer so-called back doors to law enforcement. In a series of tweets on the issue,,externalFacebook's ex-technology officer Alex Stamos attempted to clarify. ""This agreement would allow UK courts to issue requests equivalent to US courts, but it does not grant them access to anything a US court can't get already,"" he wrote. ""Orders for wire taps of products like WhatsApp can get some data, like IP addresses, phone numbers, contact lists and avatar photos. It cannot get encrypted messages and attachments."" A BBC investigation earlier this yearfound that encrypted apps were taking over from the dark web as a place to host criminals.

The teenager married too many times to count," The teenager married too many times to count By  Nawal al-Maghafi  Warning: Some readers may find some of these details upsetting Rusul woke to find herself alone. Her new husband had gone. The marriage had lasted just three hours. It wasn't the teenager's first marriage. It wasn't even her second, third or fourth. In fact she's been married too many times for her to count. Rusul's harrowing way of life was triggered by an encounter when she was at work. She would watch as girls not much older than her in tight clothing and bright make-up came in to wait expectantly. Older men would soon come in to pick them up. “They were such beautiful young girls, I couldn't understand why any girl would sell herself like this,” she says. She herself was also vulnerable - estranged from her family and supporting her sister Rula. But despite her hardships, she had made a promise to herself that she wouldn't depend on a man for survival. When men sneaked their number into her hand, she always ignored them. One day, a man came in to her workplace and started chatting to Rusul. They talked about her past, about why she was working, rather than in school, and where she was from. She felt he actually cared. Life had become increasingly tough for Rusul. Living in Baghdad on her meagre salary was a struggle. Despite her initial vow to remain independent, she found herself dreaming of a husband - one who would take care of them both. The man would come to her place of work every day to do what he could to grab her attention. Rusul gradually developed feelings for him. After just a few weeks, he proposed. He took her to Kadhimiya in Baghdad. As they walked into a religious marriage office, Rusul felt a flutter of excitement. The ceremony itself was brief - the cleric recited a few words, asked her whether she agreed with the $250 [£200] dowry she would receive and presented her with the contract. Rusul couldn’t read, but even if she could she might not have realised anything was amiss. Within minutes of the cleric's blessing, her new husband had taken her to a nearby apartment in an apparent rush to consummate their marriage. Although Rusul was nervous, she was looking forward to finally having a proper home for her and her sister. She followed her husband into the bedroom and, as she closed the door behind her, prayed that this man would treat her well, that their life together would last. And indeed the first few days seemed like a fairy tale to Rusul. “I felt like a weight had been lifted off my shoulders. Finally I didn't have to provide everything,” she says. But after just a few weeks her husband disappeared. Little did Rusul know that their marriage had an end-date before it had even begun. It was a special type of Islamic marriage - a “zawaj al-mutaa” or “pleasure marriage” - and that it was a way of allowing religiously approved sex. Hers had now expired. She decided to visit the cleric who married them. She says he seemed to be expecting her. Mutaa marriages are derived from pre-Islamic tradition in both Iran and Arabia. Today they are sanctioned by Shia clerics in Iraq and neighbouring Iran, where most Shia adhere to what is known as Twelver Shiism. Experts say that under Shia Islam the object of such marriages is sexual enjoyment and not procreation, and that in previous centuries they took place mostly at pilgrimage sites and trade centres, where lonely men travelling long distances often sought company. A mutaa marriage is subject to a contract that specifies its length and the amount of compensation given to the temporary wife. But the contract can just be verbal, and a cleric - though often present - is not necessary to validate it. It can last from an hour to 99 years. The man is not obliged to provide daily maintenance and has the right to end the contract at any time. Mutaa marriages are not permitted under Sunni Islam. But some Sunni clerics sanction alternative variants of marriage, such as “misyar”, which some experts say performs a similar function to mutaa marriage and has also been criticised as exploitative of women. Supporters of mutaa marriages say they can be a positive move for couples who are aware of what they are doing. But their temporary form means they are also ripe for exploitation. In the case of girls like Rusul, they essentially enable child abuse. They are also not recognised under Iraqi civil law. The criminal code states that any person who has sex outside of marriage with a girl or a woman could be punished with up to seven years’ imprisonment if she is between 15 and 18, or up to 10 years if she is under 15. Rusul says the cleric now suggested she simply continue to enter into more mutaa marriages, arguing that she had no other choice given her difficulties. He took photos of her. Rusul knew she would struggle to survive for much longer on her salary, and that her lack of education afforded her little prospect of a better job. She also knew that the fact that she wasn't a virgin would make it difficult for her to find a man who wanted a permanent marriage. “The cleric became a middle man, giving me work, and I had no choice but to follow that road,” she says. She won't go into details about how much she earns, but says the cleric takes a fee from the client and then pays her the dowry. She says the length of her contracts have varied from a few hours to several weeks. “When the Sheikh [cleric] calls up and says, 'I've found someone suitable for you,' I can't say no.” Rusul has by now slept with dozens of men - so many that she has lost count - in the course of these mutaa marriages. She says the cleric provides her with contraceptive injections to ensure she doesn't get pregnant. “This is something that is very widespread. There are many girls like me.” Kadhimiya is the location of one of Shia Islam's most important pilgrimage sites. Millions of people come from all over the world to visit the mosque commemorating the martyrdom of the death, in the 8th Century, of Moussa al-Kadhim, the seventh of the 12 Shia imams. Dotted among the bustling market stalls surrounding the shrine are dozens of offices where couples go to get married under Islamic law, or Sharia, before appearing before a judge to obtain an official marriage certificate. Most couples are seeking permanent marriages. But some are looking for mutaa marriages. Despite being illegal in Iraq, the BBC found that mutaa marriages were widely available in Kadhimiya. Out of 10 clerics approached by a BBC undercover reporter, eight said they performed them. Of those eight, we had further conversations with two who agreed to approve them for girls as young as nine. It is impossible to quantify exactly how widespread the practice of under-age mutaa marriage is in Iraq. Ghaith Tamimi, a former senior Shia cleric from Karbala, said he witnessed thousands of mutaa marriages but none with children. He acknowledged that Sunnis also enter into informal marriages, but said the fact that the Shia clerics are closer to those in power means they can act with impunity. The BBC decided to investigate after it was contacted by concerned members of communities in Iraq. In the marriage offices in Kadhimiya, clerics approached by the BBC undercover reporter elaborated on their practice. “You can marry a woman for half an hour, and as soon as it's over, straight away you can marry another one,”  says one of these clerics, Sayyed Raad, who uses the honorific title of Sayyed because he claims descent from the Prophet Muhammad. He also says he can arrange a “first class” hotel suite for the reporter and his mutaa marriage bride, despite it being illegal for a couple to rent a hotel room in Iraq unless they are married under civil law. Some of the clerics also appear unconcerned that the bride in question is very young. The legal age for marriage in Iraq is 18, although judges are allowed to permit girls as young as 15 to marry in “urgent” cases. Sharia, meanwhile, says that girls are allowed to marry once they have gone through puberty. Clerics are required by Sharia to obtain parental consent if the girl is under-age. But Sayyed Raad is happy to officiate even when our reporter pretends the girl in question is a 13-year-old virgin. Instead he just advises against taking the girl's virginity. He suggests anal sex as an alternative. And he is happy to conduct the ceremony over the phone, with the girl not even present. He charges our undercover reporter $200 for the minutes-long ceremony. He even agrees to procure our reporter another girl for a later date. “I can take a photo of her and send you her photo. Then you agree with her. Then when you come back she's yours.” Sayyed Raad brings another young woman available for mutaa marriage to meet our undercover reporter. The cleric says she is available to spend the night with him for $300. When the reporter says he doesn't want to go ahead with the mutaa marriage, Sayyed Raad then offers to use her to find the reporter a younger bride. “Maybe she can find me a girl who is 14, 15, 16 years old. I will go with her to check the girl and if she's young I will bring her to you.” In Karbala, a Shia holy city 120km [75 miles] south of Baghdad, the BBC asks Sheikh Emad Alassady, the most senior cleric in the city's Sharia marriage office in Karbala mosque, whether he approves of the practice of mutaa marriage. He says although allowed in Sharia he would never officiate one. “The culprit would be sentenced to prison, even if he was a cleric” he says. But in the streets around the shrine, some clerics are giving very different advice. Cleric Sayyed Mustafa Salawi says he would be happy to officiate a mutaa marriage between the reporter and a girl the reporter pretends is 12 years old. He is not concerned that the bride is young. “Nine years-old plus, there's no problem at all. According to Sharia, there is no problem... Do what you desire.” And when contacted again, a few days later, to find out if he could provide another bride, he is happy to provide a choice of women. “They won't send photos but when you see them face to face, they're good girls, beautiful girls. If you don't like her, there will be a second and a third and so on.” The BBC later approached the clerics it had filmed undercover to ask for their response. Sayyed Raad denied he performed mutaa marriages at all. The others did not respond. Sayyed Raad had said he was a follower of Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani, Iraq's most influential Shia cleric. The BBC approached Ayatollah Sistani's office in the holy city of Najaf with the reporter’s evidence, and asked him to clarify his stance on mutaa marriages. “If these practices are happening in the way you are saying then we condemn them unreservedly,” his office says in a statement. “Temporary marriage is not allowed as a tool to sell sex in a way that belittles the dignity and humanity of women. “A guardian of a girl should not permit her marriage without her consent… and she is not supposed to marry if it’s against the law, which could bring troubles to her.” Like some other Shia leaders in Iraq, the 89-year-old Ayatollah Sistani has in the past - in a book published 25 years ago called The Path of the Righteous - written that if a child under nine were promised in marriage or temporary marriage, sexual touching was religiously permitted. In the statement to the BBC, the ayatollah’s office said: “times had changed and it had been erased from his current books”. Ali, a professional man in his 40s, is one of those who uses clerics to source him women and girls for mutaa marriages. “It doesn't count as a sin. It is available and it is cheap and it's fine to do it,”  he says. “Lots of clerics do [facilitate] it, but I only use two because they provide me with all the girls I need,” he says. “The cleric has a photo album, sometimes several girls are sitting in his office. If you like one of them, you can take her. If you don't, your second choice is the photo album.” Ali says he personally prefers girls who are 16 and older because they are more experienced and more affordable than the younger girls. The 12-year-olds, he says, are “fresh” and therefore more expensive, earning the clerics as much as $800 per contract. Rusul agrees it is the virgins that are in demand. “There are clerics who look for young virgin girls because many customers want them, they are more desired, and people pay more for them. This is happening to many girls - not just a few.” She says 20 is the cut-off age for girls working for the clerics. Losing your virginity outside marriage carries considerable risk in the country, as it is seen by some Iraqis as tainting family honour. Mona was just 14 when she was persuaded into a mutaa marriage with an older man who followed her home from school. Now several years older, Mona is under pressure from her family to marry, and is terrified her future husband will find out she's no longer a virgin. She says that her uncle killed her cousin just for having a boyfriend. She says she is contemplating suicide. “I have no way out. If I feel under any more pressure, I will do it,” she says. Since the BBC spoke to Mona, she has run away from home. But it's not just girls who are vulnerable to the potentially exploitative tool of mutaa marriages. Rana, in her 20s, was divorced by her husband after she fled to Baghdad five years ago, after militants from the Sunni jihadist group Islamic State [IS] overran her home city. When she met someone else she was delighted by his proposal. She had assumed it would be a permanent union. She didn't bother to read the contract because she trusted her husband. Even if she had, she might well have missed the fact that it was a mutaa marriage, since the contract is the same as a regular Sharia marriage contract - the cleric just writes “mutaa” in brackets, a detail that is easy to miss. “We had three of the happiest days of my life - ordering food. He cherished me. When you're broken, and someone comes and gives you hope, it's very precious.” But then her husband took her out shopping, and without warning vanished. When her family discovered that her marriage had only been temporary, they rejected her. Although mutaa marriages are sanctioned by Shia clerics, it's seen as dishonourable - essentially prostitution - by many sectors of Iraqi society, both Shia and Sunni. “When you get married, you feel secure, you're happy. He's your husband, you believe you have a future, but it turned out it was all a lie. For us, a cleric is something very special, but then you discover that this guy wearing a turban is a cheat.” Some clerics defend mutaa marriage as a way for widows and divorcees to obtain an income, as the woman gets a dowry. They also say that women have sexual desires and want a religiously-approved means of sleeping with men. Rusul says this is a false notion. “Maybe some desire this, but I don't think many people would like to take that road if they are financially secure. Why would a teenager want to do this?” Ayatollah Sistani’s office told the BBC the abuses we have witnessed are because the authorities are not enforcing the law. An Iraqi government spokesman told the corporation that it is difficult for the authorities to act “if women don’t go to the police with their complaints against clerics”. But for girls like Mona, who don’t want their families to find out about their mutaa marriages, going to the police seems impossible. There are no statistics for how many mutaa marriages are being conducted but anecdotal evidence suggests they have become more common in the wake of the US-led invasion of Iraq in 2003. The invasion toppled Saddam Hussein's nominally secular government, and ended the political and economic dominance of Iraq's Sunni minority and the persecution of the country's Shia majority. Since then, Iraqi Shias have sought redress and reversed the imbalance of power. The country's Shia clerical establishment now holds enormous sway. Though it isn't possible to verify all the details of Rusul's story, sources have confirmed that many elements of her account are similar to those of other girls who have been exploited by clerics in this way. Other girls, for example, have spoken of being given contraceptive injections. Rusul regrets the day she ever unwittingly took this path. “The moment a girl starts doing this, her life is ruined.”  Unlike mutaa marriages, permanent Sharia marriages are not outlawed in Iraq, though they do need to be signed off by a judge if they are to be officially recognised. But like mutaa marriages, they can also put vulnerable girls at risk if the civil legal system is bypassed. One cleric says that under Sharia, the bride must simply be able to “handle the sex. Sometimes that would be 10 years [old]”. Marrying off their daughters at a young age is tempting for parents struggling to look after them. “Girls are seen as a financial burden,” says Yanar Mohammed, president of the Organization of Women's Freedom. In addition, many conservative parents marry off their girls early to safeguard or protect their reputation, by ensuring they do not mix with men or take boyfriends - which in conservative communities jeopardises the honour of the girl and her family. But at the point at which permanent Sharia marriages are signed off by a court - necessary for example to allow couples’ babies to be delivered in hospital - Iraq’s law on the minimum age for marriage should be enforced. Some of the country's judiciary, though, don't seem to be enforcing the law with any enthusiasm. At Sadr City courthouse, couples gather with their parents to have their permanent Sharia marriages signed off by a judge. One of them, Haneen, is just 13. A cleric married Haneen to her husband in a permanent Sharia marriage six months ago, and now she's pregnant. Because she was under-age when she got married, her father and groom could get two years in prison. Instead they are fined just $50. The judge in the case defends his position. “The marriage of minors can sometimes be to their advantage, she's agreed to it and wants it. As you know, marriage is a fact of life.” There is a queue of fathers waiting for their daughters to get married before the judge. One of them, Sami Okaybi, is with his 14-year-old daughter. “Our young men aren't even interested in 18-year-olds,” he says. “They're looking for 13-, 14-, 15-year-olds. At 18 she will barely have a chance.” The court's social worker says she has processed 126 teenage marriages in the last six weeks alone. She predicts most of them will end in divorce, just as Rusul's first marriage did. “Only four or five will be successful,” she says, explaining that such young people cannot handle the responsibility of marriage. The social stigma attached to divorce in Iraq is significant. A divorced girl or woman can be rejected by her family. This leaves her extremely exposed, says Yanar Mohammed. “If you are a divorced woman you do not have a future, you are looked at as a tainted person. “Once you have reached that situation you are very vulnerable to the cleric who whispers in your ear that they have the solution.” When Rusul talks about her sister, her face lights up. Rula’s life has so far not taken the same path as Rusul’s, and she is determined that their lives remain very different. “She is on my mind the whole time, but I am trying to protect her,” Rusul says. “I think she will do very well. She will be the one that saves me from this life.” Some names have been changed to protect the contributors' identities.

The retirement age for women rose from 60 to 65, in line with men, and will go up to 66 by 2020, and to 67 by 2028. Women born in the 1950s claim the rise is unfair because they were not given enough time to make adjustments to cope with years without a state pension. They argued the changes were discrimination, but judges disagreed. The fight over women's state pensions State pension age to rise to 68 In a summary of the High Court's decision, the judges said: ""There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law. Rather it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men."" The court also rejected the claimants' argument that the policy was discriminatory based on age, adding that even if it was ""it could be justified on the facts"". To chants of ""the fight goes on"" from supporters, Joanne Welch, who led the campaign, said outside court: ""Where do we go from here? Well, where will the government go from here is the better question."" She referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to look at the state pension age issue with ""fresh vigour"", adding: ""We will be holding you to that undertaking."" She said she was ""rather puzzled"" by the court's ruling, but added: ""We can take this, we've got broad shoulders."" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We welcome the High Court's judgment. It has always been our view that the changes we made to women's state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds."" Up until 2010, women received their state pensions at the age of 60 but that has been rising since then. While most campaigners support pension age equality, they argued that the government was discriminatory in the way it has introduced it. The result has been that some women who thought they would retire and receive a state pension at 60 found that they would have to wait longer - for some a wait of more than five years. That resulted in financial hardship for many. Those affected were born in the decade after 6 April, 1950, but those born from 6 April 1953 were particularly affected and have been the focus of much of the campaign. In June, the judicial review in the High Court heard the claim from two members of the Backto60 group who said that not receiving their state pension at the age of 60 had affected them disproportionately. They argued that many women took time out of work to care for children, were paid less than men and could not save as much in occupational pensions, so the change had hit them harder. It is estimated that 3.8 million women were in this position, with some potentially losing out on more than Â£40,000. The Backto60 group is seeking repayment of all the pensions people born in the 1950s would have received if they had been able to retire earlier. It argues that the speed of the change and what it calls the lack of warnings has disadvantaged millions of women. However, the government has estimated that a reversal of the pension changes in the Acts of Parliament of 1995 and 2011 would cost Â£215bn over the period 2010-11 to 2025-26. About Â£181bn of that would be money potentially owed to women and the rest to men. It has said the move to make the state pension age the same for men and women was a ""long-overdue"" move towards gender equality, and had been clearly communicated to those affected. Krissy Abbott, with her dog Jazz, says she is angry about the situation Krissy Abbott was born in April 1954 so had expected to be receiving her state pension well before now. Instead, it will come in November. Mrs Abbott, from Essex, said the loss of her husband, Alan, as well as difficulties with benefits applications meant she was depending on the charity of others last year. ""The only thing I had was the food bank and some very good neighbours of mine. They knew how much I thought of [my dog] Jazz. They brought round tins of dog food for him,"" she said. ""I had a gas cooker in the kitchen and Jazz and I used to spend our time in the kitchen keeping warm. You just survive."" She said life would have been different had she been in receipt of her state pension. ""You could have had the heating, you could have had hot food, a shower, a bath, a simple thing like having a kettle and making a hot drink. It would have made such a difference. I could have paid my bills,"" she said. ""It makes me angry. It makes me very emotional."" Campaigners have lobbied MPs, and call regular public protests to raise awareness of their situation. To gasps in the courtroom when declaring the ruling, Lord Justice Irwin and Mrs Justice Whipple said: ""The court was saddened by the stories contained in the claimants' evidence. ""But the court's role was limited. There was no basis for concluding that the policy choices reflected in the legislation were not open to government. In any event they were approved by Parliament. ""The wider issues raised by the claimants about whether the choices were right or wrong or good or bad were not for the court. They were for members of the public and their elected representatives."" The judges also said there was nothing written into the law that ordered specific notification about the pension age changes. The Backto60 group has taken this legal action to demand ""the return of their earned dues"". The separate Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) group is calling for a ""bridging"" pension to cover the gap from the age of 60 until their state pension is paid.

Trump urges China to investigate Bidens,"This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims US President Donald Trump, already facing an impeachment inquiry after urging Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, has now urged China to do likewise. He said both China and Ukraine should look into Mr Biden, a Democratic presidential frontrunner, and his son. ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"" said Mr Trump. The Democrats accuse Mr Trump of dangling military aid as a way to press Ukraine to dig dirt on Mr Biden.

Mr Trump has accused Mr Biden and his son Hunter of corruption in their political and business dealings in Ukraine and China, without offering specific evidence. When Hunter Biden joined Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma in 2014, questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest for his father. Ukraine was undergoing a political transition after its pro-Russia president was forced out of office, while the elder Biden was the Obama administration's point man for the Eastern European country. In 2016, Joe Biden pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whose office had been scrutinising the oligarch owner of Burisma. In a speech last year at a think tank, Mr Biden boasted of having forced Mr Shokin out by threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee to Ukraine. Mr Trump and his allies accuse Mr Biden of acting to protect his son. However, other Western officials and major financers of Ukraine's government also wanted Mr Shokin dismissed because he was seen as a barrier to anti-corruption efforts. This video can not be played Former prosecutor-general Yuriy Lutsenko speaks to the BBC's Jonah Fisher Last week, the Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr Shokin told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Impeachment inquiry explained - in short and long form Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? When asked what Mr Trump sought as a ""favour"" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in this summer's phone call, Mr Trump responded: ""Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer. ""They should investigate the Bidens,"" he said, speaking to reporters on the lawn of the White House. ""Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,"" he continued. Mr Trump also suggested again without offering evidence that Mr Biden had ""scammed"" other countries and was responsible for China's ""sweetheart"" trade relationship with the US. The head of the Federal Election Commission responded by tweeting a reminder that it is illegal for anyone to solicit anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election.

A spokeswoman for Mr Biden's 2020 campaign accused Mr Trump of ""flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organisations"". Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield's statement compared Mr Trump's latest comments to his ""'Russia, if you're listening' moment from 2016 -  a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country"". The quote is a reference to Mr Trump's first election campaign, in which he urged Russia to find more than 30,000 emails deleted from his opponent Hillary Clinton's personal server. A spokesman for Hunter Biden has told US media that Mr Trump's $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) figure is false, and that the younger Biden did not receive any return or compensation from the Chinese firm. In 2013, then vice-president Mr Biden went to China on an official visit, where he met Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials. Hunter Biden and his daughter joined the vice-president, who had travelled with family members before. During the two-day visit, Hunter met a Chinese banker, Jonathan Li, who would eventually become a business partner. Mr Li founded a private equity fund shortly after the trip, and Hunter was on the board, although a spokesman for the younger Mr Bidentold NBC News,externalthey did not discuss any business during the trip and the fund had been planned months earlier. Hunter Biden was also not an equity owner in the fund during his father's term as vice-president, according to the spokesman. Hunter has denied meeting any Chinese officials about the business. However, he reportedly helped arrange for Mr Li to shake hands with Joe Biden during his trip to Beijing, which stoked claims of influence-peddling. This August, Republican Senator and Finance Chairman Chuck Grassleyquestioned Hunter's actions on the trip,external. He said the younger Biden had a ""history of investing in and collaborating with Chinese companies, including at least one posing significant national security concerns"". Once again Donald Trump is publicly stating something that has got him into hot water for saying privately. It's either brilliant strategy or political madness. Or maybe a bit of both. For those who believe that a president calling on a foreign government to investigate a political rival is an impeachable offence, Mr Trump has already offered more than enough evidence to proceed straight to a vote, no ""inquiry"" necessary. If an abuse of presidential power is what elevates the foreign ""request"" to an impeachable act, then a bit more digging is required. Is there evidence that Mr Trump tied Ukrainian military aid to the Biden request? Has Biden come up at all during Mr Trump's trade negotiations with China? Less than a minute before Mr Trump called on China to investigate the former vice-president, he spoke about those trade negotiations, noting that the US has ""tremendous power"" over China. How is that power being used? Mr Trump is drawing a line in the sand. He says his Ukraine phone call was ""perfect"" - and, as if to prove it, he's saying and doing the same thing again and again. If Democrats disagree, they can impeach him. And they just might. Ex-US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker has become the first witness to testify to Congress in the formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump. Mr Volker was among those mentioned in an anonymous whistleblower's complaint about Mr Trump's call to the president of Ukraine. Kurt Volker (left) resigned as US special envoy to Ukraine last week The Republican foreign policy expert was addressing three Democratic-led House committees behind closed doors on Thursday. Afterwards, Republicans and Democrats gave contrasting accounts of what Mr Volker's testimony meant for Mr Trump, with Republican Mark Meadows saying there was ""no quid pro quo"" and Democrat Eric Swalwell saying it showed there was a ""shadow shakedown going on"". The whistleblower's complaint said that one day after the Trump-Zelensky call, Mr Volker and US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, met the Ukrainian president to advise him on how to ""navigate"" Mr Trump's request. Mr Volker resigned from the Department of State last week after being named in the complaint. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had sought to block testimony from Mr Volker and four other Department of State officials whom Democrats wish to interview. This video can not be played Who is Rudy Giuliani? In advance of his testimony, Mr Volker handed over documents to the committee, including text messages with Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Friday morning Democratic congressional leaders published a letter setting out ""grave concerns"" over what they said was the Trump administration's attempt to ""normalise the act of soliciting foreign powers to interfere in our elections"". They attached text message exchanges involving Mr Volker as well as an exchange between Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and Mr Sondland. In one exchange, Mr Taylor tells Mr Sondland: ""As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign."" Mr Sondland, a former Republican donor, replied: ""Bill, I believe you are incorrect about President Trump's intention."" ""The president has been crystal clear: no quid pro quos of any kind."" Mr Sondland then suggests ""we stop the back and forth by text"". Analysis: Dissecting Trump's Ukraine phone calls Pompeo confirms he heard Trump-Ukraine call Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached but neither was convicted and removed President Nixon resigned before he could have been impeached How could Trump be impeached?

Banksy chimpanzee MPs painting sells for Â£9.9m,"The painting is nearly four metres (13ft) wide and is the largest known canvas by Banksy A painting by Banksy showing the House of Commons overrun with chimpanzees has sold at auction for just under Â£9.9m.

Expected to fetch up to Â£2m, it sold for nearly five times its estimate at Sotheby's in London on Thursday. Banksy reacted on Instagram, saying it was a ""record price for a Banksy painting"" and ""shame I didn't still own it"". Sotheby's tweeted the painting had sold ""to applause at Â£9,879,500 - nine times its previous record - after a 13-minute bidding battle"".

If Democrats disagree, they can impeach him. And they just might. Ex-US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker has become the first witness to testify to Congress in the formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump. Mr Volker was among those mentioned in an anonymous whistleblower's complaint about Mr Trump's call to the president of Ukraine. Kurt Volker (left) resigned as US special envoy to Ukraine last week The Republican foreign policy expert was addressing three Democratic-led House committees behind closed doors on Thursday. Afterwards, Republicans and Democrats gave contrasting accounts of what Mr Volker's testimony meant for Mr Trump, with Republican Mark Meadows saying there was ""no quid pro quo"" and Democrat Eric Swalwell saying it showed there was a ""shadow shakedown going on"". The whistleblower's complaint said that one day after the Trump-Zelensky call, Mr Volker and US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, met the Ukrainian president to advise him on how to ""navigate"" Mr Trump's request. Mr Volker resigned from the Department of State last week after being named in the complaint. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had sought to block testimony from Mr Volker and four other Department of State officials whom Democrats wish to interview.

In advance of his testimony, Mr Volker handed over documents to the committee, including text messages with Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Friday morning Democratic congressional leaders published a letter setting out ""grave concerns"" over what they said was the Trump administration's attempt to ""normalise the act of soliciting foreign powers to interfere in our elections"". They attached text message exchanges involving Mr Volker as well as an exchange between Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and Mr Sondland. In one exchange, Mr Taylor tells Mr Sondland: ""As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.""

He said both China and Ukraine should look into Mr Biden, a Democratic presidential frontrunner, and his son. ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"" said Mr Trump. The Democrats accuse Mr Trump of dangling military aid as a way to press Ukraine to dig dirt on Mr Biden. Mr Biden responded by tweeting: ""The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone's integrity is a joke."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A 25 July phone call between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered an intelligence community whistleblower complaint and the impeachment inquiry. But Mr Trump said on Thursday that the inquiry, which could culminate in a congressional attempt to remove him from office, is ""crap"". This video can not be played Trump calls for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens In a late-night tweet, Mr Trump added thathe had a duty to investigate alleged corruption,external""and that would include asking, or suggesting, other countries to help us out!"" Mr Trump has accused Mr Biden and his son Hunter of corruption in their political and business dealings in Ukraine and China, without offering specific evidence. When Hunter Biden joined Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma in 2014, questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest for his father. Ukraine was undergoing a political transition after its pro-Russia president was forced out of office, while the elder Biden was the Obama administration's point man for the Eastern European country. In 2016, Joe Biden pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whose office had been scrutinising the oligarch owner of Burisma. In a speech last year at a think tank, Mr Biden boasted of having forced Mr Shokin out by threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee to Ukraine. Mr Trump and his allies accuse Mr Biden of acting to protect his son. However, other Western officials and major financers of Ukraine's government also wanted Mr Shokin dismissed because he was seen as a barrier to anti-corruption efforts. This video can not be played Former prosecutor-general Yuriy Lutsenko speaks to the BBC's Jonah Fisher Last week, the Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr Shokin told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Impeachment inquiry explained - in short and long form Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? When asked what Mr Trump sought as a ""favour"" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in this summer's phone call, Mr Trump responded: ""Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer. ""They should investigate the Bidens,"" he said, speaking to reporters on the lawn of the White House. ""Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,"" he continued. Mr Trump also suggested again without offering evidence that Mr Biden had ""scammed"" other countries and was responsible for China's ""sweetheart"" trade relationship with the US. The head of the Federal Election Commission responded by tweeting a reminder that it is illegal for anyone to solicit anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election.

Defeat for women in state pension age challengeJudges rule the government's handling of the rise from the age of 60 did not discriminate against women.Business,"This video can not be played ""It makes me angry. It makes me very emotional"" Campaigners have lost a significant legal battle against the government's handling of the rise in women's state pension age. The retirement age for women rose from 60 to 65, in line with men, and will go up to 66 by 2020, and to 67 by 2028. Women born in the 1950s claim the rise is unfair because they were not given enough time to make adjustments to cope with years without a state pension. They argued the changes were discrimination, but judges disagreed. The fight over women's state pensions State pension age to rise to 68 In a summary of the High Court's decision, the judges said: ""There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law. Rather it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men."" The court also rejected the claimants' argument that the policy was discriminatory based on age, adding that even if it was ""it could be justified on the facts"". To chants of ""the fight goes on"" from supporters, Joanne Welch, who led the campaign, said outside court: ""Where do we go from here? Well, where will the government go from here is the better question."" She referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to look at the state pension age issue with ""fresh vigour"", adding: ""We will be holding you to that undertaking."" She said she was ""rather puzzled"" by the court's ruling, but added: ""We can take this, we've got broad shoulders."" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We welcome the High Court's judgment. It has always been our view that the changes we made to women's state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds."" Up until 2010, women received their state pensions at the age of 60 but that has been rising since then. While most campaigners support pension age equality, they argued that the government was discriminatory in the way it has introduced it. The result has been that some women who thought they would retire and receive a state pension at 60 found that they would have to wait longer - for some a wait of more than five years. That resulted in financial hardship for many. Those affected were born in the decade after 6 April, 1950, but those born from 6 April 1953 were particularly affected and have been the focus of much of the campaign. In June, the judicial review in the High Court heard the claim from two members of the Backto60 group who said that not receiving their state pension at the age of 60 had affected them disproportionately. They argued that many women took time out of work to care for children, were paid less than men and could not save as much in occupational pensions, so the change had hit them harder. It is estimated that 3.8 million women were in this position, with some potentially losing out on more than Â£40,000. The Backto60 group is seeking repayment of all the pensions people born in the 1950s would have received if they had been able to retire earlier. It argues that the speed of the change and what it calls the lack of warnings has disadvantaged millions of women. However, the government has estimated that a reversal of the pension changes in the Acts of Parliament of 1995 and 2011 would cost Â£215bn over the period 2010-11 to 2025-26. About Â£181bn of that would be money potentially owed to women and the rest to men. It has said the move to make the state pension age the same for men and women was a ""long-overdue"" move towards gender equality, and had been clearly communicated to those affected. Krissy Abbott, with her dog Jazz, says she is angry about the situation Krissy Abbott was born in April 1954 so had expected to be receiving her state pension well before now. Instead, it will come in November. Mrs Abbott, from Essex, said the loss of her husband, Alan, as well as difficulties with benefits applications meant she was depending on the charity of others last year. ""The only thing I had was the food bank and some very good neighbours of mine. They knew how much I thought of [my dog] Jazz. They brought round tins of dog food for him,"" she said. ""I had a gas cooker in the kitchen and Jazz and I used to spend our time in the kitchen keeping warm. You just survive."" She said life would have been different had she been in receipt of her state pension. ""You could have had the heating, you could have had hot food, a shower, a bath, a simple thing like having a kettle and making a hot drink. It would have made such a difference. I could have paid my bills,"" she said. ""It makes me angry. It makes me very emotional."" Campaigners have lobbied MPs, and call regular public protests to raise awareness of their situation. To gasps in the courtroom when declaring the ruling, Lord Justice Irwin and Mrs Justice Whipple said: ""The court was saddened by the stories contained in the claimants' evidence. ""But the court's role was limited. There was no basis for concluding that the policy choices reflected in the legislation were not open to government. In any event they were approved by Parliament. ""The wider issues raised by the claimants about whether the choices were right or wrong or good or bad were not for the court. They were for members of the public and their elected representatives."" The judges also said there was nothing written into the law that ordered specific notification about the pension age changes. The Backto60 group has taken this legal action to demand ""the return of their earned dues"".

EU 'open but unconvinced' by UK PM's Brexit plan,"EU Council chief Donald Tusk is one of several leading EU figures to question Boris Johnson's plans The European Union is ""open but not convinced"" by the UK PM's new proposals for a Brexit deal with the EU, the president of the European Council says. Donald Tusk was among several leading EU voices to express doubt over Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement plan. The plan would keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods but see it leave the customs union. But what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland remains a central sticking point. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the new plans for the withdrawal agreement were welcome, but ""fall short in a number of aspects"". It comes as UK PM Boris Johnson's Europe adviser, David Frost, is to hold another round of talks in Brussels in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has told European diplomats he still has plenty of questions about the British proposal to replace the backstop - the measure designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Europe scorns Johnson's 'unrealistic' Brexit plans What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? He has said he will be in a better position to judge possible future negotiations with the UK once he has spoken to Mr Frost. On Thursday, Mr Johnson saidhe had made a ""genuine attempt to bridge the chasm"" with EU officialsbefore time runs out to reach a deal for the 31 October deadline for the UK to leave the EU. The UK government says it is aiming to reach a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October. EU leaders face a delicate political dance, uncertain if Mr Johnson is open for deeper negotiations or is focusing his attention on a possible election campaign, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Whatever happens, she adds, the EU will be reluctant to be seen slamming the door in the face of the UK. Meanwhile, Scotland's highest civil courtis to consider whether Mr Johnson could be jailed if he ignores legislation aimed at preventing no-deal. The so-called Benn Act requires the government to ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline if it fails to either pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve no-deal, by 19 October. However, Mr Johnson has repeatedly insisted he would not ask for a delay as the law requires him to, describing the legislation as a ""surrender bill"". Downing Street hopes its new plan will replace the controversial Irish backstop provision that has proved the biggest obstacle to the existing withdrawal agreement. The backstop was meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but critics - including Mr Johnson - fear it could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Mr Johnson's latest plan seeks to address this with the following: Northern Ireland to remain aligned with EU's single market rules for trade in animal, food and manufactured goods Northern Ireland's legislative assembly to have the right to decide every four years if it wants to continue to apply EU legislation to traded goods Northern Ireland to leave EU's customs union alongside rest of UK in 2021 Customs checks on goods traded between UK and EU to be ""decentralised"", with electronic paperwork and ""small number"" of physical checks away from border itself Read more:How does the border plan differ from the backstop? The new UK proposals envisage two borders - one between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and a second between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, says the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler. EU negotiators say they have already identified problems with the plans, including the continuing failure to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and the threat to the single market. Donald Tusk reacted in a tweet, after speaking to Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar, who is seen as key to agreeing to a withdrawal deal. Allow Twitter content?

For his part, Mr Varadkar voiced concerns over the customs proposals, questioning how Northern Ireland and Ireland could operate under different customs systems without the need for physical checkpoints. He also questioned the plan to give Northern Ireland's Assembly a veto over entering into a ""regulatory zone"" with the EU, without the involvement of Ireland or the EU. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says he wants further discussions with his UK counterpart before making a judgement on the plans The UK has made some progress but ""further work is needed"", European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said. Accepting the current proposals would not meet the objectives of the backstop including preventing a hard border, he added. Meanwhile, the European parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, called the plans ""unworkable"". In an interview with the BBC, Mr Verhofstadt said the plan represented ""a repackaging of old ideas"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.

What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?,"Boris Johnson hasoutlined his plan to the European Union (EU),externalto avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the plan ""removes the so-called backstop"". The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU. It is designed to avoid any physical border infrastructure, which it is feared would bring back memories of the Troubles, after Brexit. It would keep the UK in the same customs territory as the EU, and Northern Ireland closely tied to EU regulations - until the UK and the EU reach a trade deal. But it would stop the UK striking its own trade deals, which is why so many Conservative MPs, including Mr Johnson, oppose the backstop. So, what is his alternative? The government wants the UK to leave the EU customs union. This would mean Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ending up in two different customs territories. This means lorries entering the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland will need to complete customs declarations. This is to ensure the correct tariffs (tax on imports) are paid when UK goods enter the EU customs union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Reality Check's Chris Morris:From the beginning the EU has struggled to see how Ireland and Northern Ireland can exist in different customs territories while keeping the border as open as it is now under all circumstances. They will argue that - in the absence of a future free trade deal - this proposal means the UK is breaking commitments it has made about the border. The UK counters that the backstop has already been rejected in Parliament three times, and something needs to change. Instead of installing customs posts and other physical infrastructure at the Irish border, the UK says declarations should be done electronically. The government says physical checks would still be needed ""on a very small proportion of movements"". Currently, about one in 100 consignments entering the EU customs union are inspected to check that the goods match the information on the declaration. These inspections could be carried out at warehouses or ""designated locations, which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland."" The government's proposal does not spell out what these ""designated locations"" would look like, but it adds there should be ""a firm commitment (by both parties) never to conduct checks at the border in future"". Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? If adopted, a border solution relying on technology and remote checks would be a first. The EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has previously rejected a customs solution that relies on technology. Back in January, Sabine Weyand, the EU's director-general for trade, said: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" The government says that some small traders should be exempt from paying duty. However, the document does not address smuggling head on. In other words, what will be done to detect and prevent traders, who should be paying duty, from crossing the border without completing custom declarations first? Reality Check's Chris Morris:The EU will see much of this as a rehash of previous ideas that it doesn't think will work. And many people will worry that unspecified ""designated locations"" could become targets for anyone seeking to undermine the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU will push back hard against suggestions that it needs to revise its own customs rules to suit the UK. When it comes to the regulation of goods, Northern Ireland would keep to the rules of the EU's single market, rather than UK rules. That removes the need for product standard and safety checks on goods at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it creates the need for checks between the rest of the UK - which will not be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland.. All agricultural, food or animal products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will have to go through a Border Inspection Post. That's a bit of infrastructure where goods can be physically examined and paperwork checked. Manufactured goods in Northern Ireland would also have to keep to EU rules, and these goods would be checked ""at the boundary of the zone"" - presumably at crossings between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, on the Irish Sea. Reality Check's Chris Morris:This is quite a big concession from the UK side - basically accepting that there would have to be quite intrusive checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for a number of years, on things like product standards and food safety. The EU has always said there have to be checks carried out somewhere, and both sides will try to deny any suggestion that this amounts to a new border in the Irish Sea. Having Northern Ireland following EU rules for the production of goods over which it has no say is, as the document says, ""a significant democratic problem"". As a result, it is proposed that the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to sign off on the plan before it takes effect. The Northern Irish institutions will be asked to approve the plan again every four years, and if they do not then Northern Ireland would stop following EU rules one year later. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not met since early 2017. Reality Check's Chris Morris:The issue of democratic legitimacy is a crucial one, but it cannot be applied unevenly. The EU is likely to have a problem with anything which suggests that only Northern Ireland could have - in effect - a veto on this plan. The point of the backstop was to provide a legal guarantee to keep an open border under all circumstances. Being subject to approval every four years simply isn't the same thing. If Northern Ireland voted to leave this arrangement things like checks on food safety would have to take place at the Irish border. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Europe scorns Johnson's 'unrealistic' Brexit plans,"The story is making the front pages of many newspapers in the region Irish newspapers are resoundingly unimpressed with Boris Johnson's proposed Brexit deal and many commentators in Europe are similarly dismissive of it. Several say the UK prime minister's description of the Irish border issue as a ""technical"" one shows a lack of sensitivity to its political meaning. Many believe his plans have less to do with formulating a realistic agreement and more to do with preparing for a general election. Some are frustrated at what they perceive to be the deliberate opacity of Mr Johnson's intentions. Broadly, the view is that the chances of a no-deal Brexit are increasing. Mr Johnson's proposals are ""unrealistic and unworkable"",external, says the Irish Times. ""A customs border would require checks, infrastructure and a much higher level of policing and monitoring than currently takes place... interventions of this kind would be toxic politically,"" the paper says. ""The prime minister and those around him have anticipated that this offer will be rejected and their primary objective in framing it in such a manner is their own domestic political advantage,"" it adds. The Irish Independent, meanwhile, saysMr Johnson's plan for Brexit ""asks too much and delivers far too little"",external. ""Surrendering something tried, trusted and secure, for something that could result in a permanent Border does not seem a reasonable demand. ""There will have to be more talking. But the art of conversation is the art of hearing as well as of being heard,"" it concludes. See also:What is Boris Johnson's plan to avoid a hard Irish border? The view from elsewhere in Europe is not dissimilar. ""Have you read it yourself?"" asks Brussels, in this cartoon from Latvia's Dienas Bizness ""Boris Johnson's new Brexit proposal is... equally bad for all,external,"" says a commentator in Germany's SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung. Another writer in Handelsblatt says the proposals showthe prime minister ""does not really want a deal"",external. ""By making impossible demands on the EU, he shatters any chance of reaching an agreement. The fact that Johnson now forces the EU to customs controls should be perceived as a provocation,"" the article says. Italy's La Repubblica also calls his proposal ""a provocation"", sayingit could be ""an attempt to exasperate the EU,externaland to have doors slammed in his face, just as he would prefer"". His deal ""gives a small region [Northern Ireland] a veto power,external. It is almost impossible to expect the EU - and Ireland in particular - to agree to this,"" says Lithuania's news website 15min. ""It is not an accident that Boris Johnson presented his alternative to the Irish backstop during today's [2 October] conference of the Conservative Party,"" says a commentary in Poland's Gazeta Wyborcza. ""He is gearing up not for a compromise but for elections,external."" The article believes Mr Johnson will try to avoid delaying Brexit. ""This would mean a war with Brussels, the British parliament and neighbours in order to finally become a political martyr in the struggle for Brexit."" There is some sympathy for Mr Johnson's plans in Hungary's right-wing 888 website, though, which reports it with the headline ""The Brits finally grew a gourd,externaland gave an ultimatum to Brussels"". ""Boris Johnson, the lover of contradictions"" - French daily Liberation One writer in France's Liberation newspaper notes that Mr Johnson describes the Irish border as a ""technical"" issue although ""the stakes are much deeper and more complicated"". ""It is a question of politics, of peace, of identity,,externalof preserving the integrity of the single market and... of the very survival of the EU,"" the writer says. European leaders ""are all carefully speaking about steps in the right direction...Europe wants to avoid at any cost Johnson being able to blame [it] for a hard Brexit,external"", notes Belgium's De Standaard. ""Nobody in Brussels believes that enough time remains to negotiate a serious alternative to the backstop,external. Almost everybody agrees that even if a compromise acceptable for the EU were reached, Johnson would be unable to push it through parliament,"" says Italy's Il Foglio. ""It is also not possible to know what Johnson is thinking,external, who is ideologically neutral and for whom Brexit is nothing more than a path of the least resistance discovered on the way to power,"" says Spain's La Vanguardia. ""Premier Johnson is going to war with the EU and the British parliament"" says this Polish daily ""Hard Brexit now looks unavoidable,external,"" says the Polish Rzeczpospolita. And nations do not have confidence that Mr Johnson will seek an extension if no deal can be agreed before his Brexit deadline of 31 October. ""Boris Johnson seems prepared to defy the law,externalto try to force a 'no-deal' Brexit,"" says Sweden's Dagens Nyheter. ""Whether the text is passed or not,"" says France's Le Parisien, ""he would finally be able to escape the impasse he is trapped in,external: betray his promise to leave the EU... or trample on the law obliging him to ask for a delay"".

'Locum MP' to cover Stella Creasy maternityThe stand-in will do the Labour MP's constituency work - but will not sit in the Commons or vote.UK Politics,"The UK's first ""locum MP"" is to provide maternity cover for pregnant MP Stella Creasy in her constituency. An advert says the role has an annual salary of Â£50,000 pro rata and is ""rooted in Walthamstow not Westminster"". The ""locum MP"" will cover constituency work over seven months and will not sit in the Commons or vote. Ipsa - the body which regulates MPs' pay - says it provides extra funding for all MPs' offices to cover absences. MPs themselves are paid in full for the whole period of leave. Creasy 'forced to choose to be MP or mum' 'Maternity leave is hard and lonely' New mothers 'need better job protection' Anti-abortion posters targeting MP to be pulled The locum MP will represent Labour MP Ms Creasy - who has previously spoken out about the maternity rights of MPs - in constituency surgeries, at events and visits and will answer queries from constituents. Locum is a word most often used in the medical profession to describe a doctor who is covering the duties of another physician while they are ill or absent from work for some other reason. The ""locum MP"" advert says in ""the last few years alone"" Ms Creasy, who represents Walthamstow, in North London, has answered more than 133,000 queries, in addition to her staff. It adds that the role will begin in November and will ""play a key role"" in ensuring Ms Creasy's campaigns progress until May 2020. She will be represented in Parliamentary votes via a proxy - an MP who is allowed to vote on a colleagues' behalf. MPs have previously arranged unofficial cover for their constituency work through their staff or colleagues. Ms Creasy said: ""If the place that makes the law doesn't recognise the value of ensuring cover for the duties of MPs, then how can it advocate for the millions of parents across the country worried that if they take time out to care for newborn children they will suffer? ""As yet Parliament has still to get its act together to come up with a policy on this area and has not yet even begun to consult on the issue as promised, but this post means residents in Walthamstow can be confident that when my child is born they will still have someone to take up their cases with ministers, local public services and an advocate for the causes they care about."" In June, Ms Creasywrote in the Guardian,externalthat she was being ""forced to choose between being an MP and a mum"" because Ipsa does not automatically provide paid cover for MPs on parental leave. Responding to the general issue rather than Ms Creasy's specific case, Ipsa's chairwoman Ruth Evans said: ""To provide MPs with extra money, Ipsa asks for an explanation to be provided of how the additional money would be spent. ""We support proposals to allow maternity cover for MPs, and this would be for the House of Commons to take forward. ""In the last few years, we have more than doubled the funding available for MPs' dependants to support family life and will continue to strive to modernise our rules."" In January,MPs backed a year-long trialto allow MPs who were about to give birth or had recently become a parent to nominate another MP to vote on their behalf in the Commons. Ipsa said that during the pilot it will pre-approve any applications for staff cover for MPs' parliamentary functions during their period of parental leave - and then consider creating a new budget to put the scheme on a permanent footing. The debate over Parliament's rules was reignited earlier this year when Labour MP Tulip Siddiq delayed a Caesarean section to attend a vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal.

Las Vegas shooting victims reach $735m settlement,"More than 800 people were injured in the attack Victims of the 2017 Las Vegas shooting have reached a settlement of at least $735m (Â£592m) from MGM Resorts. The chain owns the Mandalay Bay Hotel, from where the gunman killed 58 people and wounded hundreds more before killing himself in October 2017. The victims were attending a country music festival at a venue across from the hotel, also owned by MGM. It remains the single deadliest mass shooting committed by an individual in US history. Outrage at the killing led to a ban on bump stocks - devices that make rifles fire like machine guns. Las Vegas shooting - what we know 'I'm no hero, but I had to go back in' Olympics 'a special dream after shooting' ""While nothing will be able to bring back the lives lost or undo the horrors so many suffered on that day, this settlement will provide fair compensation for thousands of victims and their families,"" said Robert Eglet, a lawyer for the victims. Jim Murren, Chairman of MGM Resorts, said their aim was always to ""resolve these matters so our community and the victims and their families can move forward in the healing process"". ""We have always believed that prolonged litigation around these matters is in no-one's best interest.""

"EU 'open but unconvinced' by UK PM's Brexit planBritain's latest proposals for leaving the EU fall short of what is required to get a deal, the bloc's leaders say.Europe","EU Council chief Donald Tusk is one of several leading EU figures to question Boris Johnson's plans The European Union is ""open but not convinced"" by the UK PM's new proposals for a Brexit deal with the EU, the president of the European Council says. Donald Tusk was among several leading EU voices to express doubt over Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement plan. The plan would keep Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods but see it leave the customs union. But what happens to the border between Northern Ireland and Ireland remains a central sticking point. Irish PM Leo Varadkar said the new plans for the withdrawal agreement were welcome, but ""fall short in a number of aspects"". It comes as UK PM Boris Johnson's Europe adviser, David Frost, is to hold another round of talks in Brussels in a bid to break the Brexit deadlock. The EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has told European diplomats he still has plenty of questions about the British proposal to replace the backstop - the measure designed to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. Europe scorns Johnson's 'unrealistic' Brexit plans What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? He has said he will be in a better position to judge possible future negotiations with the UK once he has spoken to Mr Frost. On Thursday, Mr Johnson saidhe had made a ""genuine attempt to bridge the chasm"" with EU officialsbefore time runs out to reach a deal for the 31 October deadline for the UK to leave the EU. The UK government says it is aiming to reach a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October. EU leaders face a delicate political dance, uncertain if Mr Johnson is open for deeper negotiations or is focusing his attention on a possible election campaign, the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. Whatever happens, she adds, the EU will be reluctant to be seen slamming the door in the face of the UK. Meanwhile, Scotland's highest civil courtis to consider whether Mr Johnson could be jailed if he ignores legislation aimed at preventing no-deal. The so-called Benn Act requires the government to ask the EU for an extension to the Brexit deadline if it fails to either pass a deal in Parliament, or get MPs to approve no-deal, by 19 October. However, Mr Johnson has repeatedly insisted he would not ask for a delay as the law requires him to, describing the legislation as a ""surrender bill"". Downing Street hopes its new plan will replace the controversial Irish backstop provision that has proved the biggest obstacle to the existing withdrawal agreement. The backstop was meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but critics - including Mr Johnson - fear it could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Mr Johnson's latest plan seeks to address this with the following: Northern Ireland to remain aligned with EU's single market rules for trade in animal, food and manufactured goods Northern Ireland's legislative assembly to have the right to decide every four years if it wants to continue to apply EU legislation to traded goods Northern Ireland to leave EU's customs union alongside rest of UK in 2021 Customs checks on goods traded between UK and EU to be ""decentralised"", with electronic paperwork and ""small number"" of physical checks away from border itself Read more:How does the border plan differ from the backstop? The new UK proposals envisage two borders - one between Northern Ireland and Ireland, and a second between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, says the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler. EU negotiators say they have already identified problems with the plans, including the continuing failure to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland and the threat to the single market. Donald Tusk reacted in a tweet, after speaking to Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar, who is seen as key to agreeing to a withdrawal deal. Allow Twitter content?

For his part, Mr Varadkar voiced concerns over the customs proposals, questioning how Northern Ireland and Ireland could operate under different customs systems without the need for physical checkpoints. He also questioned the plan to give Northern Ireland's Assembly a veto over entering into a ""regulatory zone"" with the EU, without the involvement of Ireland or the EU. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier says he wants further discussions with his UK counterpart before making a judgement on the plans The UK has made some progress but ""further work is needed"", European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said. Accepting the current proposals would not meet the objectives of the backstop including preventing a hard border, he added. Meanwhile, the European parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, Guy Verhofstadt, called the plans ""unworkable"". In an interview with the BBC, Mr Verhofstadt said the plan represented ""a repackaging of old ideas"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics.

Brain-damaged girl can go abroad for treatmentUK specialists had argued taking five-year-old Tafida Raqeeb to a foreign hospital would be futile.,"This video can not be played Tafida's mother Shelina Begum said the case had been ""exhausting and traumatic"" The parents of a brain-damaged girl will be allowed to take her abroad to continue her treatment, the High Court has ruled. Five-year-old Tafida Raqeeb has been on life support at the Royal London Hospital since suffering a traumatic brain injury in February. Her parents have organised funding to take her to the Gaslini children's hospital in Genoa, Italy. But UK specialists had argued any further treatment would be futile. Bosses at Barts Health NHS Trust, which runs the hospital in Whitechapel, had asked the judge to rule that ending Tafida's life-support was in her best interests. Do hospitals or parents of sick children get to decide? Girl 'will suffer if life support continues' Brain-damaged girl's mum 'doesn't trust UK medics' Her mother, solicitor Shelina Begum, and father, construction consultant Mohammed Raqeeb, said doctors in Italy would continue to treat their daughter until she was diagnosed as brain dead. They argued that Tafida was from a Muslim family and Islamic law said only God could take the decision to end her life. Tafida Raqeeb suffered a traumatic brain injury in February and has been on life support ever since Following the ruling, Mr Raqeeb said the couple were ""thrilled by the judgement"". Their barrister David Lock QC said the ruling was an ""enormous relief"" for the couple who he said now ""wanted to get on with the transfer"". Lawyers representing Barts Health NHS Trust said hospital bosses would consider appealing against the ruling. Barrister Katie Gollop QC told Mr Justice MacDonald that his ruling could have implications for other children. Specialists at the Royal London Hospital believe the five-year-old has no chance of recovery The High Court had heard that Tafida woke her parents one morning in February complaining that she had a headache, and then had collapsed. She was taken to hospital where doctors discovered that blood vessels in her brain were tangled and had ruptured. In his ruling, Mr Justice MacDonald found that ""where a child is not in pain and is not aware of his or her parlous situation, these cases can place the objective best interests test under some stress"". ""Tests must be looked for in subjective or highly value laden ethical, moral or religious factors... which mean different things to different people in a diverse, multicultural, multi-faith society,"" he said. Tafida and her father Mohammed Raqeeb Lawyer Mathieu Culverhouse, who represented Tafida, said there were ""no winners in a case like this"" but added the family were ""relieved they are now a step closer to taking Tafida to Italy"". According to the family solicitor Paul Conrathe, they hoped to do that ""within the next 10 days"" - although it could be delayed if the trust appeal. ""That is a huge anxiety for the parents"", he said.

Trump urges Ukraine and China to probe Bidens,"This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims US President Donald Trump, already facing an impeachment inquiry after urging Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, has now urged China to do likewise. He said both China and Ukraine should look into Mr Biden, a Democratic presidential frontrunner, and his son. ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"" said Mr Trump. The Democrats accuse Mr Trump of dangling military aid as a way to press Ukraine to dig dirt on Mr Biden. Mr Biden responded by tweeting: ""The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone's integrity is a joke."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A 25 July phone call between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered an intelligence community whistleblower complaint and the impeachment inquiry. But Mr Trump said on Thursday that the inquiry, which could culminate in a congressional attempt to remove him from office, is ""crap"". This video can not be played Trump calls for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens In a late-night tweet, Mr Trump added thathe had a duty to investigate alleged corruption,external""and that would include asking, or suggesting, other countries to help us out!"" Mr Trump has accused Mr Biden and his son Hunter of corruption in their political and business dealings in Ukraine and China, without offering specific evidence. When Hunter Biden joined Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma in 2014, questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest for his father. Ukraine was undergoing a political transition after its pro-Russia president was forced out of office, while the elder Biden was the Obama administration's point man for the Eastern European country. In 2016, Joe Biden pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whose office had been scrutinising the oligarch owner of Burisma. In a speech last year at a think tank, Mr Biden boasted of having forced Mr Shokin out by threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee to Ukraine. Mr Trump and his allies accuse Mr Biden of acting to protect his son. However, other Western officials and major financers of Ukraine's government also wanted Mr Shokin dismissed because he was seen as a barrier to anti-corruption efforts. This video can not be played Former prosecutor-general Yuriy Lutsenko speaks to the BBC's Jonah Fisher Last week, the Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr Shokin told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Impeachment inquiry explained - in short and long form Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? When asked what Mr Trump sought as a ""favour"" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in this summer's phone call, Mr Trump responded: ""Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer. ""They should investigate the Bidens,"" he said, speaking to reporters on the lawn of the White House. ""Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,"" he continued. Mr Trump also suggested again without offering evidence that Mr Biden had ""scammed"" other countries and was responsible for China's ""sweetheart"" trade relationship with the US. The head of the Federal Election Commission responded by tweeting a reminder that it is illegal for anyone to solicit anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election.

A spokeswoman for Mr Biden's 2020 campaign accused Mr Trump of ""flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organisations"". Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield's statement compared Mr Trump's latest comments to his ""'Russia, if you're listening' moment from 2016 -  a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country"". The quote is a reference to Mr Trump's first election campaign, in which he urged Russia to find more than 30,000 emails deleted from his opponent Hillary Clinton's personal server. A spokesman for Hunter Biden has told US media that Mr Trump's $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) figure is false, and that the younger Biden did not receive any return or compensation from the Chinese firm. In 2013, then vice-president Mr Biden went to China on an official visit, where he met Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials. Hunter Biden and his daughter joined the vice-president, who had travelled with family members before. During the two-day visit, Hunter met a Chinese banker, Jonathan Li, who would eventually become a business partner. Mr Li founded a private equity fund shortly after the trip, and Hunter was on the board, although a spokesman for the younger Mr Bidentold NBC News,externalthey did not discuss any business during the trip and the fund had been planned months earlier. Hunter Biden was also not an equity owner in the fund during his father's term as vice-president, according to the spokesman. Hunter has denied meeting any Chinese officials about the business. However, he reportedly helped arrange for Mr Li to shake hands with Joe Biden during his trip to Beijing, which stoked claims of influence-peddling. This August, Republican Senator and Finance Chairman Chuck Grassleyquestioned Hunter's actions on the trip,external. He said the younger Biden had a ""history of investing in and collaborating with Chinese companies, including at least one posing significant national security concerns"". Once again Donald Trump is publicly stating something that has got him into hot water for saying privately. It's either brilliant strategy or political madness. Or maybe a bit of both. For those who believe that a president calling on a foreign government to investigate a political rival is an impeachable offence, Mr Trump has already offered more than enough evidence to proceed straight to a vote, no ""inquiry"" necessary. If an abuse of presidential power is what elevates the foreign ""request"" to an impeachable act, then a bit more digging is required. Is there evidence that Mr Trump tied Ukrainian military aid to the Biden request? Has Biden come up at all during Mr Trump's trade negotiations with China? Less than a minute before Mr Trump called on China to investigate the former vice-president, he spoke about those trade negotiations, noting that the US has ""tremendous power"" over China. How is that power being used? Mr Trump is drawing a line in the sand. He says his Ukraine phone call was ""perfect"" - and, as if to prove it, he's saying and doing the same thing again and again. If Democrats disagree, they can impeach him. And they just might. Ex-US special envoy to Ukraine Kurt Volker has become the first witness to testify to Congress in the formal impeachment inquiry of President Trump. Mr Volker was among those mentioned in an anonymous whistleblower's complaint about Mr Trump's call to the president of Ukraine. Kurt Volker (left) resigned as US special envoy to Ukraine last week The Republican foreign policy expert was addressing three Democratic-led House committees behind closed doors on Thursday. Afterwards, Republicans and Democrats gave contrasting accounts of what Mr Volker's testimony meant for Mr Trump, with Republican Mark Meadows saying there was ""no quid pro quo"" and Democrat Eric Swalwell saying it showed there was a ""shadow shakedown going on"". The whistleblower's complaint said that one day after the Trump-Zelensky call, Mr Volker and US ambassador to the EU, Gordon Sondland, met the Ukrainian president to advise him on how to ""navigate"" Mr Trump's request. Mr Volker resigned from the Department of State last week after being named in the complaint. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had sought to block testimony from Mr Volker and four other Department of State officials whom Democrats wish to interview. This video can not be played Who is Rudy Giuliani? In advance of his testimony, Mr Volker handed over documents to the committee, including text messages with Mr Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani. On Friday morning Democratic congressional leaders published a letter setting out ""grave concerns"" over what they said was the Trump administration's attempt to ""normalise the act of soliciting foreign powers to interfere in our elections"". They attached text message exchanges involving Mr Volker as well as an exchange between Bill Taylor, the top US diplomat in Ukraine, and Mr Sondland. In one exchange, Mr Taylor tells Mr Sondland: ""As I said on the phone, I think it's crazy to withhold security assistance for help with a political campaign.""

UK facing 'heightened risk of recession',"The UK's economy may have tipped into recession following a downturn in the dominant service sector, according to closely-watched figures. The IHS Markit/CPS purchasing managers' index for services,externalfell to a six-month low of 49.5 in September. The 50 level divides growth from expansion. It suggests the economy shrank 0.1% in the three months to September, after a 0.2% fall in the previous quarter. Some experts urged caution, as official data last month eased recession fears. Combined with even weaker manufacturing and construction purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) earlier this week, September's all-sector PMI sank to 48.8 from 49.7. This was its lowest since the month after the referendum decision to leave the EU in June 2016, and before that 2009. ""Coming on the heels of a decline in the second quarter, [this] would mean the UK is facing a heightened risk of recession,"" said IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson. A recession is normally defined as when an economy contracts over two consecutive quarters. How big is the UK's economy? ""September's decline is all the more ominous, being the result of an insidious weakening of demand over the past year rather than a sudden shock,"" Mr Williamson added. He highlighted Brexit uncertainty, worries about trade tensions between the US, China and Europe, and weaker growth in the eurozone. Separate PMI figures on Thursday showed Germany's services sector sharply lost momentum in September, fuelling fears that contraction in the country's manufacturing sector was spilling over into the rest of Europe's largest economy. Germany's services PMI fell to 51.4 from 54.8 in August, the lowest reading for three years. Although the PMI data is closely followed it is not considered foolproof. Immediately after the Brexit referendum, the data indicated a sharper downturn than was actually the case. Last month,latest figures from the Office for National Statistics(ONS) pointed to the UK economy growing faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession. Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement on the 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. ONS growth data for August is due for publication on 10 October. This survey has sounded the recession alarm bells - pointing to a second quarter of shrinking GDP.  Not only does it imply one of the biggest slumps in activity in the dominant service sector since the financial crisis but, taken with its counterparts for manufacturing and construction, signals output falling across the economy. Should we be worried? These surveys are the first monthly insight into the health of major parts of our economy. But in these tumultuous times, they may be more of a mood check rather than a whole-body MOT. The authors refer to Brexit-related anxiety: sentiment, rather than activity, may be clouding or obscuring the picture. It wouldn't be the first time. Earlier this year (because of course we've been here before) these surveys failed to fully reflect the flurry in Brexit preparations. Nor do they cover retail or the public sector - two areas that have underpinned the growth we have seen.  The surveys can and do deviate from official growth numbers. But it'd be dangerous to ignore the warnings. Sentiment can dictate all sorts of business plans - from investment to hiring. The impact of those can last longer than one quarter's GDP. Economists said Thursday's PMI figures were a warning. Ruth Gregory, senior UK economist at Capital Economics, said they reignited concerns the economy is in recession as it ""suggests that growth in the biggest part of the economy has fizzled out"". However, while Dean Turner, UK economist for UBS Global Wealth Management, said the figures were ""gloomy"", he added that the PMIs ""have had a tendency to overreact relative to reality. It is too early to conclude that the UK is heading for a recession on these numbers alone."" And Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics, went further. ""The survey's poor track record recently means its recession signal should not be believed,"" he said. ""Markit's services survey has been far too downbeat over the last year.""

HK set to announce ban on face masks at protests,"Hong Kong's government is set to announce a ban on wearing face masks at public gatherings, local media report. Officials plan to use emergency legislation dating from the colonial era to invoke the measure, aimed at quelling anti-government protests. The legislation, called the Emergency Regulations Ordinance, has not been used for over 50 years. Hong Kong's protests started in June, sparked by proposals to extradite suspected criminals to mainland China. Critics feared this could undermine the city's judicial independence and endanger dissidents. The face mask ban is expected to be announced on Friday after a meeting of the Executive Council in which emergency laws are likely to be enacted, local TV channel TVB reported. The laws would grant Hong Kong's leader, Carrie Lam, the authority to ""make any regulations whatsoever which he [or she] may consider desirable in the public interest"" in case of ""emergency or public danger"". Hong Kong protests explained in 100 and 500 words What led to a single gunshot being fired? Apple bans Hong Kong protest location app Last used in 1967 to help stop violent riots in the territory's trading hub, the laws could also give the governmentgreater authority to make arrests, censor publications and search premises.,external In recent weeks, the unrest has taken a more violent turn. An Indonesian journalist has been left permanently blinded in her right eye by a rubber bullet said to have been fired by police on Sunday. On Tuesday, an 18-year-old protester was wounded when a police officer fired a live bullet into his chest. This video can not be played Footage of the shooting shows the police officer fire one bullet at close range Face masks are often worn by protesters to help prevent them from being identified and arrested by authorities. In the recent Hong Kong protests, police have used water cannon to spray blue dye on demonstrators to make it easier to identify them later. By Martin Yip, BBC News Chinese, Hong Kong We don't yet know the contents of the rumoured emergency legislation, but protesters are already putting themselves on ""high alert"" in anticipation of Friday's announcement. Some are still calling for flash mob protests on Thursday evening to go head, showing how defiant they remain. The Civil Human Rights Front, which has organised a few peaceful ""mega-marches"" over the last four months, argues the police should, in fact, be the first to be banned from wearing masks. That would mean officers could be held accountable for any abuse of power. Police in Hong Kong have repeatedly denied allegations of brutality. Of course, there are many questions about how this ban would affect the protests. It is also unclear how the overstretched police would carry it out. Nonetheless, it seems as though it will be good news for officers. However, one of their trade unions wants restrictions to be taken even further: it is insisting a curfew is imposed. Opponents of the proposed extradition law thought it would put Hong Kongers at risk of unfair trials and,in July, Carrie Lam said the law ""was dead"". Despite this, protesters feared the bill could be revived, so demonstrations continued, calling for it to be withdrawn completely. The bill was finally withdrawn in September. But clashes between police and protesters had already created their own momentum, and authorities continue to try to crack down on the unrest. The 96 people, mostly students, who had been arrested on Sunday have already appeared in court charged with rioting. The injured 18-year-old protester has been charged with rioting and assaulting an officer. Profile: Hong Kong leader Carrie Lam Seven ways China's media took on HK protests How badly has tourism been affected The protests have been spared by wider discontent too. Recent years have seen growing opposition to the perceived encroachment of Beijing on Hong Kong's politics and threats to local identity. Until 1997, Hong Kong was a British territory. Since then, it has been part of China - but with its own system of law and government, known as One Country, Two Systems.

Labour MP and chair of the Brexit Committee, Hilary Benn, reiterates his call for another EU referendum. He says the Commons has ""made it quite clear"" they do not support a no-deal Brexit, but Boris Johnson's plan has too many flaws. He tells BBC News: ""We need to find another way out of this. ""There is a growing number of MPs that recognise the only way to resolve this is to go back to the people - put a deal to them that has been negotiated and the option of remain and say, 'look, we are deadlocked, you need to decide'."" Mr Benn adds: ""Three-and-a-half years on, we now know what was offered by the Leave campaign... wasn't true. ""There are choices that need to be made and trade-offs involved here, and the democratic thing to do is that confirmatory referendum. ""This began with the people.

BBC News Channel Mark Francois, Tory MP and deputy chairman of the Brexiteer European Research Group, says the PM has ""a fighting chance"" of getting his deal through Parliament. The majority of ERG voted against Theresa May's deal three times and have long had an issue with the Irish backstop. Mr Francois tells BBC News: ""The greatest problem with the original withdrawal agreement was always the so-called backstop because, in a nutshell, it meant we didn't leave the European Union. ""The prime minister's proposal gets rid of the backstop and replaces it with alternative customs arrangements in Northern Ireland."" He says there are still ""other issues"" with Boris Johnson's plan, ""but the absolute crunch issue was always the backstop"". And the key element for him is the support of the offer from the Northern Irish party, the DUP. ""It is not our job in the ERG to be more unionist than the DUP,"" he says. ""They will be the ones and the people in Northern Ireland most affected by this. ""If they can live with this, we can probably live with it too."" Northern Ireland's Chief Constable tells Boris Johnson he does not have enough officers to police the 300 crossing points of the Irish border. Simon Byrne says he spoke to the PM via a video link. ""We were face-to-face on a video call for over half an hour,"" he says. ""It was a very open conversation trying to tell him we saw that it was nigh on impossible to try and police over 300 crossings with the amount of police officers we had. ""It was a candid conversation, he was responsive to what we said and at the end of the day, how it landed and what he thought... you're going to have to ask him.""

The European Parliament's Brexit Steering Group represents a number of the major groupings in the Parliament. The Parliament itself has a veto on any Withdrawal Agreement agreed between the EU and UK. In a statement, the group say they did not find that the ""last minute proposals of the UK government... represent a basis for an agreement to which the European
Parliament could give consent"". They add: ""While we remain open to
workable, legally operable and serious solutions, the UKâs proposals fall short

First witness testifies in Trump impeachment probeKurt Volker resigned last week after he was named in an whistleblower's complaint about Donald Trump.US & Canada,"This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims US President Donald Trump, already facing an impeachment inquiry after urging Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, has now urged China to do likewise. He said both China and Ukraine should look into Mr Biden, a Democratic presidential frontrunner, and his son. ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"" said Mr Trump. The Democrats accuse Mr Trump of dangling military aid as a way to press Ukraine to dig dirt on Mr Biden. Mr Biden responded by tweeting: ""The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone's integrity is a joke."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A 25 July phone call between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered an intelligence community whistleblower complaint and the impeachment inquiry. But Mr Trump said on Thursday that the inquiry, which could culminate in a congressional attempt to remove him from office, is ""crap"". This video can not be played Trump calls for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens In a late-night tweet, Mr Trump added thathe had a duty to investigate alleged corruption,external""and that would include asking, or suggesting, other countries to help us out!"" Mr Trump has accused Mr Biden and his son Hunter of corruption in their political and business dealings in Ukraine and China, without offering specific evidence. When Hunter Biden joined Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma in 2014, questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest for his father. Ukraine was undergoing a political transition after its pro-Russia president was forced out of office, while the elder Biden was the Obama administration's point man for the Eastern European country. In 2016, Joe Biden pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whose office had been scrutinising the oligarch owner of Burisma. In a speech last year at a think tank, Mr Biden boasted of having forced Mr Shokin out by threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee to Ukraine. Mr Trump and his allies accuse Mr Biden of acting to protect his son. However, other Western officials and major financers of Ukraine's government also wanted Mr Shokin dismissed because he was seen as a barrier to anti-corruption efforts. This video can not be played Former prosecutor-general Yuriy Lutsenko speaks to the BBC's Jonah Fisher Last week, the Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr Shokin told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Impeachment inquiry explained - in short and long form Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? When asked what Mr Trump sought as a ""favour"" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in this summer's phone call, Mr Trump responded: ""Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer. ""They should investigate the Bidens,"" he said, speaking to reporters on the lawn of the White House. ""Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,"" he continued. Mr Trump also suggested again without offering evidence that Mr Biden had ""scammed"" other countries and was responsible for China's ""sweetheart"" trade relationship with the US. The head of the Federal Election Commission responded by tweeting a reminder that it is illegal for anyone to solicit anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election.

A spokeswoman for Mr Biden's 2020 campaign accused Mr Trump of ""flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organisations"". Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield's statement compared Mr Trump's latest comments to his ""'Russia, if you're listening' moment from 2016 -  a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country"". The quote is a reference to Mr Trump's first election campaign, in which he urged Russia to find more than 30,000 emails deleted from his opponent Hillary Clinton's personal server. A spokesman for Hunter Biden has told US media that Mr Trump's $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) figure is false, and that the younger Biden did not receive any return or compensation from the Chinese firm. In 2013, then vice-president Mr Biden went to China on an official visit, where he met Chinese President Xi Jinping and other officials. Hunter Biden and his daughter joined the vice-president, who had travelled with family members before.

First witness testifies in Trump impeachment probe,"This video can not be played What we know about Biden-Ukraine corruption claims US President Donald Trump, already facing an impeachment inquiry after urging Ukraine to investigate his political rival Joe Biden, has now urged China to do likewise. He said both China and Ukraine should look into Mr Biden, a Democratic presidential frontrunner, and his son. ""China should start an investigation into the Bidens,"" said Mr Trump. The Democrats accuse Mr Trump of dangling military aid as a way to press Ukraine to dig dirt on Mr Biden. Mr Biden responded by tweeting: ""The idea of Donald Trump attacking anyone's integrity is a joke."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A 25 July phone call between Mr Trump and Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky triggered an intelligence community whistleblower complaint and the impeachment inquiry. But Mr Trump said on Thursday that the inquiry, which could culminate in a congressional attempt to remove him from office, is ""crap"". This video can not be played Trump calls for China and Ukraine to investigate the Bidens In a late-night tweet, Mr Trump added thathe had a duty to investigate alleged corruption,external""and that would include asking, or suggesting, other countries to help us out!"" Mr Trump has accused Mr Biden and his son Hunter of corruption in their political and business dealings in Ukraine and China, without offering specific evidence. When Hunter Biden joined Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma in 2014, questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest for his father. Ukraine was undergoing a political transition after its pro-Russia president was forced out of office, while the elder Biden was the Obama administration's point man for the Eastern European country. In 2016, Joe Biden pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whose office had been scrutinising the oligarch owner of Burisma. In a speech last year at a think tank, Mr Biden boasted of having forced Mr Shokin out by threatening to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee to Ukraine. Mr Trump and his allies accuse Mr Biden of acting to protect his son. However, other Western officials and major financers of Ukraine's government also wanted Mr Shokin dismissed because he was seen as a barrier to anti-corruption efforts. This video can not be played Former prosecutor-general Yuriy Lutsenko speaks to the BBC's Jonah Fisher Last week, the Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr Shokin told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. Impeachment inquiry explained - in short and long form Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? When asked what Mr Trump sought as a ""favour"" from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in this summer's phone call, Mr Trump responded: ""Well, I would think that if they were honest about it, they'd start a major investigation into the Bidens. It's a very simple answer. ""They should investigate the Bidens,"" he said, speaking to reporters on the lawn of the White House. ""Likewise, China should start an investigation into the Bidens because what happened to China is just about as bad as what happened with Ukraine,"" he continued. Mr Trump also suggested again without offering evidence that Mr Biden had ""scammed"" other countries and was responsible for China's ""sweetheart"" trade relationship with the US. The head of the Federal Election Commission responded by tweeting a reminder that it is illegal for anyone to solicit anything of value from a foreign national in connection with a US election.

A spokeswoman for Mr Biden's 2020 campaign accused Mr Trump of ""flailing and melting down on national television, desperately clutching for conspiracy theories that have been debunked and dismissed by independent, credible news organisations"". Deputy Campaign Manager Kate Bedingfield's statement compared Mr Trump's latest comments to his ""'Russia, if you're listening' moment from 2016 -  a grotesque choice of lies over truth and self over the country"". The quote is a reference to Mr Trump's first election campaign, in which he urged Russia to find more than 30,000 emails deleted from his opponent Hillary Clinton's personal server. A spokesman for Hunter Biden has told US media that Mr Trump's $1.5bn (Â£1.2bn) figure is false, and that the younger Biden did not receive any return or compensation from the Chinese firm.

Defeat for women in state pension age challengeJudges rule the government's handling of the rise from the age of 60 did not discriminate against women.,"This video can not be played ""It makes me angry. It makes me very emotional"" Campaigners have lost a significant legal battle against the government's handling of the rise in women's state pension age. The retirement age for women rose from 60 to 65, in line with men, and will go up to 66 by 2020, and to 67 by 2028. Women born in the 1950s claim the rise is unfair because they were not given enough time to make adjustments to cope with years without a state pension. They argued the changes were discrimination, but judges disagreed. The fight over women's state pensions State pension age to rise to 68 In a summary of the High Court's decision, the judges said: ""There was no direct discrimination on grounds of sex, because this legislation does not treat women less favourably than men in law. Rather it equalises a historic asymmetry between men and women and thereby corrects historic direct discrimination against men."" The court also rejected the claimants' argument that the policy was discriminatory based on age, adding that even if it was ""it could be justified on the facts"". To chants of ""the fight goes on"" from supporters, Joanne Welch, who led the campaign, said outside court: ""Where do we go from here? Well, where will the government go from here is the better question."" She referred to Prime Minister Boris Johnson's pledge during the Tory leadership campaign to look at the state pension age issue with ""fresh vigour"", adding: ""We will be holding you to that undertaking."" She said she was ""rather puzzled"" by the court's ruling, but added: ""We can take this, we've got broad shoulders."" A spokesman for the Department for Work and Pensions said: ""We welcome the High Court's judgment. It has always been our view that the changes we made to women's state pension age were entirely lawful and did not discriminate on any grounds."" Up until 2010, women received their state pensions at the age of 60 but that has been rising since then. While most campaigners support pension age equality, they argued that the government was discriminatory in the way it has introduced it. The result has been that some women who thought they would retire and receive a state pension at 60 found that they would have to wait longer - for some a wait of more than five years. That resulted in financial hardship for many. Those affected were born in the decade after 6 April, 1950, but those born from 6 April 1953 were particularly affected and have been the focus of much of the campaign. In June, the judicial review in the High Court heard the claim from two members of the Backto60 group who said that not receiving their state pension at the age of 60 had affected them disproportionately. They argued that many women took time out of work to care for children, were paid less than men and could not save as much in occupational pensions, so the change had hit them harder. It is estimated that 3.8 million women were in this position, with some potentially losing out on more than Â£40,000. The Backto60 group is seeking repayment of all the pensions people born in the 1950s would have received if they had been able to retire earlier. It argues that the speed of the change and what it calls the lack of warnings has disadvantaged millions of women. However, the government has estimated that a reversal of the pension changes in the Acts of Parliament of 1995 and 2011 would cost Â£215bn over the period 2010-11 to 2025-26. About Â£181bn of that would be money potentially owed to women and the rest to men. It has said the move to make the state pension age the same for men and women was a ""long-overdue"" move towards gender equality, and had been clearly communicated to those affected. Krissy Abbott, with her dog Jazz, says she is angry about the situation Krissy Abbott was born in April 1954 so had expected to be receiving her state pension well before now. Instead, it will come in November. Mrs Abbott, from Essex, said the loss of her husband, Alan, as well as difficulties with benefits applications meant she was depending on the charity of others last year. ""The only thing I had was the food bank and some very good neighbours of mine. They knew how much I thought of [my dog] Jazz. They brought round tins of dog food for him,"" she said. ""I had a gas cooker in the kitchen and Jazz and I used to spend our time in the kitchen keeping warm. You just survive."" She said life would have been different had she been in receipt of her state pension. ""You could have had the heating, you could have had hot food, a shower, a bath, a simple thing like having a kettle and making a hot drink. It would have made such a difference. I could have paid my bills,"" she said. ""It makes me angry. It makes me very emotional."" Campaigners have lobbied MPs, and call regular public protests to raise awareness of their situation. To gasps in the courtroom when declaring the ruling, Lord Justice Irwin and Mrs Justice Whipple said: ""The court was saddened by the stories contained in the claimants' evidence. ""But the court's role was limited. There was no basis for concluding that the policy choices reflected in the legislation were not open to government. In any event they were approved by Parliament. ""The wider issues raised by the claimants about whether the choices were right or wrong or good or bad were not for the court. They were for members of the public and their elected representatives."" The judges also said there was nothing written into the law that ordered specific notification about the pension age changes. The Backto60 group has taken this legal action to demand ""the return of their earned dues"". The separate Women Against State Pension Inequality (Waspi) group is calling for a ""bridging"" pension to cover the gap from the age of 60 until their state pension is paid.

Uber launches job app for gig economy workers,"Uber is testing new ground with an app to put casual workers in touch with employers, as it faces an increasingly tough climate for its core ride-hailing business. Uber Works will allow cleaners, bar staff and warehouse workers to compare pay rates and sign up for shifts. The app, which launches on Friday, will initially only be available in Chicago. It will compete with a range of rival apps in the US market including Wonolo, Workpop and Shiftgig. The move comes as several parts of the world tighten regulation around Uber's operations as a ride-hailing firm.California recently passed legislationdesigned to pave the way for so-called âgig workersâ to become employees and gain additional rights, which is expected to increase costs for firms such as Uber. Millions of American workers use staffing agencies, Ubersaid in a blog post,externalannouncing the venture. But it believes the process can be made more transparent and faster for both employees and firms. The app will provide information on pay, location and working conditions. Workers can also use it to track working hours and breaks, the firm said. Employers would be able to tap into a ready pool of ""vetted and qualified"" temporary labour, Uber said. Uber says 'gig economy' law will not hurt business On the Record: Stacy Brown-Philpot, TaskRabbit Uber's London licence renewed for two months Uber will focus on making the app successful in Chicago, where it has already operated in a test phase for the past year, before introducing it elsewhere, it added. The growth of casual hiring, dubbed the ""gig economy"", has been controversial. Some staff hired on an ad hoc basis say they appreciate the flexibility it offers, while others suffer income insecurity and a lack of other welfare benefits of employee status. Drivers working for Uber's original ride-hailing business have taken the company to court to establish the firm's duty to provide staff benefits such as holiday pay and sickness cover. Uber Works has agreed partnerships with staffing agencies in Chicago that employ, pay and handle worker benefits, potentially side-stepping this issue with the new platform.

Boar with swine fever found in Korea border zone,"More than six million pigs have been culled in Asia after the virus was discovered A boar with African swine fever has been found dead in the demilitarised zone (DMZ) that separates the two Koreas. The virus was only discovered in South Korea recently, and there was speculation it arrived via pigs crossing the heavily-guarded DMZ. North Korea first recorded ASF in May, and the South made great efforts to keep it out, including border fences. Despite its name, the DMZ is one of the world's most fortified places. It is a 4km-wide (2.5 miles) strip of land, laden with landmines, that is a buffer zone between North and South Korea. More than 10,000 pigs have died or been culled in the South since ASF was discovered. More than six million pigs have been culled overall in Asia. The virus is not dangerous to humans, but is highly contagious - and incurable - in boars and pigs. According to the UN,the fatality rate is ""up to 100%"".,external It emerged inEast Africa in the early 1990s,external, moved through sub-Saharan Africa, and has also been recorded in Europe. In August 2018, China - which has half the world's pigs, and where pork is often a staple food - confirmed an outbreak of ASF. Since then, more than one million pigs have been culled in China, plusmore than five million,externalin Vietnam. Farmers in China have been promised compensation for culled pigs worth a minimum of 80% of the market price. The number of pigs is down by about 40% in China, the AFP news agency reported, and the price of pork is up by at least half. China has sold30,000 tonnes from its pork reservesin an effort to increase supply and hold down prices. Mongolia, the Philippines, Laos, have also culled tens of thousands of pigs in total. Animal rights activists in Seoul called for an end to the cull on Wednesday The first case of ASF was recorded in North Korea in May. The scale of the outbreak is not known, but South Korea believes the north raises around 2.6m pigs across 14 state-run farms. Kim Jun-young, from the Korean Veterinary Medical Association in the south, said it was possible the virus had spread through the North, either through the sale of infected meat, or vultures eating infected carcasses. In June, Seoul said the disease was ""highly likely"" to enter the country from the North and ordered fences to be built at farms along the border. The South offered quarantine and medical assistance to the North, but had no response. Why millions of pigs are being culled in Asia The deadly disease wiping out pigs The South Korean military was authorised to kill any wild boars seen crossing the DMZ. Despite the precautions, South Korea reported its first case on 17 September - with the total now at 13 - and has culled around 15,000 pigs in response. There are around 6,700 pig farms in South Korea. Officials are braced for a further spread of ASF with the arrival Typhoon Mitag, which has already led to deaths of six people in the south.

Escaped zebra shot in Germany after autobahn chaos,"The zebra was one of two that escaped from a circus A runaway zebra has been shot dead in Germany after it escaped from a circus and fled onto a motorway, causing a traffic accident, police say. Police in the northern city of Rostock said the animal disrupted traffic, damaged cars and caused an accident on the A20 motorway on Wednesday before being shot dead by officers. A second zebra that escaped from the circus was captured. Details of the shooting have not been made public. It is also not yet clear how the two animals escaped from the circus in northern Germany on Tuesday evening. Zoo visitors 'petrified' by escaped chimp Zoo accused of passing off donkey as zebra Zoo condemned over smoking orangutan Police on Wednesday morning issued a warning on Twitter that one of the escaped zebras was disrupting traffic on the A20 highway and had caused an accident. ""The animal was going in the wrong direction on the autobahn from Tessin to Rostock,"" a police spokesperson told Deutsche Welle. In a later statement, they said no one was injured in the collision, which occurred when one car braked to avoid the animal, causing another to crash into it. The animal also damaged vehicles and forced the temporary closure of the highway, they said. Police say the zebra damaged a patrol car The zebra was later shot near the municipality of Thelkow after efforts by officials and a circus tamer to capture it alive were unsuccessful.

"Escaped zebra shot in Germany after autobahn chaosThe zebra, one of two to run away from a circus, was killed by police after it caused an accident.","The zebra was one of two that escaped from a circus A runaway zebra has been shot dead in Germany after it escaped from a circus and fled onto a motorway, causing a traffic accident, police say. Police in the northern city of Rostock said the animal disrupted traffic, damaged cars and caused an accident on the A20 motorway on Wednesday before being shot dead by officers. A second zebra that escaped from the circus was captured. Details of the shooting have not been made public. It is also not yet clear how the two animals escaped from the circus in northern Germany on Tuesday evening. Zoo visitors 'petrified' by escaped chimp Zoo accused of passing off donkey as zebra Zoo condemned over smoking orangutan Police on Wednesday morning issued a warning on Twitter that one of the escaped zebras was disrupting traffic on the A20 highway and had caused an accident. ""The animal was going in the wrong direction on the autobahn from Tessin to Rostock,"" a police spokesperson told Deutsche Welle. In a later statement, they said no one was injured in the collision, which occurred when one car braked to avoid the animal, causing another to crash into it. The animal also damaged vehicles and forced the temporary closure of the highway, they said. Police say the zebra damaged a patrol car The zebra was later shot near the municipality of Thelkow after efforts by officials and a circus tamer to capture it alive were unsuccessful. The second zebra was reportedly returned to the circus.

Boris Johnson sets out Brexit plan to MPs,"This video can not be played Brexit: Reaction to Boris Johnson's Irish border proposals Boris Johnson is setting out his proposals for a Brexit deal in Parliament, while EU leaders also consider their response. He outlined plans on Wednesday that would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks. The European Commission welcomed ""advances"" but said problems remained. The PM says the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. He insists he will not ask for a further extension if no deal is reached despite legislation designed to force him to do so unless MPs pass a deal or approve a no-deal Brexit before 19 October. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, whose stance is expected to guide how the EU responds, said the UK's approach ""did not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"". The backstop is a mechanism designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. However, he did add he would study the proposals ""in further detail"". European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will speak to Mr Varadkar later, the commission has said. LIVE: PM updates MPs on Brexit border plans Reality Check: What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Kuenssberg: Johnson won't decide next Brexit steps What questions do you have about Brexit? The UK government hopes to begin a period of intense negotiations with the aim of reaching a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast that the government's plan set out to the EU were ""serious proposals"" and were recognised by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier as such. He said both sides ""recognise that it is better to have a deal"" and negotiations ""will have to be intensively done in the next few days"". There will be further talks on Friday ""subject to how today unfolds"", Mr Barclay said. Many EU leaders feared, before they saw it, that the plan would show the prime minister was focused on a domestic audience, on an upcoming general election and not engaging with the EU. But I have spoken to a number of EU diplomats tonight who say some of the proposals were better than expected. But they emphasised very big differences remain between the two sides. The EU has a number of concerns when it comes to the prime minister's offer. And the European Commission says before it can think of compromise it has a number of detailed questions for the government, when it has properly digested the paper. The main concern for the EU, the big flashing lights, come down to customs. It fears the prime minister's offer could pose a threat to the Northern Ireland peace process and leave the single market exposed after Brexit. Those are two big no-nos for the EU. Looking forward, they have to come to agreement and unanimity among themselves Any idea in the UK that EU leaders will turn to Ireland and say ""you need to compromise because we want a deal with the UK"" is not one we are hearing behind the scenes or in public. Will EU compromise after receiving UK Brexit proposals? The PM's Brexit plan set out details of a replacement for the Irish border ""backstop"" in the current Brexit agreement. The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone"" This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes. TheDemocratic Unionist Party - whose votes the government is likely to need to pass the deal - have supported the plansaying it would allow Northern Ireland to leave the customs union and single market at the same time as the rest of the UK. The party's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds told BBC Breakfast that the proposals ""remove the trap"" of the backstop and he said they were ""a massive improvement"". However, other Northern Ireland parties criticised the proposals. Sinn Fein called the plans a ""non-starter"", the Social Democratic and Labour Party said they were ""dead on arrival"", and the Ulster Unionist Party argued Northern Ireland would be left in a ""perpetual cycle of uncertainty"". Irish Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee said there were ""concerns"" and ""obvious challenges"" with the plan. ""I've always said there are grounds for a deal but there are key objectives we need to meet: protecting the Good Friday Agreement, and to prevent border infrastructure, protecting the economy and the single market,"" she said. This video can not be played DUP leader says new proposals ""sensible and serious"" Several Conservative MPs who rejected Theresa May's withdrawal agreement signalled their support. Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said it was ""highly likely"" the deal would get through Parliament. And fellow Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was ""a mood for compromise"" and ""very strong grounds for optimism"" as ""people want to get this done"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was ""not acceptable"" and the Lib Dem's Jo Swinson accused Mr Johnson of not being ""serious about getting a deal"". Labour MP Hilary Benn, chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee called the proposals ""worse than Theresa May's"", saying: ""How will it help peace and stability in Northern Ireland if every four years there is a divisive debate about whether to follow UK or EU rules?"" Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the proposals were ""designed to fail"". If the EU and UK cannot agree a deal which is approved by MPs by 19 October, the prime minister is compelled by the Benn Act to seek an extension to the Brexit negotiation process unless the Commons votes to leave without a deal. However, the prime minister has repeatedly insisted the UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal, and that he will not ask for an extension.

Reality Check: Brexit plan,"Boris Johnson hasoutlined his plan to the European Union (EU),externalto avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Mr Johnson said the plan ""removes the so-called backstop"". The backstop is the insurance policy negotiated by Theresa May and the EU. It is designed to avoid any physical border infrastructure, which it is feared would bring back memories of the Troubles, after Brexit. It would keep the UK in the same customs territory as the EU, and Northern Ireland closely tied to EU regulations - until the UK and the EU reach a trade deal. But it would stop the UK striking its own trade deals, which is why so many Conservative MPs, including Mr Johnson, oppose the backstop. So, what is his alternative? The government wants the UK to leave the EU customs union. This would mean Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland ending up in two different customs territories. This means lorries entering the Republic of Ireland from Northern Ireland will need to complete customs declarations. This is to ensure the correct tariffs (tax on imports) are paid when UK goods enter the EU customs union. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Reality Check's Chris Morris:From the beginning the EU has struggled to see how Ireland and Northern Ireland can exist in different customs territories while keeping the border as open as it is now under all circumstances. They will argue that - in the absence of a future free trade deal - this proposal means the UK is breaking commitments it has made about the border. The UK counters that the backstop has already been rejected in Parliament three times, and something needs to change. Instead of installing customs posts and other physical infrastructure at the Irish border, the UK says declarations should be done electronically. The government says physical checks would still be needed ""on a very small proportion of movements"". Currently, about one in 100 consignments entering the EU customs union are inspected to check that the goods match the information on the declaration. These inspections could be carried out at warehouses or ""designated locations, which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland."" The government's proposal does not spell out what these ""designated locations"" would look like, but it adds there should be ""a firm commitment (by both parties) never to conduct checks at the border in future"". Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? If adopted, a border solution relying on technology and remote checks would be a first. The EU does not currently share a single border with a non-EU country where checks have been completely eliminated. That includes Norway (not in the EU) and Sweden (an EU member) - which share one of the most technologically advanced borders in the world. Their main crossing point processes about 1,300 lorries a day, with each waiting 20 minutes on average. The EU has previously rejected a customs solution that relies on technology. Back in January, Sabine Weyand, the EU's director-general for trade, said: ""We looked at every border on this Earth, every border the EU has with a third country - there's simply no way you can do away with checks and controls."" The government says that some small traders should be exempt from paying duty. However, the document does not address smuggling head on. In other words, what will be done to detect and prevent traders, who should be paying duty, from crossing the border without completing custom declarations first? Reality Check's Chris Morris:The EU will see much of this as a rehash of previous ideas that it doesn't think will work. And many people will worry that unspecified ""designated locations"" could become targets for anyone seeking to undermine the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU will push back hard against suggestions that it needs to revise its own customs rules to suit the UK. When it comes to the regulation of goods, Northern Ireland would keep to the rules of the EU's single market, rather than UK rules. That removes the need for product standard and safety checks on goods at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it creates the need for checks between the rest of the UK - which will not be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland.. All agricultural, food or animal products entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK will have to go through a Border Inspection Post. That's a bit of infrastructure where goods can be physically examined and paperwork checked. Manufactured goods in Northern Ireland would also have to keep to EU rules, and these goods would be checked ""at the boundary of the zone"" - presumably at crossings between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, on the Irish Sea. Reality Check's Chris Morris:This is quite a big concession from the UK side - basically accepting that there would have to be quite intrusive checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK for a number of years, on things like product standards and food safety. The EU has always said there have to be checks carried out somewhere, and both sides will try to deny any suggestion that this amounts to a new border in the Irish Sea. Having Northern Ireland following EU rules for the production of goods over which it has no say is, as the document says, ""a significant democratic problem"". As a result, it is proposed that the Northern Ireland Assembly and Executive will have to sign off on the plan before it takes effect. The Northern Irish institutions will be asked to approve the plan again every four years, and if they do not then Northern Ireland would stop following EU rules one year later. The Northern Ireland Assembly has not met since early 2017. Reality Check's Chris Morris:The issue of democratic legitimacy is a crucial one, but it cannot be applied unevenly. The EU is likely to have a problem with anything which suggests that only Northern Ireland could have - in effect - a veto on this plan. The point of the backstop was to provide a legal guarantee to keep an open border under all circumstances. Being subject to approval every four years simply isn't the same thing. If Northern Ireland voted to leave this arrangement things like checks on food safety would have to take place at the Irish border. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Is it different from the backstop?,"How does the prime minister's Irish border plan differ from the backstop? BBC News NI's economic and business editor John Campbell has a look. It was the plan for keeping the Irish border as open as it is today, if that can't be achieved through a trade deal or technological solutions. It was agreed by the former Prime Minister Theresa May in November 2018. It would mean the whole of the UK staying in a customs union with the EU. Northern Ireland alone would stay in EU's single market for goods. This arrangement would remain until both sides agreed there was something better to replace it. Prime Minister Boris Johnson opposes the backstop saying it is antidemocratic and could trap the UK in the EU's customs territory This video can not be played PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready"" It says the whole of the UK should leave the EU's customs union. This inevitably means a new customs border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland with new requirements for cross-border traders. However the prime minister believes the impact of this can be minimised with any checks taking place away from the border. His plan involves trusted trader schemes and simplified customs procedures with the smallest traders being exempt from all customs procedures. He suggests that physical checks would only be required on a small proportion of trade and that most checks could take place at traders' premises. However the plan suggests that checks may also have to happen at ""other designated locations which could be located anywhere in Ireland or Northern Ireland."" Are those 'designated locations' customs posts by another name? The plan would also probably require the EU to make changes or derogations to its customs rules. Mr Johnson has written to the European Commission president about his proposals Mr Johnson's plan has big similarities to the backstop. Northern Ireland would continue to follow EU rules on agriculture, food safety and industrial goods -the rest of the UK would not. That would effectively mean a new border in the Irish Sea with checks on goods coming in here from other parts of the UK. These sorts of checks already happen on livestock. All animals coming here from the rest of UK enter through an inspection post at Larne Harbour. The new plan would mean an increase in the scope and scale of these checks. The DUP has welcomed the new border plan One big difference in the new plan is that the Northern Ireland Executive and Assembly would have to approve that single market arrangement coming into force. Then every four years, Stormont would have to decide if it wants to continue to follow EU rules or align with the rest of the UK. The DUP, which has welcomed the plan, believes that would mean Northern Ireland would always default to UK regulations unless there is a cross-community vote at Stormont to continue to follow EU regulations. Nationalist parties fear this would amount to a unionist veto on whether to continue to follow EU rules. That is because of the existence of a veto mechanism at Stormont known as the Petition of Concern. The Irish government agreed on an interim Brexit deal with the UK in 2017 It seems unlikely at this stage. From the Irish government's point of view, they made an agreement with the UK in the 2017 Joint Report - a kind of interim deal - which said there would not be ""any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls"" as a result of Brexit. That was not just an agreement to prevent any new infrastructure at the Irish border, it was any new checks on the island of Ireland. So the Irish government's position has been that the UK agreed that the status quo would be maintained for cross-border trade. What Boris Johnson is proposing on customs would not meet those criteria.

Trump lashes out at impeachment inquiry,"This video can not be played Stand-off between Trump and reporter on Ukraine phone call US President Donald Trump has lashed out at congressional Democrats after they vowed to summons the White House to produce documents this week. Committees are demanding documents relating to the administration's dealings with Ukraine, which is now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry. The president accused Democratic leaders of dishonesty and even treason. Democrats have defended the inquiry - which focuses on a phone call between Mr Trump and the Ukrainian president. Warning: this report contains strong language During a joint news conference with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶, Mr Trump called Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, ""stone-cold corrupt"". Mr Trump directed much of his anger towards House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, calling him ""shifty Schiff, ""a lowlife"" and saying he ""should resign from office in disgrace"". He added: ""Frankly, they should look at him for treason."" Mr Trump also stated that he believed Mr Schiff had ""helped write"" a complaint about the call filed by a whistleblower, without offering evidence. Impeachment inquiry explained - in short and long form Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? The US president told reporters that only ""legitimate"" whistleblowers should be protected. ""This country has to find out who this person was, because that person's a spy, in my opinion,"" Mr Trump said. He labelled the entire inquiry a ""hoax"" and a ""fraudulent crime on the American people"" while maintaining he would ""always co-operate"" with Congress. This video can not be played Who is Rudy Giuliani? The US president also sparred at the White House with a Reuters correspondent, who asked him what he considered treasonous. As the Finnish leader looked on, Mr Trump said ""there are those who think I'm a very stable genius"" and said he ""probably will be bringing a lot of litigation"" against those who participated in the Russia investigation. When the reporter pressed Mr Trump, the US president cut him off, saying: ""Don't be rude."" Earlier, Mr Trump raged at the most powerful elected Democrat, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Mr Schiff on Twitter, accusing Democrats of focusing on ""BULLSHIT"".

Mr Trump said Mrs Pelosi should focus on her own city, San Francisco, which he described as a ""tent city"" of homeless people. The impeachment inquiry - which may seek to remove Mr Trump from office - stems from the whistleblower's complaint about his 25 July phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Analysis: Dissecting Trump's Ukraine phone calls Pompeo confirms he heard Trump-Ukraine call In the call, Mr Trump pressed for an investigation of his Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas firm that faced allegations of corruption. As vice-president and the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine, Mr Biden threatened to withhold US loan guarantees to the country unless it fired its top prosecutor, at a time when Hunter Biden's employer had been under official scrutiny. But European countries and international bodies had also wanted Viktor Shokin fired, accusing him of failing to clamp down on corruption. The Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr Shokin has told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. However, questions were raised at the time about a potential conflict of interest for the US vice-president. Democrats have pointed out Mr Trump's call with the newly elected Mr Zelensky took place at the same time as the US president decided to withhold military aid from Ukraine. From what has been shared of the call so far, Mr Trump did not directly reference withholding aid, but a full verbatim transcript has not been made available. Mr Trump's opponents say he was pressuring a vulnerable American ally to interfere in the 2020 US election for the US president's personal benefit. Democrats have accused the White House of blocking congressional inquiries and refusing to respond to record requests, which has prompted the subpoena threat this week. House oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings said in a memo: ""I do not take this step lightly. ""Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with - or even respond to - the committees."" The subpoena will request documents on Mr Trump's call with Ukraine and any related items from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the impeachment inquiry Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schiff held a joint news conference on Wednesday, defending the impeachment proceedings. ""We're not fooling around here,"" Mr Schiff said, adding that Democrats did not want the inquiry to ""drag on"". He also criticised the president's comments against the whistleblower as ""a blatant effort to intimidate witnesses"" and ""an incitement of violence"". Mr Schiff has also issued a statement saying his committee never reviewed or received the whistleblower's complaint in advance, as Mr Trump claimed. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached but neither was convicted and removed President Nixon resigned before he could have been impeached How could Trump be impeached?

Service sector decline flashes UK recession alert,"The UK's economy may have tipped into recession following a downturn in the dominant service sector, according to closely-watched figures. The IHS Markit/CPS purchasing managers' index for services,externalfell to a six-month low of 49.5 in September. The 50 level divides growth from expansion. It suggests the economy shrank 0.1% in the three months to September, after a 0.2% fall in the previous quarter. Some experts urged caution, as official data last month eased recession fears. Combined with even weaker manufacturing and construction purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) earlier this week, September's all-sector PMI sank to 48.8 from 49.7. This was its lowest since the month after the referendum decision to leave the EU in June 2016, and before that 2009. ""Coming on the heels of a decline in the second quarter, [this] would mean the UK is facing a heightened risk of recession,"" said IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson. A recession is normally defined as when an economy contracts over two consecutive quarters. How big is the UK's economy? ""September's decline is all the more ominous, being the result of an insidious weakening of demand over the past year rather than a sudden shock,"" Mr Williamson added. He highlighted Brexit uncertainty, worries about trade tensions between the US, China and Europe, and weaker growth in the eurozone. Separate PMI figures on Thursday showed Germany's services sector sharply lost momentum in September, fuelling fears that contraction in the country's manufacturing sector was spilling over into the rest of Europe's largest economy. Germany's services PMI fell to 51.4 from 54.8 in August, the lowest reading for three years. Although the PMI data is closely followed it is not considered foolproof. Immediately after the Brexit referendum, the data indicated a sharper downturn than was actually the case. Last month,latest figures from the Office for National Statistics(ONS) pointed to the UK economy growing faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession. Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement on the 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. ONS growth data for August is due for publication on 10 October. This survey has sounded the recession alarm bells - pointing to a second quarter of shrinking GDP.  Not only does it imply one of the biggest slumps in activity in the dominant service sector since the financial crisis but, taken with its counterparts for manufacturing and construction, signals output falling across the economy. Should we be worried? These surveys are the first monthly insight into the health of major parts of our economy. But in these tumultuous times, they may be more of a mood check rather than a whole-body MOT. The authors refer to Brexit-related anxiety: sentiment, rather than activity, may be clouding or obscuring the picture. It wouldn't be the first time.

Service sector decline flashes UK recession alertClosely-watched surveys suggest the UK economy has contracted in the past two quarters.Business,"The UK's economy may have tipped into recession following a downturn in the dominant service sector, according to closely-watched figures. The IHS Markit/CPS purchasing managers' index for services,externalfell to a six-month low of 49.5 in September. The 50 level divides growth from expansion. It suggests the economy shrank 0.1% in the three months to September, after a 0.2% fall in the previous quarter. Some experts urged caution, as official data last month eased recession fears. Combined with even weaker manufacturing and construction purchasing managers' indexes (PMI) earlier this week, September's all-sector PMI sank to 48.8 from 49.7. This was its lowest since the month after the referendum decision to leave the EU in June 2016, and before that 2009. ""Coming on the heels of a decline in the second quarter, [this] would mean the UK is facing a heightened risk of recession,"" said IHS Markit economist Chris Williamson. A recession is normally defined as when an economy contracts over two consecutive quarters. How big is the UK's economy? ""September's decline is all the more ominous, being the result of an insidious weakening of demand over the past year rather than a sudden shock,"" Mr Williamson added. He highlighted Brexit uncertainty, worries about trade tensions between the US, China and Europe, and weaker growth in the eurozone. Separate PMI figures on Thursday showed Germany's services sector sharply lost momentum in September, fuelling fears that contraction in the country's manufacturing sector was spilling over into the rest of Europe's largest economy. Germany's services PMI fell to 51.4 from 54.8 in August, the lowest reading for three years. Although the PMI data is closely followed it is not considered foolproof. Immediately after the Brexit referendum, the data indicated a sharper downturn than was actually the case. Last month,latest figures from the Office for National Statistics(ONS) pointed to the UK economy growing faster than expected in July, easing fears that it could fall into recession. Growth was flat over the three months to July, but this was an improvement on the 0.2% contraction seen in the April-to-June quarter. ONS growth data for August is due for publication on 10 October. This survey has sounded the recession alarm bells - pointing to a second quarter of shrinking GDP.  Not only does it imply one of the biggest slumps in activity in the dominant service sector since the financial crisis but, taken with its counterparts for manufacturing and construction, signals output falling across the economy. Should we be worried? These surveys are the first monthly insight into the health of major parts of our economy. But in these tumultuous times, they may be more of a mood check rather than a whole-body MOT. The authors refer to Brexit-related anxiety: sentiment, rather than activity, may be clouding or obscuring the picture. It wouldn't be the first time.

Nor do they cover retail or the public sector - two areas that have underpinned the growth we have seen.  The surveys can and do deviate from official growth numbers.

"Analysis: Will the EU compromise?Senior EU diplomats say some UK suggestions were ""better than expected"", but big obstacles remain.","How will the EU respond to Mr Johnson's proposals? Workable proposals or non-workable proposals? That's the EU's question. The prime minister says he has delivered a ""constructive and reasonable"" plan to Brussels, containing UK compromises on finding alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop in a Brexit deal. Now it's the EU's turn, he reasons. So what compromises, if any, is the EU now willing to make? Well, Brussels' mantra since Boris Johnson became prime minister has been: we already compromised in our backstop agreement with Theresa May, if the UK's new PM wants to rip up that agreement and start again, then the onus is on him, not the EU, to find an alternative solution. The EU has said it needed concrete, legally operable, realistic UK proposals on the table before it could entertain re-thinking its position. UK proposals have now been delivered but the EU suspicion is that they are neither realistic, nor legally operable as they stand. Reality Check: What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Kuenssberg: Johnson won't decide next Brexit steps And before anyone objects that ""the EU was always going to pour cold water on the PM's offer, whatever he said!"" let me tell you, it's not all gloom. Before the EU read the prime minister's offer, many predicted it would confirm their suspicion that his focus was on a domestic UK audience and on an upcoming general election - not on engaging with the EU. But senior diplomats told me on Wednesday night that some of Boris Johnson's proposals were ""better than expected"". ""His offer on regulatory alignment (keeping Northern Ireland tied to EU rules on goods) was great, as was the tone of his covering letter to Jean-Claude Juncker,"" one northern European diplomat told me. ""All very professional. I believe he wants a deal. That it wasn't just rhetoric."" This video can not be played DUP leader says new proposals ""sensible and serious"" Another hit with much of the EU audience was Boris Johnson's recognition that the backstop and any alternative arrangements to replace it would be specific to the island of Ireland and the delicate balance needed there to protect the Good Friday Agreement. The prime minister promised the UK would not seek to mirror advantages in that special arrangement in its other post-Brexit borders with the EU - such as the Dover-Calais crossing. But diplomats also echoed the concerns of the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who commented - tight-lipped - that while ""there's improvement... we're not there yet"". Brexit jargon explained 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Mr Barnier's team says it will have many detailed questions for the government on Thursday, after closer scrutiny of the UK offer. In fact, Boris Johnson's proposals raise a number of concerns for the EU, including a question mark over the regulatory alignment that the northern European diplomat so praised. You see, the prime minister calls for Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, not currently sitting, but which includes the ultra-unionist DUP party, to have a veto over the alignment. This means they could refuse to renew the agreement or even stop it ever kicking in. Some of the UK proposals concern regulatory alignment on the island of Ireland But the big flashing red light for the EU concerns customs arrangements. The EU thinks the prime minister's proposals would leave the single market exposed after Brexit (primarily because of smuggling risks but also VAT fraud) and could also pose a threat to the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU, led by Dublin, has ruled out any customs checks on the island of Ireland; any procedures that interrupt the all-Ireland economy. Another EU criticism is that the UK proposal lacks detail on how customs checks would be carried out, even away from the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. A high-level EU diplomat suggested to me that while it might eventually allow a time limit to the backstop/alternative arrangements (if Dublin could be persuaded), Brussels would need Boris Johnson to budge on customs. In the meantime, don't expect the EU to rush forward to crush the prime minister's proposals, because: A) EU leaders want a deal B) If there isn't going to be a deal, the EU doesn't want to be seen to be slamming the door in the UK's face. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker was quick to welcome the arrival of the UK proposals in Brussels on Wednesday. He expressed concern over some elements of the paper but also immediately volunteered that the EU would be available night and day for further negotiations. His intention: to put the ball back in the UK's court. Mr Juncker was quick to welcome the arrival of the UK proposals While the prime minister appears to have walked back from his declared ""take it or leave it"" approach - instead declaring that he would look carefully at the response - the EU questions how flexible he can or will want to be in further negotiations, especially with a general election looming. Brussels is keen to clear up a constant EU confusion since Boris Johnson became prime minister: should the EU believe it's in real negotiations with the government, or are the talks ultimately a backdrop to an election campaign for the prime minister? ""All eyes will now be on [Brexit Secretary] Steve Barclay,"" a senior EU source told me. ""He's the one who talks to the European Commission and he's the tough one."" There are diplomats who suggest that it's almost as if Boris Johnson and the Brexit secretary have a good cop, bad cop thing going when it comes to talking to the EU. Before the EU thinks of offering compromises - and Ireland is key here - it has to believe negotiations are sincere and that an acceptable agreement can be found. Is Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay playing the role of bad cop? Right now the differences between the two sides remain huge. There are also questions marks over whether seething MPs in Westminster would approve a ""Boris-engineered deal"" and also whether the European Parliament would give the go-ahead. MEPs are scheduled to outline their opposition to the Johnson proposals on Thursday. No-one I speak to on the EU side thinks a new Brexit deal can be done in time for the leaders' summit in mid-October. Few think it possible even by the end of the month. Ultimately the EU doesn't buy the prime minister's line that it's either this deal or no deal. Brussels believes another extension is the most likely new chapter in the ongoing Brexit process.

Trump lashes out at impeachment inquiryThe president steps up his attacks on Democrats as proceedings against him gather pace in Congress.,"This video can not be played Stand-off between Trump and reporter on Ukraine phone call US President Donald Trump has lashed out at congressional Democrats after they vowed to summons the White House to produce documents this week. Committees are demanding documents relating to the administration's dealings with Ukraine, which is now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry. The president accused Democratic leaders of dishonesty and even treason. Democrats have defended the inquiry - which focuses on a phone call between Mr Trump and the Ukrainian president. Warning: this report contains strong language During a joint news conference with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶, Mr Trump called Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, ""stone-cold corrupt"". Mr Trump directed much of his anger towards House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, calling him ""shifty Schiff, ""a lowlife"" and saying he ""should resign from office in disgrace"". He added: ""Frankly, they should look at him for treason."" Mr Trump also stated that he believed Mr Schiff had ""helped write"" a complaint about the call filed by a whistleblower, without offering evidence. Impeachment inquiry explained - in short and long form Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? The US president told reporters that only ""legitimate"" whistleblowers should be protected. ""This country has to find out who this person was, because that person's a spy, in my opinion,"" Mr Trump said. He labelled the entire inquiry a ""hoax"" and a ""fraudulent crime on the American people"" while maintaining he would ""always co-operate"" with Congress. This video can not be played Who is Rudy Giuliani? The US president also sparred at the White House with a Reuters correspondent, who asked him what he considered treasonous. As the Finnish leader looked on, Mr Trump said ""there are those who think I'm a very stable genius"" and said he ""probably will be bringing a lot of litigation"" against those who participated in the Russia investigation. When the reporter pressed Mr Trump, the US president cut him off, saying: ""Don't be rude."" Earlier, Mr Trump raged at the most powerful elected Democrat, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Mr Schiff on Twitter, accusing Democrats of focusing on ""BULLSHIT"".

Mr Trump said Mrs Pelosi should focus on her own city, San Francisco, which he described as a ""tent city"" of homeless people. The impeachment inquiry - which may seek to remove Mr Trump from office - stems from the whistleblower's complaint about his 25 July phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Analysis: Dissecting Trump's Ukraine phone calls Pompeo confirms he heard Trump-Ukraine call In the call, Mr Trump pressed for an investigation of his Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas firm that faced allegations of corruption. As vice-president and the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine, Mr Biden threatened to withhold US loan guarantees to the country unless it fired its top prosecutor, at a time when Hunter Biden's employer had been under official scrutiny. But European countries and international bodies had also wanted Viktor Shokin fired, accusing him of failing to clamp down on corruption. The Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr Shokin has told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. However, questions were raised at the time about a potential conflict of interest for the US vice-president. Democrats have pointed out Mr Trump's call with the newly elected Mr Zelensky took place at the same time as the US president decided to withhold military aid from Ukraine. From what has been shared of the call so far, Mr Trump did not directly reference withholding aid, but a full verbatim transcript has not been made available. Mr Trump's opponents say he was pressuring a vulnerable American ally to interfere in the 2020 US election for the US president's personal benefit. Democrats have accused the White House of blocking congressional inquiries and refusing to respond to record requests, which has prompted the subpoena threat this week. House oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings said in a memo: ""I do not take this step lightly. ""Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with - or even respond to - the committees."" The subpoena will request documents on Mr Trump's call with Ukraine and any related items from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the impeachment inquiry Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schiff held a joint news conference on Wednesday, defending the impeachment proceedings. ""We're not fooling around here,"" Mr Schiff said, adding that Democrats did not want the inquiry to ""drag on"". He also criticised the president's comments against the whistleblower as ""a blatant effort to intimidate witnesses"" and ""an incitement of violence"". Mr Schiff has also issued a statement saying his committee never reviewed or received the whistleblower's complaint in advance, as Mr Trump claimed. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached but neither was convicted and removed President Nixon resigned before he could have been impeached How could Trump be impeached?

Thomas Cook staff forced to turn to family for cashCrew and shop workers are borrowing from friends and family to pay bills after the firm's collapse.Business,"Abi Anderson (centre) with colleagues Shelley Matthews and Donna Kelly outside Downing Street. After 23 years with Thomas Cook, cabin crew member Abi Anderson learned over messaging app WhatsApp that last-ditch rescue talks to save the firm - and her job - had failed. About 9,000 staff in the UK were left jobless when the business failed to secure a last-ditch rescue deal. Ms Anderson, like all former staff of the collapsed travel firm, was due to be paid on Monday for September, but did not receive it because the firm is in liquidation ""Luckily, I didn't pay my credit card bill last month, so I had the cash in my bank."" But now she'll have to turn to her mum for help. ""The bank of mum will be coming to the rescue,"" she says. Ms Anderson joined former colleagues Donna Kelly and Shelley Matthews, and dozens of other ex-Thomas Cook staff to deliver a petition to Downing Street signed by more than 50,000 people demanding answers about the firm's collapse. They are also urging an inquiry into where the money from the business has gone. She blames the management, saying: ""These people are supposed to be the best at what they do and they've let us all down."" ""We need answers from them and - if there is something that isn't quite right - accountability for it."" Al White marched past Parliament with other former Thomas Cook staff. Former Cabin manager Al White says he is angry that the firm's boss, Peter Fankhauser, waspaid Â£8.3m in his five years at the top. ""We haven't got any money, we're literally just relying on friends, family [and] savings,"" he says. ""[Mr Fankhauser's] ok, we're not."" Shortly before it went under, Thomas Cook turned to the UK government for a Â£250m rescue package. But the government turned it down arguing that the troubled travel company would not survive even with a bailout. But Mr White thinks that was a mistake. ""If we'd been bailed out we could have paid money back like it was when the government bailed the banks out."" Instead, he says, that the government will now pick up a large share of the bill for repatriating holidaymakers and reimbursing travellers whose holidays have been cancelled. Alessandro Rossinelli is worried that Thomas Cook's failure may hurt his new wife's visa application. Former cabin crew member, Alessandro Rossinelli, said Â£250m was ""peanuts"" for the government, while 9,000 families were affected by the collapse. He got married earlier this year and fears that, without a job, he may not be able to sponsor his new wife's application for a UK visa. ""I support her so I don't know ifâ¦ they'll reject it,"" he says. Jo Cooke and Colleen Gibson say they believed assurances from Thomas Cook management that the firm would survive. Former store manager Jo Cooke worries that she misled customers about the health of the company in the days before it collapsed. Her colleague Colleen Gibson said they were told there would be ""a lot of noise"", but that ""it would be OK"". ""I don't know if we were just gullible or naive but we really believed that."" In a statement, the government said: ""The collapse of Thomas Cook is devastating for those who have lost their jobs and affected holidaymakers and the government will do all it can to support them."" ""Unfortunately a government bailout would not have solved the company's problems, which are well-documented."" Thomas Cook staff have been told to apply fortheir salary and redundancy related payments,externalfrom the Insolvency Service's Redundancy Payment Service (RPS). The Insolvency Service has said claims would be paid within 14 days of receipt of information, but ""special arrangements are being put in place to pay sooner if practicable to do so"".

Thomas Cook staff forced to turn to family for cash,"Abi Anderson (centre) with colleagues Shelley Matthews and Donna Kelly outside Downing Street. After 23 years with Thomas Cook, cabin crew member Abi Anderson learned over messaging app WhatsApp that last-ditch rescue talks to save the firm - and her job - had failed. About 9,000 staff in the UK were left jobless when the business failed to secure a last-ditch rescue deal. Ms Anderson, like all former staff of the collapsed travel firm, was due to be paid on Monday for September, but did not receive it because the firm is in liquidation ""Luckily, I didn't pay my credit card bill last month, so I had the cash in my bank."" But now she'll have to turn to her mum for help. ""The bank of mum will be coming to the rescue,"" she says. Ms Anderson joined former colleagues Donna Kelly and Shelley Matthews, and dozens of other ex-Thomas Cook staff to deliver a petition to Downing Street signed by more than 50,000 people demanding answers about the firm's collapse. They are also urging an inquiry into where the money from the business has gone. She blames the management, saying: ""These people are supposed to be the best at what they do and they've let us all down."" ""We need answers from them and - if there is something that isn't quite right - accountability for it."" Al White marched past Parliament with other former Thomas Cook staff. Former Cabin manager Al White says he is angry that the firm's boss, Peter Fankhauser, waspaid Â£8.3m in his five years at the top. ""We haven't got any money, we're literally just relying on friends, family [and] savings,"" he says. ""[Mr Fankhauser's] ok, we're not."" Shortly before it went under, Thomas Cook turned to the UK government for a Â£250m rescue package. But the government turned it down arguing that the troubled travel company would not survive even with a bailout. But Mr White thinks that was a mistake. ""If we'd been bailed out we could have paid money back like it was when the government bailed the banks out."" Instead, he says, that the government will now pick up a large share of the bill for repatriating holidaymakers and reimbursing travellers whose holidays have been cancelled. Alessandro Rossinelli is worried that Thomas Cook's failure may hurt his new wife's visa application. Former cabin crew member, Alessandro Rossinelli, said Â£250m was ""peanuts"" for the government, while 9,000 families were affected by the collapse. He got married earlier this year and fears that, without a job, he may not be able to sponsor his new wife's application for a UK visa. ""I support her so I don't know ifâ¦ they'll reject it,"" he says. Jo Cooke and Colleen Gibson say they believed assurances from Thomas Cook management that the firm would survive. Former store manager Jo Cooke worries that she misled customers about the health of the company in the days before it collapsed. Her colleague Colleen Gibson said they were told there would be ""a lot of noise"", but that ""it would be OK"". ""I don't know if we were just gullible or naive but we really believed that."" In a statement, the government said: ""The collapse of Thomas Cook is devastating for those who have lost their jobs and affected holidaymakers and the government will do all it can to support them."" ""Unfortunately a government bailout would not have solved the company's problems, which are well-documented."" Thomas Cook staff have been told to apply fortheir salary and redundancy related payments,externalfrom the Insolvency Service's Redundancy Payment Service (RPS). The Insolvency Service has said claims would be paid within 14 days of receipt of information, but ""special arrangements are being put in place to pay sooner if practicable to do so"".

Scotch whisky targeted by United States tariffs,"Single malt Scotch whisky exported to the United States is to face a tariff of 25% from 18 October. The new duty is part of a raft of measures being imposed by theUS in retaliation against EU subsidies given to aircraft maker Airbus. Other goods being targeted,externalinclude cashmere sweaters, dairy products, pork, books and some machinery. Scotch exports to the US last year were worth $1.3bn (Â£1bn), with single malts accounting for a large share of that. The US was given the go-ahead to impose tariffs on $7.5bn (Â£6.1bn) of goods it imports from the EU following a World Trade Organisation (WTO) ruling on Wednesday. It is the latest chapter in a 15-year battle between the US and the EU over illegal subsidies for planemakers Airbus and rival Boeing. The ruling by the WTO will mean tariffs on EU goods ranging from aircraft to agricultural products. Brussels has threatened to retaliate similarly against US goods. Karen Betts, chief executive of the Scotch Whisky Association, said it was a blow to the Scotch whisky sector. ""This is a serious situation for the industry,"" she said. ""We heard overnight that a 25% import tariff will be imposed on all single malts into the United States and also all Scotch whisky liqueurs, and that's from a position of zero. ""We've had a zero tariff on imports to the United States for the past 25 years, so this is quite a hike."" The Scotch whisky industry directly employs about 11,000 people in Scotland, and many more indirectly through its supply chain. More than 7,000 of the jobs are in rural areas across the country. A spokesman for the UK's Department for International Trade said: ""Resorting to tariffs is not in the interests of the UK, EU or US. ""The UK is working closely with the US, EU and European partners to support a negotiated settlement to the Airbus and Boeing disputes. ""The UK, through the EU, is seeking confirmation from the WTO that we have complied fully with WTO rulings regarding support to Airbus, and should not be subject to tariffs."" Airbus' A380 was unfairly subsidised, WTO says The US first filed the case in 2004, arguing that cheap European loans for Airbus amounted to illegal state subsidies. The WTO decided in favour of the US, which subsequently complained that the EU and certain member countries were not in compliance with the decision, prompting years of further wrangling. The US had sought to impose tariffs on about $11bn in goods. Though the WTO cut that figure to $7.5bn, Wednesday's decision still marks the largest penalty of its kind in the organisation's history. The WTO's dispute settlement body must formally adopt the ruling but is not expected to overturn the decision. US set to impose tariffs on $7.5bn of EU exports WTO warns trade wars could hit living standards US proposes tariffs on EU cheese and wine LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's casket heads to Georgia The '9/11 mastermind' is set to plead guilty.

Katya Adler: Will EU compromise?,"How will the EU respond to Mr Johnson's proposals? Workable proposals or non-workable proposals? That's the EU's question. The prime minister says he has delivered a ""constructive and reasonable"" plan to Brussels, containing UK compromises on finding alternative arrangements to the Irish backstop in a Brexit deal. Now it's the EU's turn, he reasons. So what compromises, if any, is the EU now willing to make? Well, Brussels' mantra since Boris Johnson became prime minister has been: we already compromised in our backstop agreement with Theresa May, if the UK's new PM wants to rip up that agreement and start again, then the onus is on him, not the EU, to find an alternative solution. The EU has said it needed concrete, legally operable, realistic UK proposals on the table before it could entertain re-thinking its position. UK proposals have now been delivered but the EU suspicion is that they are neither realistic, nor legally operable as they stand. Reality Check: What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? Kuenssberg: Johnson won't decide next Brexit steps And before anyone objects that ""the EU was always going to pour cold water on the PM's offer, whatever he said!"" let me tell you, it's not all gloom. Before the EU read the prime minister's offer, many predicted it would confirm their suspicion that his focus was on a domestic UK audience and on an upcoming general election - not on engaging with the EU. But senior diplomats told me on Wednesday night that some of Boris Johnson's proposals were ""better than expected"". ""His offer on regulatory alignment (keeping Northern Ireland tied to EU rules on goods) was great, as was the tone of his covering letter to Jean-Claude Juncker,"" one northern European diplomat told me. ""All very professional. I believe he wants a deal. That it wasn't just rhetoric."" This video can not be played DUP leader says new proposals ""sensible and serious"" Another hit with much of the EU audience was Boris Johnson's recognition that the backstop and any alternative arrangements to replace it would be specific to the island of Ireland and the delicate balance needed there to protect the Good Friday Agreement. The prime minister promised the UK would not seek to mirror advantages in that special arrangement in its other post-Brexit borders with the EU - such as the Dover-Calais crossing. But diplomats also echoed the concerns of the EU's chief Brexit negotiator, Michel Barnier, who commented - tight-lipped - that while ""there's improvement... we're not there yet"". Brexit jargon explained 10 ways no-deal Brexit could affect you Mr Barnier's team says it will have many detailed questions for the government on Thursday, after closer scrutiny of the UK offer. In fact, Boris Johnson's proposals raise a number of concerns for the EU, including a question mark over the regulatory alignment that the northern European diplomat so praised. You see, the prime minister calls for Northern Ireland's power-sharing government, not currently sitting, but which includes the ultra-unionist DUP party, to have a veto over the alignment. This means they could refuse to renew the agreement or even stop it ever kicking in. Some of the UK proposals concern regulatory alignment on the island of Ireland But the big flashing red light for the EU concerns customs arrangements. The EU thinks the prime minister's proposals would leave the single market exposed after Brexit (primarily because of smuggling risks but also VAT fraud) and could also pose a threat to the Northern Ireland peace process. The EU, led by Dublin, has ruled out any customs checks on the island of Ireland; any procedures that interrupt the all-Ireland economy. Another EU criticism is that the UK proposal lacks detail on how customs checks would be carried out, even away from the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. A high-level EU diplomat suggested to me that while it might eventually allow a time limit to the backstop/alternative arrangements (if Dublin could be persuaded), Brussels would need Boris Johnson to budge on customs. In the meantime, don't expect the EU to rush forward to crush the prime minister's proposals, because: A) EU leaders want a deal B) If there isn't going to be a deal, the EU doesn't want to be seen to be slamming the door in the UK's face. European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker was quick to welcome the arrival of the UK proposals in Brussels on Wednesday. He expressed concern over some elements of the paper but also immediately volunteered that the EU would be available night and day for further negotiations. His intention: to put the ball back in the UK's court. Mr Juncker was quick to welcome the arrival of the UK proposals While the prime minister appears to have walked back from his declared ""take it or leave it"" approach - instead declaring that he would look carefully at the response - the EU questions how flexible he can or will want to be in further negotiations, especially with a general election looming. Brussels is keen to clear up a constant EU confusion since Boris Johnson became prime minister: should the EU believe it's in real negotiations with the government, or are the talks ultimately a backdrop to an election campaign for the prime minister? ""All eyes will now be on [Brexit Secretary] Steve Barclay,"" a senior EU source told me. ""He's the one who talks to the European Commission and he's the tough one."" There are diplomats who suggest that it's almost as if Boris Johnson and the Brexit secretary have a good cop, bad cop thing going when it comes to talking to the EU. Before the EU thinks of offering compromises - and Ireland is key here - it has to believe negotiations are sincere and that an acceptable agreement can be found. Is Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay playing the role of bad cop? Right now the differences between the two sides remain huge. There are also questions marks over whether seething MPs in Westminster would approve a ""Boris-engineered deal"" and also whether the European Parliament would give the go-ahead. MEPs are scheduled to outline their opposition to the Johnson proposals on Thursday. No-one I speak to on the EU side thinks a new Brexit deal can be done in time for the leaders' summit in mid-October. Few think it possible even by the end of the month. Ultimately the EU doesn't buy the prime minister's line that it's either this deal or no deal. Brussels believes another extension is the most likely new chapter in the ongoing Brexit process.

Government publishes new Brexit proposals,"The government has delivered its new Brexit proposals to the EU, including plans to replace the Irish backstop. The plan, outlined in a seven-page document,external, would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods, but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks. The Northern Ireland Assembly would get to approve the arrangements first and vote every four years on keeping them. The European Commission said there had been progress but ""problems"" remained. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar said the new blueprint did not ""fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"", in terms of upholding the EU's single market, protecting peace in Northern Ireland and supporting economic co-operation with the Republic of Ireland. But he said he wanted an agreement and talks would continue. Kuenssberg: Johnson won't decide next Brexit steps Reality Check: What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? How does the border plan differ from the backstop? The UK is set to leave the EU on 31 October and the government has insisted it will not negotiate a further delay beyond the Halloween deadline. Speaking at the Conservative Party conference earlier on Wednesday, Boris Johnson said the only alternative to his Brexit plan was no-deal. This video can not be played PM: Boris Johnson: ""It (no deal) is not an outcome we want... but is an outcome for which we are ready"" In a letter to European Commission's president,external, Jean-Claude Juncker, the prime minister said the new proposals ""respect the decision taken by the people of the UK to leave the EU, while dealing pragmatically with that decision's consequences in Northern Ireland and in Ireland"". Government sources hoped the UK might be able to enter an intense 10-day period of negotiations with the EU almost immediately, with the aim of coming to a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October. Mr Juncker welcomed what he said were ""positive advances"" in some areas but he said the UK's proposed system of ""governance"" of the new arrangements was ""problematic"" - and customs rules remained a concern. This video can not be played Chief EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier: ""There is progress, but to be frank, lots of work still needs to be done"" Don't expect the EU to rush to reject the prime minister's proposals even though there are elements that clearly contravene EU red lines, such as the implementation of any kind of customs procedures between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Jean-Claude Juncker spoke today of ""concerns"" arising from the text but EU leaders won't want to be seen to be the ones closing the door to a deal. Throughout the Brexit process they've repeatedly kicked the ball back into the UK government's court. On cue, leaders are ""welcoming the delivery of the proposals from the government"" and inviting the prime minister to continue negotiations. The fundamental questions for the EU remain: How much does does the prime minister really want a deal? Is he willing to move from his apparent ""take it or leave it"" position? If he is, there will be something to talk about. If not, the EU will try its best to avoid being the ones to say ""forget it"". But Mr Johnson should think again if he imagines his proposals, which do include concessions from his side, will prompt EU countries with a lot to lose in a no deal Brexit (like Germany) to try to force Ireland to accept his offer. Angela Merkel today insisted EU leaders would stick together. With such an important EU member leaving, Mrs Merkel believes unity amongst those left behind is paramount. Arlene Foster, leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party, supported the plan, saying it would allow Northern Ireland to leave the customs union and single market at the same time as the rest of the UK. Johnson: No-deal only alternative to Brexit plan Several Conservative MPs who opposed Theresa May's agreement also signalled their likely support, with leading Brexiteer Steve Baker saying he was ""cautiously optimistic"". This video can not be played DUP leader says new proposals ""sensible and serious"" But Sinn Fein said the plans were a ""non-starter"" and accused the DUP, their former power-sharing partners of ""working against the interests of the people"" of Northern Ireland. And Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was ""not acceptable"" and ""worse"" than Theresa May's agreement, as it ""undermined"" the Good Friday Agreement that secured peace in Northern Ireland. The prime minister has set out details of his plan to replace theIrish border ""backstop""in the current Brexit agreement. The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone"" This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes. Mr Johnson has written to the European Commission president about his proposals German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who has spoken to Mr Johnson, said the EU would study the proposals carefully. She said she ""trusted"" the bloc's Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier to maintain European unity. But opponents of Brexit in Parliament indicated they would not support the proposals, unless they were accompanied by the promise of another referendum. The Liberal Democrats, who want to stop Brexit, said the proposals would deal a ""hammer blow"" to the Northern Irish economy. The Scottish National Party dismissed the proposals as ""window dressing"".

Government to set out Brexit plan to MPs,"This video can not be played Brexit: Reaction to Boris Johnson's Irish border proposals Boris Johnson is setting out his proposals for a Brexit deal in Parliament, while EU leaders also consider their response. He outlined plans on Wednesday that would see Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods but leave the customs union - resulting in new customs checks. The European Commission welcomed ""advances"" but said problems remained. The PM says the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. He insists he will not ask for a further extension if no deal is reached despite legislation designed to force him to do so unless MPs pass a deal or approve a no-deal Brexit before 19 October. Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, whose stance is expected to guide how the EU responds, said the UK's approach ""did not fully meet the agreed objectives of the backstop"". The backstop is a mechanism designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. However, he did add he would study the proposals ""in further detail"". European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker will speak to Mr Varadkar later, the commission has said.

The UK government hopes to begin a period of intense negotiations with the aim of reaching a final agreement at an EU summit on 17 October. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay told BBC Breakfast that the government's plan set out to the EU were ""serious proposals"" and were recognised by EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier as such. He said both sides ""recognise that it is better to have a deal"" and negotiations ""will have to be intensively done in the next few days"". There will be further talks on Friday ""subject to how today unfolds"", Mr Barclay said. Many EU leaders feared, before they saw it, that the plan would show the prime minister was focused on a domestic audience, on an upcoming general election and not engaging with the EU. But I have spoken to a number of EU diplomats tonight who say some of the proposals were better than expected. But they emphasised very big differences remain between the two sides. The EU has a number of concerns when it comes to the prime minister's offer. And the European Commission says before it can think of compromise it has a number of detailed questions for the government, when it has properly digested the paper. The main concern for the EU, the big flashing lights, come down to customs. It fears the prime minister's offer could pose a threat to the Northern Ireland peace process and leave the single market exposed after Brexit. Those are two big no-nos for the EU. Looking forward, they have to come to agreement and unanimity among themselves Any idea in the UK that EU leaders will turn to Ireland and say ""you need to compromise because we want a deal with the UK"" is not one we are hearing behind the scenes or in public. Will EU compromise after receiving UK Brexit proposals? The PM's Brexit plan set out details of a replacement for the Irish border ""backstop"" in the current Brexit agreement. The backstop is the controversial ""insurance policy"" that is meant to keep a free-flowing border on the island of Ireland but which critics - including the PM - fear could trap the UK in EU trading rules indefinitely. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would, with the consent of politicians in the Northern Ireland Assembly, continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products - what he calls an ""all-island regulatory zone"" This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" The government is also promising a ""New Deal for Northern Ireland"", with financial commitments to help manage the changes. TheDemocratic Unionist Party - whose votes the government is likely to need to pass the deal - have supported the plansaying it would allow Northern Ireland to leave the customs union and single market at the same time as the rest of the UK. The party's Westminster leader Nigel Dodds told BBC Breakfast that the proposals ""remove the trap"" of the backstop and he said they were ""a massive improvement"". However, other Northern Ireland parties criticised the proposals. Sinn Fein called the plans a ""non-starter"", the Social Democratic and Labour Party said they were ""dead on arrival"", and the Ulster Unionist Party argued Northern Ireland would be left in a ""perpetual cycle of uncertainty"". Irish Minister for European Affairs Helen McEntee said there were ""concerns"" and ""obvious challenges"" with the plan. ""I've always said there are grounds for a deal but there are key objectives we need to meet: protecting the Good Friday Agreement, and to prevent border infrastructure, protecting the economy and the single market,"" she said. This video can not be played DUP leader says new proposals ""sensible and serious"" Several Conservative MPs who rejected Theresa May's withdrawal agreement signalled their support. Leading Brexiteer Steve Baker said it was ""highly likely"" the deal would get through Parliament. And fellow Brexiteer Bernard Jenkin told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there was ""a mood for compromise"" and ""very strong grounds for optimism"" as ""people want to get this done"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the deal was ""not acceptable"" and the Lib Dem's Jo Swinson accused Mr Johnson of not being ""serious about getting a deal"". Labour MP Hilary Benn, chairman of the Commons Brexit Committee called the proposals ""worse than Theresa May's"", saying: ""How will it help peace and stability in Northern Ireland if every four years there is a divisive debate about whether to follow UK or EU rules?"" Scotland's First Minister and SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon said the proposals were ""designed to fail"". If the EU and UK cannot agree a deal which is approved by MPs by 19 October, the prime minister is compelled by the Benn Act to seek an extension to the Brexit negotiation process unless the Commons votes to leave without a deal. However, the prime minister has repeatedly insisted the UK will leave the EU on 31 October with or without a deal, and that he will not ask for an extension.

"Drug exports restricted 'to protect NHS patients'Hormone replacement therapy, contraceptives and adrenaline pens are all on the government's list.Health","The UK government has announced a ban on some drug exports to protect NHS patients' access to medicines. The 24 medicines affected include hormone replacement therapy drugs, contraceptives and adrenaline pens. The move comes aftera survey of local pharmacists found shortages of every major type of medicine,externalin the past six months. Ministers said the restrictions were not linked to Brexit and medicine shortages did occasionally occur. Pharmaceutical industry leaders welcomed the move, saying stockpiles of medicines would now be better protected and available for NHS use only. The government restrictions will stop wholesalers selling some medicines meant for UK patients for a higher price in another country, potentially causing or worsening supply problems. The drugs on the export ban list,externalinclude 19 HRT drugs and five other medicines, includingall adrenaline pens for severe allergies, hepatitis B vaccines and a number of contraceptives. About 360,000 prescriptions of HRT, which relieve symptoms of the menopause, are dispensed every month, But these drugs, along with contraceptives and anti-epileptic drugs, are in short supply, according to a UK-wide survey of 402 community pharmacies by the Chemist and Druggist. The government has also introduced a ""serious shortage protocol"" for the antidepressant Fluoxetine, which allows pharmacists to give patients an alternative strength or form of the drug because of temporary shortages of some doses. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""I know how distressing medicine shortages can be for those who rely on drugs like HRT and it is absolutely crucial patients can always access safe and effective treatments through the NHS."" The new measures would help ""ensure patients get the medicines they need"", he added. Dr Rick Greville, from the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry, said: ""It means that these stockpiles of medicines which companies have built over previous months are better protected and available for use only by the NHS patients for which they were intended. ""Companies can now work with the [health] department to identify any problem areas."" This is an unprecedented move for the UK. Some other EU countries have considered such action or implemented measures in the past to stop the flow of drugs out of their countries. The Greek authorities, for example, banned exports during the financial crisis. But it's the first time the government has decided the risk of shortages for NHS patients requires intervention to protect supplies. UK wholesalers with regulatory licences have the right to move stocks of drugs to sell in other European markets if they wish. The incentive to do so in the eurozone increases as the pound weakens. Now, they have been told they will lose those licences if they shift products elsewhere. Officials say the risk of the UK leaving the European Union without a withdrawal agreement in place is not the reason for the new policy, as shortages do occur from time to time in the medicine markets. But that is certainly the backdrop to the new export ban, as ministers decide action is needed to protect existing supplies. Dr Farah Jameel, from the British Medical Association, said there were lots of different reasons why drugs shortages happened. ""But they are gradually getting worse and can have a serious effect on how quickly patients receive appropriate treatment,"" she said. ""Practices often won't know that a drug is in short supply until patients return from the pharmacy and these extra GP appointments can dramatically add to their already burgeoning workload - as well as distressing patients."" Patients should continue to order their repeat prescriptions and keep taking their medicines as normal - but not ask for more medicines than they need, the Department for Health and Social Care said. It added it was working to ensure the supply of medicines and medical products ""remains uninterrupted after 31 October, [when the UK is set to leave the EU,] whatever the circumstances"". The government has made arrangements to stockpile six weeks' supply of drugs for the NHS in case of a no-deal exit from the EU. But a recent report saidit was not clear exactly what level of stockpiling was in place.

Trump angrily lashes out at impeachment inquiry,"This video can not be played Stand-off between Trump and reporter on Ukraine phone call US President Donald Trump has lashed out at congressional Democrats after they vowed to summons the White House to produce documents this week. Committees are demanding documents relating to the administration's dealings with Ukraine, which is now at the heart of an impeachment inquiry. The president accused Democratic leaders of dishonesty and even treason. Democrats have defended the inquiry - which focuses on a phone call between Mr Trump and the Ukrainian president. Warning: this report contains strong language During a joint news conference with Finnish President Sauli NiinistÃ¶, Mr Trump called Mr Biden and his son, Hunter, ""stone-cold corrupt"". Mr Trump directed much of his anger towards House Intelligence Committee Chairman Adam Schiff, calling him ""shifty Schiff, ""a lowlife"" and saying he ""should resign from office in disgrace"". He added: ""Frankly, they should look at him for treason."" Mr Trump also stated that he believed Mr Schiff had ""helped write"" a complaint about the call filed by a whistleblower, without offering evidence. Impeachment inquiry explained - in short and long form Who's who in Trump whistleblower story? The US president told reporters that only ""legitimate"" whistleblowers should be protected. ""This country has to find out who this person was, because that person's a spy, in my opinion,"" Mr Trump said. He labelled the entire inquiry a ""hoax"" and a ""fraudulent crime on the American people"" while maintaining he would ""always co-operate"" with Congress. This video can not be played Who is Rudy Giuliani? The US president also sparred at the White House with a Reuters correspondent, who asked him what he considered treasonous. As the Finnish leader looked on, Mr Trump said ""there are those who think I'm a very stable genius"" and said he ""probably will be bringing a lot of litigation"" against those who participated in the Russia investigation. When the reporter pressed Mr Trump, the US president cut him off, saying: ""Don't be rude."" Earlier, Mr Trump raged at the most powerful elected Democrat, House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and Mr Schiff on Twitter, accusing Democrats of focusing on ""BULLSHIT"".

Mr Trump said Mrs Pelosi should focus on her own city, San Francisco, which he described as a ""tent city"" of homeless people. The impeachment inquiry - which may seek to remove Mr Trump from office - stems from the whistleblower's complaint about his 25 July phone conversation with President Volodymyr Zelensky. Analysis: Dissecting Trump's Ukraine phone calls Pompeo confirms he heard Trump-Ukraine call In the call, Mr Trump pressed for an investigation of his Democratic political rival Joe Biden and his son, who worked for a Ukrainian gas firm that faced allegations of corruption. As vice-president and the Obama administration's point man on Ukraine, Mr Biden threatened to withhold US loan guarantees to the country unless it fired its top prosecutor, at a time when Hunter Biden's employer had been under official scrutiny. But European countries and international bodies had also wanted Viktor Shokin fired, accusing him of failing to clamp down on corruption. The Ukrainian prosecutor general who took over from Mr Shokin has told the BBC there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden. However, questions were raised at the time about a potential conflict of interest for the US vice-president. Democrats have pointed out Mr Trump's call with the newly elected Mr Zelensky took place at the same time as the US president decided to withhold military aid from Ukraine. From what has been shared of the call so far, Mr Trump did not directly reference withholding aid, but a full verbatim transcript has not been made available. Mr Trump's opponents say he was pressuring a vulnerable American ally to interfere in the 2020 US election for the US president's personal benefit. Democrats have accused the White House of blocking congressional inquiries and refusing to respond to record requests, which has prompted the subpoena threat this week. House oversight committee chairman Elijah Cummings said in a memo: ""I do not take this step lightly. ""Over the past several weeks, the committees tried several times to obtain voluntary compliance with our requests for documents, but the White House has refused to engage with - or even respond to - the committees."" The subpoena will request documents on Mr Trump's call with Ukraine and any related items from acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff and Speaker Nancy Pelosi defended the impeachment inquiry Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schiff held a joint news conference on Wednesday, defending the impeachment proceedings. ""We're not fooling around here,"" Mr Schiff said, adding that Democrats did not want the inquiry to ""drag on"". He also criticised the president's comments against the whistleblower as ""a blatant effort to intimidate witnesses"" and ""an incitement of violence"". Mr Schiff has also issued a statement saying his committee never reviewed or received the whistleblower's complaint in advance, as Mr Trump claimed. Impeachment is the first part - the charges - of a two-stage political process by which Congress can remove a president from office If the House of Representatives votes to pass articles of impeachment, the Senate is forced to hold a trial A Senate vote requires a two-thirds majority to convict - unlikely in this case, given that Mr Trump's party controls the chamber Only two US presidents in history - Bill Clinton and Andrew Johnson - have been impeached but neither was convicted and removed President Nixon resigned before he could have been impeached How could Trump be impeached?
