MPs admit using Commons offices for paid meeting,"Layla Moran insisted ""it will not happen again"" Two MPs have admitted using their Commons offices for non-parliamentary paid meetings. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran and Conservative Crispin Blunt appeared via video link on a panel discussing political prisoners in Saudi Arabia. The event last November was organised by law firm Bindmans LLP. According to the register of financial interests for MPs, Ms Moran was paid Â£3,000 by the firm and Mr Blunt received Â£6,000. Bindmans described the meeting as an ""evidence session"", which heard from human rights organisations and family members of detained Saudi Arabian activists. Under House of Commons rules, MPs must not use the parliamentary facilities for non-parliamentary work. Which MPs have second jobs? MPs under scrutiny over their second jobs Ms Moran, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, has apologised and said she ""deeply regretted"" it. In a statement, Ms Moran said: ""With MPs from other parties, I worked on the detention of political prisoners in Saudi Arabia with Bindmans. ""I deeply regret that I 'zoomed' in for one meeting from my office in Parliament when Covid restrictions were in place. ""I take full responsibility for this and it will not happen again."" Crispin Blunt said MPs were being subjected to an ""absurd feeding frenzy"" Mr Blunt, who represents Reigate, told the BBC it did not occur to him that there would be an issue using a room in Parliament at no cost to the taxpayer. He said the MPs on the panel were discussing a matter of ""serious public concern"" and emphasised he would accept the findings of any investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner if a complaint was made. He told the BBC: ""It was a parliamentary panel, although one not formed as either an all-party-parliamentary group or a select committee. He added: ""I have chaired three of these detention review panels over recent years and as the panel members were all parliamentarians, each panel cross party, advised by legal counsel, examining matters of serious public and human rights concern - that on any reasonable interpretation the work would meet a definition of being 'parliamentary'."" Mr Blunt continued that while the panel members had been paid a fee for their time and expertise devoted to the work, it had been declared in the usual way, and the process was open to public scrutiny throughout. He said he thought MPs were being subjected to an ""absurd feeding frenzy"" by the media in relation to their additional work that was now ""doing wider damage to the institution of Parliament by creating a wholly inaccurate image in the mind of the wider public"". Politicians are allowed to have second jobs outside Westminster but the work they do has come under the spotlight sinceTory MP Owen Paterson, who has since stood down, broke lobbying ruleswhen working as a consultant. And questions have been raised about Conservative MP andformer attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox, who earned about Â£900,000last year through his work outside Parliament. He notched up the wage bill in his work as a lawyer, including travelling to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to advise on a corruption inquiry. Labour chair Anneliese Dodds previously accused him of taking advantage of Covid restrictions to work remotely from the Caribbean. No 10 said MPs should be ""visible in their constituencies and available to help constituents with their constituency matters"".

"Fears raised over exodus of NHS consultantsBMA Scotland warns ""rock bottom morale"" and a pensions tax row is forcing top medics to consider their future.Scotland","Scotland's health service could face an exodus of consultants, a leading doctor has warned. Dr Graeme Eunson, chairman of the British Medical Association Scotland's consultant committee, also said he cannot recall a time in his career ""when things have been this tough"". The consultant paediatrician said ""rock bottom morale"" as well as concerns over pension tax charges was to blame. Ministers have warned the NHS is facing its toughest ever winter. The Scottish government hasput in a Â£300m funding packageto help the health services get through what it described as the ""extremely challenging"" months ahead. Hospitals secure military aid extension 'Nursing shifts left me inconsolable' Â£300m fund to help Scots NHS through 'challenging' winter Butwriting in a blog,external, Dr Eunson warned the NHS in Scotland ""is in full blown crisis"". He said: ""What I hear consistently is that consultants are prepared to stick at it for this winter and while we remain in pandemic. ""And that's backed up by evidence from our recent survey of doctors following this year's pay award. ""When you analyse those figures, and filter out those too young to take voluntary early retirement (VER), some 70% of consultants asked said they were planning to take VER - either prompted (19.2%), or confirmed (30%) by the pay award, or were going to do it regardless of pay (21%). ""If this is in any way representative - and we fear it is - and we don't act urgently, then the NHS faces an exodus of consultants from NHS Scotland in the near future."" In August, doctors and dental staff in Scotland wereawarded a 3% pay rise backdated to 1 April. Armed forces personnel have been helping some of Scotland's health boards, with tasks such as rolling out the Covid vaccination programme. in recent months Dr Eunson cited an ongoingcomplex row over tax bills for consultants' pensionswhich he said has left some colleagues facing the prospect of retiring or working less to ensure they are not out of pocket. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf has previously said the health service was experiencing ""significant pressure"" because of Covid admissions and a backlog in care built up over the course of the pandemic. Military assistance is in place at a number of health boards across the country and waiting times for A&E remain at record levels. Dr Eunson added that ""stop-gap solutions may just help us get through this winter - although that remains to be seen - but even beyond that the picture looks bleak."" A Scottish government spokesperson said the health secretary meets regularly with the BMA where issues related to the workforce are discussed. ""We recognise the challenges health and social care services are experiencing,"" they added. ""That is why we have announced a record Â£300m of new investment in measures to help services deal with system pressures over winter. ""To ensure our health and social care staff can continue to be able to best care for us, we need to make sure we continue to care for them by looking after their wellbeing this winter. This is why we are investing an additional Â£4m in staff wellbeing measures, in addition to the Â£8m made available through the NHS Recovery Plan. ""As well as direct workforce investment, we are introducing measures to maximise capacity in our hospitals, reduce delayed discharges and improve social care pay. These measures will ensure patients are cared for in the right setting within their community and alleviate pressures on frontline health services."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all. Before we say goodbye - here are some of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Day one started off with hundreds of people having to wait in long queues to get into the venue Former US President Barack Obama brought some star power to the summit, and called on young activists to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pictured maskless and resting his eyes inside the hall And was his US counterpart, President Joe Biden, asleep or just resting his eyes? The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively
as a team we have achieved what many people doubted."" It's been a long, long day and the COP president is now facing the press. He says he's had six hours sleep in the last few days. Stay with us for updates. Georgina RannardBBC News Sohanur Rahman, 25, is a founding member of Bangladeshâs Friday for Future movement, leading youth activists in the country as they face the dire effects of rising sea levels and flooding. As the Glasgow agreement was gavelled, he told me that youth were recognised for the first time at COP, but âthe end result is nothingâ. He feels helpless and betrayed going back to Bangladesh with this agreement and says the ""empty pledges"" won't protect anyone from the climate crisis. He does not believe it will limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C, despite what politicians say. ""We have no scope to hold them accountable,"" he explains. He welcomes the good news on loss and damage - an acknowledgment from rich countries that poor nations need support paying for impacts of climate change they can't adapt to. But the voices of the most affected people were silenced, he says - âthe interest of the fossil fuel corporations have been clearly pandered to by the UK COP presidency.â This video can not be played COP26 deal changes 'a real blow' - Marshall Islands Tina Stege, climate envoy for Marshall Islands, has sent us her reaction to the deal. Her highly vulnerable Pacific Island country is at risk of being wiped out by climate change. She says last-minute changes to the wording on coal and the weakened language on loss and damage are ""blows"". There was a conversation we were not a part of and it was a real blow.. We had been told that there would be no further changes to the text and we had already swallowed some changes that were difficult to swallow."" Tina Stege But the ""real progress made"" in Glasgow is a ""lifeline"" for her country and it should not be discounted, she argues. Stege is pleased that money on climate finance was secured. And she says it's positive that countries are being called on to submit new targets to reduce emissions next year. Disappointment being expressed with the final pact is ""understandable"" after key issues were ""watered down in the final hours"", Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. However, the SNP politician adds there ""can be no doubt"" the negotiations in Glasgow have led to improvement on some key areas. While there has been much positive progress, there is no escaping the fact that COP26 has not delivered as much as global south countries, activists and campaigners rightly demanded and I firmly believe that the leaders of the rich developed countries must go further."" Nicola Sturgeon UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a short statement on Twitter praising the deal reached by leaders in Glasgow - but says there is more work to be done.  We asked nations to come together for our planet at @COP26, and they have answered that call. I want to thank the leaders, negotiators and campaigners who made this pact happen â and the people of Glasgow who welcomed them with open arms.  I also want particularly to thank COP President Alok Sharma who has worked incredibly hard to bring countries together.  Today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5C.  I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal.""  While he may not be enthused with the deal, Shadow business minister  - and former Labour leader - Ed Miliband has nothing but praise for  Alok Sharma. He says Sharma, a Tory MP and minister of state at the cabinet office, has shown himself to be a ""person of decency, integrity and commitment"". Throughout the afternoon, the COP26 president has been seen flitting between various delegations, discussing the text and working to get the deal across the line. Allow Twitter content?

COP President Alok Sharma is still inside the conference hall, but he is expected to give a news conference when the official proceedings are done. The lectern is ready, flags and all, along with 100 journalists waiting for him outside the hall. India, along with China, pushed for the last-minute change to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But why? India - the world's third-largest emitter of fossil fuels - still relies heavily on coal, which makes up 70% of the country's energy production. A big part of their position can be summed up by comments from India's environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav earlier. He asked how anyone could expect developing countries to make promises on phasing out coal when they have still to deal with their development agendas and eradicating poverty. On top of that, four million people are employed in India's coal industry - and in the last decade the country's coal consumption has nearly doubled. It  continues to import large quantities of coal and is planning to open dozens of new mines in the coming years despite pledges to invest massively in renewable energy. An average Indian still consumes far less power than a Brit or an American. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively
as a team we have achieved what many people doubted."" It's been a long, long day and the COP president is now facing the press. He says he's had six hours sleep in the last few days.

It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe.

New global climate deal struck in GlasgowNew global climate deal agreed at COP26 in Glasgow after last-minute wrangling over agreement on cutting coal,"This video can not be played Alok Sharma fights back tears as Glasgow Climate Pact reached A deal aimed at staving off dangerous climate change has been struck at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries - to help them adapt to climate impacts. But the pledges don't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C. A commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts led to a dramatic finish after India and China led opposition to it. India's climate minister Bhupender Yadav asked how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they ""have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication"". In the end, countries agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, amid expressions of disappointment by some. COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" for how events had unfolded. Evasive words, but deal shows progress He fought back tears as he told delegates that it was vital to protect the agreement as a whole. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the world would ""look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change"". ""There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,"" he said. John Kerry, the US envoy for climate, said it wasalways unlikely that the Glasgow summit would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"", but that the ""starting pistol"" had been fired. How the final day unfolded Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the planet was ""hanging by a thread"". ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe... it is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero."" As part of the agreement, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such asmillions more people being exposed to extreme heat.,external Main achievements of the deal: Re-visiting emissions-cutting plans next year to try to keep 1.5C target reachable The first ever inclusion of a commitment to limit coal use Increased financial help for developing countries ""We would like to express our profound disappointment that the language we agreed on, on coal and fossil fuels subsidies, has been further watered down,"" Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said. ""This will not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it."" Despite the weakening of language around coal, some observers will still see the deal as a victory, underlining that it is the first time coal is explicitly mentioned in UN documents of this type. Coal is responsible for about 40% of annual CO2 emissions, making it central in efforts to keep within the 1.5C target. To meet this goal, agreed in Paris in 2015, global emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and to nearly zero by mid-century. ""They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP - that the era of coal is ending,"" said Greenpeace international executive director Jennifer Morgan. However, Lars Koch, a policy director for charity ActionAid, said it was disappointing that only coal was mentioned. ""This gives a free pass to the rich countries who have been extracting and polluting for over a century to continue producing oil and gas,"" he said. Sara Shaw, from Friends of the Earth International, said the outcome was ""nothing less than a scandal"". ""Just saying the words 1.5 degrees is meaningless if there is nothing in the agreement to deliver it. COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global South countries,"" she said. Finance was a contentious issue during the conference. A pledge by developed nations to provide $100bn (Â£75bn) per year to emerging economies, made in 2009, was supposed to have been delivered by 2020. However, the date was missed. It was designed to help developing nations adapt to climate effects and make the transition to clean energy. In an effort to mollify delegates, Mr Sharma said around $500bn would be mobilised by 2025. Scientists say extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, are becoming more frequent because of climate change But poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage - the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they are unable to adapt to. This was one of the big disappointments of the conference for many delegations. Despite their dissatisfaction, several countries that stood to benefit backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue. Delegations pushing for greater progress on the issue included those from countries in Africa, such as Guinea and Kenya, as well as Latin American states, small island territories and nations in Asia such as the Philippines. Lia Nicholson, delegate for Antigua and Barbuda, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said: ""We recognise the presidency's efforts to try and create a space to find common ground. The final landing zone, however, is not even close to capturing what we had hoped."" Shauna Aminath, environment minister for the low-lying Maldives, said: ""We have 98 months to halve global emissions. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us.""

Should we stop eating meat to fight climate change?,"Almost a quarter of global greenhouse gas emissions comes from agriculture and other related land use, according to the United Nations. With livestock being one of the main contributors, the government's climate advisers have saidthe public should be urged to less meatto help protect the planet. Meat consumption in the UK dropped by17% in the decade to 2019,with the average daily amount eaten per person falling from from 3.6oz (103g) to 3oz. But while most people are eating less red and processed meat compared to a decade ago, they are eating more white meat, according to a study published inLancet Planetary Health.,external More than one billion chickens and other poultry were killed for food in the UK in 2018. The impact of livestock on emissions varies between countries. Globally, the UN estimates it makes up more than14% of all man-made greenhouse gases,,externalincluding methane. When we talk about emissions, we usually think of carbon dioxide (CO2). But livestock's emissions also include methane, which is up to 34 times more damaging to the environment over 100 years than CO2,according to the UN.,external Beef produces the most greenhouse gas emissions, which include methane. A global average of110lb (50kg) of greenhouse gases is released per 3.5oz of protein.,external Lamb has the next highest environmental footprint but these emissions are 50% less than beef. Cattle produce more methane than poultry, which rely more on imported feed than cows, generating a carbon footprint offshore, says Prof Margaret Gill, from University of Aberdeen. Measuring and comparing the environmental impact of different foods is not simple. This is partly because some measurements include emissions from processing, packaging and transportation, rather than just the farming process. The diagram below is based on research published in the Science journal, which estimated emissions per serving of different foods. It shows a wide range of potential environmental impact, even within the same foods, depending on how and where they are produced. According to the UK'sAgriculture and Horticulture Development Board,,externalgreenhouse gas emissions are lower from UK-produced beef, partly because the ""landscape and climate is perfect for growing grass, with grasslands covering 65% of our farmland and 50% of total land"". This means cows don't rely as much on grain and other feed, which can have a high carbon footprint. Other factors around the world vary the environmental impact. Beef production is the leading cause of deforestation in tropical rainforests such as the Amazon, says food sustainability researcher Valentina Caldart. This adds to the environmental impact of beef from that part of the world. The true climate impact of what we eat is not easy to calculate, says Prof Gill. ""Carbon footprints of food vary with how it is produced and where it comes from, and thus changes with the seasons,"" she says. So, as well as cutting down on red meat and dairy, people who want to make their diets more climate-friendly can follow principles including minimising waste and trying to choose fruit and vegetables that are in season. Prof Gill says there is: ""A need for transition - albeit fairly rapid - rather than abrupt change."" Many people wanting to reduce the environmental impact of their diets have cut out animal products such as milk and cheese. According to the Vegan Society, there were600,000 vegans in the UK in 2018. The biggest environmental impact of non-meat products comes from land use change, the effect on soil quality and things like transport and packaging. Non-animal protein generally emits much less greenhouse gases than meat and dairy. ""Replacing beef with pork may sound like a good choice,"" says Ms Caldart. ""But opting for peas instead would be even better: their production results in 90% less emissions."" How we produce our food does not just affect our global emissions, but has a wider environmental impact, such as on biodiversity. ""We live on a planet where nature is being squeezed out"" says Mike Barrett, executive director of science and conservation at the World Wildlife Fund. ""Half of all habitable land is used for agriculture, and three-quarters of that land is used to feed and raise livestock."" Mr Barrett says: ""To feed a growing world population, it's far more efficient to use land to produce crops that people can consume directly, and to have a fair global approach ensuring that parts of the world with diets high in meat and dairy shift towards more plant-based foods."" Adopting a ""flexitarian"" diet would also allow us to move away from factory farming with its low animal welfare standards, says Peter Stevenson, chief policy adviser to the charity Compassion in World Farming.

How might decisions made at COP26 change our lives?,"Now that a deal has been agreed and signed at the climate summit in Glasgow, you might be left wondering what it will mean for you. Here are some ways in which the decisions made at COP26 could change your life. Switching to an electric car is among a number of lifestyle changes we're likely to be making. Experts predict that new electric vehicles could cost the same as new petrol or diesel cars within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market, where these vehicles are cheaper. Dozens of countries, regions and car companies have agreed to ramp up the use of electric vehicles and bring in new zero-emission buses and trucks. Meanwhile, others argue we need fewer cars on the road - walking and cycling more could also be among the changes we make. How can an average family afford an electric car? More than 40 countries have signed up to phasing out coal. A similar number have committed to ensuring that clean energy is the most reliable and affordable option for powering our homes and businesses. For countries like the UK, this will mean continuing the move towards renewable sources such as wind and solar energy - and possibly more reliance on nuclear energy. COP26 lacked a breakthrough announcement committing the world's biggest coal-users such as China and India to ending its use. However, it's hoped the announcements made at Glasgow will send a signal to the market that it is worth investing in renewable energy. Solar panels and heat pumps could become standard in our homes. We'll build new houses using low-carbon alternatives to cement and concrete - and try to re-fit old ones. How much do heat pumps cost and how do they work? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? There's also a focus on making sure our buildings, infrastructure and communities are able to withstand the current and future impact of climate change. Eva Hinkers, Arup Sustainable Development Director says: ""We also need to make sure [buildings] are fit for more extreme scenarios."" This could include improving green space in and around our homes to absorb extreme rainfall, installing ""cool roofs"" that reflect sunlight and prevent overheating, or introducing shutters so homes can withstand hurricane winds. Our lifestyles contribute to carbon emissions, whether we're shopping for imported food, or flying off on a foreign holiday. In future, we may see the cost of a product's carbon emissions being added to the price we pay - whether or not it's made in the UK. So if a business doesn't try and reduce the emissions of the goods it's selling, its prices may have to go up. It's hoped that will make consumers and businesses think again about how we consume and where we put our money. In response to this, some big household names like Amazon, Unilever and Ikea have now said they're looking to ensure the cargo ships they use to deliver goods will run on cleaner fuels. Amazon and Ikea in zero-carbon shipping pledge Nature's role in fighting climate change and the need to restore the natural world - from forests to peatland - was high on the agenda at Glasgow, and we may see the benefits in greener spaces around our towns and cities. ""Nature can be helping us here if we looked to actually treat it with the respect it deserves,"" says Dr Emily Shukburgh of the University of Cambridge. The arguments to make space for nature are now clearer and louder than ever, âsays Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts.  ""There is now renewed momentum about the need to... protect forests and other precious habitats and put nature in recovery."" More than 100 countries signed up to the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests, which aims to halt deforestation. This could see tougher action on cutting down forests in countries including Brazil and Indonesia to produce things such as soya, beef and palm oil which are then imported and consumed in richer, developed nations. This could end the era of cheap food. Deforestation link to Amazon soya and beef exports World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030 Experts say that a hard choice could be faced - deforestation will never be stopped if sustainability concerns are always out-competed by the price people pay for food: ""Consumers will inevitably have to absorb some of these costs if we want to deliver on the COP 26 declaration - by paying more and consuming less,"" says Toby Gardner of the Stockholm Environment Institute. More than 400 financial institutions - controlling an estimated $130tn of private finance - agreed at COP26 to provide more money for green technology. It means that many major pension providers are going to be looking at investing your money in more environmentally friendly sectors. This might include ""helping our customers identify ways to improve the energy efficiency of their homesâ¦ investing in companies developing new, sustainable ways of living and working,"" says Janet Pope of Lloyds Banking Group. We may also witness a shift in our way of thinking. Dr Stephanie Sodero of the University of Manchester says the goal of sticking to 1.5 degrees - above which scientists say climate impacts will become more dangerous and unpredictable - could galvanise community action. ""On the ground, in UK communities and beyond, led by youth activists, I think there will be sustained and intense pressure to scrutinise all governance decisions - from local transport to national energy - through a climate lens,"" she says. Matthew Hannon from the University of Strathclyde says the drive to net zero is likely to yield benefits such as cleaner air, quieter streets and better mental and physical health. ""Delivering a just, net zero transition should ultimately result in happier, healthier lifestyles,"" he says. ""The question should therefore be less about what will I lose under net zero and more about what could I gain?""

COP26: The story from Glasgow in 15 pictures,"As the official business of the UN climate summit took place behind closed doors, some of the most eye-catching demonstrations, passionate speeches and unusual stories unfolded on the streets of Glasgow. It's not often you'll see an 18-year-old surrounded by police and clamouring journalists in Glasgow Central station - but Greta Thunberg is no average teenager. During her time in the city, people flocked to venues and demonstrations where she was rumoured to appear, hoping to catch a glimpse or a quick word on camera. This video can not be played Greta Thunberg branded the COP26 climate summit a ""global north greenwash festival"" After the first day of summit discussions, as world leaders enjoyed a glamorous VIP dinner in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, she addressed a crowd in Govan's Festival Park, saying politicians were""pretending to take our future seriously"". Reiterating her comments at the Youth4Climate conference in Milan in September, she said: ""We are tired of [leaders'] blah, blah, blah"". She later joined thousands of young people on the Fridays for Future march andgave a speech in George Square, branding the summit a ""failure"" and a ""global north greenwash festival"". This video can not be played Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior sails under Erskine Bridge Residents in Glasgow were told to expect disruption to their daily lives throughout the summit, including through road closures. Among the first to make headlines was the arrival of the Rainbow Warrior - Greenpeace's famous ship - which resulted in the temporary closure of the Erskine Bridge while the vessel sailed underneath. It was transporting four young climate activists from areas affected by climate change and had hoped to dock opposite the conference venue - but instead stopped a couple of miles up river at the King George V dock. Michael Ransley and Tarateeno the Marvellous stopped for a break on Victoria Road in Glasgow Early last week, bystanders on Victoria Road may have been fortunate enough to seeTaranteeno the Marvellous clopping by. The 15-year-old cob was with owners Michael Ransley and his partner Dr Phoebe Beedell, who set off from Cornwall for COP26 in the spring of 2019. They had originally set off for Glasgow more than two years ago but delayed their arrival until the summit had been rescheduled. The activists aimed to raise awareness of the climate crisis throughout the host city, and were saddened to see the number of cars on the roads. Vanessa Nakate is one of the best known of the new generation of campaigners against global warming - and was Uganda's first Fridays for Future activist. The 24-year-old left her mark at both mass protests over the weekend, using impassioned speeches to raise awareness of the plight of the global south. What happened inside the blue zone? COP26 draft deal calls for stronger carbon cutting targets Thousands march for Glasgow's biggest protest And if Ms Thunberg was the sovereign of soundbites, Ms Nakate held audiences rapt with first-hand experiences of communities devastated by climate disasters. As one of thekey speakers at the Global Day of Action rally on Glasgow Green, she told crowds how overnight storms seriously damaged a school which she and fellow campaigners helped to build in her home country. ""The strong winds and heavy rainfall will not stop, because the words and promises of leaders do not match their actions,"" she said. A smiling Juneau made it to her first protest before her first birthday People of all ages joined schoolchildren as they marched from Kelvingrove Park to George Square on 5 November - among the youngest was 11-month-old Juneau. She and her mother, April Hamilton, had travelled from Paisley because it was ""too important"" not to join the rally. Ms Hamilton, a teacher, spoke highly of Greta Thunberg, whom she said was an incredible role model for her daughter. Shortly before 100,000 people were due to walk through the city centre on 6 November, a group of scientists chained themselves to the King George V Bridge. The group from Scientist Rebellion said they could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"". Specialist police teams used bolt cutters to remove the 21 activists. who were then arrested and released on an undertaking. The Red Rebels again added a dramatic splash of colour to the protests Despite pouring rain on Saturday, spirits were far from dampened - in part due to the colourful costumes and indigenous dress on display. Some groups did not have representation during official conference proceedings, but nevertheless had eyes upon them at one of the largest protests in Glasgow's living memory. Members of indigenous groups, some of whom had no formal representation at the summit, joined the march Others used their costumes to get their message across Organisers said about 100,000 marched through the city for the rally at Glasgow Green. Meanwhile police praised the ""good natured"" activists who were in""high spirits"" throughout the day. This mural in Partick is the work ofDaniel Rupaszov- a 25-year-old from Hungary who belongs to a group of artists and activists who visit COP every year to create art which highlights the climate crisis. He is one of many activists who have expressed their views through artwork, from a""carbon unicorn"" made by Friends of the Earthto a largeknitted display,externalby Stiches for Survival. Brave Bakers on Saltmarket was one of the few businesses in the area that opted to stay open the day 100,000 protesters walked by on their way to Glasgow Green. Arouge Salin had worked at the coffee shop for about two months when the staff of three were inundated with drenched customers vying for hot coffee and vegan pastries. She told the BBC: ""It started off quiet, but we had a queue outside the shop until the walk passed - it was non-stop from 15:30 until 18:00, and we normally shut at 17:30. ""We sold out of everything vegan - which never happens. The only thing we had left was our chicken and bacon bake which is usually the first thing to go. ""And we sold so many coffees that our machine jammed. I think people just wanted something warm."" In the absence of costumes or conspicuous floats, young people used their imaginations to daub eye-catching slogans on protest signs for the youth march. Activists made sure their messages were heard in their own voice - whether it was with a bit of humour or a Scottish accent.

India asks for last-minute change to climate text,"A deal has been reached at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow after nearly two weeks of negotiations Boris Johnson calls it a ""big step forward"" but says there is a huge amount of work still to be done India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase-down"" not the ""phase-out"" of coal power Alok Sharma says it was important to get a deal done - but many countries voiced serious disappointment The deal is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres meanwhile says: ""It's an important step but it's not enough"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We are closing our coverage of the climate summit for today. Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all. Before we say goodbye - here are some of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Day one started off with hundreds of people having to wait in long queues to get into the venue Former US President Barack Obama brought some star power to the summit, and called on young activists to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pictured maskless and resting his eyes inside the hall And was his US counterpart, President Joe Biden, asleep or just resting his eyes? The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively
as a team we have achieved what many people doubted."" It's been a long, long day and the COP president is now facing the press. He says he's had six hours sleep in the last few days. Stay with us for updates. Georgina RannardBBC News Sohanur Rahman, 25, is a founding member of Bangladeshâs Friday for Future movement, leading youth activists in the country as they face the dire effects of rising sea levels and flooding. As the Glasgow agreement was gavelled, he told me that youth were recognised for the first time at COP, but âthe end result is nothingâ. He feels helpless and betrayed going back to Bangladesh with this agreement and says the ""empty pledges"" won't protect anyone from the climate crisis. He does not believe it will limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C, despite what politicians say. ""We have no scope to hold them accountable,"" he explains. He welcomes the good news on loss and damage - an acknowledgment from rich countries that poor nations need support paying for impacts of climate change they can't adapt to.

Nicola Sturgeon UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a short statement on Twitter praising the deal reached by leaders in Glasgow - but says there is more work to be done.  We asked nations to come together for our planet at @COP26, and they have answered that call. I want to thank the leaders, negotiators and campaigners who made this pact happen â and the people of Glasgow who welcomed them with open arms.  I also want particularly to thank COP President Alok Sharma who has worked incredibly hard to bring countries together.  Today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5C.  I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal.""  While he may not be enthused with the deal, Shadow business minister  - and former Labour leader - Ed Miliband has nothing but praise for  Alok Sharma. He says Sharma, a Tory MP and minister of state at the cabinet office, has shown himself to be a ""person of decency, integrity and commitment"". Throughout the afternoon, the COP26 president has been seen flitting between various delegations, discussing the text and working to get the deal across the line. Allow Twitter content?

COP President Alok Sharma is still inside the conference hall, but he is expected to give a news conference when the official proceedings are done. The lectern is ready, flags and all, along with 100 journalists waiting for him outside the hall. India, along with China, pushed for the last-minute change to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But why? India - the world's third-largest emitter of fossil fuels - still relies heavily on coal, which makes up 70% of the country's energy production. A big part of their position can be summed up by comments from India's environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav earlier. He asked how anyone could expect developing countries to make promises on phasing out coal when they have still to deal with their development agendas and eradicating poverty. On top of that, four million people are employed in India's coal industry - and in the last decade the country's coal consumption has nearly doubled. It  continues to import large quantities of coal and is planning to open dozens of new mines in the coming years despite pledges to invest massively in renewable energy.

Deal agreed with last-minute change on coal,"A deal has been reached at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow after nearly two weeks of negotiations Boris Johnson calls it a ""big step forward"" but says there is a huge amount of work still to be done India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase-down"" not the ""phase-out"" of coal power Alok Sharma says it was important to get a deal done - but many countries voiced serious disappointment The deal is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres meanwhile says: ""It's an important step but it's not enough"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We are closing our coverage of the climate summit for today. Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all. Before we say goodbye - here are some of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Day one started off with hundreds of people having to wait in long queues to get into the venue Former US President Barack Obama brought some star power to the summit, and called on young activists to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pictured maskless and resting his eyes inside the hall And was his US counterpart, President Joe Biden, asleep or just resting his eyes? The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt.""

He welcomes the good news on loss and damage - an acknowledgment from rich countries that poor nations need support paying for impacts of climate change they can't adapt to. But the voices of the most affected people were silenced, he says - âthe interest of the fossil fuel corporations have been clearly pandered to by the UK COP presidency.â This video can not be played COP26 deal changes 'a real blow' - Marshall Islands Tina Stege, climate envoy for Marshall Islands, has sent us her reaction to the deal. Her highly vulnerable Pacific Island country is at risk of being wiped out by climate change. She says last-minute changes to the wording on coal and the weakened language on loss and damage are ""blows"". There was a conversation we were not a part of and it was a real blow.. We had been told that there would be no further changes to the text and we had already swallowed some changes that were difficult to swallow."" Tina Stege But the ""real progress made"" in Glasgow is a ""lifeline"" for her country and it should not be discounted, she argues. Stege is pleased that money on climate finance was secured. And she says it's positive that countries are being called on to submit new targets to reduce emissions next year. Disappointment being expressed with the final pact is ""understandable"" after key issues were ""watered down in the final hours"", Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. However, the SNP politician adds there ""can be no doubt"" the negotiations in Glasgow have led to improvement on some key areas. While there has been much positive progress, there is no escaping the fact that COP26 has not delivered as much as global south countries, activists and campaigners rightly demanded and I firmly believe that the leaders of the rich developed countries must go further."" Nicola Sturgeon UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a short statement on Twitter praising the deal reached by leaders in Glasgow - but says there is more work to be done.  We asked nations to come together for our planet at @COP26, and they have answered that call. I want to thank the leaders, negotiators and campaigners who made this pact happen â and the people of Glasgow who welcomed them with open arms.  I also want particularly to thank COP President Alok Sharma who has worked incredibly hard to bring countries together.  Today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5C.  I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal.""  While he may not be enthused with the deal, Shadow business minister  - and former Labour leader - Ed Miliband has nothing but praise for  Alok Sharma. He says Sharma, a Tory MP and minister of state at the cabinet office, has shown himself to be a ""person of decency, integrity and commitment"". Throughout the afternoon, the COP26 president has been seen flitting between various delegations, discussing the text and working to get the deal across the line. Allow Twitter content?

COP President Alok Sharma is still inside the conference hall, but he is expected to give a news conference when the official proceedings are done. The lectern is ready, flags and all, along with 100 journalists waiting for him outside the hall. India, along with China, pushed for the last-minute change to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But why? India - the world's third-largest emitter of fossil fuels - still relies heavily on coal, which makes up 70% of the country's energy production. A big part of their position can be summed up by comments from India's environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav earlier. He asked how anyone could expect developing countries to make promises on phasing out coal when they have still to deal with their development agendas and eradicating poverty. On top of that, four million people are employed in India's coal industry - and in the last decade the country's coal consumption has nearly doubled. It  continues to import large quantities of coal and is planning to open dozens of new mines in the coming years despite pledges to invest massively in renewable energy. An average Indian still consumes far less power than a Brit or an American. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Climate summit approaches 'moment of truth',"Scientists say extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, are becoming more frequent because of climate change The president of the COP26 climate summit said the talks had reached a ""moment of truth for our planet"". As the meeting entered its final hours, he urged delegates to agree to a draft agreement aimed at averting dangerous global warming. But he faced late objections from India and others to a clause on cutting fossil fuels, and calls for more financial help for developing nations. It's still not clear what needs to happen for these issues to be resolved. ""You all know that the world is willing us on to be bold - to be ambitious"" said the UK's Alok Sharma, who is chairing the talks. ""So much rests on the decisions we collectively take today,"" he told delegates, urging them to get on board with the draft plan published earlier on Saturday. The key achievements of the draft so far are the inclusion of a commitment to phase-out coal, re-visiting emissions-cutting plans on a more regular basis and increased financial help for developing countries. But India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav told the meeting that ""consensus remains elusive"". EXPLAINER:A really simple guide to climate change CONTEXT:How do we know climate change is caused by humans? In an apparent reference to coal, he said: ""Targeting any particular sector is uncalled for. Every country will arrive at net zero as per its national circumstances."" ""Developing countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels,"" he added. He also objected to proposals to end ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"" - financial benefits provided to producers of oil, gas and coal. China, which is understood to have earlier raised concerns about the wording, said it hoped that ""all parties will show excellent flexibility"" and said it now wanted only small edits to the text. South Africa's negotiator backed objections over the section on fossil fuels saying: ""We don't feel that one size fits all is a good approach."" But Mr Sharma said the text was a ""balanced package"". US climate envoy John Kerry said: ""If it's a good negotiation all the parties are uncomfortable. And this, I think, has been a good negotiation."" Fires and other extreme weather phenomena can become the norm if temperature rises are not capped Lia Nicholson, from Antigua and Barbuda's delegation, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said they were ""extremely disappointed"" by the lack of progress on loss and damage - the principle that richer countries, which bear the main responsibility for the global warming, should pay compensation to poorer ones because of climate impacts. She said: ""We will express our grievances in due course,"" but added: ""We implore all parties to support our common outcome and move forward."" Promises in Glasgow will not be enough to limit global warming to 1.5C. It is a key part of the 2015 Paris agreement that most countries signed up to. Scientists say that limiting temperature rise to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels will protect us from the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Meeting the goal requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by 2050. One example of the impact of global temperature rise above 2C is the death of virtually all tropical coral reefs, scientists say. One estimate by the Climate Action Tracker calculated that the planet is stillset to warm by 2.4C if the current pledges are all met. At COPs, it often all comes down to a huddle. Inside the main Plenary Room, the days of negotiations turn into a face-to-face discussion, like merchants in a souk. Around them, delegates cluster, keen to be there at the moment when key differences between the groups or countries are resolved. This afternoon, US climate envoy John Kerry and chief US negotiator Sue Biniaz stood toe-to-toe with Ahmadou Sebory Toure, the delegate from Guinea, who also represents the G77 group of nations, a large part of the developing world. At stake, how much money the developed world may have to pay to the developing world to compensate for the loss and damage done to developing countries because of climate change. Interest in that ends when Mr Kerry sweeps across the room to talk to the UK President of the COP, Alok Sharma and his chief negotiator, Archie Young. Then, all eyes move to the EU's chief negotiator, Frans Timmermans, as his team work out the repercussions of the G77 huddle. Eventually, the COP chairman decides enough is enough and further discussions must take place elsewhere. The session ends and so do the huddles. For now. But experts say the 1.5C target is still achievable: at COP15 in Copenhagen more than a decade ago, estimates suggested the world was heading for between 3.5 and 4.2C of warming. If the references to phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies remain in the final deal, it would be an historic moment in climate negotiations. Gabriela Bucher, Oxfam's international executive director, said: ""Clearly some world leaders think they aren't living on the same planet as the rest of us. It seems no amount of fires, rising sea levels or droughts will bring them to their senses to stop increasing emissions at the expense of humanity. ""The world's poorest have done the least to cause the climate emergency, yet are the ones left struggling to survive while also footing the bill. Climate finance, or the money promised by richer countries to poorer countries to fight climate change, continues to be one of the most contentious points. In 2009, developed nations pledged to provide $100bn per year to emerging economies by 2020. But this target was not met.

How might decisions made at COP26 change our lives?COP26: The story from Glasgow in 15 picturesWhat does net zero mean?Breaking|Breaking newsCOP26 agrees new global climate deal,"Now that a deal has been agreed and signed at the climate summit in Glasgow, you might be left wondering what it will mean for you. Here are some ways in which the decisions made at COP26 could change your life. Switching to an electric car is among a number of lifestyle changes we're likely to be making. Experts predict that new electric vehicles could cost the same as new petrol or diesel cars within the next five years. It is also possible to lease an electric vehicle, and there's a growing second-hand market, where these vehicles are cheaper. Dozens of countries, regions and car companies have agreed to ramp up the use of electric vehicles and bring in new zero-emission buses and trucks. Meanwhile, others argue we need fewer cars on the road - walking and cycling more could also be among the changes we make. How can an average family afford an electric car? More than 40 countries have signed up to phasing out coal. A similar number have committed to ensuring that clean energy is the most reliable and affordable option for powering our homes and businesses. For countries like the UK, this will mean continuing the move towards renewable sources such as wind and solar energy - and possibly more reliance on nuclear energy. COP26 lacked a breakthrough announcement committing the world's biggest coal-users such as China and India to ending its use. However, it's hoped the announcements made at Glasgow will send a signal to the market that it is worth investing in renewable energy. Solar panels and heat pumps could become standard in our homes. We'll build new houses using low-carbon alternatives to cement and concrete - and try to re-fit old ones. How much do heat pumps cost and how do they work? Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? There's also a focus on making sure our buildings, infrastructure and communities are able to withstand the current and future impact of climate change. Eva Hinkers, Arup Sustainable Development Director says: ""We also need to make sure [buildings] are fit for more extreme scenarios."" This could include improving green space in and around our homes to absorb extreme rainfall, installing ""cool roofs"" that reflect sunlight and prevent overheating, or introducing shutters so homes can withstand hurricane winds. Our lifestyles contribute to carbon emissions, whether we're shopping for imported food, or flying off on a foreign holiday. In future, we may see the cost of a product's carbon emissions being added to the price we pay - whether or not it's made in the UK. So if a business doesn't try and reduce the emissions of the goods it's selling, its prices may have to go up. It's hoped that will make consumers and businesses think again about how we consume and where we put our money. In response to this, some big household names like Amazon, Unilever and Ikea have now said they're looking to ensure the cargo ships they use to deliver goods will run on cleaner fuels. Amazon and Ikea in zero-carbon shipping pledge Nature's role in fighting climate change and the need to restore the natural world - from forests to peatland - was high on the agenda at Glasgow, and we may see the benefits in greener spaces around our towns and cities. ""Nature can be helping us here if we looked to actually treat it with the respect it deserves,"" says Dr Emily Shukburgh of the University of Cambridge. The arguments to make space for nature are now clearer and louder than ever, âsays Craig Bennett, chief executive of The Wildlife Trusts.  ""There is now renewed momentum about the need to... protect forests and other precious habitats and put nature in recovery."" More than 100 countries signed up to the Glasgow Leaders Declaration on Forests, which aims to halt deforestation. This could see tougher action on cutting down forests in countries including Brazil and Indonesia to produce things such as soya, beef and palm oil which are then imported and consumed in richer, developed nations. This could end the era of cheap food. Deforestation link to Amazon soya and beef exports World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030 Experts say that a hard choice could be faced - deforestation will never be stopped if sustainability concerns are always out-competed by the price people pay for food: ""Consumers will inevitably have to absorb some of these costs if we want to deliver on the COP 26 declaration - by paying more and consuming less,"" says Toby Gardner of the Stockholm Environment Institute. More than 400 financial institutions - controlling an estimated $130tn of private finance - agreed at COP26 to provide more money for green technology. It means that many major pension providers are going to be looking at investing your money in more environmentally friendly sectors. This might include ""helping our customers identify ways to improve the energy efficiency of their homesâ¦ investing in companies developing new, sustainable ways of living and working,"" says Janet Pope of Lloyds Banking Group. We may also witness a shift in our way of thinking. Dr Stephanie Sodero of the University of Manchester says the goal of sticking to 1.5 degrees - above which scientists say climate impacts will become more dangerous and unpredictable - could galvanise community action. ""On the ground, in UK communities and beyond, led by youth activists, I think there will be sustained and intense pressure to scrutinise all governance decisions - from local transport to national energy - through a climate lens,"" she says. Matthew Hannon from the University of Strathclyde says the drive to net zero is likely to yield benefits such as cleaner air, quieter streets and better mental and physical health. ""Delivering a just, net zero transition should ultimately result in happier, healthier lifestyles,"" he says. ""The question should therefore be less about what will I lose under net zero and more about what could I gain?""

COP26: The story from Glasgow in 15 picturesWhat does net zero mean?Breaking|Breaking newsCOP26 agrees new global climate deal,"As the official business of the UN climate summit took place behind closed doors, some of the most eye-catching demonstrations, passionate speeches and unusual stories unfolded on the streets of Glasgow. It's not often you'll see an 18-year-old surrounded by police and clamouring journalists in Glasgow Central station - but Greta Thunberg is no average teenager. During her time in the city, people flocked to venues and demonstrations where she was rumoured to appear, hoping to catch a glimpse or a quick word on camera. This video can not be played Greta Thunberg branded the COP26 climate summit a ""global north greenwash festival"" After the first day of summit discussions, as world leaders enjoyed a glamorous VIP dinner in Kelvingrove Art Gallery and Museum, she addressed a crowd in Govan's Festival Park, saying politicians were""pretending to take our future seriously"". Reiterating her comments at the Youth4Climate conference in Milan in September, she said: ""We are tired of [leaders'] blah, blah, blah"". She later joined thousands of young people on the Fridays for Future march andgave a speech in George Square, branding the summit a ""failure"" and a ""global north greenwash festival"". This video can not be played Greenpeace ship Rainbow Warrior sails under Erskine Bridge Residents in Glasgow were told to expect disruption to their daily lives throughout the summit, including through road closures. Among the first to make headlines was the arrival of the Rainbow Warrior - Greenpeace's famous ship - which resulted in the temporary closure of the Erskine Bridge while the vessel sailed underneath. It was transporting four young climate activists from areas affected by climate change and had hoped to dock opposite the conference venue - but instead stopped a couple of miles up river at the King George V dock. Michael Ransley and Tarateeno the Marvellous stopped for a break on Victoria Road in Glasgow Early last week, bystanders on Victoria Road may have been fortunate enough to seeTaranteeno the Marvellous clopping by. The 15-year-old cob was with owners Michael Ransley and his partner Dr Phoebe Beedell, who set off from Cornwall for COP26 in the spring of 2019. They had originally set off for Glasgow more than two years ago but delayed their arrival until the summit had been rescheduled. The activists aimed to raise awareness of the climate crisis throughout the host city, and were saddened to see the number of cars on the roads. Vanessa Nakate is one of the best known of the new generation of campaigners against global warming - and was Uganda's first Fridays for Future activist. The 24-year-old left her mark at both mass protests over the weekend, using impassioned speeches to raise awareness of the plight of the global south. What happened inside the blue zone? COP26 draft deal calls for stronger carbon cutting targets Thousands march for Glasgow's biggest protest And if Ms Thunberg was the sovereign of soundbites, Ms Nakate held audiences rapt with first-hand experiences of communities devastated by climate disasters. As one of thekey speakers at the Global Day of Action rally on Glasgow Green, she told crowds how overnight storms seriously damaged a school which she and fellow campaigners helped to build in her home country. ""The strong winds and heavy rainfall will not stop, because the words and promises of leaders do not match their actions,"" she said. A smiling Juneau made it to her first protest before her first birthday People of all ages joined schoolchildren as they marched from Kelvingrove Park to George Square on 5 November - among the youngest was 11-month-old Juneau. She and her mother, April Hamilton, had travelled from Paisley because it was ""too important"" not to join the rally. Ms Hamilton, a teacher, spoke highly of Greta Thunberg, whom she said was an incredible role model for her daughter. Shortly before 100,000 people were due to walk through the city centre on 6 November, a group of scientists chained themselves to the King George V Bridge. The group from Scientist Rebellion said they could not ""rely on our leaders to save us anymore"" and had a ""moral duty to act"". Specialist police teams used bolt cutters to remove the 21 activists. who were then arrested and released on an undertaking. The Red Rebels again added a dramatic splash of colour to the protests Despite pouring rain on Saturday, spirits were far from dampened - in part due to the colourful costumes and indigenous dress on display. Some groups did not have representation during official conference proceedings, but nevertheless had eyes upon them at one of the largest protests in Glasgow's living memory. Members of indigenous groups, some of whom had no formal representation at the summit, joined the march Others used their costumes to get their message across Organisers said about 100,000 marched through the city for the rally at Glasgow Green. Meanwhile police praised the ""good natured"" activists who were in""high spirits"" throughout the day. This mural in Partick is the work ofDaniel Rupaszov- a 25-year-old from Hungary who belongs to a group of artists and activists who visit COP every year to create art which highlights the climate crisis. He is one of many activists who have expressed their views through artwork, from a""carbon unicorn"" made by Friends of the Earthto a largeknitted display,externalby Stiches for Survival. Brave Bakers on Saltmarket was one of the few businesses in the area that opted to stay open the day 100,000 protesters walked by on their way to Glasgow Green. Arouge Salin had worked at the coffee shop for about two months when the staff of three were inundated with drenched customers vying for hot coffee and vegan pastries. She told the BBC: ""It started off quiet, but we had a queue outside the shop until the walk passed - it was non-stop from 15:30 until 18:00, and we normally shut at 17:30. ""We sold out of everything vegan - which never happens. The only thing we had left was our chicken and bacon bake which is usually the first thing to go. ""And we sold so many coffees that our machine jammed. I think people just wanted something warm."" In the absence of costumes or conspicuous floats, young people used their imaginations to daub eye-catching slogans on protest signs for the youth march. Activists made sure their messages were heard in their own voice - whether it was with a bit of humour or a Scottish accent.

What does net zero mean?Breaking|Breaking newsCOP26 agrees new global climate deal,"In order to help meet international climate targets, the world needs to cut carbon dioxide emissions to ""net zero"" by 2050, the UN says. This will involve major changes for governments, businesses and individuals. Net zero means no longer adding to the total amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. This main way to do this is to cut greenhouse gas emissions in the first place. But not all emissions can be eliminated completely, so those that remain need to actively removed. Greenhouse gases include carbon dioxide (CO2) and methane. CO2 is released when oil, gas and coal are burned in homes, factories and to power transport. Methane is produced through farming and landfill, as well as other sources. These gases increase global temperatures by trapping extra energy in the Earth's atmosphere. Meanwhile, rapiddeforestation across the worldmeans there are fewer trees to absorb CO2. Under the2015 Paris climate agreement, nearly 200 countries agreed to try to limit global temperature rises to 1.5C by 2100. To achieve this, CO2 emissions need to fall by nearly half by 2030 and reach net zero by 2050, according to the UN's climate body, the IPCC. But despite these international commitments, emissionsremain at record highs,external. A really simple guide to climate change Natural ways of removing CO2include planting treesandrestoring peatlands. Trees can take carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere There are also novel, human-designed methods - at very early stages - designed to take CO2 directly out of the air. Carbon captureis a related technology, where CO2 produced in power stations or other industrial processes is captured before it is released into the atmosphere, and stored underground. While these technologies could be important in future, they are expensive, and can currently only cancel out a very small fraction of greenhouse gas emissions which are still being produced. They are not a substitute for making drastic cuts to fossil fuel use, the International Energy Agency warns. To help achieve its 2050 target, UK governments have made a series of pledges, which include: achievingso-called 'clean' electricity by 2030, by rapidly increasing wind and solar generation ending the sale ofnew fully petrol and diesel cars by 2030 installing600,000 electric heat pumps a yearby 2028 investing intechnology to capture and store CO2 The UK's greenhouse gas emissions in 2023 werearound 50% of 1990 levels,external. This figure only includes emissions generated within the UK, in line with UN reporting standards. Under the Paris climate agreement, the UK needs to reduce its emissionsby 68% by 2030,externalcompared with 1990 levels - a key step towards achieving net zero by 2050. In July 2024, the UK's independent climate advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC),warned that only a third of emissions cuts needed to meet this goalwere backed up by credible policies. At the COP29 climate summit in Azerbaijan, Prime MinisterSir Keir Starmer announced a new target to cut the UK's annual emissions by 81% versus 1990 levels by 2035. Piers Forster, interim chair of the CCC, welcomed the announcement, which he said would ""support jobs and investment"". However, he warned that UK also needed to demonstrate greater progress regarding electric vehicles, heat pumps and tree planting. What is COP29 and what will be discussed? About 145 countrieshave - or are considering - net zero targets, covering about 90% of global emissions,external. However, not all have set a 2050 deadline. China- currently the biggest producer of CO2 worldwide - is aiming for""carbon neutrality"" by 2060. Its plans to cut emissions are not fully developed, but its electric vehicle sales and renewable energy sector have beengrowing rapidly,external. China is quickly expanding its solar and wind capacity TheUShas historically been the biggest carbon emitter, and still emits more than China per head. It has pledged to reach net zero by 2050. In August 2022, it announced a major green investment package called theInflation Reduction Act, which aims to boost renewables and other clean technologies. TheEU, the third biggest emitter of CO2, also has a 2050 net zero target. In March 2023, it announced its own green investment package, called theNet Zero Industry Act.,external RussiaandIndiaare also significant emitters. They have pledged to reach net zero by 2060 and 2070 respectively, but have published few policies to back this up. How is my country tackling climate change? There is controversy about how some countries and companies might reach net zero. For instance, a country might record lower emissions if it imports energy-intensive goods from overseas, rather than producing the goods itself. But in reality, it may not have reduced the total amount of greenhouse gases going into the atmosphere. There are also schemes that enable countries or companies to reach net zero by paying others to reduce theirs instead - for example giving funds to plant trees. But these can be controversial, withconcerns about how effective these schemes really are. Some climate scientists also fear that a focus on net zero targets in 2050 or beyond can underplay the need for rapid emissions cuts now, withthe world far off track to meet its climate goals. While the most significant changes need to come from government,individuals can also play their part to help reach net zero.

Breaking|Breaking newsCOP26 agrees new global climate deal,"This video can not be played Alok Sharma fights back tears as Glasgow Climate Pact reached A deal aimed at staving off dangerous climate change has been struck at the COP26 summit in Glasgow. The Glasgow Climate Pact is the first ever climate deal to explicitly plan to reduce coal, the worst fossil fuel for greenhouse gases. The deal also presses for more urgent emission cuts and promises more money for developing countries - to help them adapt to climate impacts. But the pledges don't go far enough to limit temperature rise to 1.5C. A commitment to phase out coal that was included in earlier negotiation drafts led to a dramatic finish after India and China led opposition to it. India's climate minister Bhupender Yadav asked how developing countries could promise to phase out coal and fossil fuel subsidies when they ""have still to deal with their development agendas and poverty eradication"". In the end, countries agreed to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal, amid expressions of disappointment by some. COP26 President Alok Sharma said he was ""deeply sorry"" for how events had unfolded. Evasive words, but deal shows progress He fought back tears as he told delegates that it was vital to protect the agreement as a whole. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he hoped the world would ""look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change"". ""There is still a huge amount more to do in the coming years. But today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5 degrees,"" he said. John Kerry, the US envoy for climate, said it wasalways unlikely that the Glasgow summit would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"", but that the ""starting pistol"" had been fired. How the final day unfolded Meanwhile, UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said the planet was ""hanging by a thread"". ""We are still knocking on the door of climate catastrophe... it is time to go into emergency mode - or our chance of reaching net zero will itself be zero."" As part of the agreement, countries will meet next year to pledge further major carbon cuts with the aim of reaching the 1.5C goal. Current pledges, if fulfilled, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. If global temperatures rise by more than 1.5C, scientists say the Earth is likely to experience severe effects such asmillions more people being exposed to extreme heat.,external Main achievements of the deal: Re-visiting emissions-cutting plans next year to try to keep 1.5C target reachable The first ever inclusion of a commitment to limit coal use Increased financial help for developing countries ""We would like to express our profound disappointment that the language we agreed on, on coal and fossil fuels subsidies, has been further watered down,"" Swiss environment minister Simonetta Sommaruga said. ""This will not bring us closer to 1.5C, but make it more difficult to reach it."" Despite the weakening of language around coal, some observers will still see the deal as a victory, underlining that it is the first time coal is explicitly mentioned in UN documents of this type. Coal is responsible for about 40% of annual CO2 emissions, making it central in efforts to keep within the 1.5C target. To meet this goal, agreed in Paris in 2015, global emissions need to be reduced by 45% by 2030 and to nearly zero by mid-century. ""They changed a word but they can't change the signal coming out of this COP - that the era of coal is ending,"" said Greenpeace international executive director Jennifer Morgan. However, Lars Koch, a policy director for charity ActionAid, said it was disappointing that only coal was mentioned. ""This gives a free pass to the rich countries who have been extracting and polluting for over a century to continue producing oil and gas,"" he said. Sara Shaw, from Friends of the Earth International, said the outcome was ""nothing less than a scandal"". ""Just saying the words 1.5 degrees is meaningless if there is nothing in the agreement to deliver it. COP26 will be remembered as a betrayal of global South countries,"" she said. Finance was a contentious issue during the conference. A pledge by developed nations to provide $100bn (Â£75bn) per year to emerging economies, made in 2009, was supposed to have been delivered by 2020. However, the date was missed. It was designed to help developing nations adapt to climate effects and make the transition to clean energy. In an effort to mollify delegates, Mr Sharma said around $500bn would be mobilised by 2025. Scientists say extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, are becoming more frequent because of climate change But poorer countries had been calling throughout the meeting for funding through the principle of loss and damage - the idea that richer countries should compensate poorer ones for climate change effects they are unable to adapt to. This was one of the big disappointments of the conference for many delegations. Despite their dissatisfaction, several countries that stood to benefit backed the agreement on the basis that talks on loss and damage would continue. Delegations pushing for greater progress on the issue included those from countries in Africa, such as Guinea and Kenya, as well as Latin American states, small island territories and nations in Asia such as the Philippines. Lia Nicholson, delegate for Antigua and Barbuda, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said: ""We recognise the presidency's efforts to try and create a space to find common ground. The final landing zone, however, is not even close to capturing what we had hoped."" Shauna Aminath, environment minister for the low-lying Maldives, said: ""We have 98 months to halve global emissions. The difference between 1.5 and 2 degrees is a death sentence for us.""

University defends student sex work training,"Durham University Students Union said people should ""educate themselves"" about the training content before passing comment Durham University has defended its decision to offer training sessions to help students involved in sex work. Further Education Minister Michelle Donelan had accused it of ""legitimising a dangerous industry which thrives on the exploitation of women"". But the university said it was acting responsibly by offering students advice on how to stay safe. Last week its students' union offered staff and students guidance for people involved in the sex industry. Durham University said the courses were launched following requests ""from a small number of concerned students"". ""We are emphatically not seeking to encourage sex work but we are seeking to provide support to our students,"" a spokesman said. He added the university's intention was to ensure ""social stigma"" did not stop vulnerable students accessing support and the training session had been ""misinterpreted"". However, Ms Donelan said the university was ""badly failing"" in its duty to protect students. ""I'm deeply concerned that any university is legitimising a dangerous industry which thrives on the exploitation of women,"" she said. ""It is right that vital support is offered to women who are being exploited. ""However, this course seeks to normalise selling sex, which has no place in our universities."" She added students facing hardship should be supported by their institution and the government had given universities an extra Â£85m last year to help those who were struggling. Jake Butler from the student money website Save the Student said the current maintenance loan allowances ""fall woefully short of the cost of living"". ""Students are forced to rely on parents, part time jobs, savings and potentially even more desperate ways to make ends meet,"" he said. Durham Students' Union welfare and liberation officer Jonah Graham said the training's target audience was those who support students ""so they understand the legal, safety, and wellbeing concerns of students and how to respond to disclosures sensitively"". ""Anyone who cares about the safety of students should support this training and educate themselves about its actual content before making poorly judged comments,"" he said.

'I could have been a racist killer',"In his late teens, Mike became a Nazi. Now, only six years later, he is a supporter of Black Lives Matter - and it worries him deeply to think how close he came, at the angriest stage of his life, to going out with his gun and shooting people. When Mike locked eyes for a brief moment with the man who had just fallen to the ground, he could tell that he was going to die. It was a frantic night in downtown Oakland, California, and the wind was sharp with the sting of tear gas as it whipped palm trees up into a frenzy. Three days after the murder of George Floyd, protests in support of Black Lives Matter were breaking out across the US. Mike had been protesting with his girlfriend but as night fell and the police started firing rubber bullets and tear gas, they decided to leave. They were walking back to their car, along streets filled with the black smoke of burning rubbish bins, when they saw a white van pull up. Then they heard the gunshots. The van pulled away as a man in uniform slumped to the ground. Mike moved towards him, trying to remember the first aid training he had learned in the military. But a police car arrived and a jittery gun-wielding officer jumped out and ordered Mike to leave. Later he learned that Dave Patrick Underwood, a federal officer who had been guarding the courthouse, had died at the scene. More than a year on, it still haunts Mike that he couldn't do more to save him. By coincidence, Mike had a connection to Underwood; he had been marching that day with members of his family. But he was also connected to the man who was later charged with his murder. Steven Carillo was a sergeant at the same California Air Force base where Mike had enlisted just a few years earlier. And that wasn't all. Mike had a secret. At home in his wardrobe there was a uniform made of grey-green khaki fabric, with a Nazi symbol on the collar. Mike kept it hanging there to remind himself of the person he used to be, someone who wanted to go out and kill people. Like Carillo, Mike had fallen down the rabbit hole of extremism, and become a follower of America's violent far-right. In the summer before Mike's final year at school he watched as the first wave of Black Lives Matter protests rolled out across the US, but taking part was the furthest thing from his mind. ""I thought they were Satan incarnate,"" he says. He had just met a new friend through a messaging group online. Paul (not his real name) invited Mike to visit his home, where he lived with his parents. It was an ordinary house on a quiet cul-de-sac in an upmarket suburb of a major US city. They were meeting to ""shoot some propaganda videos"". Paul opened the door in full Nazi uniform. He took Mike straight to his garage. ""It was just like a clothing store for Nazis,"" Mike says. The walls were lined with weapons - ammunition, cartridges and many guns."" Paul had gathered a few other young men for the shoot. They loaded guns and ammunition into a truck and drove out to some nearby hills. ""We were on a state park firing semi-automatic and automatic weapons, filming and running around in Nazi uniforms,"" Mike says. Then the park rangers appeared. Paul was annoyed. ""He was just kind of standing there and he's not really having any of it. He's not wanting to listen to this government authority telling him that he cannot do what he thinks he's entitled to do, which is make videos and pretend to be the Wehrmacht [the armed forces of Nazi Germany]."" The rangers confiscated all the guns they could see, but the boys had hidden some of them and just loaded them back in the truck once they were alone again. Then they went back to Paul's house and hung out with his parents - still wearing their Nazi uniforms. Mike was 17 and says he had become the perfect vessel for toxic extremism. He had spent his childhood in a small, rural, mostly white town. Days were spent kayaking on the lake or cycling around town with his tight-knit group of friends. Adults and kids would hang out together and dinner parties and barbecues were spontaneous. It was a place where everybody knew everybody. But Mike's stepfather was an alcoholic who could lash out violently, and when Mike was 12 his mother got a divorce and moved with the children to another part of the country. Suddenly Mike was living in a sweltering, multi-racial urban neighbourhood, and he hated it. ""There were people there who didn't look like anything that I had ever seen before, the food was different, the water tasted different, everything just completely different."" They were also much less well off now, and the stepfather - whom Mike had been close to, despite his violent outbursts - never kept a promise to visit the children. All this made Mike angry, and he found an outlet for that anger in the alt-right. Encouraged by the father of a friend, Mike began listening to right-wing talk show host Sean Hannity, and when he searched for similar content online he found alt-right videos and podcasts on Facebook and YouTube. Social media algorithms were already creating what is known as the rabbit-hole effect - leading him to content that became more and more extreme. Here he was told, for example, that divorce was a Jewish conspiracy meant to destroy the ideal white family. ""For whatever reason, for me that was easier to believe than that my stepdad was a degenerate alcoholic,"" he says. Eventually Mike migrated to the darkest corners of the internet - to white nationalist message boards on 4chan and 8chan. These sites were like a social club for racists, Nazis and white nationalists, where people could say the N-word while getting to know one another, Mike says. He started exchanging messages with a group of neo-Nazis in the San Francisco Bay area and that is how he ended up on Paul's doorstep that summer afternoon. ""I was just looking for a place to put all my anger,"" Mike says. ""And it found a perfect home."" A year later, Mike finished school. When he didn't get into his preferred universities, he said he would join the Navy instead, but his mother was against the idea. They settled on a completely different plan - Mike would go to a business school in London. In the UK, Mike expected bowler hats and gentlemen - his image of London was like something out of a Victorian novel. The reality was very different. His school was in Whitechapel, an area with a vibrant Muslim community. ""I was an 18-year-old, radical white nationalist deeply fearful, deeply Islamophobic and I arrived in Whitechapel at a flat that was sandwiched between the Royal London Hospital and the East London Mosque,"" he says. ""I definitely didn't see the diversity there as a positive thing, I looked at it as an example of everything that was wrong in the world."" During his time in London, Mike sank deeper and deeper into white nationalism. Most of his activity was online - he digitally stalked and harassed American left-wing celebrities for months with a team of other extremists - though one day he also walked up to a mosque and dropped a packet of bacon on the doorstep. He stopped going to classes and after a few months he got a letter from the Home Office that his student visa was going to be revoked. One afternoon in April 2017, he was on his way to meet some friends at a pub on Parliament Square. While he was on the train passengers were told that Westminster station had been closed because of a police operation - they had to get off at the station before. A vehicle had mounted the footpath on Westminster Bridge at 70mph and mowed down pedestrians. The driver then got out and stabbed a police officer; six people died, including the attacker, and 50 were injured. Mike emerged from the Tube station to a scene of panic. The sight of two children wrapped in foil blankets handed out by the emergency services is imprinted on his mind. At this stage, IS was still a powerful force in the Middle East. It said it was responsible for the attack, one of a number carried out across Europe while it was at its most influential. Mike tried to sign up to the military the next day. Some of the white nationalists he had been speaking to online were military men and he took his cue from them. He was rejected from the RAF because of his nationality, but within weeks he was back in California enlisting with the USAF. ""I was supercharged, like really supercharged. I mean, there was no doubt in my mind that I wanted to go to somebody else's country, whether it be Iraq or Afghanistan, put on a uniform and pick up a gun and kill them."" In the weeks before he began his military training, he spent hours in his garage drinking and chain-smoking cigarettes, full of rage. ""I almost always had a gun with me,"" he says. ""And I was at the point where if somebody had told me to do something, I would have done it."" In that period, he could have become a Steven Carillo, he now fears - though there was another incident later in 2020 where this feeling hit him with particular intensity. A few months after the protests in Oakland, rioting engulfed Kenosha in Wisconsin when a black man was shot in an encounter with police. A 17-year-old boy called Kyle Rittenhouse joined a vigilante group formed to defend the city from what an organiser called ""evil thugs"". He shot three people with an AR-15 semi-automatic rifle and is now on trial accused of intentional homicide and recklessly endangering safety. Mike found it hard to read about. ""I look at that young teenager and I'm like, 'Wow, that was really close to being me,'"" he says. In February this year, the Pentagon issued a ""stand down"" against extremism - an order to leaders across the military to address extremism in their troops. At the same time, Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin set up a working group to determine how to spot ""insider threats"" and explained that prospective recruits would now be screened for extremist affiliations. These moves came after early analyses of those arrested in the Capitol Hill riots on 6 January suggested a troubling proportion were acting or former servicemen and women - including Ashli Babbitt, an Air Force veteran killed by a police officer as she tried to break through a barricaded door. A 2020 Military Times online poll of 1,108 readers on active duty, found thatjust under a third had seen signs of racist or white supremacist behaviour,externalwithin the military. Among those charged with offences in 2020 - apart from Steve Carillo - were US Army private Ethan Melzer, accused of preparing the ground for a deadly ambush on his unit by sending information to a neo-Nazi group, and three extremist veterans accused of carrying Molotov cocktails to throw at police during a Black Lives Matter protest in Las Vegas. But perhaps surprisingly, for Mike the military would be the start of his journey out of far-right extremism. Proud boys and antifa: When a right-wing activist met a left-wing anti-fascist The teenager who saved a man with an SS tattoo 'I was a neo-Nazi - then I fell in love with a black woman' In late 2017, he was in the second month of his training, stationed deep in the woods of Missouri. ""I was just stuck in the middle of nowhere with all sorts of people from all over the US - including black guys, Jewish guys, a guy from Guam who taught me how to spear fish,"" he says. ""I was making friends with people who I would never have considered being friends with before."" He found military boot camp difficult. The hours were gruelling and the lack of autonomy - the control that his superiors had over his every move - was hard to deal with. ""It's one thing to be some kid, chain-smoking and reading 4chan and getting riled up in your garage,"" he says. ""To then finding yourself in the middle of nowhere, on an Air Force base that you cannot leave and people are screaming at you."" He was miserable and tried to quit basic training six times in eight weeks. His mother wasn't talking to him - he thinks perhaps she knew he had joined the military for the wrong reasons. Letters were a lifeline for recruits but in the first five weeks Mike received none. When the other trainees had time each week to read their letters, Mike sat alone wallowing in his misery. One day another recruit, who was black, noticed this. ""Hey man,"" he said, picking up a Bible. ""Let's pray together."" It was one of many small gestures that helped Mike to survive basic training and ultimately changed his outlook on life. ""Why are you helping me?"" Mike thought. ""I thought you wanted to destroy me."" Over the next few weeks, this recruit and another young Jewish man would support Mike through his darkest moments, with a friendly pat on the back when he was struggling or a quiet, ""Hey man, you can do this."" During training he was also removed from the echo chamber that had been reinforcing his racist beliefs. He didn't have time to go online and without the toxic propaganda that had filled his days, hate was loosening its grip on him. By the time he emerged from basic training Mike knew he didn't want to be in the military. He spent several months working at an Air Force base, but he was deeply depressed. He reached his lowest ebb shortly before he was due to be sent to Afghanistan. ""I knew I was being deployed. I was under a lot of stress, [there was] just too much alcohol about one night and access to a firearm."" He came close to killing himself and was put on unpaid medical leave. It's an episode he finds difficult to discuss. Although in his case basic training helped him break away from extremism, Mike doesn't think it's a coincidence that a number of those involved in far-right violence in recent years served in the military. He believes that some extremists may join the military, as he did, eager for an opportunity to kill people of a different race. Mike's USAF uniform and Nazi uniform hanging side by side in his room Others, he suggests, sign up because they think the training will help them overthrow the state, while a third group become disillusioned and radicalised as a result of their experience in the ranks. ""They feel taken advantage of, not understood and lied to,"" he says. One of these is a friend who Mike has seen on social media showing support for an anti-government militia group. ""He served for 16 to 20 years and he's been to two wars - two wars that were about a lie,"" Mike says, referring to Iraq and Afghanistan. Last month the Institute for Strategic Dialogue released a report looking at discussion of the military by far-right extremists on the messaging app Telegram. They found a small number of extremists claimed to be veterans, but they also saw thatthe military was generally discussed in a negative light,external. ""This is largely due to the perception that the US's interventions abroad serve Israeli interests rather than those of the white race,"" the report says. Mike also started to believe that America's wars were pointless, but he accepted his racism was pointless too. ""I started kind of realising, about 70 years later than everybody else, that Hitler was clearly wrong,"" he says. As Mike's ideas on race started to change he got in touch withChristian Picciolini, a former neo-Naziwho now channels his energies into deradicalisation. ""He told me to practise empathy, being non-judgmental, being honest, and always being self-reflective - essentially to find a way to make good happen,"" Mike says. He started working at a music venue and became enamoured of the punk rock scene. It was the outlet that he needed for anger he'd built up from his unsettled childhood. Punk became his saviour. ""My punk rock community has been the one of the biggest things in getting me out. I think how vital it is to have an outlet and to have a group where you feel like you belong. But a constructive group,"" he says. After his medical leave ran out, Mike didn't return to the military and was classified as Awol. Then, last December, to his surprise, he was honourably discharged. Sometimes he worries that extremism still has a grip over him. Towards the end of 2019 a deli that he was working in was robbed by two young black men and an older woman was assaulted, Mike tried to stop them and they pulled out a gun. Later that night Mike recognised the same ugly, dehumanising, racist ideas crowding his thoughts again but he fought against them. ""I've made continual efforts to be anti-racist, to be actively anti-racist. But it is difficult and I don't want to pretend like it isn't."" As he clawed his way out of the extremist rabbit hole, he saw some Americans fall deeper into it. Oakland and Kenosha weren't the only places where Black Lives Matters protesters were injured and Mike was horrified by the attack on Capitol Hill. The US is a loosely bound ""union of otherwise warring clans"", he says. ""And when you decide to drop a match on it, it can get incredibly dangerous. I've already seen a tremendous amount of violence."" Mike wants people to understand how easy it is in America today for extremist ideology to take over someone's life. ""I was a teenager with basic internet access in suburban California, and I became radicalised enough to want to commit acts of violence against people because of the colour of their skin or their religion,"" he says. ""The thing I want people to know is that I was a Nazi. Not in 1939 Bavaria but in modern-day America."" Mike is a pseudonym Just one conversation was enough to recruit Christian Picciolini into the neo-Nazi movement, but it took him years to get out. To make amends for his wrongdoing, he has spent the last quarter of a century persuading hundreds of others to make a break with extremism.

How a Â£5 bet changed a life forever,"Frank Higgins, pictured to the right, with his family Thirty years ago, Frank Higgins made a Â£5 bet with his wife that would change his life forever. Her challenge? She bet he wouldn't go to a night class, at what is now the Belfast Met, to study English. Not only did she lose the bet, but that course catapulted Frank into new careers, qualifications, becoming a tour guide at Auschwitz and decades of cross-community work. Frank, now 61 and from Belfast, left school at 15 with no qualifications, joined the Army and later worked in the city's shipyard. ""You didn't need to be able to write in the shipyard,"" he tells BBC News NI. ""Whenever you lose the ability to write you try to hide it. ""Do you remember in school, kids doing an exam would put their hand over what they were trying to write so you couldn't see? ""That's what was happening to me. I couldn't spell. I stopped writing altogether."" Frank, right, meeting former Irish president Mary McAleese His wife, who had herself started night school, saw how he was feeling and bet him the price of the class for motivation. That very first class gave him the confidence to pursue all of the things he has since done. The teacher ""was the type of person who understood people like me who wanted to write, who were artistic, but didn't have a clue how to do it,"" he says. GCSEs were followed by A-Levels, a history degree and masters at the Open University as well as numerous Belfast Met vocational courses. Frank has now worked as an engineer, trainer and is currently a tour guide. His love of history led him to write a book on the history of his birthplace, Brown's Square, now behind Castlecourt in Belfast city centre. Brown's Square used to be tacked on to the Shankill Road, but is now separated by the Westlink. A place steeped in history, it is known as a loyalist area but not many people are aware of its shared history. ""It was the place where the United Irishmen like Henry Joy McCracken met and planned the battle of Antrim, and James 'Jemmy' Hope, one of the United Irishmen died there,"" says Frank. ""The masters gave me the tools to research and reference work and become a published author."" However, it is his cross-community work and his work as a tour guide that has made him most proud. In 2009, Frank had his own training company and a passion for bringing communities together. ""I grew up in the street where the modern UVF was created. However, I had also worked for a training company in Andersonstown in west Belfast,"" he explains. He says he opened an Irish language internet cafe on the Falls Road. ""Bearing in mind that I'm an ex-British soldier, that was opened by Gerry Adams,"" he says. ""We had European funding, what used to happen in the early 2000s was if you got European funding, you would tick the box to do cross community - maybe a football match for the other side. ""I wanted to do it for real and created a series of projects that taught Irish history in a neutral manner - covering all difficult things - not avoiding the Troubles or republican and loyalist paramilitaries."" He took a cross community group of children to Glasnevin Cemetery andthe original Battle of the Boyne site, and it was that cross community work that would lead him to becoming a tour guide at Auschwitz. During the 2000s, the Polish community in Northern Ireland had grown substantially. Followingclashes between Northern Ireland and Polish football fans in Belfast in 2009 at a World Cup qualifier,external, Frank was asked if he could think of a way to improve relations between the two communities. ""At the time I was at university and my lecturer, Prof Brian Barton, told me the Polish fighter squadron protected Belfast during World War Two,"" he recalls. He devised a programme to teach the local community Polish history, which included a three-day visit to Krakow and a visit to Auschwitz.

Senior Lib Dem MP 'regrets' paid work from office,"Layla Moran insisted ""it will not happen again"" Two MPs have admitted using their Commons offices for non-parliamentary paid meetings. Liberal Democrat Layla Moran and Conservative Crispin Blunt appeared via video link on a panel discussing political prisoners in Saudi Arabia. The event last November was organised by law firm Bindmans LLP. According to the register of financial interests for MPs, Ms Moran was paid Â£3,000 by the firm and Mr Blunt received Â£6,000. Bindmans described the meeting as an ""evidence session"", which heard from human rights organisations and family members of detained Saudi Arabian activists. Under House of Commons rules, MPs must not use the parliamentary facilities for non-parliamentary work. Which MPs have second jobs? MPs under scrutiny over their second jobs Ms Moran, MP for Oxford West and Abingdon, has apologised and said she ""deeply regretted"" it. In a statement, Ms Moran said: ""With MPs from other parties, I worked on the detention of political prisoners in Saudi Arabia with Bindmans. ""I deeply regret that I 'zoomed' in for one meeting from my office in Parliament when Covid restrictions were in place. ""I take full responsibility for this and it will not happen again."" Crispin Blunt said MPs were being subjected to an ""absurd feeding frenzy"" Mr Blunt, who represents Reigate, told the BBC it did not occur to him that there would be an issue using a room in Parliament at no cost to the taxpayer. He said the MPs on the panel were discussing a matter of ""serious public concern"" and emphasised he would accept the findings of any investigation by the parliamentary standards commissioner if a complaint was made. He told the BBC: ""It was a parliamentary panel, although one not formed as either an all-party-parliamentary group or a select committee. He added: ""I have chaired three of these detention review panels over recent years and as the panel members were all parliamentarians, each panel cross party, advised by legal counsel, examining matters of serious public and human rights concern - that on any reasonable interpretation the work would meet a definition of being 'parliamentary'."" Mr Blunt continued that while the panel members had been paid a fee for their time and expertise devoted to the work, it had been declared in the usual way, and the process was open to public scrutiny throughout. He said he thought MPs were being subjected to an ""absurd feeding frenzy"" by the media in relation to their additional work that was now ""doing wider damage to the institution of Parliament by creating a wholly inaccurate image in the mind of the wider public"". Politicians are allowed to have second jobs outside Westminster but the work they do has come under the spotlight sinceTory MP Owen Paterson, who has since stood down, broke lobbying ruleswhen working as a consultant. And questions have been raised about Conservative MP andformer attorney general Sir Geoffrey Cox, who earned about Â£900,000last year through his work outside Parliament. He notched up the wage bill in his work as a lawyer, including travelling to the British Virgin Islands (BVI) to advise on a corruption inquiry. Labour chair Anneliese Dodds previously accused him of taking advantage of Covid restrictions to work remotely from the Caribbean.

Liam Gallagher's Wonderwall tambourine sold,"His tambourine is one of former Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher trademarks A tambourine used in the recording of Oasis' album (What's The Story) Morning Glory has been sold for seven-times its estimate at auction. Liam Gallagher used the instrument on hits Wonderwall and Champagne Supernova before throwing it out after recording in Monmouthshire in 1995. The album defined the Britpop era and has sold more than 22 million copies. Now Morning Glory's engineer has sold the tambourine, which had a Â£300-Â£500 guide price, for Â£3,600 at auction.

"Dutch partial lockdown to tackle Covid surgeThe measures will last three weeks, while Austria plans a lockdown for the unvaccinated.Europe","Clashes occurred as the prime minister was announcing the new restrictions Police in the Netherlands have used water cannon on protesters opposed to a new partial lockdown imposed amid record coronavirus infections and rising intensive care cases. Three weeks of restrictions for shops, sport and catering were announced by Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday. Much of Europe is facing a surge in cases, blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. Austria is expected to back a lockdown for unvaccinated people this weekend. Restrictions are to be be imposed first in the two provinces of Upper Austria and Salzburg from Monday, according to Health Minister Wolfgang MÃ¼ckstein. Denmark, which had downgraded coronavirus as no longer a ""socially critical"" disease, has re-instated a Covid pass that was phased out in September. The government wants to push through a law allowing workplaces to require the pass for staff. Covid passes set to stay as Europe heads for winter The Dutch prime minister said that fortunately the vast majority of people in the Netherlands had been vaccinated. But he said the three-week partial lockdown would start on Saturday evening: Non-essential shops will have to shut at 18:00 (17:00 GMT) and supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and hotels at 20:00 Professional and amateur sport will continue, but behind closed doors That includes the Netherlands' football World Cup qualifier against Norway on 16 November The 18:00 closure applies to casinos and saunas as well as hairdressers and sex workers A maximum of four guests aged over 13 will be allowed at people's homes As many people should work from home as possible Cinemas and theatres will stay open. Social distancing of 1.5m (5ft) is being reintroduced where Covid passes are not in operation. The caretaker cabinet is also working on a change in the law to allow businesses to choose whether they want to limit entry to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered. The catering industry has reacted angrily to the news; a spokesman told public broadcaster NOS the government had ""crossed a line"". Last weekend, thousands of protesters marched through The Hague in anger at existing Covid restrictions. Latest daily figures on Saturday showed 13,902 new Covid cases - the third-highest daily rate since the start of the pandemic - and 33 deaths. Dutch vaccination rates are relatively high, with 82.4% of over-12s having two doses, or 73% of the total population. Police said they had taken action to ""restore public order"" Protesters took to the streets in The Hague after Mr Rutte's announcement. Police fired water cannon after some of the crowd started throwing stones and fireworks at them. InAustria, vaccine take-up is at 65% and Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg says he will talk to provincial governors on Sunday before the green light is given for a national lockdown for the unvaccinated. ""The situation in Austria is worrying and infection numbers are rising rapidly, especially in Upper Austria and Salzburg,"" the health minister warned. The two provinces have a combined population of more than two million. Upper Austria governor Thomas Stelzer says people who have not been vaccinated will be able to leave home only for essential reasons such as going to work, buying food or to exercise. It is unclear how that would be enforced. Germany,which has also seen record Covid numbers this week, declared Austria a high-risk area on Friday, so that anyone visiting who has not been vaccinated or recovered from Covid will have to quarantine for 10 days. Eastern European countries have for weeks been fighting record infection rates, as they grapple with the lowest vaccine rates on the continent: Russiaannounced another 40,123 cases and 1,235 deaths in the past 24 hours on Friday Ukrainerecorded 24,058 more infections and 750 deaths Romania recorded another 307 deaths,external, involving 286 unvaccinated people, but case numbers are down Sloveniahas a record 215 Covid patients in intensive care, a relatively high figure for a population of more than two million Czechdaily Covid infections have topped 10,000 for the third time this week; the government is set to announce tighter restrictions *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average.

Seven ways to limit warming,"The COP27 climate summit in Sharm el-Sheikh has been billed as a ""watershed moment"" for climate change. What are some key things countries need to do to tackle the problem? Burning fossil fuels such as oil, gas, and especially coal, releases carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere, trapping heat and raising global temperatures. It's an issue which has to be tackled at government level if temperature rises are to be limited to 1.5C - the level considered the gateway to dangerous climate change. However, a recentUN report,external, has said the ongoing use of fossil fuels means remaining below this temperature rise is now unlikely. The alternative to fossil fuels is renewable energy such as wind or solar. The World Resources Institute (WRI) State of the Climate report 2022 revealed that from 2019 to 2021, solar energy generation grew by 47 percent and wind by 31 percent. But some countries have recently had to use more coaland liquified Natural Gas (LNG)- the most polluting fossil fuels - due to a shortage in gas energy supply arising from the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Are countries on track to meet the climate goals from Glasgow? A 2021UN report,externalsuggested that reducing emissions of methane could make an important contribution to tackling the planetary emergency. Researchers have found that changing cows' diets can reduce the methane they produce A substantial amount of methane is released from ""flaring"" - the burning of natural gas during oil extraction - and could be stopped with technical fixes. What is gas flaring and why is it a problem? Finding better ways of disposing of rubbish is also important, because landfill sites are another big methane source. At COP26 in 2021 in Glasgow,nearly 100 countries agreed to cut methane emissions,in a deal spearheaded by the US and the EU. The Global Methane Pledge aims to limit methane emissions by 30% compared with 2020 levels. We'll also need to change the way we power the vehicles we use to get around on land, sea and in the air. Ditching petrol and diesel cars and switching to electric vehicles will be critical. Lorries and buses could be powered by hydrogen fuel, ideally produced using renewable energy. And scientists are working on new, cleaner fuels for aircraft, although campaigners are also urging people to reduce the number of flights they take. Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think The UN's body of climate scientists, the IPCC, said in 2018, that to have a realistic chance of keeping the global temperature rise under 1.5C, we will have to remove CO2 from the air. Forests are excellent at soaking it up from the atmosphere - one reason why campaigners and scientists emphasise the need to protect the natural world by reducing deforestation. Programmes of mass tree-planting are seen as a way of offsetting CO2 emissions. Trees are likely to be important as countries wrestle with their net zero targets, because once emissions have been reduced as much as possible, remaining emissions could be ""cancelled out"" by carbon sinks such as forests. But theUK Forestry Commission also says,externalit is important to plant trees in the ""right place and for the right reasons"" - to make sure they are suitable for the environment and provide wider benefits to our ecosystems. World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030 Emerging technologies that artificially remove CO2 from the atmosphere, or stop it being released in the first place, could play a role. A number ofdirect-air capture facilitiesare being developed, including plants built by Carbon Engineering in Texas and Climeworks in Switzerland. They work by using huge fans to push air through a chemical filter that absorbs CO2. Climeworks' first direct-air capture plant opened in 2017 and it now has 15 machines in operation around the world Another method is carbon capture and storage, which captures emissions at ""point sources"" where they are produced, such as at coal-fired power plants. The CO2 is then buried deep underground. However, the technology is expensive - and controversial, because it is seen by critics as helping perpetuate a reliance on fossil fuels. The device that reverses CO2 emissions At the Copenhagen COP summit in 2009, rich countries pledged to provide $100bn (Â£88bn) in financing by 2020, designed to help developing countries fight and adapt to climate change. That target date was not met but is expected to be reached in 2023. The plan also estimated that developed countries would need to mobilise more than $100 billion per year each year through to 2025. Countries such as Kiribati in the Pacific Ocean are on the front line of the effects of global warming Many coal-dependent nations have shown interest in moving away from coal. However, they need support to construct and establish new renewable energy. Experts believe poorer nations will need continuing financial support to help them move towards greener energy. For instance, the US, EU and UK last yearprovided $8.5bn to help South Africa phase out coal use. What do the poorest countries want from climate summit?

LiveLiveClimate deal talks go into overtime5 minutes ago,"A deal has been reached at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow after nearly two weeks of negotiations Boris Johnson calls it a ""big step forward"" but says there is a huge amount of work still to be done India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase-down"" not the ""phase-out"" of coal power Alok Sharma says it was important to get a deal done - but many countries voiced serious disappointment The deal is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres meanwhile says: ""It's an important step but it's not enough"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We are closing our coverage of the climate summit for today. Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all. Before we say goodbye - here are some of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Day one started off with hundreds of people having to wait in long queues to get into the venue Former US President Barack Obama brought some star power to the summit, and called on young activists to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pictured maskless and resting his eyes inside the hall And was his US counterpart, President Joe Biden, asleep or just resting his eyes? The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively
as a team we have achieved what many people doubted."" It's been a long, long day and the COP president is now facing the press. He says he's had six hours sleep in the last few days. Stay with us for updates. Georgina RannardBBC News Sohanur Rahman, 25, is a founding member of Bangladeshâs Friday for Future movement, leading youth activists in the country as they face the dire effects of rising sea levels and flooding. As the Glasgow agreement was gavelled, he told me that youth were recognised for the first time at COP, but âthe end result is nothingâ. He feels helpless and betrayed going back to Bangladesh with this agreement and says the ""empty pledges"" won't protect anyone from the climate crisis. He does not believe it will limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C, despite what politicians say. ""We have no scope to hold them accountable,"" he explains. He welcomes the good news on loss and damage - an acknowledgment from rich countries that poor nations need support paying for impacts of climate change they can't adapt to. But the voices of the most affected people were silenced, he says - âthe interest of the fossil fuel corporations have been clearly pandered to by the UK COP presidency.â This video can not be played COP26 deal changes 'a real blow' - Marshall Islands Tina Stege, climate envoy for Marshall Islands, has sent us her reaction to the deal. Her highly vulnerable Pacific Island country is at risk of being wiped out by climate change. She says last-minute changes to the wording on coal and the weakened language on loss and damage are ""blows"". There was a conversation we were not a part of and it was a real blow.. We had been told that there would be no further changes to the text and we had already swallowed some changes that were difficult to swallow."" Tina Stege But the ""real progress made"" in Glasgow is a ""lifeline"" for her country and it should not be discounted, she argues. Stege is pleased that money on climate finance was secured. And she says it's positive that countries are being called on to submit new targets to reduce emissions next year. Disappointment being expressed with the final pact is ""understandable"" after key issues were ""watered down in the final hours"", Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. However, the SNP politician adds there ""can be no doubt"" the negotiations in Glasgow have led to improvement on some key areas. While there has been much positive progress, there is no escaping the fact that COP26 has not delivered as much as global south countries, activists and campaigners rightly demanded and I firmly believe that the leaders of the rich developed countries must go further."" Nicola Sturgeon UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a short statement on Twitter praising the deal reached by leaders in Glasgow - but says there is more work to be done.  We asked nations to come together for our planet at @COP26, and they have answered that call. I want to thank the leaders, negotiators and campaigners who made this pact happen â and the people of Glasgow who welcomed them with open arms.  I also want particularly to thank COP President Alok Sharma who has worked incredibly hard to bring countries together.  Today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5C.  I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal.""  While he may not be enthused with the deal, Shadow business minister  - and former Labour leader - Ed Miliband has nothing but praise for  Alok Sharma. He says Sharma, a Tory MP and minister of state at the cabinet office, has shown himself to be a ""person of decency, integrity and commitment"". Throughout the afternoon, the COP26 president has been seen flitting between various delegations, discussing the text and working to get the deal across the line. Allow Twitter content?

COP President Alok Sharma is still inside the conference hall, but he is expected to give a news conference when the official proceedings are done. The lectern is ready, flags and all, along with 100 journalists waiting for him outside the hall. India, along with China, pushed for the last-minute change to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But why? India - the world's third-largest emitter of fossil fuels - still relies heavily on coal, which makes up 70% of the country's energy production. A big part of their position can be summed up by comments from India's environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav earlier. He asked how anyone could expect developing countries to make promises on phasing out coal when they have still to deal with their development agendas and eradicating poverty. On top of that, four million people are employed in India's coal industry - and in the last decade the country's coal consumption has nearly doubled. It  continues to import large quantities of coal and is planning to open dozens of new mines in the coming years despite pledges to invest massively in renewable energy. An average Indian still consumes far less power than a Brit or an American. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Last-ditch effort to clinch climate dealSplits over subsidies for fossil fuels and financial help to poorer nations have taken talks into overtime.,"Scientists say extreme weather events, such as severe flooding, are becoming more frequent because of climate change The president of the COP26 climate summit said the talks had reached a ""moment of truth for our planet"". As the meeting entered its final hours, he urged delegates to agree to a draft agreement aimed at averting dangerous global warming. But he faced late objections from India and others to a clause on cutting fossil fuels, and calls for more financial help for developing nations. It's still not clear what needs to happen for these issues to be resolved. ""You all know that the world is willing us on to be bold - to be ambitious"" said the UK's Alok Sharma, who is chairing the talks. ""So much rests on the decisions we collectively take today,"" he told delegates, urging them to get on board with the draft plan published earlier on Saturday. The key achievements of the draft so far are the inclusion of a commitment to phase-out coal, re-visiting emissions-cutting plans on a more regular basis and increased financial help for developing countries. But India's environment minister Bhupender Yadav told the meeting that ""consensus remains elusive"". EXPLAINER:A really simple guide to climate change CONTEXT:How do we know climate change is caused by humans? In an apparent reference to coal, he said: ""Targeting any particular sector is uncalled for. Every country will arrive at net zero as per its national circumstances."" ""Developing countries have a right to their fair share of the global carbon budget and are entitled to the responsible use of fossil fuels,"" he added. He also objected to proposals to end ""inefficient fossil fuel subsidies"" - financial benefits provided to producers of oil, gas and coal. China, which is understood to have earlier raised concerns about the wording, said it hoped that ""all parties will show excellent flexibility"" and said it now wanted only small edits to the text. South Africa's negotiator backed objections over the section on fossil fuels saying: ""We don't feel that one size fits all is a good approach."" But Mr Sharma said the text was a ""balanced package"". US climate envoy John Kerry said: ""If it's a good negotiation all the parties are uncomfortable. And this, I think, has been a good negotiation."" Fires and other extreme weather phenomena can become the norm if temperature rises are not capped Lia Nicholson, from Antigua and Barbuda's delegation, and speaking on behalf of small island states, said they were ""extremely disappointed"" by the lack of progress on loss and damage - the principle that richer countries, which bear the main responsibility for the global warming, should pay compensation to poorer ones because of climate impacts. She said: ""We will express our grievances in due course,"" but added: ""We implore all parties to support our common outcome and move forward."" Promises in Glasgow will not be enough to limit global warming to 1.5C. It is a key part of the 2015 Paris agreement that most countries signed up to. Scientists say that limiting temperature rise to 1.5C compared to pre-industrial levels will protect us from the most dangerous impacts of climate change. Meeting the goal requires global emissions to be cut by 45% by 2030 and to zero overall by 2050. One example of the impact of global temperature rise above 2C is the death of virtually all tropical coral reefs, scientists say. One estimate by the Climate Action Tracker calculated that the planet is stillset to warm by 2.4C if the current pledges are all met. At COPs, it often all comes down to a huddle. Inside the main Plenary Room, the days of negotiations turn into a face-to-face discussion, like merchants in a souk. Around them, delegates cluster, keen to be there at the moment when key differences between the groups or countries are resolved. This afternoon, US climate envoy John Kerry and chief US negotiator Sue Biniaz stood toe-to-toe with Ahmadou Sebory Toure, the delegate from Guinea, who also represents the G77 group of nations, a large part of the developing world. At stake, how much money the developed world may have to pay to the developing world to compensate for the loss and damage done to developing countries because of climate change. Interest in that ends when Mr Kerry sweeps across the room to talk to the UK President of the COP, Alok Sharma and his chief negotiator, Archie Young. Then, all eyes move to the EU's chief negotiator, Frans Timmermans, as his team work out the repercussions of the G77 huddle. Eventually, the COP chairman decides enough is enough and further discussions must take place elsewhere. The session ends and so do the huddles. For now. But experts say the 1.5C target is still achievable: at COP15 in Copenhagen more than a decade ago, estimates suggested the world was heading for between 3.5 and 4.2C of warming. If the references to phasing out coal and fossil fuel subsidies remain in the final deal, it would be an historic moment in climate negotiations. Gabriela Bucher, Oxfam's international executive director, said: ""Clearly some world leaders think they aren't living on the same planet as the rest of us. It seems no amount of fires, rising sea levels or droughts will bring them to their senses to stop increasing emissions at the expense of humanity. ""The world's poorest have done the least to cause the climate emergency, yet are the ones left struggling to survive while also footing the bill. Climate finance, or the money promised by richer countries to poorer countries to fight climate change, continues to be one of the most contentious points.

LiveLiveClimate deal talks go into overtime1 minute ago,"A deal has been reached at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow after nearly two weeks of negotiations Boris Johnson calls it a ""big step forward"" but says there is a huge amount of work still to be done India and China asked for a crucial last minute-change to the agreement, calling for the ""phase-down"" not the ""phase-out"" of coal power Alok Sharma says it was important to get a deal done - but many countries voiced serious disappointment The deal is receiving a mixed reaction - Greenpeace says it keeps the 1.5C goal ""only just alive"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres meanwhile says: ""It's an important step but it's not enough"" The summit's overall goal was to chart a path to keep warming limited to 1.5C and avoid the worst impacts of climate change Edited by Tiffany Wertheimer We are closing our coverage of the climate summit for today. Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all. Before we say goodbye - here are some of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Day one started off with hundreds of people having to wait in long queues to get into the venue Former US President Barack Obama brought some star power to the summit, and called on young activists to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pictured maskless and resting his eyes inside the hall And was his US counterpart, President Joe Biden, asleep or just resting his eyes? The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively

Robin Swann set to unveil carers pay proposals,"Many vulnerable people need regular visits from carers in order to be able to live in their own homes Health minister Robin Swann is finalising proposals to improve pay for social care staff in Northern Ireland. A spokesperson for the Department of Health said officials have been in discussion with employers and a decision was due ""in the very near future"". Concern has been growing about a shortage of staff in the sector. Some domiciliary care companies have had to withdraw services as they struggle to recruit. The spokesperson said: ""The department can confirm that discussions have been ongoing in respect of funding for remuneration of staff in the domiciliary care and the wider social care sector and that proposals are being finalised. ""Notwithstanding ongoing budgetary pressures, the minister intends to announce his decision in the very near future. ""In developing these proposals, we have had constructive engagement with social care employers with the shared objective of improving terms and conditions for employees."" At present, about 75% of home care in Northern Ireland is provided by the independent sector. On Thursday, Dr Bob Brown of the Western Health and Social Care Trust told councillors in Londonderry the domiciliary care sector was struggling to recruit and retain staff. He said an additional Â£2 per hour could have a ""significant impact"". Dr Brown, the trust's director of care and older people's services, told the council's health committee the department has been working with the trust ""to identify ways this winter to incentivise domiciliary care"". Dr Bob Brown said the trust has ""made its case to the department"" ""Terms and conditions are a key issue,"" Dr Brown said. He added: ""There has been some calculations that indicate, that assuming an increase in the hourly rate gets straight into the carers' hands rather than the provider's hands, it could have a very significant impact on recruitment, even a Â£2 per hour increase."" Carer shortage leaves Greysteel woman 'stuck in hospital' The Western Trust said that proposals on domiciliary care staff pay ""are under active consideration"". ""To clarify, these are not Western Trust proposals but NI-wide proposals led by the minister and department,"" the trust said, in a statement. ""They form part of a package of measures being finalised to support the domiciliary care sector through this winter. ""In addition, proposals for the longer-term reform of adult social care will shortly be the subject of a public consultation launched by the minister. ""The consultation will include the vital issue of properly rewarding and recognising social care staff - which the minister has made clear is a priority for him."" About 1,600 people across Northern Ireland have been assessed as needing a care package - that is they need help with washing, dressing or cooking, or adaptations to their home. Many are waiting in hospitals or care homes because there is not enough home-based carers to provide the level of care they require. Domiciliary or home care packages allow those who are ill or vulnerable to be cared for in their own house. But, according to the Northern Trust, some independent providers have raised concerns about the sustainability of their service as they do not have enough staff. The trust said the problem is particularly acute in the Mid Ulster area with concerns also emerging in Causeway area too. While it is mostly the independent sector that is affected, BBC News NI understands that the trust's own service is experiencing challenges which may mean reducing the number of calls. Figures from the Department of Health show that as of October the number of people waiting for a care package, many of whom are in care homes, has dropped to 1,657. That includes: 410 people - Belfast Health Trust 402 people - Northern Health Trust 280 people - Southern Health Trust 424 people - South Eastern Health Trust 141 people - Western Health Trust BBC News NI understands that many front-line care staff feel the number waiting on care packages could be much higher.

EU welcomes 'changing tone' in NI Protocol talks,"MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ says he is hopeful the two sides can make progress The EU's chief Brexit negotiator has welcomed what he says is ""a changing tone of discussion"" in talks about theNorthern Ireland Protocol. MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ was talking after a meeting in London with Lord Frost. Mr Å efÄoviÄ said he was hopeful the two sides could make progress on the supply of medicines next week. Meanwhile, Lord Frost said there were still ""significant gaps"" to be bridged between the bloc and the UK, and that talks would be ""intensified"". The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. What is Article 16 and why does it matter? Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem Suspension of NI-EU deal 'may be only option' That means that goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, removing the threat of a ""hard border"". However, goods arriving into Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are now subject to checks and control - amounting to what is being referred to as an ""Irish Sea border"". The UK wants fundamental changes to the operation and governance of the protocol. Lord Frost says triggering Article 16 could be the ""only option"" The EU has proposed a package of measures which would reduce its practical impact. Mr Å efÄoviÄ said there would still need to be a ""reciprocal"" move from the UK. He added: ""We need to make serious headway in the course of next week. ""This is particularly important as regards the issue of medicines. I stand by my commitment to do whatever it takes to address this issue in line with what industry tells us."" He said agreement in this area could be a ""blueprint"" for reaching a wider deal"". In a statement, a UK government spokesperson said the preference ""remained to find a consensual way forward"", but that Article 16 was a ""legitimate safeguard"". ""Lord Frost also underlined the need to address the full range of issues the UK had identified in the course of discussions, if a comprehensive and durable solution was to be found that supported the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and was in the best interests of Northern Ireland. ""In this context, although talks had so far been conducted in a constructive spirit, Lord Frost underlined that in order to make progress, it was important to bring new energy and impetus to discussions."" The spokesperson said next week's talks would be ""intensified"". Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the UK government needed to take ""decisive action within weeks"". He added: ""It is essential that either the government gets agreement with the EU, and in the absence of such an agreement that it does move to trigger Article 16."" The protocol means Northern Ireland is still in the EU's pharmaceutical regulatory system. However it continues to get most of its medicines from Great Britain which is outside the EU's system. This is creating potential supply complications which have lead some firms in GB to indicate they will stop supplying products to NI. Nothing has changed so far as a ""grace period"" means the protocol is not yet being implemented for medicines. The EU's acknowledges that as it stands the protocol creates too much of a burden in this area and should be changed. In October it publishedproposals to tackle the difficulties, which will include changing EU law. If the protocol is causing serious difficulties either side can unilaterally suspend the relevant parts of it by using the Article 16 safeguards clause. However, UK ministers have said such a move is not imminent. What is Article 16 and why does it matter? What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all. Before we say goodbye - here are some of the most memorable moments from the past fortnight: Climate activist Greta Thunberg was mobbed as she arrived in Glasgow Day one started off with hundreds of people having to wait in long queues to get into the venue Former US President Barack Obama brought some star power to the summit, and called on young activists to ""stay angry"" in the fight against climate change UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson was pictured maskless and resting his eyes inside the hall And was his US counterpart, President Joe Biden, asleep or just resting his eyes? The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively
as a team we have achieved what many people doubted."" It's been a long, long day and the COP president is now facing the press. He says he's had six hours sleep in the last few days.

The Queen and other royals delivered powerful messages to the delegates Boris Johnson had to apologise to Israeli minister Karine Elharrar after she wasn't able to get into the venue in her wheelchair Thousands of climate activists protested in Glasgow - and cities around the world - during the summit China and the US issued a surprise joint statement vowing to boost climate co-operation There was a massive Earth hanging from the ceiling, which Greenpeace flew a ""not for sale"" banner up to on the last day, using helium balloons David ShukmanBBC News Science Editor, reporting from Glasgow Our science editor David Shukman has been reporting on climate change for nearly 20 years. This is his 10th COP summit - and here's his view on what we've seen agreed tonight: These conferences tend, at best, to produce incremental
progress not dramatic breakthroughs. And as US envoy John Kerry told me yesterday, this one was
never going to halt global warming on its own. So the hope is that agreeing to pick up the pace of climate
diplomacy, and packing the diary with more reviews and meetings, will make it
harder for governments to dodge the issue. Another hope is that the shame heaped on the richest nations for
failing to keep their word on climate aid to the poorest - together with new
arrangements - will lead to much-needed cash actually getting delivered. The initiatives by groups of countries on deforestation,
methane and fossil fuels do at least indicate a willingness to head in a new
direction, even if theyâre not verifiable. But is the goal of limiting the rise in temperatures to 1.5C really
alive? Yes, if youâre really optimistic that the promises made here
will be kept and that the real world is embracing renewable energy, electric
cars and all the rest rapidly enough. As you can imagine, reaction is continuing to pour in to the Glasgow deal. EU leader Ursula von der Leyen has shared a statement on Twitter praising today's agreement as ""a step in the right direction"". She says that the deal ""sends a clear message time is up for fossil
fuel subsidies and unabated coal"". (That means coal produced without carbon capture technology.) ""If all long-term commitments announced in Glasgow will be
implemented, we should keep global warming under 2C,"" she adds. ""So we need to work further â so that next yearâs climate
conference in Egypt puts us firmly on track for 1.5C."" The difference between a world that warms by 2C instead of 1.5C in terms of climate impacts is significant. At the higher figure, many more people would face extreme heat, all coral reefs would be destroyed and flooding would be even worse. Allow Twitter content?

Asked how he will convince critics that the agreement represent urgent action, the US climate envoy says they should read it first, before saying it's a failure. ""The reality is that whatâs
happened here is significant,"" he says. ""Did I appreciate that we
had to adjust something tonight in an
unusual way? No,"" he adds, talking about the change to a line in the agreement about coal, which was pushed for by China and India. ""But you have to make tough decisions in this business sometimes."" US climate envoy John Kerry says the majority of the 20 largest economies in the world - which are responsible for 80% of emissions - are committed to reaching the 1.5C global warming target. He says Glasgow gives a clear blueprint for ""what we need to do"" from now until 2050. He admits some people ""may have wanted even stronger language"" but says the text that has been agreed to has the first ever mention of coal. Kerry goes on to say that this ""is the beginning of a 10-year sprint"". On the US-China agreement announced earlier in the week - which contained few concrete measures - he says it was announced ""with a view to producing a reduction in emissions"". ""We are the two largest economies in the world and we are going to work together to raise climate ambition in this decade,"" he says. There's been a lot of reporting on how India pushed for the language on coal to be weakened, but China was very strongly pushing for it behind the scenes, our reporters in Glasgow say. Helen BriggsEnvironment correspondent in Glasgow After a day of high emotion, tension and drama, at times,
the mood has lightened here. Thereâs a frenzy of activity as delegates spill out of the
plenary hall and journalists furiously file pieces to camera. Others are packing up their kit, knowing weâre meant to
leave within a few hours of the gavel falling for the last time. This slice of UN territory â for the fortnight the
conference lasted â is quickly being returned to Scottish soil. Staff are
cleaning, packing up boxes, and moving tables and chairs. On the way in this morning, everyone was taking pictures,
wondering if this would be the last day. Itâs hard to believe it is â and
that the Glasgow Climate Pact has finally become a reality. Roger HarrabinBBC environment analyst in Glasgow This outcome is good and bad. First the good: The measures taken are the strongest seen in 30 years of climate talks. Polluting nations agreed they hadnât done enough tocut emissions, and said theyâd do more over the next year. Rich nations also agreed todouble the amount of cashtheyâll offer for vulnerable countries to adapt to worsening weather. And after years of pressure theyâve accepted there should be a fund to actuallycompensate poor nationshit by extreme events. Fossil fuelswere mentioned too, for the first time at a COP, although India watered down the deal. There was also an innovation from the UK to seek separate agreements between governments, businesses and civil society onmethane, forests and innovation. The UK was also praised for itsdiplomacy. Thatâs the good news. The bad news is that if every government does everything it promises, the world will still face a catastrophic temperature rise of around 2C. This video can not be played COP26: 'Paris built the arena, Glasgow starts the race' - Kerry We're now hearing from US climate envoy John Kerry, hot on the heels of Alok Sharma. He says it was always unlikely that the summit in Glasgow would result in a decision that ""was somehow going to end the crisis"". âParis built build the arena, and Glasgow started the race.
Tonight the starting gun was fired,"" he says, referring to the Paris climate agreement in 2015. ""As a result of what took place here... nations that have
never considered having the word 'coal' in a plan... it's on the books â it's part
of the decision."" He adds that ""you have to phase-down coal before you can end coal"". ""This is the beginning of something,"" he says. When asked about the ""heartbreaking"" stories of poorer and island nations and how they are being affected by climate change, Sharma says he understands their disappointment with parts of the agreement. ""What was important was
to get a deal over the line, and that all the hard work... was not going to
dissipate,"" he says, defending the late compromises. Asked about the tense and seemingly fraught discussions in the summit's final hours, Sharma declines to go into detail about the back and forth that took place between negotiators. But he adds: ""Anyone who has seen footage of the conversations can make up their own minds about how I felt."" I'm sorry we couldn't hold the original language on coal, but nevertheless we do have language on coal and I think that is a start."" Alok Sharma, COP president In response to a question, Alok Sharma, who has led this summit, says he wishes the 11th hour watering down of the agreement on coal had not happened. But he says, ""we do have language on coal, on phase-down"" and that no-one would have thought that line would have been retained at all earlier in the summit. The line calling for the ""phase-down of unabated coal"" and an end to ""inefficient"" fossil fuel subsidies is unprecedented in a COP agreement, experts say, even if it was weakened. Alok Sharma calls the agreement a ""fragile win"" and says that the hard work starts now. ""We have kept 1.5C alive â that was our overarching objective... But I would
still say that the pulse of 1.5C is weak."" He was asked about the moment he became emotional during the formal plenary. ""Iâve had about six hours
sleep in the last three days,"" he says, adding ""it is emotional, collectively
as a team we have achieved what many people doubted."" It's been a long, long day and the COP president is now facing the press. He says he's had six hours sleep in the last few days. Stay with us for updates. Georgina RannardBBC News Sohanur Rahman, 25, is a founding member of Bangladeshâs Friday for Future movement, leading youth activists in the country as they face the dire effects of rising sea levels and flooding. As the Glasgow agreement was gavelled, he told me that youth were recognised for the first time at COP, but âthe end result is nothingâ. He feels helpless and betrayed going back to Bangladesh with this agreement and says the ""empty pledges"" won't protect anyone from the climate crisis. He does not believe it will limit the global temperature rise to 1.5C, despite what politicians say. ""We have no scope to hold them accountable,"" he explains. He welcomes the good news on loss and damage - an acknowledgment from rich countries that poor nations need support paying for impacts of climate change they can't adapt to. But the voices of the most affected people were silenced, he says - âthe interest of the fossil fuel corporations have been clearly pandered to by the UK COP presidency.â This video can not be played COP26 deal changes 'a real blow' - Marshall Islands Tina Stege, climate envoy for Marshall Islands, has sent us her reaction to the deal. Her highly vulnerable Pacific Island country is at risk of being wiped out by climate change. She says last-minute changes to the wording on coal and the weakened language on loss and damage are ""blows"". There was a conversation we were not a part of and it was a real blow.. We had been told that there would be no further changes to the text and we had already swallowed some changes that were difficult to swallow."" Tina Stege But the ""real progress made"" in Glasgow is a ""lifeline"" for her country and it should not be discounted, she argues. Stege is pleased that money on climate finance was secured. And she says it's positive that countries are being called on to submit new targets to reduce emissions next year. Disappointment being expressed with the final pact is ""understandable"" after key issues were ""watered down in the final hours"", Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says. However, the SNP politician adds there ""can be no doubt"" the negotiations in Glasgow have led to improvement on some key areas. While there has been much positive progress, there is no escaping the fact that COP26 has not delivered as much as global south countries, activists and campaigners rightly demanded and I firmly believe that the leaders of the rich developed countries must go further."" Nicola Sturgeon UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has posted a short statement on Twitter praising the deal reached by leaders in Glasgow - but says there is more work to be done.  We asked nations to come together for our planet at @COP26, and they have answered that call. I want to thank the leaders, negotiators and campaigners who made this pact happen â and the people of Glasgow who welcomed them with open arms.  I also want particularly to thank COP President Alok Sharma who has worked incredibly hard to bring countries together.  Today's agreement is a big step forward and, critically, we have the first ever international agreement to phase down coal and a roadmap to limit global warming to 1.5C.  I hope that we will look back on COP26 in Glasgow as the beginning of the end of climate change, and I will continue to work tirelessly towards that goal.""  While he may not be enthused with the deal, Shadow business minister  - and former Labour leader - Ed Miliband has nothing but praise for  Alok Sharma. He says Sharma, a Tory MP and minister of state at the cabinet office, has shown himself to be a ""person of decency, integrity and commitment"". Throughout the afternoon, the COP26 president has been seen flitting between various delegations, discussing the text and working to get the deal across the line. Allow Twitter content?

COP President Alok Sharma is still inside the conference hall, but he is expected to give a news conference when the official proceedings are done. The lectern is ready, flags and all, along with 100 journalists waiting for him outside the hall. India, along with China, pushed for the last-minute change to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But why? India - the world's third-largest emitter of fossil fuels - still relies heavily on coal, which makes up 70% of the country's energy production. A big part of their position can be summed up by comments from India's environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav earlier. He asked how anyone could expect developing countries to make promises on phasing out coal when they have still to deal with their development agendas and eradicating poverty. On top of that, four million people are employed in India's coal industry - and in the last decade the country's coal consumption has nearly doubled. It  continues to import large quantities of coal and is planning to open dozens of new mines in the coming years despite pledges to invest massively in renewable energy. An average Indian still consumes far less power than a Brit or an American. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Britney released from 13-year conservatorshipAn LA judge terminates a legal guardianship set up by the 39-year-old pop star's father in 2008.,"Britney Spears has described the termination of a legal arrangement that controlled many aspects of her life for 13 years as ""the best day ever"". ""I think I'm gonna cry,"" she told her 35 million Instagram followers. A judge in Los Angeles on Friday ended the conservatorship set up by the 39-year-old singer's father in 2008 with immediate effect. Fans had gathered outside the LA court to support Spears, who had described the guardianship as abusive. Her father Jamie earlier said it was ""necessary"", butagreed it was time for her ""to re-take control of her life"". ""Her life was in shambles and she was in physical, emotional, mental and financial distress,"" lawyers representing Jamie Spears said in earlier court filings. The conservatorship had power over her finances and career decisions plus major personal matters, such as her visits to her teenage sons and whether she can get remarried. The Britney Spears conservatorship case explained Britney Spears: Everything she said in court On Friday, Los Angeles County Superior Court Judge Brenda Penny ruled in favour of the singer's request to end it, which was not opposed by any of the parties involved.

As part of the ruling, Judge Penny said an accountant who served as a temporary conservator should retain some powers to settle ongoing financial issues. Addressing the crowd outside the court, Spears' lawyer Mathew Rosengart praised the singer's ""courage"" throughout the court hearings. He said he was proud that she had shone ""a light on conservatorships from California to New York"", and that as a result of her testimony, new legislation had been passed ""to try to ensure that conservatorships like this... do not happen again"".

Fans celebrated with confetti outside the LA court when it was announced Britney Spears' conservatorship had ended In a court appearance in June, the star asked the judge to end the ""abusive"" arrangement and said she was ""traumatised"". Addressing the court remotely, she said she had been drugged, forced to perform against her will and prevented from getting married and having more children. Her testimony led her father to agree to step aside.

Todayâs editors were
Lauren Turner, Tiffany Wertheimer and Kevin Ponniah. Our writers in London and Glasgow over a very long day were Georgina
Rannard, Matt Murphy, Becky Morton, Paul McLaren, Adam Durbin, Sam
Cabral, Dulcie Lee, Doug Faulkner and Mal Siret. After two long weeks of diplomatic back-and-forth, the Glasgow Climate Pact has been agreed. It has been labelled everything from historic and aggressive to fragile and disappointing. The measures are some of the strongest seen in the past 30 years of climate talks. Rich nations agreed to double the amount of cash they'll offer to vulnerable countries, and for the first time fossil fuels were mentioned in a COP agreement. But even if every government sticks to its promises, the world will still face a temperature rise of about 2C, which would lead to devastating impacts all over the globe. The overall consensus from delegates was that it was better to have an imperfect deal than no deal at all.

The lectern is ready, flags and all, along with 100 journalists waiting for him outside the hall. India, along with China, pushed for the last-minute change to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal. But why? India - the world's third-largest emitter of fossil fuels - still relies heavily on coal, which makes up 70% of the country's energy production. A big part of their position can be summed up by comments from India's environment and climate minister Bhupender Yadav earlier. He asked how anyone could expect developing countries to make promises on phasing out coal when they have still to deal with their development agendas and eradicating poverty. On top of that, four million people are employed in India's coal industry - and in the last decade the country's coal consumption has nearly doubled. It  continues to import large quantities of coal and is planning to open dozens of new mines in the coming years despite pledges to invest massively in renewable energy. An average Indian still consumes far less power than a Brit or an American. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

"Dutch partial lockdown to tackle Covid surgeThe measures will last three weeks, while Austria plans a lockdown for the unvaccinated.","Clashes occurred as the prime minister was announcing the new restrictions Police in the Netherlands have used water cannon on protesters opposed to a new partial lockdown imposed amid record coronavirus infections and rising intensive care cases. Three weeks of restrictions for shops, sport and catering were announced by Prime Minister Mark Rutte on Friday. Much of Europe is facing a surge in cases, blamed partly on low vaccine take-up in several countries. Austria is expected to back a lockdown for unvaccinated people this weekend. Restrictions are to be be imposed first in the two provinces of Upper Austria and Salzburg from Monday, according to Health Minister Wolfgang MÃ¼ckstein. Denmark, which had downgraded coronavirus as no longer a ""socially critical"" disease, has re-instated a Covid pass that was phased out in September. The government wants to push through a law allowing workplaces to require the pass for staff. Covid passes set to stay as Europe heads for winter The Dutch prime minister said that fortunately the vast majority of people in the Netherlands had been vaccinated. But he said the three-week partial lockdown would start on Saturday evening: Non-essential shops will have to shut at 18:00 (17:00 GMT) and supermarkets, cafes, restaurants and hotels at 20:00 Professional and amateur sport will continue, but behind closed doors That includes the Netherlands' football World Cup qualifier against Norway on 16 November The 18:00 closure applies to casinos and saunas as well as hairdressers and sex workers A maximum of four guests aged over 13 will be allowed at people's homes As many people should work from home as possible Cinemas and theatres will stay open. Social distancing of 1.5m (5ft) is being reintroduced where Covid passes are not in operation. The caretaker cabinet is also working on a change in the law to allow businesses to choose whether they want to limit entry to people who have been vaccinated or who have recovered. The catering industry has reacted angrily to the news; a spokesman told public broadcaster NOS the government had ""crossed a line"". Last weekend, thousands of protesters marched through The Hague in anger at existing Covid restrictions. Latest daily figures on Saturday showed 13,902 new Covid cases - the third-highest daily rate since the start of the pandemic - and 33 deaths. Dutch vaccination rates are relatively high, with 82.4% of over-12s having two doses, or 73% of the total population. Police said they had taken action to ""restore public order"" Protesters took to the streets in The Hague after Mr Rutte's announcement. Police fired water cannon after some of the crowd started throwing stones and fireworks at them. InAustria, vaccine take-up is at 65% and Chancellor Alexander Schallenberg says he will talk to provincial governors on Sunday before the green light is given for a national lockdown for the unvaccinated. ""The situation in Austria is worrying and infection numbers are rising rapidly, especially in Upper Austria and Salzburg,"" the health minister warned. The two provinces have a combined population of more than two million. Upper Austria governor Thomas Stelzer says people who have not been vaccinated will be able to leave home only for essential reasons such as going to work, buying food or to exercise. It is unclear how that would be enforced. Germany,which has also seen record Covid numbers this week, declared Austria a high-risk area on Friday, so that anyone visiting who has not been vaccinated or recovered from Covid will have to quarantine for 10 days. Eastern European countries have for weeks been fighting record infection rates, as they grapple with the lowest vaccine rates on the continent: Russiaannounced another 40,123 cases and 1,235 deaths in the past 24 hours on Friday Ukrainerecorded 24,058 more infections and 750 deaths Romania recorded another 307 deaths,external, involving 286 unvaccinated people, but case numbers are down Sloveniahas a record 215 Covid patients in intensive care, a relatively high figure for a population of more than two million Czechdaily Covid infections have topped 10,000 for the third time this week; the government is set to announce tighter restrictions *Deaths per 100,000 people Please update your browser to see full interactive This information is regularly updated but may not reflect the latest totals for each country. ** The past data for new cases is a three day rolling average.
