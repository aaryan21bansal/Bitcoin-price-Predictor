EU backtracks on vaccine export controls for NI,"Despite the reversed decision, the EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc The EU has reversed its decision to trigger an emergency provision in the Brexit deal to control Covid vaccine exports from the EU. The move could have seen checks at the border of Ireland and Northern Ireland to prevent shipments entering the UK. The Brussels U-turn came hours after it was announced, following condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast. The plans had been part of the EU's new export controls on vaccines, to combat delivery shortfalls. It is the latest development in a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the EU. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? WHO criticises EU over vaccine export controls Foster urges UK to override part of Brexit deal The Brexit dealguarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. However, Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". On Friday eveningthe EU announcedit would trigger the clause and introduce the export controls on its vaccines entering Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent the region becoming a backdoor for jabs to be sent to the UK mainland. It said the actions were ""justified"" to avert problems caused by a lack of supply. But the proposals sparked concern from Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin as well as all five parties in Northern Ireland's devolved government. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster described it as ""an absolutely incredible act of hostility"" that created a hard Irish border, while Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveneysaid in a tweet,external: ""The [Northern Ireland] Protocol is not something to be tampered with lightly, it's an essential, hard-won compromise, protecting peace and trade for many."" Later on Friday evening, following talks with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyentweeted,externalthat the UK and EU had ""agreed on the principle that there should not be restrictions on the export of vaccines by companies where they are fulfilling contractual responsibilities"". She said the backtrack, which was outlined ina European Commission statement,external, came after ""constructive talks"" with Mr Johnson in which he had expressed ""grave concerns"" about the initial plan. The BBC's Brussels correspondent, Kevin Connelly, said Ms von der Leyen's midnight tweet seemed to ""wind down"" the idea that there could be a ""vaccine war"" where jab supplies are prevented from reaching the UK. ""Mistake,"" ""misjudgement,"" ""blunder."" These are just some of words EU insiders have been using privately to describe the European Commission's initial decision on Friday to suspend areas of the Brexit deal dealing with Northern Ireland, a part of its Covid vaccine row. Although it then U-turned on those plans, critics say the damage was already done. Brussels previously lectured the UK government about respecting the Irish Protocol - which was painfully and carefully drafted during Brexit negotiations. Now the EU seemed quick to undermine the agreement. Member state Ireland felt stung that it hadn't been consulted. This all adds to the impression of chaos surrounding the EU's vaccine rollout. Brussels was already under fire from a growing number of EU countries for having been slow to sign vaccine contracts with pharmaceutical companies. This ""mishap"" over the Irish Protocol, as Spain's Foreign Minister called it, hasn't exactly helped the commission's reputation. Julian Smith, Conservative MP and former Northern Ireland secretary, said the EU had ""pulled the emergency cord"" without following the proper processes that had been agreed over years of negotiations. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move came ""without anywhere near the level of understanding of the Good Friday Agreement, of the sensitivities of the situation in Northern Ireland"". ""It was an almost Trumpian act - I'm very pleased that they've changed their minds,"" he said, adding that the EU's ""major issue"" with its Covid vaccine rollout ""does not excuse"" their actions. How many people have had the jab so far? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery Single-dose Johnson & Johnson jab is 66% effective BBC business correspondent Katie Prescottsaid firms in Northern Ireland were stunnedthat the European Commission could trigger a change that was only meant for the ""most egregious circumstances"" - just one month after the UK's post-Brexit transition period with the EU ended. Conservative MP and former international trade secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said the EU had shown it was ""willing to impose [a] hard border on Northern Ireland"" despite the ""precious"" agreements in place to prevent such a situation, with ""very little requirement and no notice"". ""It was like an episode of Carry On at the [European] Commission yesterday, except that it wasn't funny,"" he told BBC News. Mr Martin welcomed the EU's reversal, describing it as a ""positive development given the many challenges we face in tackling Covid-19"". It was not thought that the move would have directly disadvantaged Northern Ireland, which gets its vaccine supplies through the UK procurement system. The Department of Health confirmed Health Secretary Matt Hancock had a ""constructive discussion"" on the supply of vaccines with his Northern Ireland counterpart Robin Swann, whotweeted,externalit was ""essential"" confidence and trust were rebuilt after the EU's actions. The Irish government and its diplomats have spent a huge amount of time and energy educating their EU partners on the nuances of the Irish border. During the Brexit negotiations there was a slick operation where visiting dignitaries and camera crews were whisked up the road from Dublin airport to see the border in County Louth. This paid dividends for Ireland: its concerns remained top of the EU's priorities during the negotiations. Some of the European Commission's most talented officials were deeply involved in the Irish elements of the Brexit deals. But something clearly went badly awry on Friday. The use of the Article 16 mechanism, to override part of the Brexit deal, caught the Irish government by surprise. Those Commission officials with special knowledge of Ireland were either not consulted or not listened to. Dick Roche, Ireland's former Europe minister, told the BBC the government had been ""blindsided"" and ""embarrassed"". He said the Taoiseach had been ""very annoyed"" and made ""very strong representation"" to urge the Commission to change its mind. Despite later backtracking on Article 16, the EU is stillintroducing new controlsgiving its member states the power - should they want to - to block exports of the coronavirus vaccine to countries including the UK, if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. The European Commission said the temporary mechanism is to combat ""the current lack of transparency"" over vaccine exports outside the EU, and is not an export ban. But the World Health Organization isamong those criticising the move, saying ""vaccine nationalism"" could prolong the pandemic and further widen global inequality. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Twenty-nine more deaths with Covid in Wales,"There have been almost 200,000 Covid-19 cases in Wales since the start of the pandemic The number of deaths from coronavirus reported to Public Health Wales (PHW) has gone past 5,000. A further 12 people have died in Wales with Covid, taking the total to 5,001. Health Minister Vaughan Gething has apologised for ""every single life that has been lost"" during the pandemic. ""Today we reached a sobering milestone,"" said Dr Giri Shankar, Covid incident director for PHW. ""That's one life lost every 90 minutes since March last year. 5,000 families grieving."" It comes on the same day as it is confirmed thatmore than 600,000 people in Wales- 19.2% of the Welsh population - have had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine. Your tributes to those lost to Covid in Wales Booster jab 'may be needed to tackle variants' Widow's plea to BAME communities to have vaccine The PHW reports deaths that are confirmed cases in hospitals and some care homes. The number who have died with Covid when the virus is either suspected or confirmed by doctors, in all settings, is nearly 6,500. ""I'm deeply sorry for every single life that's been lost. Every family that's been affected,"" said Mr Gething. He said those that died were not ""just numbers"", adding: ""These are people who are loved and valued and leave others behind."" He said there was no ""good"" or ""bad"" figure for the numbers of deaths from the pandemic. He added: ""I'm afraid we can be terribly confident that without the measures that we've all taken together, more people would have come to harm, and more families would be grieving the loss of a loved one."" Dr Shankar urged everyone ""whatever their background, socio-demographic and ethnicity"" to have the vaccine when offered it. Vaughan Gething says it's difficult to talk about ""good"" and ""bad"" death figures in this pandemic. Many people might question the latter point. It's true that counting Covid deaths is not straightforward. Different organisations use different measures and therefore produce different figures. But of today's tragic milestone, more than two-thirds of the 5,001 deaths have occurred since September. International comparisons are difficult too, but nevertheless Wales - and the rest of the UK - has one of the highest excess death tolls in the world. There will be a large variety of possible explanations for this, from investment in health systems, to the rapidity of test and trace and the timings of lockdowns. But with elections across Britain scheduled for May, a dispassionate excavation of the data and the impact of decision making by governments will likely have to wait for the public inquiry. The worst day for Covid deaths in Wales during the whole pandemic was in January - theworst week was also last month- and the highest 13 days of coronavirus deaths reported by PHW have all occurred since mid-December. Hospital admissions involving coronavirus and Covid patients in critical care were at record levels in January - but now they are at their lowest since 28 December, at 2,261 inpatients. Wales' case rate of 116 cases per 100,000 people is the lowest in the UK and the lowest since 6 October. Mr Gething denied the Welsh Government had been naive about the risks at the start of the pandemic. This video can not be played Wales' health minister says those who have died with Covid are not ""just numbers"" He said there were ""different risks to the UK and to Wales at that point in time"". But he added ministers had ""never said"" that if coronavirus ""arrived at our shores in larger numbers then there wouldn't be harm caused - far from it"". Mr Gething said preparations had changed as more information came to light and that the ""reasonable worst case scenario"" in their plans talked about hundreds of thousands of deaths across the UK and ""nearly 26,000 deaths in Wales"". Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Mr Gething said he had warned ministers at the time that ""individual burial may no longer be possible"" but said ""we haven't reached that scenario in reality"". But he said those plans ""show how much worse this could have been"". Welsh Conservative leader in the Senedd Andrew RT Davies called the 5,000 deaths a ""grim milestone"", adding: ""We must never forget the impact on them and their loved ones."" He said the ""consistency around the messaging"" was something that he regretted and it wasn't ""clear and loud enough right the way through the pandemic"", with some confused by ""unnecessary divergences"" between governments. This video can not be played Watch how the Covid-19 map of Wales has changed as case rates have eased since Christmas Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the Welsh Government should have gone into lockdown ""harder and earlier"" in March 2020. However he praised the government and all those involved in the vaccination programme for the ""fantastic"" improvement in the vaccination rate. The health minister acknowledged, in hindsight earlier this month, thatmore lives could have been saved had Wales gone into lockdown earlierat the start of the coronavirus pandemic. Office for National Statistics (ONS) figuresinclude all deaths registered, when the virus is suspected or confirmed- and in all settings from hospitals to people's homes. Public Health Wales figures just show hospital and care home deaths with Covid, when cases have been confirmed by a lab test. Under the ONS figures,Wales passed 5,000 deaths a month ago. It is estimated that for 90% of these deaths in Wales, Covid is the underlying cause not just a contributory factor. This video can not be played The different measures for looking at deaths involving Covid-19 in Wales The ONS death toll - up to 22 January - was 6,473, with updated figures due out on Tuesday. Of the deaths reported to Public Health Wales on Monday, four more were in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area in north Wales, three were in Hywel Dda in west Wales, two each were in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and Aneurin Bevan in south Wales while one death was in Swansea Bay. There were also 610 new Covid infections reported in the last 24 hour period, taking the total number of cases to 196,670. More than 600,000 people have now received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in Wales - with 603,976 people now having had the jab. Of those, 2,792 have had a second dose. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? How many coronavirus cases in the UK? The case rate in Wales has fallen to 116 per 100,000 people, the lowest it has been for four months. Flintshire has overtaken its neighbouring county Wrexham as the area with the highest case rate with 231.9 per 100,000 people. Wrexham's rate now stands at 229.5. The areas with the lowest case rate are Ceredigion with 56.4 per 100,000 people, followed by Pembrokeshire with 69.9 and Swansea with 70. Since the start of the pandemic 1,559,030  people have been tested for Covid-19 in Wales, with more than 2.5 million tests carried out. On Sunday 11,013 new tests were performed.

Single-dose Johnson & Johnson jab is 66% effective,"Dr Claire Cole from Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust volunteered in the Janssen jab's Phase 3 trial A new single-dose vaccine has shown to be 66% effective against Covid-19, and offered complete protection against hospitalisation and death in trials. However, there are signs the jab, made by Belgian pharmaceutical firm Janssen, is less effective against the new variant spreading in South Africa. The Johnson & Johnson-owned company is looking at whether two doses will give stronger or longer-lasting protection. It aims to make one billion doses this year. The UK has ordered 30 million doses, the US 100 million and Canada 38 million. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said if the jab was approved by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) it could ""significantly bolster"" the country's vaccine programme. Crucially, no one needed hospital treatment or died from coronavirus after the Janssen vaccine took effect in the international trial. The news comes shortly after Novavax announcedtheir jab was 89% effective overallin the UK and 60% in South Africa. Both new vaccines will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. Meanwhile, the EU's drugs regulator hasapproved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged over 18. It comes amid an ongoing dispute over whether AstraZeneca is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the bloc, which has seen the EU confirm that it will bring inexport controls on Covid vaccines made in the bloc. The EU hastemporarily overridden a section of the Brexit deal in relation to Northern Ireland, over concerns the country could become a backdoor for vaccines from the EU to be sent into the wider UK. Arlene Foster, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's first minister, called the move ""an incredible act of hostility"" by the EU. It comes as the UK reported a further 29,079 new coronavirus cases on Friday, and 1,245 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the government's daily figures, bringing the total deaths by that measure to 104,371. How many people have had the jab so far? When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery Crucially, the Janssen trial looked at giving just one dose of the vaccine, which makes it significantly easier to roll out than those requiring two.  It is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The fact it works as a single dose and can be kept in a standard fridge, while others need super-cold storage, means the vaccine could have a significant role around the world. ""A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings,"" said Dr Paul Stoffels, the chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson. He added the vaccine could ""potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of Covid-19"". It is easy to become complacent after the astounding success of the first vaccines to go through trials. But having another two effective vaccines is a cause for massive celebration. It will take vast quantities of vaccine to immunise the world - remember this is a pandemic - and the more options we have available, the better. However, there is also a warning sign in the new data from the Janssen and Novavax trials. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results from South Africa were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all. But they do emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change the vaccines we use in the future. The Janssen vaccine uses a common cold virus that has been engineered to make it harmless. It then safely carries part of the coronavirus's genetic code into the body. This is enough for the body to recognise the threat and then learn to fight coronavirus. This trains the body's immune system to fight coronavirus when it encounters the virus for real. This is similar to the approach used by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Dr Mathai Mammen, from Janssen, said: ""A single dose regimen with fast onset of protection and ease of delivery and storage provides a potential solution to reaching as many people as possible. ""The ability to avoid hospitalisations and deaths would change the game in combating the pandemic."" The results are based on nearly 44,000 people who took part in the trial and 468 cases of Covid-19. However the vaccine was just 57% effective in the South African part of the trial, where a new version of the coronavirus is spreading, compared with 72% in the US. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Prime Minister Boris Johnson said thatthe results from the early trials were ""very encouraging"",external, and if the vaccine was approved doses should be available later this year. Mr Hancock said the Janssen announcement was ""yet more good news"". ""If this jab is approved this could significantly bolster our vaccination programme, especially as a single-dose vaccine,"" he said. ""Once the full data has been submitted [to the MHRA], they will consider the evidence to determine whether the vaccine meets robust standards of safety, effectiveness & quality.""

In the UK,the latest estimate for the R rate,externalfrom the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK remained virtually unchanged in the week to 23 January,according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data.  Its survey suggests the epidemic is levelling off or perhaps very slightly falling - but not at the rate hoped.

France closes borders to most non-EU travel,"Arrivals at Charles de Gaulle Airport are checked. But are the new measures enough? France has imposed new Covid-19 border restrictions, but has once again resisted a new nationwide lockdown. All but essential travel from outside the EU has been banned, while testing requirements on travellers from within the EU has been tightened. PM Jean Castex said France's night curfew would be more tightly enforced and large shopping centres would close. But the measures were seen as mild and favouring the economy. Some doctors fear they will not curb infections. Which countries have been hit the hardest? Tracking the Covid vaccine across Europe Paris police 'broke Covid curfew' at party The new border restrictions will affect the UK, now no longer in the EU, but the French transport minister clarified on Twitter that hauliers transporting goods to or from the UK would not be affected.

Mr Castex said that from Sunday, apart from exceptional reasons, ""any entry into France and any exit from our territory to or from a country outside the European Union will be prohibited"". A number of countries are exempted, as they are not considered at risk. They are Australia, South Korea, Japan, New Zealand, Rwanda, Singapore and Thailand. In addition, arrivals from inside the EU, and several other neighbouring states - Andorra, Iceland, Liechtenstein, Monaco, Norway, San Marino, the Vatican and Switzerland - will have to present a negative polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test. All arrivals, not just by air and sea, but by land too, must comply with the test rule. There are exemptions, including cross-border workers and hauliers, and other groups such as students, health workers and diplomats, although the list is not fully defined. The new Covid variants are the main motivating factor, and travel to the UK, which has been hit by the UK - or Kent - variant, is ""strongly discouraged"". There were few specific details about how the measures would be enforced, particularly on those arriving by road and having to provide test results. The closure of all non-food shopping centres with a surface area greater than 20,000 sq m (215,000 sq ft) Increased police presence to check non-compliance with the overnight curfew that runs between 18:00 and 06:00, as well as clampdowns on illegal restaurant openings and clandestine parties Working-from-home rules to be reinforced so that it is encouraged wherever possible The shopping centre rule affects some 400 malls and 25,000 businesses. Small traders were relieved not to be be included. This video can not be played Police in Paris ensure shops close at 6pm as France begins a new curfew to tackle Covid-19 The other measures appeared more general, with French media saying they were fairly mild and an attempt to slow the virus without harming the economy further. For now, schools remain open across the country. Some health sector experts were unconvinced the measures would be of use in controlling rising infections. Mahmoud Zureik, professor of public health at the University of Versailles-Saint-Quentin, told French news network BFMTV: ""Unfortunately I fear it is too late. It is not enough."" The threat of a third national lockdown in France has loomed large all week, followingwarnings by top health officials that one would be needed amid high hospital rates and the spread of new variants. But there is a lot of public opposition - more than 50% in an Elabe Institute poll oppose a strict lockdown, compared to 93% support last spring. Mr Castex said in his televised statement on Friday a lockdown could still be prevented. ""We know the grave impact [of a lockdown]. Tonight, looking at the data of the past few days, we consider that we can still give ourselves a chance to avoid one,"" he said. ""The coming days will be decisive. Let's be very vigilant."" France reported 820 new deaths on Friday, taking the total recorded nationally to more than 75,000. It has recorded the sixth highest number of infections in the world. More than 25,000 people are in hospital with the virus - including more than 3,000 in intensive care - but Mr Castex said the health situation was ""better controlled in France than in many of our neighbours"". Health Minister Olivier VÃ©ran warned this week that the new, more transmissible variants were now ""actively spreading"" in France, despite the current restrictions. Friday's announcement also comes amida growing row between the EU and vaccine companies about supply shortfalls. French officials say they have given first doses to 1.45m people so far, but delivery shortages from Pfizer and Moderna are further slowing their rollout. From Saturday,Germanyhas banned most travellers from countries hit hard by new variants. The countries are the UK, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini. The move is expected to last until 17 February. Also from Saturday, theCzech Republichas banned non-essential entry into the country, again to try to curb the new variants. Portugalon Thursday banned non-essential overseas travel by air, land or sea for its citizens for a fortnight. Belgiumon Wednesday banned non-essential trips out of the country until 1 March. In contrast,Italysaid on Friday it would move more areas into less-restrictive rules from Monday, despite health officials warning it was risky. No areas would be classified as ""red"", which brings tough travel and business restrictions.

'Stansted 15' win appeal against convictions,"The ""Stansted 15"" tried to stop an aircraft being used to deport people to Africa (one of the 15 did not make the photo call in time) Protesters who broke into Stansted Airport to stop a plane deporting people to Africa have won an appeal against their convictions. The group, known as the Stansted 15, cut through the perimeter fence and locked themselves together around a Boeing 767 jet in 2017. They were convicted of theintentional disruption of services at an aerodrome. The Lord Chief Justice said they ""should not have been prosecuted for the extremely serious offence"". A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""We will consider the judgment carefully in the next 28 days."" The jet they surrounded in March 2017 had been chartered by the Home Office to transport people from UK detention centres for repatriation to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. The protesters put their arms inside pipes which were then filled with expandable foam, and secured themselves around the nose wheel and wing of the aircraft, the court was told during their trial. They were convicted under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act (Amsa) 1990. In February 2019, three were given suspended jail sentences, and the other 12 were handed community orders. Amnesty International placards were held up outside Chelmsford Crown Court during the trial Sitting with Mr Justice Jay and Mrs Justice Whipple, Lord Burnett said the protesters' ""conduct did not satisfy the various elements of the offence"". ""There was, in truth, no case to answer,"" he said. ""We recognise that the various summary-only offences with which the appellants were originally charged, if proved, might well not reflect the gravity of their actions. ""That, however, does not allow the use of an offence which aims at conduct of a different nature. ""All the appellants' convictions must be quashed."" Six members of the ""Stansted 15"" were photographed outside the court on the first day of the appeal hearing At the appeal hearing in November, lawyers for the activists argued the legislation used to convict the 15 is rarely used and not intended for this type of case. The Stansted 15's barristers argued that the Amsa law is intended to deal with violence of the ""utmost seriousness"", such as terrorism, not demonstrators. 'Stansted 15' counter-terrorism appeal begins Protesters 'tried to stop deportees dying' 'Stansted 15' surrounded deportation jet Lord Burnett said in the judgement that it could not be established on the evidence in the case that the group's actions caused disruption which was ""likely to endanger"" the safe operation of the airport or the safety of people there. After the judgment was published, one of the protesters, Lyndsay Burtonshaw, tweeted: ""We got the judgement from our appeal for our terrorism-related conviction for the #Stansted15 action. WE WON!"" The Court of Appeal's judgment in favour of the 15 underlines a fundamental safeguard in the law: You can only be prosecuted for something you've actually done - and that means the evidence has to fit the wording of the offence. The crime the 15 were charged with had its genesis in the need to protect airports from terrorism - yet the prosecution didn't suggest at the trial that the incident was remotely that kind of attack. And the protesters insisted that despite their plan to stop the flight, they never intended to do anything that was likely to endanger safety at the airport. The three senior judges agreed that this critical test had not been met and so the prosecution was unjustified. The 15 may have created a health-and-safety risk by going onto the airport tarmac - but that was well below a genuinely dangerous situation that would have justified charging them with this very serious offence. In a statement on behalf of the group, May MacKeith, one of the protesters, said: ""The nightmare of this bogus charge, a 10-week trial and the threat of prison has dominated our lives for four years. ""Despite the draconian response we know our actions were justified. ""Eleven people, including survivors of trafficking, who would have been deported that night are still in the UK.

Global watchdogs on alert as GameStop frenzy grows,"This video can not be played AOC calls the GameStop saga ""a weird collision of social forces and economic factors"" Regulators have fired warning shots over frenzied share dealing in GameShop and other firms fuelled by social media chat on sites like Reddit and Facebook. Watchdogs in the US and UK said they were monitoring activity and potential lawbreaking, and warned traders they risked facing huge losses. Traders should ensure they are familiar with all rules, ""including market abuse"", the UK's regulator said. GameStop is the focus of a trading war between amateurs and Wall Street pros. This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? Shares in the US bricks-and-mortar video games retailer surged again on Friday, ending 68% higher. Another stock in the traders' sights, AMC Entertainment, jumped 54%. That bucked broader market trends, which saw all three main US indexes fall roughly 2%. For the week they were down more than 3% - the biggest weekly decline since October. Some share trading firms temporarily halted dealings on Thursday amid extreme volatility in GameStop, which has soared as much as 700% in the past week. AMC Entertainment and Blackberry, which have also seen huge trading activity, were among the other companies also hit by the restrictions. UK traders have also been sharing their thoughts and tips on trading chat forums amid mounting concerns about misinformation and share ramping. London-listed companies have also been the focus of social media attention, including publisher Pearson and cinema operator Cineworld, although the share price movements were minimal compared with the GameStop surge. Anger as trading in GameStop shares is restricted Confused investors inundate Robin Hood society GameStop: What is it and why is it trending? In a statement on Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said: ""The FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks. ""Firms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in."" The retailer has made heavy losses as games sales moved online In the US, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned against illegal ""manipulative trading activity"". The regulator added: ""Our core market infrastructure has proven resilient under the weight of this week's extraordinary trading volumes. ""Nevertheless, extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence."" The SEC also said it would review actions that could ""unduly inhibit"" and ""disadvantage investors"". The war between amateur private investors and heavyweight firms like hedge funds centres on so-called short selling. Over recent months, hedge funds had made big bets that shares in loss-making GameStop would fall. But an army of private investors, swapping tips on social media, spotted a chance for a buying frenzy that would push up the price and ""squeeze"" the hedge fund short sellers. Many private traders made profits - and losses - along the way, but their actions also dealt a big financial blow to hedge funds that spent billions of dollars gambling GameStop's shares would tumble. The decision on Thursday by several brokerages to halt purchases of shares in Gamestop and some other firms  sparked outrage among investors, who accused the companies of working on behalf of traditional Wall Street investors who were losing out to the army of amateurs. Some disgruntled investors said they were preparing legal action. Investor anger over their temporary ban from trading spread beyond the investment community, with rappers and US politicians on both sides of the Washington divide joining the backlash against Wall Street. ""This is unacceptable,"" tweeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat. ""We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit."" Her tweet was shared by Republican Senator Ted Cruz who commented ""fully agree."" Tesla founder Elon Musk, whose shares have also been a retail favourite, also commented on Ms Ocasio-Cortez's tweet, saying ""Absolutely"". Much of the anger was directed atRobinhood, a new breed of broker popular among a new generation of younger, tech-savvy investor, but which has been accused of ""gamifying"" share trading. On Friday, a Robinhood chat forum on Facebook was also removed for breaking its Community Standards rules, although the social media giant did not expand on the reasons. After the backlash, Robinhood late Thursday said it would ease the restrictions. The firm also said it had raised more than $1bn from existing investors to bolster its finances amid questions about strains caused by the buying frenzy. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat known as a supporter of tougher financial rules, said the chaos was another sign of ""years of distortion in securities markets that have allowed the wealthy few to artificially inflate and deflate share prices and reap short-term profits while exacerbating wealth inequality"". She said regulators must review the trades and make changes to ensure that markets ""reflect real value, rather than the highly leveraged bets of wealthy traders or those who seek to inflict financial damage on those traders"". Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment firm such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall. The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses - a process known as covering. However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still.

Brexit: How NI is different,"The practical and economic consequences of Brexit will become real when the transition period ends at 23:00 GMT on Thursday. But because of special arrangements for Northern Ireland, it will have a different experience from the rest of the UK. People born in Northern Ireland have the right to Irish as well as British citizenship. Those who exercise that right will retain their EU citizenship, something not available to people elsewhere in the UK who may have only British citizenship. The consequences of this range from the mundane to the profound. People travelling on Irish passports will be able to use EU/EEA lanes and e-gates at airports. Those with British passports will not. A quick guide to what's in the Brexit deal Why a Brexit trade deal is different for NI Brexit and Northern Ireland - the year in review More fundamentally people with Irish passports keep their right to freedom of movement within the EU. That means they can live, work and study in an EU country without a visa and with no time limit. These rights extend to their spouses and dependent children. TheEU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier explained this during a speech in Belfastin 2020. ""Whilst Northern Ireland will no longer be part of the EU, people born and raised here that choose to be Irish citizens will still be EU citizens,"" he said. ""This means they can continue to move and reside freely within the EU."" The UK will no longer be participating in Erasmus, the EU student exchange scheme. Instead, the UK government is setting up its own scheme, known as Turing. However,students at Northern Ireland's universities will still be able to take part in Erasmusdue to funding and administrative assistance from the Irish government. Ireland's Higher Education Minister Simon Harris said: ""The government of Ireland made a very solemn commitment to Northern Ireland that, even after Brexit, we would make sure that there were still ways for us to co-operate and collaborate in relation to higher education."" Funding will be available to all full-time students attending third level institutions in Northern Ireland. It will not be limited to those with an Irish passport, so British passport holders will also qualify. The town of Warrenpoint in County Down is home to the second largest port in Northern Ireland Businesses across the UK will still be able to sell their goods to the EU without tariffs being imposed. This is due to thetrade dealreached between the EU and UK on Christmas Eve. But businesses in GB will face a range of new non-tariff trade barriers such as paperwork, certifications and checks on goods as they enter the EU. Northern Ireland will not face these non-tariff barriers as it will effectively remain within the EU's single market for goods. This is a consequence of theNI Protocol, a special deal to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. As an example, a lorry load of Northern Ireland meat products could board a ferry at Dublin port and disembark at a French port with no new paperwork or checks. However, if a similar load was travelling from Scotland to France it would need to be accompanied by new export health certificates and the authorities would need advance notice of its arrival. It would have to go to a border control post where the load may be physically examined. There is a significant flipside to this: new trade barriers within the UK. That lorry load of Scottish meat could be driven to Cardiff or London without any new checks or controls. But when entering Northern Ireland it is as if it is entering the EU. So it will need to undergo all the same bureaucracy and checking as when it was entering a French port. SIMPLE GUIDE: What happens next with Brexit?

"Cameron House fined Â£500,000 over fatal hotel fire","Aerial photographs show the extent of the damage to Cameron House A Scottish luxury hotel has been fined half a million pounds over a fire that claimed the lives of two guests. Cameron House has been ordered to pay Â£500,000 after admitting to breaches of fire safety rules. A hotel porter has also been given a community payback order to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Richard Dyson, 38, and his partner Simon Midgley, 32, died in the hotel blaze on the banks of Loch Lomond in December 2017. The fire started after night porter Christopher O'Malley, 35, placed a plastic bag of ash in a cupboard containing kindling and newspapers. O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. Christopher O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act Sheriff William Gallacher said the families of Mr Dyson and Mr Midgley will ""always endure the heartbreak"" caused by the fire. Cameron Housepreviously pleaded guiltyto two charges of failing to take fire safety measures which were necessary to ensure the safety of staff and guests. Survivor Hannah Munns, who was in the room next to the couple, said she felt ""ignored and angry"" after the sentencing. Ms Munns toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""Two men have lost their lives, many families have been impacted and they (Cameron House) continue to trade. They are barely going to notice it."" She also criticised the lack of communication since the blaze and said she could not make sense of O'Malley's ""ridiculous"" actions. But Ms Munns added she felt more aggrieved at the fine handed down to Cameron House. She said: ""That's nothing. No lessons will be learned from that. Nothing will change as a result of that. ""It just feels like no-one has taken it very seriously. I am just in shock, really. It is almost saying our lives don't matter."" Richard Dyson, left, and Simon Midgley, right, who both died, had been on a winter break in Scotland Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie said the fire had been devastating for the victims' families. The Scottish Labour interim leader spoke to Mr Midgley's mother, Jane, after the sentencing and said she remains ""heartbroken"". Ms Baillie added: ""What we heard today, in the context of two young men losing their lives, does not seem enough to her. ""We have a major hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond that failed to heed the advice given to them by the fire brigade and others. ""The deaths of these two young men did not need to happen at all."" Dumbarton Sheriff Court heard staff were not properly trained in the safe disposal of ash and no written procedures were in place. That was contrary to recommendations made in two fire risk assessments carried out by an independent company in 2016 and 2017. There was no safe system for emptying the ash bins outside the hotel, which is next to Loch Lomond. The day before the fatal fire, O'Malley had discovered they were both full. They had not been emptied since October 2017, two months before the 18 December blaze. In August 2017, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service told managers not to store combustibles - like kindling and newspapers - in the concierge cupboard, but staff continued to do so. This video can not be played CCTV captures moment hotel fire takes hold Peter Gray QC, acting for Cameron House, said the failings were not deliberate breaches but occurred ""as a result of genuine errors"". He also told the court the fire had gone undetected for a long period before being discovered, and that the hotel had a ""suite of measures in place"" to deal with fire safety. Sheriff William Gallacher also heard of an incident three nights before the fatal fire, when O'Malley and another night porter were told not to put ash into plastic bags because it was a fire hazard. Mr Gray said it was therefore ""extremely difficult to understand"" why O'Malley did not follow this guidance on the night of the fire. Fatal hotel fire caused by ash left in cupboard Couple killed in hotel fire named Mum 'tortured' by son's death in hotel fire After the sentencing, Alistair Duncan, head of the Health and Safety Investigation Unit, said: ""The failings on the part of Cameron House Resort and Christopher O'Malley led to the deaths of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson. ""This incident should serve as a reminder to other companies that failure to implement the necessary fire safety measures can have terrible consequences."" Stuart Stevens, assistant chief officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said the ""needless loss of two lives"" could have been prevented. Det Insp Stuart Grainger from Police Scotland said: ""While nothing will ever diminish the pain of their loss, we hope that the conclusion of this case brings at least a small measure of comfort."" The interior of the hotel reception where the fire started in the concierge cupboard The court was previously told O'Malley, of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, deeply regretted his actions and they were not deliberate. More than 200 guests were staying in the hotel when an initial fire alarm sounded at about 06:40. O'Malley opened the door and flames took hold, spreading to the hall. He and two others tried to fight the blaze with fire extinguishers, but were overcome by the flames. The overflowing ash bins outside the luxury hotel Firefighters arrived within 10 minutes to find a ""well-developed"" fire in the mansion, which is near Balloch in West Dunbartonshire. It was after 08:00 when it was discovered that Mr Dyson, 38, and Mr Midgley, 32, were missing. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus found Mr Dyson on a landing at the top of a staircase. Mr Midgley was lying in a fire escape passageway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Mr Dyson was taken to hospital, where he was also pronounced dead. Post-mortem examinations said the men's causes of death had been inhalation of smoke and fire gases. The couple had travelled from London, and were staying at the five-star resort as the final stop on their winter break to Scotland.

Tributes follow death of acting pioneer Cicely Tyson,"In 2018, Cicely Tyson became the first African American woman to receive an honorary Oscar Pioneering Hollywood actress Cicely Tyson - who was known for portraying strong African-American characters - has died aged 96, her manager has said. No cause of the death was given. The former fashion model had a career that spanned seven decades. Tyson won two Emmys for her performance in the 1974 civil rights-era film The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. She also became the first black woman to take on a main role in the TV drama East Side/West Side in the 1960s.

Tyson turned down stereotypical roles for black women, agreeing only to play characters that were strong, positive and realistic. ""I have managed Miss Tyson's career for over 40 years, and each year was a privilege and blessing,"" her manager Larry Thompson said in Thursday's statement announcing her death. ""Cicely thought of her new memoir as a Christmas tree decorated with all the ornaments of her personal and professional life. Today she placed the last ornament, a star, on top of the tree,"" the manager said, adding that she died peacefully. Tyson's memoir Just As I Am was published on Tuesday andVulture wrote about seven highlights from the book,external, including her accidentally hanging up on Mr Obama's aide ringing to tell her she had won the prestigious medal. Lupita Nyong'o and Tyson embraced at last year's National Equal Justice Awards dinner in New York ""'Oh please,' I said laughing, feeling sure it was a prankster talking some foolishness,"" she recalled. ""How did you even get this number? She tried to persuade me that her declaration was true, but I wouldn't hear of it'."" It also mentioned how she met her future husband, trumpeter Miles Davis, in the 60s after he knocked on the door of his neighbour Diahann Carroll's house, where Tyler was a guest. He appeared in just a robe, to ask for some sugar. Vulture said the book later went on to detail the couple falling out after their marriage, after Tyson first sniffed out ""the stench of Miles's philandering"". They were married from 1981 to 1988. Tyson spoke at the 47th AFI Life Achievement Award honouring fellow actor Denzel Washington Born in New York's Harlem, she was raised by her devoutly religious parents from the Caribbean island of Nevis. After being discovered by a fashion editor at Ebony magazine her modelling career took off. By 1957, she was acting in off-Broadway productions and went on to gain small roles in feature films before she was cast as Portia in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter in 1968. After paying tribute, US broadcaster and actress Oprah Winfrey said: ""She used her career to illuminate the humanity of black people. The roles she played reflected her values; she never compromised."" Tyson recently told CBS interviewer Gayle King: ""I had no idea I would touch anybody."" Allow Twitter content?

In 1973, Tysontold the BBC's Film Programme,externalshe hoped the acclaim for her role in Sounder ""allows me to be considered for roles simply because I'm a good actress rather than because I'm a black actress, which limits my ability to work.

The Tony Awards also nominated her in 2013 for lead actress for the play The Trip to Bountiful, about an unhappy, elderly woman desperate to visit her girlhood home before she dies.

Protocol 'obstructs military movement',"Doug Beattie said a customs form will be needed to move army equipment from GB to NI The government is facing fresh criticism over the Northern Ireland Protocol amid warnings it obstructs the ""free movement"" of the military. The Ulster Unionist Party has said that, under the protocol, the MoD must now give 15 days notice and fill out customs declaration forms before it moves equipment from GB to NI. It also said Nato has to be notified about the move. But the Ministry of Defence insists its NI operations will not be affected. Ulster Unionist MLA and former Army officer Doug Beattie said it is ""ludicrous where UK armed forces cannot move around the UK with equipment without permission"". In a letter to Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, he called for urgent action to ""protect military operations"" in Northern Ireland. He wrote that ""military equipment, and in some cases personnel, cannot be moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland unless they complete a customs form"". ""More worryingly, there will also be a need to complete a Nato form before any movement takes place,"" Mr Beattie added. The days of heavy duty military hardware rolling into Northern Ireland are long gone. But the military still provides support to the PSNI against the threat from paramilitaries under Operation Helvetic. It also has two bases used for training soldiers. But one military source said much of the equipment needed is already here, hence the MoD statement insisting its operations will not be affected by the new protocol arrangements. Though, for some unionists, the very thought of the military having to give notice and fill out forms before moving equipment from one part of the UK to another is a bitter pill. For them it is much more than a paper exercise. ""This Nato form is usually for the movement of UK forces and their equipment around the globe, but in this instance it is to allow UK forces to move within the confines of our own country. ""This is quite incredible and I simply cannot believe that any UK government would tolerate such a situation."" Mr Beattie told the secretary of state if the ""barriers"" cannot be removed, then Mr Lewis must invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The clause allows the EU or UK to ""unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures"", if the application of the protocol is triggering ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist"" or trade friction. First Minister Arlene Foster told Good Morning Ulster it was ""another example of the hundreds of problems with the protocol which we (the DUP) vehemently opposed"". ""We find it and its outworkings offensive,"" she said. ""No sovereign country should have barriers to trade and customs arrangements placed within it,"" she added. She said she had spoken to Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, who was ""concerned about the principle and sovereignty of the UK"". She added that they would be working on ""not just the function but on the principle - that the UK military has to be able to work at speed within its own jurisdiction"". It is understood one of the documents required is a form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"" Mr Beattie has also raised his concerns with the Armed Forces Minister James Heappey. Military on duty in wards to help ease pressures Brexit means NI eels can't be sold in Britain What will happen in Northern Ireland after Brexit? It is understood one of the documents required is a Nato 302 form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"". According to the EU Customs Transit regulations covering Nato and other military activities, the 302 form is used for a number of reasons, including ""temporary admission in the EU"". But an MoD spokesperson said: ""The Northern Ireland Protocol has not placed any limitations on the Ministry of Defence's ability to conduct operations.""

Here are this eveningâs headlines:  The anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases is an ""appropriate"" time for people to thank all NHS workers, the head of the health service has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens praised treatment innovations on a visit to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on Friday. The hospital treated the UK's first two Covid-19 patients a year ago. The pair, a Chinese student and his mother, were in York when they fell ill with the virus. Sir Simon said: ""These are the staff here at this hospital in Newcastle who treated the first coronavirus patients in England a year ago. ""Since then, hospitals across the country have looked after more than 300,000 severely ill coronavirus patients so I do think, on this one year anniversary, it is appropriate for the whole country to say a huge thank you to every member of staff across the health service."" You can read more from Sir Simon here. The UK is ""carefully considering"" its next steps after the EU introduced export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under Northern Ireland's Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Cabinet Office minister Michael
Gove has spoken with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ to express
the UKâs concern over a lack of notification from the EU about its actions in
relation to the NI protocol. ""Gove told him the UK would now be carefully
considering next steps,"" Downing Street said in a statement. The incident happened at one of New Zealand's managed isolation hotels in Auckland An employee at a quarantine hotel in New Zealand has been sacked after what officials described as an inappropriate encounter with a person who should have been isolating. Officials say the pair shared notes, including one written on a face mask, before spending 20 minutes in a room together. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said it was ""unacceptable"": ""I didn't enquire specifically into the nature of the encounter, but the fact it was a 20-minute encounter, it was long enough for me to be unacceptable,"" he said. He added that the staff member had brought a bottle of wine to the room. People returning to New Zealand have to spend at least 14 days in isolation. The country has been hailed as one of the world's leaders in containing the virus. It has recorded 25 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Earlier this week, it reported its first case of Covid-19 outside of quarantine facilities in more than two months. Read more here. Andy Burnham with Matt Healy of the band The 1975 - in pre-social distancing times Record labels should help bail out small music venues struggling to survive the pandemic, Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham says. Burnham, a former culture secretary, is calling on the ""big players"" in music to pay a levy, just as football clubs do for grassroots facilities. The musicians who go on to sustain the industry often start in ""critical"" small venues, he says. The Music Venue Trust says 30 venues are at imminent risk of permanent closure because of the pandemic, with hundreds more in trouble. You can read more about Burnham's comments here. American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan disembark at a US military base on 29 January 2020. In late January, a cargo aircraft carrying nearly 200 Americans - the first to be evacuated from Wuhan, China - landed at a military base in California. They were greeted by health officials who did not wear the proper protective gear and had also been advised to avoid the ""bad optics"" of wearing any. As civilians disembarked and began to quarantine at the base, there were no officials leading an effort to manage ""infection control and prevention measures"" and little PPE on hand for the officials present. Days later, these officials boarded commercial airlines and flew to other parts of the country. These details - initially the subject of a whistleblower complaint against the US health department - are the findings of a federal watchdog's investigation into how the US handled its first up-close encounter with the virus. The âmost troubling findingâ is that the handling of the 
Wuhan evacuees âincreased the risk of infection transmission not only to
 deployed [government] personnel, but also to the American public as a 
whole,â wrote lead investigator Henry Kerner in a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday. The US is now well past 25 million total cases of the virus. Over 433,000 Americans have died.

He's now back in his day job, in the midst of a pandemic, working in A&E at University Hospital Lewisham in London. He also lost his brother, LlÅ·r, to suicide last year. He's been speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat. The US Navy's warship USS Chafee Several sailors aboard a US Navy warship have tested positive for Covid. The Navy Times reports that 41 crew members aboard the USS Chafee have either been infected with the virus or been in close contact with sick shipmates. Sailors on board told The Times there has been a lack of ship-wide testing to identify more cases and a shortage of N95 masks. Some have used a single dirty mask for several days on end, according to one petty officer, who told the paper: ""We have asked for more, but they donât have enough."" ""When we kick back, we are either told to wear the 
dirty mask or face (non-judicial punishment)."" An official spokesman for the ship's fleet has however disputed the reporting and said: ""The ship remains able to meet its mission."" The warship - currently stationed in California - typically docks in Hawaii, which has seen over 25,000 cases of the virus and over 400 deaths. Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Cross-border travel with Northern Ireland and Britain makes a ""zero Covid"" strategy unlikely to work, an Irish expert says A senior member of the Republic of Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team hasrejected the ""zero Covid"" strategy advocated by opposition politicians. Those supporting the measure point to Australia and New Zealand's approach of suppressing the virus with much stricter lockdowns and rules on inbound travel. But Prof Philip Nolan said it was a ""false promise"" to say Ireland could go from the highest level of restrictions to the lowest levels ""in the space of weeks or months"" - adding that it ""won't happen"". Prof Nolan, who chairs the government's epidemiological modelling advisory group, said it ""would be an incredibly risky thing to do because we will inevitably be a leaky country and get re-introduction of the disease and that could easily be new variants"". The Irish government has always cited the open border with Northern Ireland and the lack of restriction on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as reasons why a zero Covid policy would be unlikely to work. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on non-essential airline travel in and out of the country. He says the countryâs main airlines have agreed to cancel service to âall Caribbeans destinations and Mexicoâ until the end of April. In addition, the government will mandate new testing and quarantine requirements for people returning to Canada. âNew variants of Covid-19 pose a real challenge to Canada,â
 says Mr Trudeau. âThatâs why we need to take extra measures.â It comes as media reports suggest Canadians are escaping to more sunny destinations amid the chilly and virus-afflicted winter. âWith the challenges we currently face with Covid-19, both here at home and abroad, we all agree that now is just not the time to be flying,"" says Mr Trudeau. That's all from the AstraZeneca press conference. Researchers are asked about comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, where he questioned how effective the vaccine was in over-65s. In response, Prof Pollard says there's ""good evidence"" to support the use of vaccine, including a strong immune response in older adults. He says there is much more limited data on efficacy in older adults but that doesn't mean there is necessarily a lack of protection. He adds ""everything points to the likelihood"" the vaccine will offer the same level of protection across all age groups. Prof Pollard says it is ""perhaps a misunderstanding"" of the data by the French president. Menelaos Pangolas, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D, is asked about the half dose of the vaccine that appeared to show better efficacy. Trials showed 62% effectiveness for two doses. But a subset of data showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. Pangolas says he is ""very confident"" with the dosing regimen they have, adding they are no longer needing to explore the half dose. He says hopefully when the data is published that will become apparent. Away from the AstraZeneca press conference, the EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines. The EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. It has therefore invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. You can read the full story here. The Associated Press asks Soriot whether the company will look at today with ""some regret"" given the disputes with the EU. He says ""a lot has been done"" to provide the vaccine to the bloc. Soriot says nine months ago the firm had nothing and the company is focused on supplying the EU, but everyone has to recognise it's ""a complicated process"". He says what has been done ""people take for granted"". It is not simple and is indeed very complicated, he says. ""We are really trying to catch up - there's not much more we can do."" Researchers are asked about the South African variant and its impact on vaccine efficacy. Prof Pollard says he doesn't have the data on what sort of effect the variant will have on the AstraZeneca vaccine. But he says he when you look at the changes in the spike protein caused by the variant, researchers would expect an ""impact on efficacy"" in vaccines. He says some of this has been shown in the data released in the last 24 hours for the Janssen and Novavax vaccines. But he says the ""really good news"" is if new vaccines do need to be made they can be done within a ""matter of months"". It's not like the situation a year ago, where it took a year of development, he says. He also says that although there are some concerns about new variants, it's still possible the current vaccines will be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalisation. AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot is asked about a problem with production of the vaccine at a factory in Belgium. He says the firm never mentions any of its partners, but adds that it has had ""teething issues"" in terms of the yield of vaccine at some of its production sites. ""We're talking about biology manufacturing here,"" he says, adding that making vaccines ""is extremely complicated"". ""It's not like doing an orange juice,"" he says. ""Everybody's on a learning curve, which usually you develop over year. We've had months. ""Some sites are more advanced."" He says the reasons for yield issues vary from site to site, but adds: ""We believe we have now fixed most of the issues and the productivity of the sites should improve rapidly over the next few months."" AstraZeneca is ""ready to launch"" its vaccine in the US as soon as it is approved by the regulator, the firm's chief executive says. Pascal Soriot says the firm has been working ""hand in hand"" with the US to manufacture the jab. Executive vice president Mene Pangolas says the US study is fully recruited and they are now waiting for enough Covid cases to be able to report their data. He says he imagines this will be in February. Asked whether he is concerned that some EU states are considering not giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to over 65s, Prof Andrew Pollard says ""there's no reason to be concerned about using it"". He stresses it ""can be used in all ages"", but adds that ""we have to respect how member states choose to use the vaccine"". Prof Pollard says the team is ""very confident in the data that we have"", adding that they have ""data showing that there's good immune response in older adults"". He also notes that trials are still running in the UK and Brazil, so ""there's a lot more data to come"". Asked by Alistair Smout of Reuters about Astra Zeneca's requirement to fulfil its ""best efforts"" to supply the vaccine to the EU, the company's chief executive officer Pascal Soriot says he is going to disappoint him with his reply. Soriot declines to answer and says he only wants to talk about the positive news of the deal to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the EU. Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLive'No concern' about AstraZeneca vaccine and over-65s4 minutes ago,"AstraZeneca says it is ""unprecedented"" the world has produced multiple vaccines in a year, after the EU approved its jab Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group, adds there is ""no reason"" to be concerned about using the vaccine on over-65s Some EU states are considering only giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-65s, citing a lack of data for its use on older age groups Meanwhile, a new coronavirus vaccine developed by Janssen prevents 66% of Covid cases after a single dose, the Belgian company says And another new vaccine, Novavax, is said to be the first to show in trials it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK Meanwhile, lockdown will continue in Wales for a further three weeks, First Minister Mark Drakeford says The UK's R rate - the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect - is now estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.1 Edited by Hamish Mackay Weâre ending todayâs live coverage here, but we'll be back tomorrow with more updates. Here are this eveningâs headlines:  The anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases is an ""appropriate"" time for people to thank all NHS workers, the head of the health service has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens praised treatment innovations on a visit to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on Friday. The hospital treated the UK's first two Covid-19 patients a year ago. The pair, a Chinese student and his mother, were in York when they fell ill with the virus. Sir Simon said: ""These are the staff here at this hospital in Newcastle who treated the first coronavirus patients in England a year ago. ""Since then, hospitals across the country have looked after more than 300,000 severely ill coronavirus patients so I do think, on this one year anniversary, it is appropriate for the whole country to say a huge thank you to every member of staff across the health service.""

Under Northern Ireland's Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Cabinet Office minister Michael
Gove has spoken with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ to express
the UKâs concern over a lack of notification from the EU about its actions in
relation to the NI protocol. ""Gove told him the UK would now be carefully
considering next steps,"" Downing Street said in a statement. The incident happened at one of New Zealand's managed isolation hotels in Auckland An employee at a quarantine hotel in New Zealand has been sacked after what officials described as an inappropriate encounter with a person who should have been isolating. Officials say the pair shared notes, including one written on a face mask, before spending 20 minutes in a room together. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said it was ""unacceptable"": ""I didn't enquire specifically into the nature of the encounter, but the fact it was a 20-minute encounter, it was long enough for me to be unacceptable,"" he said. He added that the staff member had brought a bottle of wine to the room. People returning to New Zealand have to spend at least 14 days in isolation. The country has been hailed as one of the world's leaders in containing the virus. It has recorded 25 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Earlier this week, it reported its first case of Covid-19 outside of quarantine facilities in more than two months. Read more here. Andy Burnham with Matt Healy of the band The 1975 - in pre-social distancing times Record labels should help bail out small music venues struggling to survive the pandemic, Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham says. Burnham, a former culture secretary, is calling on the ""big players"" in music to pay a levy, just as football clubs do for grassroots facilities. The musicians who go on to sustain the industry often start in ""critical"" small venues, he says. The Music Venue Trust says 30 venues are at imminent risk of permanent closure because of the pandemic, with hundreds more in trouble. You can read more about Burnham's comments here. American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan disembark at a US military base on 29 January 2020. In late January, a cargo aircraft carrying nearly 200 Americans - the first to be evacuated from Wuhan, China - landed at a military base in California. They were greeted by health officials who did not wear the proper protective gear and had also been advised to avoid the ""bad optics"" of wearing any. As civilians disembarked and began to quarantine at the base, there were no officials leading an effort to manage ""infection control and prevention measures"" and little PPE on hand for the officials present. Days later, these officials boarded commercial airlines and flew to other parts of the country. These details - initially the subject of a whistleblower complaint against the US health department - are the findings of a federal watchdog's investigation into how the US handled its first up-close encounter with the virus. The âmost troubling findingâ is that the handling of the 
Wuhan evacuees âincreased the risk of infection transmission not only to
 deployed [government] personnel, but also to the American public as a 
whole,â wrote lead investigator Henry Kerner in a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday. The US is now well past 25 million total cases of the virus. Over 433,000 Americans have died.

The Navy Times reports that 41 crew members aboard the USS Chafee have either been infected with the virus or been in close contact with sick shipmates. Sailors on board told The Times there has been a lack of ship-wide testing to identify more cases and a shortage of N95 masks. Some have used a single dirty mask for several days on end, according to one petty officer, who told the paper: ""We have asked for more, but they donât have enough."" ""When we kick back, we are either told to wear the 
dirty mask or face (non-judicial punishment)."" An official spokesman for the ship's fleet has however disputed the reporting and said: ""The ship remains able to meet its mission."" The warship - currently stationed in California - typically docks in Hawaii, which has seen over 25,000 cases of the virus and over 400 deaths. Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Cross-border travel with Northern Ireland and Britain makes a ""zero Covid"" strategy unlikely to work, an Irish expert says A senior member of the Republic of Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team hasrejected the ""zero Covid"" strategy advocated by opposition politicians. Those supporting the measure point to Australia and New Zealand's approach of suppressing the virus with much stricter lockdowns and rules on inbound travel. But Prof Philip Nolan said it was a ""false promise"" to say Ireland could go from the highest level of restrictions to the lowest levels ""in the space of weeks or months"" - adding that it ""won't happen"". Prof Nolan, who chairs the government's epidemiological modelling advisory group, said it ""would be an incredibly risky thing to do because we will inevitably be a leaky country and get re-introduction of the disease and that could easily be new variants"". The Irish government has always cited the open border with Northern Ireland and the lack of restriction on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as reasons why a zero Covid policy would be unlikely to work. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on non-essential airline travel in and out of the country. He says the countryâs main airlines have agreed to cancel service to âall Caribbeans destinations and Mexicoâ until the end of April. In addition, the government will mandate new testing and quarantine requirements for people returning to Canada. âNew variants of Covid-19 pose a real challenge to Canada,â
 says Mr Trudeau. âThatâs why we need to take extra measures.â It comes as media reports suggest Canadians are escaping to more sunny destinations amid the chilly and virus-afflicted winter. âWith the challenges we currently face with Covid-19, both here at home and abroad, we all agree that now is just not the time to be flying,"" says Mr Trudeau. That's all from the AstraZeneca press conference. Researchers are asked about comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, where he questioned how effective the vaccine was in over-65s. In response, Prof Pollard says there's ""good evidence"" to support the use of vaccine, including a strong immune response in older adults. He says there is much more limited data on efficacy in older adults but that doesn't mean there is necessarily a lack of protection. He adds ""everything points to the likelihood"" the vaccine will offer the same level of protection across all age groups. Prof Pollard says it is ""perhaps a misunderstanding"" of the data by the French president. Menelaos Pangolas, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D, is asked about the half dose of the vaccine that appeared to show better efficacy. Trials showed 62% effectiveness for two doses. But a subset of data showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. Pangolas says he is ""very confident"" with the dosing regimen they have, adding they are no longer needing to explore the half dose. He says hopefully when the data is published that will become apparent. Away from the AstraZeneca press conference, the EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines. The EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. It has therefore invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. You can read the full story here. The Associated Press asks Soriot whether the company will look at today with ""some regret"" given the disputes with the EU. He says ""a lot has been done"" to provide the vaccine to the bloc. Soriot says nine months ago the firm had nothing and the company is focused on supplying the EU, but everyone has to recognise it's ""a complicated process"". He says what has been done ""people take for granted"". It is not simple and is indeed very complicated, he says. ""We are really trying to catch up - there's not much more we can do."" Researchers are asked about the South African variant and its impact on vaccine efficacy. Prof Pollard says he doesn't have the data on what sort of effect the variant will have on the AstraZeneca vaccine. But he says he when you look at the changes in the spike protein caused by the variant, researchers would expect an ""impact on efficacy"" in vaccines. He says some of this has been shown in the data released in the last 24 hours for the Janssen and Novavax vaccines. But he says the ""really good news"" is if new vaccines do need to be made they can be done within a ""matter of months"". It's not like the situation a year ago, where it took a year of development, he says. He also says that although there are some concerns about new variants, it's still possible the current vaccines will be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalisation. AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot is asked about a problem with production of the vaccine at a factory in Belgium. He says the firm never mentions any of its partners, but adds that it has had ""teething issues"" in terms of the yield of vaccine at some of its production sites.

"Single-dose Johnson & Johnson jab is 66% effectiveThe health secretary says the vaccine could ""significantly bolster"" the UK's vaccination programme if approved.","Dr Claire Cole from Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust volunteered in the Janssen jab's Phase 3 trial A new single-dose vaccine has shown to be 66% effective against Covid-19, and offered complete protection against hospitalisation and death in trials. However, there are signs the jab, made by Belgian pharmaceutical firm Janssen, is less effective against the new variant spreading in South Africa. The Johnson & Johnson-owned company is looking at whether two doses will give stronger or longer-lasting protection. It aims to make one billion doses this year. The UK has ordered 30 million doses, the US 100 million and Canada 38 million. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said if the jab was approved by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) it could ""significantly bolster"" the country's vaccine programme. Crucially, no one needed hospital treatment or died from coronavirus after the Janssen vaccine took effect in the international trial. The news comes shortly after Novavax announcedtheir jab was 89% effective overallin the UK and 60% in South Africa. Both new vaccines will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. Meanwhile, the EU's drugs regulator hasapproved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged over 18. It comes amid an ongoing dispute over whether AstraZeneca is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the bloc, which has seen the EU confirm that it will bring inexport controls on Covid vaccines made in the bloc. The EU hastemporarily overridden a section of the Brexit deal in relation to Northern Ireland, over concerns the country could become a backdoor for vaccines from the EU to be sent into the wider UK. Arlene Foster, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's first minister, called the move ""an incredible act of hostility"" by the EU. It comes as the UK reported a further 29,079 new coronavirus cases on Friday, and 1,245 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the government's daily figures, bringing the total deaths by that measure to 104,371. How many people have had the jab so far? When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery Crucially, the Janssen trial looked at giving just one dose of the vaccine, which makes it significantly easier to roll out than those requiring two.  It is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The fact it works as a single dose and can be kept in a standard fridge, while others need super-cold storage, means the vaccine could have a significant role around the world. ""A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings,"" said Dr Paul Stoffels, the chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson. He added the vaccine could ""potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of Covid-19"". It is easy to become complacent after the astounding success of the first vaccines to go through trials. But having another two effective vaccines is a cause for massive celebration. It will take vast quantities of vaccine to immunise the world - remember this is a pandemic - and the more options we have available, the better. However, there is also a warning sign in the new data from the Janssen and Novavax trials. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results from South Africa were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all. But they do emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change the vaccines we use in the future. The Janssen vaccine uses a common cold virus that has been engineered to make it harmless. It then safely carries part of the coronavirus's genetic code into the body. This is enough for the body to recognise the threat and then learn to fight coronavirus. This trains the body's immune system to fight coronavirus when it encounters the virus for real. This is similar to the approach used by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Dr Mathai Mammen, from Janssen, said: ""A single dose regimen with fast onset of protection and ease of delivery and storage provides a potential solution to reaching as many people as possible. ""The ability to avoid hospitalisations and deaths would change the game in combating the pandemic."" The results are based on nearly 44,000 people who took part in the trial and 468 cases of Covid-19. However the vaccine was just 57% effective in the South African part of the trial, where a new version of the coronavirus is spreading, compared with 72% in the US. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said thatthe results from the early trials were ""very encouraging"",external, and if the vaccine was approved doses should be available later this year. Mr Hancock said the Janssen announcement was ""yet more good news"". ""If this jab is approved this could significantly bolster our vaccination programme, especially as a single-dose vaccine,"" he said. ""Once the full data has been submitted [to the MHRA], they will consider the evidence to determine whether the vaccine meets robust standards of safety, effectiveness & quality.""

EU introduces controls on vaccines to NI,"This video can not be played Arlene Foster: EU Covid vaccine controls are an ""act of aggression"" The EU is introducing controls on vaccines made in the bloc, including to Northern Ireland, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to Northern Ireland without checks. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for the EU to ""urgently clarify its intentions"". NI First Minister Arlene Foster described the move as ""an incredible act of hostility"" by the EU. The EU invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. In a new regulation, the European Commission stated: ""This is justified as a safeguard measure pursuant to Article 16 of that Protocol in order to avert serious societal difficulties due to a lack of supply threatening to disturb the orderly implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the Member States."" What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan? EU drugs regulator approves AstraZeneca vaccine The move comes amid a disputeover vaccine producer AstraZeneca's delivery commitments to the EU. The bloc agreed to buy up to 400m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine last year, and on Friday the EU's drugs regulator approved their use for all adults. But the firm said that due to problems at one of its EU factories, supplies would be reduced by about 60% in the first quarter of 2021. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""The UK government is urgently seeking an explanation from the European Commission about the statements issued by the EU today and assurances as to its intentions. ""The UK has legally-binding agreements with vaccine suppliers and it would not expect the EU, as a friend and ally, to do anything to disrupt the fulfilment of these contracts. ""The UK government has reiterated the importance of preserving the benefits of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement and the commitments that have been made to the two communities."" The EU is under growing pressure over the slow pace of vaccine distribution The prime minister spoke with Taoiseach (prime minister) Micheal Martin on Friday night and stressed the need for the EU to clarify its intentions. An Irish government spokesman said Mr Martin was currently in discussions with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen to express Dublin's concerns. The Northern Ireland Protocol is a special deal to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, agreed in the original withdrawal agreement,is essentially a safeguard that would allow the UK or EU to act unilaterallyif measures imposed as a result of the protocol are deemed to be causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland have been agitating for the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The government has been resisting this, insisting the new arrangements are not creating serious difficulties. The EU's actions are seen as an audacious move. Unionist politicians are incredulous. Throughout the Brexit process the EU vehemently insisted there could be no border on the island of Ireland. For a while the entire trade deal hinged on this. But now, to critics, it appears that principle has vanished over vaccines. It begs the question, if the EU can decide to push this button on this, what else might they use it for in future? Those who strongly oppose the Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland will be pushing even harder now for the UK to use Article 16 to override parts of the deal for its own purposes, too. The EU's move should not directly disadvantage Northern Ireland, which gets its vaccine supplies through the UK procurement system. ""The government has contracts with AstraZeneca & others to ensure vaccines are delivered on schedule & guarantee reliable vaccine provision across the whole of the UK,"" tweeted Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. Politicians who support the Northern Ireland Protocol have reacted with dismay, fearing the EU move could undermine the whole deal. Louise Haigh MP, Labour's Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, said the move was ""deeply destabilising and undermines the huge efforts being made to make the Protocol work"". For her part, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the EU had placed a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""By triggering Article 16 in this manner, the European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner - over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives,"" she said. ""At the first opportunity the EU has placed a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over the supply chain of the coronavirus vaccine. ""With the European Union using Article 16 in such an aggressive and most shameful way, it is now time for our Government to step up."" Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol is a safeguard mechanism. Similar measures are often found in a variety of trade agreements. It allows either the UK or the EU to take unilateral action if the application of the protocol leads to serious 'economic, societal or environmental difficulties' which are liable to persist. It doesn't define what 'serious' means, but Article 16 is only meant to be used in an emergency. So, the fact that the EU has chosen to invoke it shows just how seriously it is taking its vaccine shortages. But how will the UK respond? If Northern Ireland could become a backdoor for vaccines to be taken from the EU into the UK, couldn't the same point be argued the other way round? Arlene Foster clearly expects something to be done. ""I will be urging the Prime Minister to act,"" she says, ""and use robust measures including Article 16 to advance the interests of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom."" The intriguing thing is that Article 16 doesn't, of course, apply only to vaccines. There have been plenty of people calling on the government to invoke Article 16 to help alleviate the trade problems that have arisen between Great Britain and Northern Ireland since the beginning of the year. That's because Great Britain is now outside the EU single market, but Northern Ireland is still following many single market rules. This latest development means the plot thickens even further. Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald described the EU's use of Article 16 as a ""grave error"". ""Our citizens need timely access to lifesaving vaccines not trade disputes,"" she tweeted. ""Now is a time for cool heads and solidarity."" Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said the UK government should now invoke Article 16 in response to the EU's actions. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said what was needed was ""maximum co-operation"", rather than ""obstructive behaviour"" from the EU. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the European Commission's decision to invoke Article 16 was ""disproportionate"". Last week AstraZeneca said vaccine supplies would be reduced because of problems in one of its EU factories. The shortfall is expected to be about 60% in the first quarter of 2021.The EU has also received fewer than expected doses of the two other vaccinesit has approved - from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. How effective is the Oxford vaccine? Why is EUâs vaccine rollout so slow? Is it OK to get a leftover Covid-19 vaccine? The EU has said AstraZeneca must honour its commitments and deliver the jabs it ordered by diverting doses manufactured in the UK. The company said its contract for UK supplies prohibits that, since it must fulfil Britain's order before it can send supplies made there abroad. But an EU source familiar with the matter told the BBC that AstraZeneca's UK facilities were legally obliged to do so, saying: ""This is not an option, it is a contractual obligation."" The UK plants are not back-up facilities; they are part of the main network, the source added. The company's CEO Mr Soriot said earlier this week that the contract obliged AstraZeneca to make its ""best effort"" to meet EU demand, without compelling it to stick to a specific timetable - an assertion disputed by the EU. ""There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear,"" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview with German radio on Friday morning. ""'Best effort' was valid while it was still unclear whether they could develop a vaccine. That time is behind us. The vaccine is there."" What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

Hotel porter sentenced over fatal fireTwo guests died after a fire broke out in a cupboard at the hotel in West Dunbartonshire in 2017.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Aerial photographs show the extent of the damage to Cameron House A Scottish luxury hotel has been fined half a million pounds over a fire that claimed the lives of two guests. Cameron House has been ordered to pay Â£500,000 after admitting to breaches of fire safety rules. A hotel porter has also been given a community payback order to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Richard Dyson, 38, and his partner Simon Midgley, 32, died in the hotel blaze on the banks of Loch Lomond in December 2017. The fire started after night porter Christopher O'Malley, 35, placed a plastic bag of ash in a cupboard containing kindling and newspapers. O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. Christopher O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act Sheriff William Gallacher said the families of Mr Dyson and Mr Midgley will ""always endure the heartbreak"" caused by the fire. Cameron Housepreviously pleaded guiltyto two charges of failing to take fire safety measures which were necessary to ensure the safety of staff and guests. Survivor Hannah Munns, who was in the room next to the couple, said she felt ""ignored and angry"" after the sentencing. Ms Munns toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""Two men have lost their lives, many families have been impacted and they (Cameron House) continue to trade. They are barely going to notice it."" She also criticised the lack of communication since the blaze and said she could not make sense of O'Malley's ""ridiculous"" actions. But Ms Munns added she felt more aggrieved at the fine handed down to Cameron House. She said: ""That's nothing. No lessons will be learned from that. Nothing will change as a result of that. ""It just feels like no-one has taken it very seriously. I am just in shock, really. It is almost saying our lives don't matter."" Richard Dyson, left, and Simon Midgley, right, who both died, had been on a winter break in Scotland Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie said the fire had been devastating for the victims' families. The Scottish Labour interim leader spoke to Mr Midgley's mother, Jane, after the sentencing and said she remains ""heartbroken"". Ms Baillie added: ""What we heard today, in the context of two young men losing their lives, does not seem enough to her. ""We have a major hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond that failed to heed the advice given to them by the fire brigade and others. ""The deaths of these two young men did not need to happen at all."" Dumbarton Sheriff Court heard staff were not properly trained in the safe disposal of ash and no written procedures were in place. That was contrary to recommendations made in two fire risk assessments carried out by an independent company in 2016 and 2017. There was no safe system for emptying the ash bins outside the hotel, which is next to Loch Lomond. The day before the fatal fire, O'Malley had discovered they were both full. They had not been emptied since October 2017, two months before the 18 December blaze. In August 2017, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service told managers not to store combustibles - like kindling and newspapers - in the concierge cupboard, but staff continued to do so. This video can not be played CCTV captures moment hotel fire takes hold Peter Gray QC, acting for Cameron House, said the failings were not deliberate breaches but occurred ""as a result of genuine errors"". He also told the court the fire had gone undetected for a long period before being discovered, and that the hotel had a ""suite of measures in place"" to deal with fire safety. Sheriff William Gallacher also heard of an incident three nights before the fatal fire, when O'Malley and another night porter were told not to put ash into plastic bags because it was a fire hazard. Mr Gray said it was therefore ""extremely difficult to understand"" why O'Malley did not follow this guidance on the night of the fire. Fatal hotel fire caused by ash left in cupboard Couple killed in hotel fire named Mum 'tortured' by son's death in hotel fire After the sentencing, Alistair Duncan, head of the Health and Safety Investigation Unit, said: ""The failings on the part of Cameron House Resort and Christopher O'Malley led to the deaths of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson. ""This incident should serve as a reminder to other companies that failure to implement the necessary fire safety measures can have terrible consequences."" Stuart Stevens, assistant chief officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said the ""needless loss of two lives"" could have been prevented. Det Insp Stuart Grainger from Police Scotland said: ""While nothing will ever diminish the pain of their loss, we hope that the conclusion of this case brings at least a small measure of comfort."" The interior of the hotel reception where the fire started in the concierge cupboard The court was previously told O'Malley, of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, deeply regretted his actions and they were not deliberate. More than 200 guests were staying in the hotel when an initial fire alarm sounded at about 06:40. O'Malley opened the door and flames took hold, spreading to the hall. He and two others tried to fight the blaze with fire extinguishers, but were overcome by the flames. The overflowing ash bins outside the luxury hotel Firefighters arrived within 10 minutes to find a ""well-developed"" fire in the mansion, which is near Balloch in West Dunbartonshire. It was after 08:00 when it was discovered that Mr Dyson, 38, and Mr Midgley, 32, were missing. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus found Mr Dyson on a landing at the top of a staircase. Mr Midgley was lying in a fire escape passageway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Mr Dyson was taken to hospital, where he was also pronounced dead. Post-mortem examinations said the men's causes of death had been inhalation of smoke and fire gases. The couple had travelled from London, and were staying at the five-star resort as the final stop on their winter break to Scotland.

Covid: Why is EUâs vaccine rollout so slow?,"Poland's elderly are being vaccinated against Covid-19 Has the European Commission failed EU voters in its all-for-one and one-for-all approach to procuring coronavirus vaccines? Are member countries now regretting they didn't go it alone? As things stand, according to EU sources, the bloc looks sets to receive only a quarter of the 100 million doses it had been expecting from pharma company AstraZeneca by the end of March - putting millions of lives at risk. Vaccine deliveries from another pharma giant, Pfizer, have also slowed down temporarily, while the firm says it's adjusting production methods. Dwindling supplies of coronavirus vaccines have seen Madrid cancelling first dose injections for two weeks. Regional hospitals in Paris say they're in a similar position. They said they're delaying first dose appointments in order to ensure already-vaccinated citizens their second jab. Portugal has warned it could take up to two months longer than initially planned to complete the first phase of its vaccinations. Angela Merkel has scheduled a Monday video conference with Germany's regional leaders and representatives of vaccine manufacturers, after her Health Minister Jens Spahn warned of ""at least another 10 weeks of shortages"". Germany set to limit AstraZeneca jab to under-65s UK vaccine supplies 'won't be interrupted' - Gove What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? Charles Michel, the president of the European Council (the man who represents EU countries in Brussels) said on Thursday he hoped delays in vaccine deliveries could be solved. If not, he said he supported the use of ""all legal means and enforcement measures to ensure effective vaccine production and supply for our population"". In the meantime, the EU is trying to get some control over the number of vaccine doses leaving the bloc from pharmaceutical company sites. New powers for EU members to restrict exports of vaccines are expected to be made public later on Friday. AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Pfizer have EU production sites. Moderna completes its vaccines for countries other than the US in Spain, although the vaccine itself is produced in Switzerland, which is not an EU member. Basically, Brussels wants to know if pharmaceutical companies are exporting vaccines or components needed to produce vaccines from EU production sites, in order to fulfil orders elsewhere, when those same companies have delayed supplies to the EU. Officially, Brussels insists it doesn't intend to ban vaccine exports in the future. It claims the new powers for members states are for the purpose of transparency. But the situation is evolving. EU suspicions led it to ask Belgian investigators to inspect a factory - part of the AstraZeneca production chain - this week, to look into the company's claims that the dramatic delay in vaccine supply for the EU was due to production problems. Brussels also asked AstraZeneca whether vaccines produced, or partially produced, in the EU were delivered to the UK. The EU has also demanded the company divert vaccines made at its UK production sites to boost the supply to the EU. In what at first seemed an extremely emotional attack on AstraZeneca, Brussels threw at the company the fact that it had invested more than â¬300m (Â£265m; $364m) to help it develop the vaccine and to produce it in mass quantities. In reality, Brussels has yet to hand over a substantial lump of the promised amount. And some EU accusations just don't add up. Take the complaint that the bloc is being treated as ""second class"" by AstraZeneca. The fact is, when it comes to honouring its contract with the UK, for example, the EU signed its AstraZeneca vaccine contract three months later than Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. AstraZeneca has also claimed that it has a ""best effort"" agreement with the EU, rather than a 100% commitment that the desired amount of vaccines would be delivered by the end of March. The UK has tried to stay out of the Astra Zeneca row, with the government focusing instead on the content of their contract with the pharmaceutical company. There have been public assurances from cabinet ministers that the UK supply agreed with AstraZeneca will not be affected. That was the really important thing, said UK cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, on Thursday, also adding: ""We will want to talk to and with our friends in Europe to see how we can help."" Some EU figures bridled at comments by Mr Johnson this week that he didn't want to see restrictions on vaccines or their ingredients across borders. They took it as criticism of the discussion in EU circles - originally championed, but later stepped away from, by Germany - of a possible export ban. Post-Brexit, relations are sensitive between the EU and UK - but by Thursday the European Commission was keen to spell out that its beef was with the pharmaceuticals, not with Downing Street. But while there's clearly been bad luck with vaccine supplies so far, the finger of blame has also been pointed squarely - from inside the EU - at the European Commission itself. Brussels had hoped the EU's vaccination procurement scheme would be a beacon of European solidarity and strength. A stark contrast to the ""each country for itself"" impression given off by member states at the start of the pandemic, when EU countries closed off national borders, and Germany and France initially blocked exports of PPE equipment, much needed elsewhere in the bloc. A stark contrast too, according the EU, to the ""vaccine nationalism'"" it believed it saw in the US under President Donald Trump. EU diplomats say the bloc was ""desperate"" to avoid having one EU member state pitted against the other in an ""ugly"" national scramble to secure vaccine contracts for their own populations. But the Commission's ensuing three-pronged attempt to sign a number of contracts with different pharmaceutical companies, at lower prices, ensuring more legal liability on the companies themselves, undoubtedly slowed the process down. The EU is also accused of not investing enough in expanding production capacity. An added complication was the initial suspicion from some member states of the motives of others, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands that are homes to big vaccine producers. Were they keen for the EU to spend more on vaccine procurement, so companies on their soil could benefit? The EU got there in the end with its contracts, amounting to 2.3bn doses, it says, but an online article from Belgium's RTBF describes the current vaccine situation as politically humiliating for the EU, especially after Brexit. It says even though the EU managed to negotiate vaccine contracts as a bloc, even though it played a major role in the research and development of a Covid vaccine, it ultimately failed to achieve ""vaccine sovereignty"". EU defenders say it's a question of perspective and that smaller, less well-off member states are still relieved the EU negotiated on their behalf as they would have probably found themselves far nearer the back of the vaccine queue had they been trying to go it alone. EU officials also make the argument that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been slower to approve new vaccines in order to be extra sure of their safety. Despite a week of rowing with AstraZeneca, for example, the EU has yet to actually approve the company's vaccine. By contrast, the UK government approved the vaccine a month ago. An EMA announcement is expected on Friday afternoon. Diplomats point to lowering levels of vaccine scepticism amongst the EU public this year, compared with 2020, for example in France, which has a pretty high level of anti-vaxxers. They attribute that to public confidence in the EMA. But EU vaccine problems don't just lie in Brussels. Some member countries have been far more efficient at rolling out the vaccines they have so far received, than others. Denmark is held up as a poster child, for example, whereas Germany's popular Bild newspaper has criticised Angela Merkel's government for being a ""vaccination snail"". And that, coupled with a steadily climbing Covid death toll, has a definite impact on national politics - and EU solidarity. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared This is election year in Germany. Under fire for the slow rate of getting vaccines into arms compared with the UK, the German government felt forced to admit it had negotiated a separate vaccine contract with Pfizer back in September. Ms Merkel is obliged to wait with using those additional vaccines until all EU countries have received their allotted doses under the EU-Pfizer contract, but still... Hungary, meanwhile, has agreed to purchase two million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. Since the EU has no contract with Moscow, Prime Minister Viktor Orban is legally free to start rolling out those jabs whenever he wants. Pharmaceutical companies promised vaccine deliveries to the EU will greatly increase after March - but EU citizens look at the advanced rate of vaccinations in the UK, the US, never mind Israel, and right now the mood is fearful and sceptical. In the initial race to find a vaccine, most countries spoke of the need for fairness. Global pledging conferences emphasised the importance of everyone getting the vaccine, rich or poor; wherever they live. But now vaccines are available and with Covid still a huge health threat, the rush for jabs is proving rather messier than was hoped. At least in the immediate term.

Here are this eveningâs headlines:  The anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases is an ""appropriate"" time for people to thank all NHS workers, the head of the health service has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens praised treatment innovations on a visit to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on Friday. The hospital treated the UK's first two Covid-19 patients a year ago. The pair, a Chinese student and his mother, were in York when they fell ill with the virus. Sir Simon said: ""These are the staff here at this hospital in Newcastle who treated the first coronavirus patients in England a year ago. ""Since then, hospitals across the country have looked after more than 300,000 severely ill coronavirus patients so I do think, on this one year anniversary, it is appropriate for the whole country to say a huge thank you to every member of staff across the health service."" You can read more from Sir Simon here. The UK is ""carefully considering"" its next steps after the EU introduced export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under Northern Ireland's Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Cabinet Office minister Michael
Gove has spoken with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ to express
the UKâs concern over a lack of notification from the EU about its actions in
relation to the NI protocol. ""Gove told him the UK would now be carefully
considering next steps,"" Downing Street said in a statement. The incident happened at one of New Zealand's managed isolation hotels in Auckland An employee at a quarantine hotel in New Zealand has been sacked after what officials described as an inappropriate encounter with a person who should have been isolating. Officials say the pair shared notes, including one written on a face mask, before spending 20 minutes in a room together. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said it was ""unacceptable"": ""I didn't enquire specifically into the nature of the encounter, but the fact it was a 20-minute encounter, it was long enough for me to be unacceptable,"" he said. He added that the staff member had brought a bottle of wine to the room. People returning to New Zealand have to spend at least 14 days in isolation. The country has been hailed as one of the world's leaders in containing the virus. It has recorded 25 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Earlier this week, it reported its first case of Covid-19 outside of quarantine facilities in more than two months. Read more here. Andy Burnham with Matt Healy of the band The 1975 - in pre-social distancing times Record labels should help bail out small music venues struggling to survive the pandemic, Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham says. Burnham, a former culture secretary, is calling on the ""big players"" in music to pay a levy, just as football clubs do for grassroots facilities. The musicians who go on to sustain the industry often start in ""critical"" small venues, he says. The Music Venue Trust says 30 venues are at imminent risk of permanent closure because of the pandemic, with hundreds more in trouble. You can read more about Burnham's comments here. American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan disembark at a US military base on 29 January 2020. In late January, a cargo aircraft carrying nearly 200 Americans - the first to be evacuated from Wuhan, China - landed at a military base in California. They were greeted by health officials who did not wear the proper protective gear and had also been advised to avoid the ""bad optics"" of wearing any. As civilians disembarked and began to quarantine at the base, there were no officials leading an effort to manage ""infection control and prevention measures"" and little PPE on hand for the officials present. Days later, these officials boarded commercial airlines and flew to other parts of the country. These details - initially the subject of a whistleblower complaint against the US health department - are the findings of a federal watchdog's investigation into how the US handled its first up-close encounter with the virus. The âmost troubling findingâ is that the handling of the 
Wuhan evacuees âincreased the risk of infection transmission not only to
 deployed [government] personnel, but also to the American public as a 
whole,â wrote lead investigator Henry Kerner in a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday. The US is now well past 25 million total cases of the virus. Over 433,000 Americans have died. This video can not be played Dr Alex: From Love Island to the frontline of a pandemic When Dr Alex George entered the Love Island villa in 2018 he never could have imagined what the next few years would bring. He's now back in his day job, in the midst of a pandemic, working in A&E at University Hospital Lewisham in London. He also lost his brother, LlÅ·r, to suicide last year. He's been speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat. The US Navy's warship USS Chafee Several sailors aboard a US Navy warship have tested positive for Covid. The Navy Times reports that 41 crew members aboard the USS Chafee have either been infected with the virus or been in close contact with sick shipmates. Sailors on board told The Times there has been a lack of ship-wide testing to identify more cases and a shortage of N95 masks. Some have used a single dirty mask for several days on end, according to one petty officer, who told the paper: ""We have asked for more, but they donât have enough."" ""When we kick back, we are either told to wear the 
dirty mask or face (non-judicial punishment)."" An official spokesman for the ship's fleet has however disputed the reporting and said: ""The ship remains able to meet its mission."" The warship - currently stationed in California - typically docks in Hawaii, which has seen over 25,000 cases of the virus and over 400 deaths. Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Cross-border travel with Northern Ireland and Britain makes a ""zero Covid"" strategy unlikely to work, an Irish expert says A senior member of the Republic of Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team hasrejected the ""zero Covid"" strategy advocated by opposition politicians. Those supporting the measure point to Australia and New Zealand's approach of suppressing the virus with much stricter lockdowns and rules on inbound travel. But Prof Philip Nolan said it was a ""false promise"" to say Ireland could go from the highest level of restrictions to the lowest levels ""in the space of weeks or months"" - adding that it ""won't happen"". Prof Nolan, who chairs the government's epidemiological modelling advisory group, said it ""would be an incredibly risky thing to do because we will inevitably be a leaky country and get re-introduction of the disease and that could easily be new variants"". The Irish government has always cited the open border with Northern Ireland and the lack of restriction on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as reasons why a zero Covid policy would be unlikely to work. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on non-essential airline travel in and out of the country. He says the countryâs main airlines have agreed to cancel service to âall Caribbeans destinations and Mexicoâ until the end of April. In addition, the government will mandate new testing and quarantine requirements for people returning to Canada. âNew variants of Covid-19 pose a real challenge to Canada,â
 says Mr Trudeau. âThatâs why we need to take extra measures.â It comes as media reports suggest Canadians are escaping to more sunny destinations amid the chilly and virus-afflicted winter. âWith the challenges we currently face with Covid-19, both here at home and abroad, we all agree that now is just not the time to be flying,"" says Mr Trudeau. That's all from the AstraZeneca press conference. Researchers are asked about comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, where he questioned how effective the vaccine was in over-65s. In response, Prof Pollard says there's ""good evidence"" to support the use of vaccine, including a strong immune response in older adults. He says there is much more limited data on efficacy in older adults but that doesn't mean there is necessarily a lack of protection. He adds ""everything points to the likelihood"" the vaccine will offer the same level of protection across all age groups. Prof Pollard says it is ""perhaps a misunderstanding"" of the data by the French president. Menelaos Pangolas, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D, is asked about the half dose of the vaccine that appeared to show better efficacy. Trials showed 62% effectiveness for two doses. But a subset of data showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. Pangolas says he is ""very confident"" with the dosing regimen they have, adding they are no longer needing to explore the half dose. He says hopefully when the data is published that will become apparent. Away from the AstraZeneca press conference, the EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines. The EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. It has therefore invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. You can read the full story here. The Associated Press asks Soriot whether the company will look at today with ""some regret"" given the disputes with the EU. He says ""a lot has been done"" to provide the vaccine to the bloc. Soriot says nine months ago the firm had nothing and the company is focused on supplying the EU, but everyone has to recognise it's ""a complicated process"". He says what has been done ""people take for granted"". It is not simple and is indeed very complicated, he says. ""We are really trying to catch up - there's not much more we can do."" Researchers are asked about the South African variant and its impact on vaccine efficacy. Prof Pollard says he doesn't have the data on what sort of effect the variant will have on the AstraZeneca vaccine. But he says he when you look at the changes in the spike protein caused by the variant, researchers would expect an ""impact on efficacy"" in vaccines. He says some of this has been shown in the data released in the last 24 hours for the Janssen and Novavax vaccines. But he says the ""really good news"" is if new vaccines do need to be made they can be done within a ""matter of months"". It's not like the situation a year ago, where it took a year of development, he says. He also says that although there are some concerns about new variants, it's still possible the current vaccines will be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalisation. AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot is asked about a problem with production of the vaccine at a factory in Belgium. He says the firm never mentions any of its partners, but adds that it has had ""teething issues"" in terms of the yield of vaccine at some of its production sites. ""We're talking about biology manufacturing here,"" he says, adding that making vaccines ""is extremely complicated"". ""It's not like doing an orange juice,"" he says. ""Everybody's on a learning curve, which usually you develop over year. We've had months. ""Some sites are more advanced."" He says the reasons for yield issues vary from site to site, but adds: ""We believe we have now fixed most of the issues and the productivity of the sites should improve rapidly over the next few months."" AstraZeneca is ""ready to launch"" its vaccine in the US as soon as it is approved by the regulator, the firm's chief executive says. Pascal Soriot says the firm has been working ""hand in hand"" with the US to manufacture the jab. Executive vice president Mene Pangolas says the US study is fully recruited and they are now waiting for enough Covid cases to be able to report their data. He says he imagines this will be in February. Asked whether he is concerned that some EU states are considering not giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to over 65s, Prof Andrew Pollard says ""there's no reason to be concerned about using it"". He stresses it ""can be used in all ages"", but adds that ""we have to respect how member states choose to use the vaccine"". Prof Pollard says the team is ""very confident in the data that we have"", adding that they have ""data showing that there's good immune response in older adults"". He also notes that trials are still running in the UK and Brazil, so ""there's a lot more data to come"". Asked by Alistair Smout of Reuters about Astra Zeneca's requirement to fulfil its ""best efforts"" to supply the vaccine to the EU, the company's chief executive officer Pascal Soriot says he is going to disappoint him with his reply. Soriot declines to answer and says he only wants to talk about the positive news of the deal to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the EU. Â© 2025 BBC.

"EU introduces controls on vaccines to NIDUP leader Arlene Foster described the move as ""an incredible act of hostility"" by the EU.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played Arlene Foster: EU Covid vaccine controls are an ""act of aggression"" The EU is introducing controls on vaccines made in the bloc, including to Northern Ireland, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to Northern Ireland without checks. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Prime Minister Boris Johnson called for the EU to ""urgently clarify its intentions"". NI First Minister Arlene Foster described the move as ""an incredible act of hostility"" by the EU. The EU invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. In a new regulation, the European Commission stated: ""This is justified as a safeguard measure pursuant to Article 16 of that Protocol in order to avert serious societal difficulties due to a lack of supply threatening to disturb the orderly implementation of the vaccination campaigns in the Member States."" What is Northern Ireland's Covid-19 vaccine plan? EU drugs regulator approves AstraZeneca vaccine The move comes amid a disputeover vaccine producer AstraZeneca's delivery commitments to the EU. The bloc agreed to buy up to 400m doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine last year, and on Friday the EU's drugs regulator approved their use for all adults. But the firm said that due to problems at one of its EU factories, supplies would be reduced by about 60% in the first quarter of 2021. A Downing Street spokesperson said: ""The UK government is urgently seeking an explanation from the European Commission about the statements issued by the EU today and assurances as to its intentions. ""The UK has legally-binding agreements with vaccine suppliers and it would not expect the EU, as a friend and ally, to do anything to disrupt the fulfilment of these contracts. ""The UK government has reiterated the importance of preserving the benefits of the Belfast/Good Friday agreement and the commitments that have been made to the two communities."" The EU is under growing pressure over the slow pace of vaccine distribution The prime minister spoke with Taoiseach (prime minister) Micheal Martin on Friday night and stressed the need for the EU to clarify its intentions. An Irish government spokesman said Mr Martin was currently in discussions with European Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen to express Dublin's concerns. The Northern Ireland Protocol is a special deal to prevent the re-emergence of a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol, agreed in the original withdrawal agreement,is essentially a safeguard that would allow the UK or EU to act unilaterallyif measures imposed as a result of the protocol are deemed to be causing ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". Unionist politicians in Northern Ireland have been agitating for the UK government to use Article 16 to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The government has been resisting this, insisting the new arrangements are not creating serious difficulties. The EU's actions are seen as an audacious move. Unionist politicians are incredulous. Throughout the Brexit process the EU vehemently insisted there could be no border on the island of Ireland. For a while the entire trade deal hinged on this. But now, to critics, it appears that principle has vanished over vaccines. It begs the question, if the EU can decide to push this button on this, what else might they use it for in future? Those who strongly oppose the Brexit arrangements in Northern Ireland will be pushing even harder now for the UK to use Article 16 to override parts of the deal for its own purposes, too. The EU's move should not directly disadvantage Northern Ireland, which gets its vaccine supplies through the UK procurement system. ""The government has contracts with AstraZeneca & others to ensure vaccines are delivered on schedule & guarantee reliable vaccine provision across the whole of the UK,"" tweeted Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. Politicians who support the Northern Ireland Protocol have reacted with dismay, fearing the EU move could undermine the whole deal. Louise Haigh MP, Labour's Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary, said the move was ""deeply destabilising and undermines the huge efforts being made to make the Protocol work"". For her part, DUP leader Arlene Foster said the EU had placed a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. ""By triggering Article 16 in this manner, the European Union has once again shown it is prepared to use Northern Ireland when it suits their interests but in the most despicable manner - over the provision of a vaccine which is designed to save lives,"" she said. ""At the first opportunity the EU has placed a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland over the supply chain of the coronavirus vaccine. ""With the European Union using Article 16 in such an aggressive and most shameful way, it is now time for our Government to step up."" Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol is a safeguard mechanism. Similar measures are often found in a variety of trade agreements. It allows either the UK or the EU to take unilateral action if the application of the protocol leads to serious 'economic, societal or environmental difficulties' which are liable to persist. It doesn't define what 'serious' means, but Article 16 is only meant to be used in an emergency. So, the fact that the EU has chosen to invoke it shows just how seriously it is taking its vaccine shortages. But how will the UK respond? If Northern Ireland could become a backdoor for vaccines to be taken from the EU into the UK, couldn't the same point be argued the other way round? Arlene Foster clearly expects something to be done. ""I will be urging the Prime Minister to act,"" she says, ""and use robust measures including Article 16 to advance the interests of Northern Ireland and the rest of the United Kingdom."" The intriguing thing is that Article 16 doesn't, of course, apply only to vaccines. There have been plenty of people calling on the government to invoke Article 16 to help alleviate the trade problems that have arisen between Great Britain and Northern Ireland since the beginning of the year. That's because Great Britain is now outside the EU single market, but Northern Ireland is still following many single market rules. This latest development means the plot thickens even further. Sinn Fein leader Mary Lou McDonald described the EU's use of Article 16 as a ""grave error"". ""Our citizens need timely access to lifesaving vaccines not trade disputes,"" she tweeted. ""Now is a time for cool heads and solidarity."" Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken said the UK government should now invoke Article 16 in response to the EU's actions. Alliance Party leader Naomi Long said what was needed was ""maximum co-operation"", rather than ""obstructive behaviour"" from the EU. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said the European Commission's decision to invoke Article 16 was ""disproportionate"". Last week AstraZeneca said vaccine supplies would be reduced because of problems in one of its EU factories. The shortfall is expected to be about 60% in the first quarter of 2021.The EU has also received fewer than expected doses of the two other vaccinesit has approved - from Pfizer-BioNTech and Moderna. How effective is the Oxford vaccine? Why is EUâs vaccine rollout so slow? Is it OK to get a leftover Covid-19 vaccine? The EU has said AstraZeneca must honour its commitments and deliver the jabs it ordered by diverting doses manufactured in the UK. The company said its contract for UK supplies prohibits that, since it must fulfil Britain's order before it can send supplies made there abroad. But an EU source familiar with the matter told the BBC that AstraZeneca's UK facilities were legally obliged to do so, saying: ""This is not an option, it is a contractual obligation."" The UK plants are not back-up facilities; they are part of the main network, the source added. The company's CEO Mr Soriot said earlier this week that the contract obliged AstraZeneca to make its ""best effort"" to meet EU demand, without compelling it to stick to a specific timetable - an assertion disputed by the EU. ""There are binding orders and the contract is crystal clear,"" European Commission chief Ursula von der Leyen said in an interview with German radio on Friday morning. ""'Best effort' was valid while it was still unclear whether they could develop a vaccine. That time is behind us. The vaccine is there."" What is the new Northern Ireland Brexit trade deal?

LiveLive'No concern' about AstraZeneca vaccine and over-65sLess than a minute ago,"AstraZeneca says it is ""unprecedented"" the world has produced multiple vaccines in a year, after the EU approved its jab Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group, adds there is ""no reason"" to be concerned about using the vaccine on over-65s Some EU states are considering only giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-65s, citing a lack of data for its use on older age groups Meanwhile, a new coronavirus vaccine developed by Janssen prevents 66% of Covid cases after a single dose, the Belgian company says And another new vaccine, Novavax, is said to be the first to show in trials it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK Meanwhile, lockdown will continue in Wales for a further three weeks, First Minister Mark Drakeford says The UK's R rate - the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect - is now estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.1 Edited by Hamish Mackay Weâre ending todayâs live coverage here, but we'll be back tomorrow with more updates. Here are this eveningâs headlines:  The anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases is an ""appropriate"" time for people to thank all NHS workers, the head of the health service has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens praised treatment innovations on a visit to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on Friday. The hospital treated the UK's first two Covid-19 patients a year ago. The pair, a Chinese student and his mother, were in York when they fell ill with the virus. Sir Simon said: ""These are the staff here at this hospital in Newcastle who treated the first coronavirus patients in England a year ago. ""Since then, hospitals across the country have looked after more than 300,000 severely ill coronavirus patients so I do think, on this one year anniversary, it is appropriate for the whole country to say a huge thank you to every member of staff across the health service."" You can read more from Sir Simon here. The UK is ""carefully considering"" its next steps after the EU introduced export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under Northern Ireland's Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Cabinet Office minister Michael
Gove has spoken with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ to express
the UKâs concern over a lack of notification from the EU about its actions in
relation to the NI protocol. ""Gove told him the UK would now be carefully
considering next steps,"" Downing Street said in a statement. The incident happened at one of New Zealand's managed isolation hotels in Auckland An employee at a quarantine hotel in New Zealand has been sacked after what officials described as an inappropriate encounter with a person who should have been isolating. Officials say the pair shared notes, including one written on a face mask, before spending 20 minutes in a room together. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said it was ""unacceptable"": ""I didn't enquire specifically into the nature of the encounter, but the fact it was a 20-minute encounter, it was long enough for me to be unacceptable,"" he said. He added that the staff member had brought a bottle of wine to the room. People returning to New Zealand have to spend at least 14 days in isolation. The country has been hailed as one of the world's leaders in containing the virus. It has recorded 25 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Earlier this week, it reported its first case of Covid-19 outside of quarantine facilities in more than two months. Read more here. Andy Burnham with Matt Healy of the band The 1975 - in pre-social distancing times Record labels should help bail out small music venues struggling to survive the pandemic, Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham says. Burnham, a former culture secretary, is calling on the ""big players"" in music to pay a levy, just as football clubs do for grassroots facilities. The musicians who go on to sustain the industry often start in ""critical"" small venues, he says. The Music Venue Trust says 30 venues are at imminent risk of permanent closure because of the pandemic, with hundreds more in trouble. You can read more about Burnham's comments here. American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan disembark at a US military base on 29 January 2020. In late January, a cargo aircraft carrying nearly 200 Americans - the first to be evacuated from Wuhan, China - landed at a military base in California. They were greeted by health officials who did not wear the proper protective gear and had also been advised to avoid the ""bad optics"" of wearing any. As civilians disembarked and began to quarantine at the base, there were no officials leading an effort to manage ""infection control and prevention measures"" and little PPE on hand for the officials present. Days later, these officials boarded commercial airlines and flew to other parts of the country. These details - initially the subject of a whistleblower complaint against the US health department - are the findings of a federal watchdog's investigation into how the US handled its first up-close encounter with the virus. The âmost troubling findingâ is that the handling of the 
Wuhan evacuees âincreased the risk of infection transmission not only to
 deployed [government] personnel, but also to the American public as a 
whole,â wrote lead investigator Henry Kerner in a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday. The US is now well past 25 million total cases of the virus. Over 433,000 Americans have died. This video can not be played Dr Alex: From Love Island to the frontline of a pandemic When Dr Alex George entered the Love Island villa in 2018 he never could have imagined what the next few years would bring. He's now back in his day job, in the midst of a pandemic, working in A&E at University Hospital Lewisham in London. He also lost his brother, LlÅ·r, to suicide last year. He's been speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat. The US Navy's warship USS Chafee Several sailors aboard a US Navy warship have tested positive for Covid. The Navy Times reports that 41 crew members aboard the USS Chafee have either been infected with the virus or been in close contact with sick shipmates. Sailors on board told The Times there has been a lack of ship-wide testing to identify more cases and a shortage of N95 masks. Some have used a single dirty mask for several days on end, according to one petty officer, who told the paper: ""We have asked for more, but they donât have enough."" ""When we kick back, we are either told to wear the 
dirty mask or face (non-judicial punishment)."" An official spokesman for the ship's fleet has however disputed the reporting and said: ""The ship remains able to meet its mission."" The warship - currently stationed in California - typically docks in Hawaii, which has seen over 25,000 cases of the virus and over 400 deaths. Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Cross-border travel with Northern Ireland and Britain makes a ""zero Covid"" strategy unlikely to work, an Irish expert says A senior member of the Republic of Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team hasrejected the ""zero Covid"" strategy advocated by opposition politicians. Those supporting the measure point to Australia and New Zealand's approach of suppressing the virus with much stricter lockdowns and rules on inbound travel. But Prof Philip Nolan said it was a ""false promise"" to say Ireland could go from the highest level of restrictions to the lowest levels ""in the space of weeks or months"" - adding that it ""won't happen"". Prof Nolan, who chairs the government's epidemiological modelling advisory group, said it ""would be an incredibly risky thing to do because we will inevitably be a leaky country and get re-introduction of the disease and that could easily be new variants"". The Irish government has always cited the open border with Northern Ireland and the lack of restriction on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as reasons why a zero Covid policy would be unlikely to work. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on non-essential airline travel in and out of the country. He says the countryâs main airlines have agreed to cancel service to âall Caribbeans destinations and Mexicoâ until the end of April. In addition, the government will mandate new testing and quarantine requirements for people returning to Canada. âNew variants of Covid-19 pose a real challenge to Canada,â
 says Mr Trudeau. âThatâs why we need to take extra measures.â It comes as media reports suggest Canadians are escaping to more sunny destinations amid the chilly and virus-afflicted winter. âWith the challenges we currently face with Covid-19, both here at home and abroad, we all agree that now is just not the time to be flying,"" says Mr Trudeau. That's all from the AstraZeneca press conference. Researchers are asked about comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, where he questioned how effective the vaccine was in over-65s. In response, Prof Pollard says there's ""good evidence"" to support the use of vaccine, including a strong immune response in older adults. He says there is much more limited data on efficacy in older adults but that doesn't mean there is necessarily a lack of protection. He adds ""everything points to the likelihood"" the vaccine will offer the same level of protection across all age groups. Prof Pollard says it is ""perhaps a misunderstanding"" of the data by the French president. Menelaos Pangolas, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D, is asked about the half dose of the vaccine that appeared to show better efficacy. Trials showed 62% effectiveness for two doses. But a subset of data showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. Pangolas says he is ""very confident"" with the dosing regimen they have, adding they are no longer needing to explore the half dose. He says hopefully when the data is published that will become apparent. Away from the AstraZeneca press conference, the EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines. The EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. It has therefore invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. You can read the full story here. The Associated Press asks Soriot whether the company will look at today with ""some regret"" given the disputes with the EU. He says ""a lot has been done"" to provide the vaccine to the bloc. Soriot says nine months ago the firm had nothing and the company is focused on supplying the EU, but everyone has to recognise it's ""a complicated process"". He says what has been done ""people take for granted"". It is not simple and is indeed very complicated, he says. ""We are really trying to catch up - there's not much more we can do."" Researchers are asked about the South African variant and its impact on vaccine efficacy. Prof Pollard says he doesn't have the data on what sort of effect the variant will have on the AstraZeneca vaccine. But he says he when you look at the changes in the spike protein caused by the variant, researchers would expect an ""impact on efficacy"" in vaccines. He says some of this has been shown in the data released in the last 24 hours for the Janssen and Novavax vaccines. But he says the ""really good news"" is if new vaccines do need to be made they can be done within a ""matter of months"". It's not like the situation a year ago, where it took a year of development, he says. He also says that although there are some concerns about new variants, it's still possible the current vaccines will be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalisation. AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot is asked about a problem with production of the vaccine at a factory in Belgium. He says the firm never mentions any of its partners, but adds that it has had ""teething issues"" in terms of the yield of vaccine at some of its production sites. ""We're talking about biology manufacturing here,"" he says, adding that making vaccines ""is extremely complicated"". ""It's not like doing an orange juice,"" he says. ""Everybody's on a learning curve, which usually you develop over year. We've had months. ""Some sites are more advanced."" He says the reasons for yield issues vary from site to site, but adds: ""We believe we have now fixed most of the issues and the productivity of the sites should improve rapidly over the next few months."" AstraZeneca is ""ready to launch"" its vaccine in the US as soon as it is approved by the regulator, the firm's chief executive says. Pascal Soriot says the firm has been working ""hand in hand"" with the US to manufacture the jab. Executive vice president Mene Pangolas says the US study is fully recruited and they are now waiting for enough Covid cases to be able to report their data. He says he imagines this will be in February. Asked whether he is concerned that some EU states are considering not giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to over 65s, Prof Andrew Pollard says ""there's no reason to be concerned about using it"". He stresses it ""can be used in all ages"", but adds that ""we have to respect how member states choose to use the vaccine"". Prof Pollard says the team is ""very confident in the data that we have"", adding that they have ""data showing that there's good immune response in older adults"". He also notes that trials are still running in the UK and Brazil, so ""there's a lot more data to come"". Asked by Alistair Smout of Reuters about Astra Zeneca's requirement to fulfil its ""best efforts"" to supply the vaccine to the EU, the company's chief executive officer Pascal Soriot says he is going to disappoint him with his reply. Soriot declines to answer and says he only wants to talk about the positive news of the deal to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the EU. Â© 2025 BBC.

NI Protocol 'obstructs free movement of military'The UUP says the MoD must now fill out customs declaration forms to move equipment.Northern Ireland,"Doug Beattie said a customs form will be needed to move army equipment from GB to NI The government is facing fresh criticism over the Northern Ireland Protocol amid warnings it obstructs the ""free movement"" of the military. The Ulster Unionist Party has said that, under the protocol, the MoD must now give 15 days notice and fill out customs declaration forms before it moves equipment from GB to NI. It also said Nato has to be notified about the move. But the Ministry of Defence insists its NI operations will not be affected. Ulster Unionist MLA and former Army officer Doug Beattie said it is ""ludicrous where UK armed forces cannot move around the UK with equipment without permission"". In a letter to Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, he called for urgent action to ""protect military operations"" in Northern Ireland. He wrote that ""military equipment, and in some cases personnel, cannot be moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland unless they complete a customs form"". ""More worryingly, there will also be a need to complete a Nato form before any movement takes place,"" Mr Beattie added. The days of heavy duty military hardware rolling into Northern Ireland are long gone. But the military still provides support to the PSNI against the threat from paramilitaries under Operation Helvetic. It also has two bases used for training soldiers. But one military source said much of the equipment needed is already here, hence the MoD statement insisting its operations will not be affected by the new protocol arrangements. Though, for some unionists, the very thought of the military having to give notice and fill out forms before moving equipment from one part of the UK to another is a bitter pill. For them it is much more than a paper exercise. ""This Nato form is usually for the movement of UK forces and their equipment around the globe, but in this instance it is to allow UK forces to move within the confines of our own country. ""This is quite incredible and I simply cannot believe that any UK government would tolerate such a situation."" Mr Beattie told the secretary of state if the ""barriers"" cannot be removed, then Mr Lewis must invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The clause allows the EU or UK to ""unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures"", if the application of the protocol is triggering ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist"" or trade friction. First Minister Arlene Foster told Good Morning Ulster it was ""another example of the hundreds of problems with the protocol which we (the DUP) vehemently opposed"". ""We find it and its outworkings offensive,"" she said. ""No sovereign country should have barriers to trade and customs arrangements placed within it,"" she added. She said she had spoken to Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, who was ""concerned about the principle and sovereignty of the UK"". She added that they would be working on ""not just the function but on the principle - that the UK military has to be able to work at speed within its own jurisdiction"". It is understood one of the documents required is a form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"" Mr Beattie has also raised his concerns with the Armed Forces Minister James Heappey. Military on duty in wards to help ease pressures Brexit means NI eels can't be sold in Britain What will happen in Northern Ireland after Brexit? It is understood one of the documents required is a Nato 302 form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"". According to the EU Customs Transit regulations covering Nato and other military activities, the 302 form is used for a number of reasons, including ""temporary admission in the EU"". But an MoD spokesperson said: ""The Northern Ireland Protocol has not placed any limitations on the Ministry of Defence's ability to conduct operations.""

"Archbishop supports mother and baby home inquiryArchbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, also agrees that victims should be entitled to compensation.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, was speaking on BBC NI's The View programme The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said he would support a public inquiry into what happened at mother and baby homes across NI. A Department of Health report on the homes was published on Tuesday. Archbishop Eamon Martin was speaking on BBC NI's The View programme on Thursday night. He also agreed that victims of mother and baby homes should be entitled to compensation. Archbishop Martin appealed to anyone in Northern Ireland who has information on what happened to women and children at the homes to ""lift the lid on this stark reality and let the glaring light of truth shine in"". Reaction to NI mother-and-baby homes statement Major findings of NI mother-and-baby homes report Watch back: Eamon Martin on The View The research into the homes was commissioned by the Department of Health and carried out by Queen's University and Ulster University. It examined eight mother and baby homes, a number of former workhouses, four Magdalene Laundries and sought personal testimony from women and children with ""lived experience"" of the institutions. Mother-and-baby institutions housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage and the laundries were Catholic-run workhouses that operated across the island of Ireland. It examined a number of issues including whether a public inquiry should be held. The findings of the research included details of how some were the victims of sexual crime, including rape and incest. Read more on the report's contents here. Speaking on The View, Archbishop Martin said any inquiry ""will require a very firm legislative and statutory framework... in order to help these people understand their story"". First Minister Arlene Foster has said that there would be a ""new independent investigation"" . Meanwhile Judith Gillespie, who chaired the executive's independent inter-departmental working group on the issue, said a public inquiry was ""not off the table"" and insisted survivors would have ""agency in the process"". A man who was placed in a mother-and-baby home in north Belfast in 1945 has said Archbishop Eamon Martin's apology ""helps so much"". Peter Quigley was taken to the home shortly after his birth in Bethany Home orphanage in Dublin. When he was 42, he managed to trace his birth mother and met up with her on Mother's Day in 1987. ""It was quite an emotional experience, and such a joy to put all those pieces together,"" Mr Quigley told BBC Radio Ulster. ""I sent her flowers in advance for Mother's Day, my stepdad met me in the train station at Bognor Regis and we walked up the Linden Road together and I met my mum for the very first time. ""There was no recrimination, there was no regret, it wasn't perfect but it was just normal, healthy and good."" Mr Quigley said a full inquiry would be ""tremendously helpful"" because many people, like himself, need to get information and ""want to fill in the blanks"". Billy Scampton was born in Marianvale in Newry, County Down in the 1960s and was then adopted from the Nazareth House in Donegal in 1962. A Londonderry man who was also born in a mother-and-baby home echoed that call and said there needed to be an investigation into how babies were transported across the border without ""questions being asked"". Billy Scampton was born in Marianvale in Newry, County Down, in the 1960s and was then adopted from the Nazareth House in Donegal in 1962. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Mr Scampton said in the last couple of years he has tried to track down his biological family, but has never met his birth mother. ""What still gets me to this day, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was very much a fixed entity in the 1960s, even before that, when we were born. ""To move even as much as a cow or a chicken you needed the proper paperwork, yet there was the likes of us being moved freely back and forward on what was an international frontier by individuals. ""There were more checks-and-balances put in place to move livestock across than there were to move babies."" First Minister Arlene Foster told Good Morning Ulster that Peter Quigley's testimony of being placed in a mother-and-baby home was ""moving"". She said it was important that people like him were involved in the design and structure of an inquiry. ""It will need statutory powers and a legislative framework to ensure we have access to everything we need,"" she said. However, she added that the form and function should be ""decided by the victims and facilitated and chaired by Victims Commissioner Judith Thompson"". ""It is important that victims must have ownership of everything going forward given that they were not in that position either as young women or the children of those women,"" she added. Thousands of women and girls entered the institutions in Northern Ireland over a 68-year period Following publication of the research earlier this week, Archbishop Martinapologised to victims on behalf of the church and asked for their forgiveness. He reiterated his apology on The View on Thursday night, saying: ""I'm deeply sorry for the way you were treated. As a church leader in Ireland today, it is I who feels the shame that was placed on your shoulders."" He said the Catholic Church ""lost sight of the merciful Christ"" when they mistreated mothers and babies at the homes. ""The gospel I follow is about the dignity of every person, a gospel that calls me to reach out to the vulnerable and the marginalised."" He added: ""We clearly had obscured the light of the gospel underneath a fixation with a judgemental, authoritarian approach to our faith and it is extremely sad that at the brunt of that were often women and vulnerable, those who society was perhaps also rejecting and who perhaps would have wanted to find in their church some refuge, some solace in their church and didn't find it."" Archbishop Martin also said the Catholic Church ""cannot shirk its responsibility for this, which is why I very humbly and sincerely offer that apology"". 'Significant wrongs' in NI mother-and-baby homes Reaction to NI mother-and-baby homes statement Asked if compensation should be paid to victims, Bishop Martin said ""definitely"". He added: ""Victims will require practical support.  What I have found from talking survivors, often they aren't seeking money but answers denied to them in decades previously"". ""We have to find maybe a multitude of ways or memorialisation, recognition. ""If that means financial reparation and it is possible to do that in a way which is just and proportionate and takes account of the findings, I think all of us have to step up and play our part."" The publication of the report in Northern Ireland comes after a similar investigation into mother-and-baby homes and laundries in the Republic of Ireland, which prompted anapology from Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin.

Hotel porter sentenced over fatal fireTwo guests died after a fire broke out in a cupboard at the hotel in West Dunbartonshire in 2017.,"Aerial photographs show the extent of the damage to Cameron House A Scottish luxury hotel has been fined half a million pounds over a fire that claimed the lives of two guests. Cameron House has been ordered to pay Â£500,000 after admitting to breaches of fire safety rules. A hotel porter has also been given a community payback order to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Richard Dyson, 38, and his partner Simon Midgley, 32, died in the hotel blaze on the banks of Loch Lomond in December 2017. The fire started after night porter Christopher O'Malley, 35, placed a plastic bag of ash in a cupboard containing kindling and newspapers. O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. Christopher O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act Sheriff William Gallacher said the families of Mr Dyson and Mr Midgley will ""always endure the heartbreak"" caused by the fire. Cameron Housepreviously pleaded guiltyto two charges of failing to take fire safety measures which were necessary to ensure the safety of staff and guests. Survivor Hannah Munns, who was in the room next to the couple, said she felt ""ignored and angry"" after the sentencing. Ms Munns toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""Two men have lost their lives, many families have been impacted and they (Cameron House) continue to trade. They are barely going to notice it."" She also criticised the lack of communication since the blaze and said she could not make sense of O'Malley's ""ridiculous"" actions. But Ms Munns added she felt more aggrieved at the fine handed down to Cameron House. She said: ""That's nothing. No lessons will be learned from that. Nothing will change as a result of that. ""It just feels like no-one has taken it very seriously. I am just in shock, really. It is almost saying our lives don't matter."" Richard Dyson, left, and Simon Midgley, right, who both died, had been on a winter break in Scotland Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie said the fire had been devastating for the victims' families. The Scottish Labour interim leader spoke to Mr Midgley's mother, Jane, after the sentencing and said she remains ""heartbroken"". Ms Baillie added: ""What we heard today, in the context of two young men losing their lives, does not seem enough to her. ""We have a major hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond that failed to heed the advice given to them by the fire brigade and others. ""The deaths of these two young men did not need to happen at all."" Dumbarton Sheriff Court heard staff were not properly trained in the safe disposal of ash and no written procedures were in place. That was contrary to recommendations made in two fire risk assessments carried out by an independent company in 2016 and 2017. There was no safe system for emptying the ash bins outside the hotel, which is next to Loch Lomond. The day before the fatal fire, O'Malley had discovered they were both full. They had not been emptied since October 2017, two months before the 18 December blaze. In August 2017, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service told managers not to store combustibles - like kindling and newspapers - in the concierge cupboard, but staff continued to do so. This video can not be played CCTV captures moment hotel fire takes hold Peter Gray QC, acting for Cameron House, said the failings were not deliberate breaches but occurred ""as a result of genuine errors"". He also told the court the fire had gone undetected for a long period before being discovered, and that the hotel had a ""suite of measures in place"" to deal with fire safety. Sheriff William Gallacher also heard of an incident three nights before the fatal fire, when O'Malley and another night porter were told not to put ash into plastic bags because it was a fire hazard. Mr Gray said it was therefore ""extremely difficult to understand"" why O'Malley did not follow this guidance on the night of the fire. Fatal hotel fire caused by ash left in cupboard Couple killed in hotel fire named Mum 'tortured' by son's death in hotel fire After the sentencing, Alistair Duncan, head of the Health and Safety Investigation Unit, said: ""The failings on the part of Cameron House Resort and Christopher O'Malley led to the deaths of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson. ""This incident should serve as a reminder to other companies that failure to implement the necessary fire safety measures can have terrible consequences."" Stuart Stevens, assistant chief officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said the ""needless loss of two lives"" could have been prevented. Det Insp Stuart Grainger from Police Scotland said: ""While nothing will ever diminish the pain of their loss, we hope that the conclusion of this case brings at least a small measure of comfort."" The interior of the hotel reception where the fire started in the concierge cupboard The court was previously told O'Malley, of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, deeply regretted his actions and they were not deliberate. More than 200 guests were staying in the hotel when an initial fire alarm sounded at about 06:40. O'Malley opened the door and flames took hold, spreading to the hall. He and two others tried to fight the blaze with fire extinguishers, but were overcome by the flames. The overflowing ash bins outside the luxury hotel Firefighters arrived within 10 minutes to find a ""well-developed"" fire in the mansion, which is near Balloch in West Dunbartonshire. It was after 08:00 when it was discovered that Mr Dyson, 38, and Mr Midgley, 32, were missing. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus found Mr Dyson on a landing at the top of a staircase. Mr Midgley was lying in a fire escape passageway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Mr Dyson was taken to hospital, where he was also pronounced dead. Post-mortem examinations said the men's causes of death had been inhalation of smoke and fire gases. The couple had travelled from London, and were staying at the five-star resort as the final stop on their winter break to Scotland.

A year of high-speed discovery,"A worker takes away an escaped giant salamander from a seafood market, which was shut down due to its connection to the spread of the coronavirus, in Wuhan, January 2020 In January 2020, two scientists published the entire genetic code of a coronavirus that was soon to wreak havoc around the world. It marked the start of a year of intense and rapid scientific endeavour, to work out how we might fight the virus. Eddie Holmes had the genetic blueprint for the coronavirus in his possession for exactly 52 minutes before he put it online. Prof Holmes is based at the University of Sydney, where he works on the emergence of infectious disease - an area of research that was suddenly thrust into the spotlight at the beginning of 2020. He has worked closely, for several years, with Prof Yong-Zhen Zhang, who was at the Chinese Centre for Disease Control in Beijing. Prof Zhang sequenced the genome of the virus that closed down the world. Prof Zhang and Prof Holmes examine a rat in a trap during an infectious disease research trip to China in 2013 He collected samples taken from some of the first patients in Wuhan Central Hospital, where a cluster of mysterious pneumonia cases had emerged. Many of those patients had a link to a seafood and wildlife market in Wuhan. When he examined the code, Prof Zhang immediately saw that this was a coronavirus. It looked very similar to Sars - the respiratory disease that caused a deadly outbreak in Asia in 2002. ""That was on 5 January,"" recalls Prof Holmes. ""And we just thought,oh no. It's Sars back again."" Coronavirus variants: The science explained Coronavirus: A hunt for the 'missing link' species Wuhan scientist 'welcomes' visit over lab leak claim Medical workers in protective suits with Covid-19 patients in Wuhan, China, February 2020 But this code - this virus - was different. It was new. Prof Zhang and Prof Holmes quickly submitted a paper describing what they had seen and, as the week wore on, a buzz of public health speculation about what the novel virus might be started on social media. ""I didn't sleep,"" Prof Holmes tells me. ""It was weighing on my conscience."" In Sydney, it was early on 11 January when Prof Holmes phoned his colleague in China and asked his permission to publish the sequence. ""Zhang was on a plane, strapped into his seat,"" Prof Holmes recalled. ""He told me he needed to think about it - there was some pressure not to release too much information about the outbreak. Prof Holmes (right) visited Wuhan Central Hospital with Prof Zhang and researchers from the Wuhan Centre for Disease Control in 2016 ""He called me back about a minute later and said, 'OK, let's do it.'"" A researcher in Prof Zhang's lab emailed the genetic code to Eddie Holmes, who called a colleague in Edinburgh, in the UK. ""It was about 01:00 there,"" Prof Holmes recalls. In the ensuing 52 minutes, the scientists together wrote a brief post explaining that they were ""releasing a coronavirus genome from a case of a respiratory disease from the Wuhan outbreak"" and uploaded the code. Their post said that researchers should please ""feel free to download, share, use and analyse this data"". With that post,the full genome of Sars CoV-2,external- the code that makes the coronavirus - was available to any scientist with an internet connection. The researchers posted the full genome online on 10 January 2020 It set off 12 months of break-neck scientific endeavour. If you search theUS National Library of Medicine - a database of published medical science studies - for mentions of Covid-19,external, you will retrieve more than 90,000 results. ""If we didn't collaborate with colleagues in China - if I wasn't working with and talking to Zhang - that sequence wouldn't have gone online as early as it did,"" says Prof Holmes. That same weekend, scientists at a US pharmaceutical company called Moderna, which had never previously brought a product to market, downloaded the genome and started work on their experimental vaccine. Scientists at Pfizer did the same. There are multiple methods - traditional and experimental - for making vaccines, but Moderna and Pfizer use an experimental approach based on something called mRNA (or Messenger ribonucleic acid). The terminology is a mouthful, but it describes a simpler, swifter approach to vaccine production. And it was boosted over the clinical finish line by the pandemic. Margaret Keenan, 90, who became the first person to receive the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine outside of a trial, in December 2020 Vaccination is fundamentally based on ""showing"" your immune system the disease-causing agent, so it can form a biological memory and be primed to fight it. For many existing virus vaccines, this has meant producing versions or pieces of the virus itself - often snippets of viral protein stripped of their disease-causing ability. These are grown inside chicken eggs, packaged up and injected. ""To grow enough of those things can take a very long time - sometimes years,"" explains Prof Robert Langer, one of the founders of Moderna, and a professor of chemical engineering at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, US. ""With mRNA - you use the body as a factory to make that protein. So rather than have a giant plant with all these eggs to grow your proteins, you just make the mRNA, give it to the patient and the patient does everything else."" Messenger RNA is a short sequence of coded genetic instructions for the protein you want a cell to make. ""I've been working on this technology for decades,"" says Prof Langer. ""This is actually the ninth mRNA vaccine that Moderna has developed."" The others, which include vaccines that are designed to prime people's immune systems to fight their own cancer, are still in clinical trials. ""But when the pandemic hit, this technology lent itself to doing things as rapidly as possible."" There are now more than 150 coronavirus vaccines in some stage of development. But Pfizer's mRNA vaccine, which it developed in partnership with the German company BioNTech, was the first to receive emergency authorisation by the US Food and Drug Administration. It was quickly followed by Moderna's vaccine - less than a year after scientists first downloaded the genome it was based on. Researcher in a laboratory at Oxfordâs Jenner Institute working on the coronavirus vaccine developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University It was not until the end of January that the World Health Organization called the coronavirus outbreak a ""public health emergency of international concern"". And it took until March for the WHO to officially declare a pandemic. Efforts to understand the virus - to find out where it came from, how to treat it and learn how it was evolving - were already moving almost as rapidly as the pandemic. ""With that genome, we didn't need the actual virus,"" explains Dr Dalan Bailey from the UK's Pirbright Institute. ""We could take that code and actually get the part of the virus that we wanted to study synthesised [using the genome as a blueprint] and have it in our lab within days. ""That definitely allowed us to start our research much more quickly."" Illustration of the coronavirus binding to a human cell Dr Bailey and his colleagues study how exactly the coronavirus latches on to and hijacks each cell. Key to this are those spikes we now see on every graphic depiction of the spherical coronavirus structure. Not only is the spike protein the key that unlocks viral entry into a cell, it is also the part of the virus that is most frequently recognised by our immune systems, so understanding its shape and its function is critical to optimising vaccines. By the end of March, with many European countries in lockdown, Chinese scientists had mappedthe exact atom-by-atom structure of that spike protein,external. Knowing what the protein physically looks like means researchers can work out how antibodies bind to it. That is critical, because antibodies are the immune system's memory proteins. Immune cells produce antibodies to fit a specific invader - a virus that they have previously encountered in the form of a vaccine, perhaps. The antibodies then latch onto it and tag it for destruction. ""So this ultimately helps us design better vaccines,"" explained Dr Bailey. Throughout summer months in the northern hemisphere, lockdowns (temporarily and patchily) eased, but international tension did not. Even as US President Donald Trump sought to blame China for ""unleashing a plague"", scientists in the US and China carried on working together. By June, scientists from both countries hadcollaborated on more than 120 Covid-19 studies,external. President Jair Bolsanaro of Brazil, which remains one of the countries hit hardest by the pandemic, made baseless, very unscientific claims that Brazilians were somehow ""immune"" to the disease. Meanwhile, scientists there werereported to be subsidising their own Covid research,externalamid a national funding crisis. Political tensions flared between the US and China, but scientists from both countries continued to collaborate on Covid-19 research One large international effort, called theCovid-19 Host Genetics Initiative,external, saw investigators from research centres in Europe, Asia, and North America share data on how our own genes might affect how sick the coronavirus makes us. There is no single, simple answer to the question of why some people have no symptoms at all, while others are made extremely ill by Covid-19. But many of these efforts to solve that puzzle have focused on the ""lock"" on our cells that the virus uses to gain access. It is called the Ace-2 receptor. It is a biological lock that has evolved to be opened by chemical keys that occur naturally. That mechanism is fundamental to the biochemical machinery that is constantly whirring in healthy cells. Ace-2, for example, can be used as a cellular doorway by proteins that regulate our blood pressure. The coronavirus, however, has cleverly (and unfortunately) evolved to fit that same lock. Like every building block of our bodies, the exact shape and function of our Ace-2 receptors is written in our genes, giving researchers valuable clues about who is most vulnerable to Covid-19. A member of staff cares for a patient in the Intensive Care Unit of Royal Papworth Hospital, Cambridge, UK, May 2020 While there is no single coded clue to predict how sick we might be made by Covid, several studies of patients have spotteddifferences in the genetic blueprint for an individual's Ace-2 receptor,externalthat might be linked with the severity of their illness. One intriguing genetic study by German and Japanese scientists showed that agene that we inherited from Neanderthals provides the code for an extra  ""biological doorway"",externalthat the virus can use to hijack our cells. Examining the shape of the Ace-2 receptor in other species is also providing clues about other animals that might be susceptible to the coronavirus. That knowledge will be crucial in future efforts to control the disease and prevent new strains,like the one detected in farmed mink in Denmark,from triggering further outbreaks. Mink about to be killed on a farm at Jyllinge, Denmark, November 2020 In the midst of the pandemic, the search for any potential treatments relied, for the most part, on repurposing existing drugs. By examining treatments that were already proven safe, and by looking at the way they worked, researchers had reason to believe they had a good chance of tackling Covid. With no specific treatments available and thousands of patients critically ill, this was emergency medical research. In May, the UK launchedthe world's largest clinical trial, called Recovery,external, to test a group of existing treatments. There have been mixed results, but in June, this trial provided a breakthrough - the first evidence that dexamethasone, a cheap and widely available steroid, could reduce deaths from Covid-19. Another trial being carried out in six countries, including the UK, recently revealedanother two existing drugs that could save yet more lives. A woman wearing a mask reads a newspaper on a London Underground train, May 2020 In the long term, many scientists think we face a world where the coronavirus is always present in the global population at some level. ""So we'll also need new drugs to target not only this virus, but other related viruses that could spill over in the same way,"" Dr Stephen Griffin, a virologist from the University of Leeds, explains. One line of attack that looks particularly promising isa group of drugs called protease inhibitors,external. ""The main aim every virus has when it enters a cell is to hijack it and use the machinery inside to copy itself thousands and millions of times over,"" explains Dr Griffin. To do this, the virus tricks the cell into making its own viral building blocks, or proteins. Some of the most important viral proteins are made as one, long chain - like a long roll of tape. So the virus also makes an enzyme called a protease that snips the sections of tape it needs to build functioning copies of itself. ""Protease is critical for the virus to thrive and drugs targeting it prevent some of the earliest stages of infection - stopping the virus from copying itself,"" Dr Griffin explains. Similar drugs are already successfully used against protease enzymes from HIV and hepatitis C. Police and protesters at a mass rally against vaccination and government Covid-19 restrictions - Trafalgar Square, London, 26 September 2020 For many countries in the northern hemisphere, outbreaks resurged through autumn and into winter. Scientists have, meanwhile, tracked the virus's every move and every mutation. By taking a swab from an infected patient, the genetic code of the exact version of the virus that has infected them can be extracted, amplified and ""read"" using a sequencer, which is a machine that can translate biological code into a string of letters, or nucleotides. That allows whole genomes to be compared, so specific mutations can be spotted. ""There are also huge ongoing efforts to both track mutations and to assess their impact,"" Dr Lucy van Dorp from University College London (UCL) explains. It was ""thanks to these efforts, and to UK testing laboratories, that the recently discovered UK variant was flagged so quickly as a potential cause of concern"". Viruses mutate all the time, as they make copies of themselves in millions of infected bodies. But understanding which versions of the virus are spreading most quickly - spotting patterns in that spread - has informed public health responses and transformed contact tracing. In countries like New Zealand, where small, specific outbreaks have been found and brought under control, contact tracers can examine and compare genomes for clues. This is how so-called superspreading events are picked up - when a cluster of infections all share the same code. Researchers have now sequenced more than 250,000 Sars-CoV-2 genomes, which have been shared on open data platforms like Next Strain. ""This is all going to feed into the vaccine design, as well,"" says Prof Eddie Holmes, the Sydney-based scientist who put the first viral genome online. The mRNA vaccines, in particular, are easily adaptable with a new set of genetic instructions. Covid-19 vaccination in the refrigerator of a pharmacy laboratory in Warsaw, Poland, December 2020 Despite being able to watch it spread and evolve almost in real time, researchers still have not pinned down where the virus came from. Scientists agree that, like ebola, Mers and Sars1, the coronavirus originated in wildlife. But most experts also agree that the animal that the virus initially ""spilled over"" from was not in that Wuhan seafood market. Prof Holmes now thinks Wuhan was an ""amplification"" point for the virus, rather than being the origin. But there are different expert views on how the virus made the jump from bats to humans, and the lack of direct evidence currently makes solving that epidemiological puzzle almost impossible. Chinese officials have concluded the outbreak is likely to have begun elsewhere, and that the crowded market simply helped spread the disease from person to person. ""It could have come from almost anywhere in China, quite frankly,"" says Prof Holmes, ""because Wuhan is a major travel hub."" That outstanding mystery made it all the more disappointing for infectious disease experts when China recentlyblocked the entry of a WHO team that was poised to spend weeks examining the evidencefrom those earliest cases. But connecting all the threads - from the earliest known cases of Covid all the way back to the original source of the outbreak - could take years, not weeks. While the coronavirus genetic code still cannot tell us exactly how the pandemic started, it does show that the virus came from bats. Genetically similar viruses - probable coronavirus ancestors - have been found in colonies of bats elsewhere in China. Emerging disease researchers agree that these animals were the likely original ""reservoir"" for the disease. But there is a gap - possibly of decades of viral mutation and evolution - between those bat viruses and the one that is now still wreaking havoc among humans. Closely related coronaviruses have been found in horseshoe bats Dr Polly Hayes from the University of Westminster explains that the coronavirus could have been initially harmless when it made the first jump into humans ""then... evolved to become harmful as it passed from person to person"". To answer all of those remaining questions and to have a better chance of preventing the next pandemic, Prof Holmes stresses, channels of communication between scientists in every country must remain open. ""Politics can't come into it,"" he adds. ""Otherwise the world will be a far less safe place. I think preventing the next pandemic will be partly about fantastic, whizz-bang technology like genome sequencing and mRNA. ""But it's more importantly about people, scientists, talking to each other freely and openly."" Additional reporting by Helen Briggs.

LiveLiveAstraZeneca holding briefing after EU approves jab1 minute ago,"AstraZeneca says it is ""unprecedented"" the world has produced multiple vaccines in a year, after the EU approved its jab Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group, adds there is ""no reason"" to be concerned about using the vaccine on over-65s Some EU states are considering only giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-65s, citing a lack of data for its use on older age groups Meanwhile, a new coronavirus vaccine developed by Janssen prevents 66% of Covid cases after a single dose, the Belgian company says And another new vaccine, Novavax, is said to be the first to show in trials it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK Meanwhile, lockdown will continue in Wales for a further three weeks, First Minister Mark Drakeford says The UK's R rate - the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect - is now estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.1 Edited by Hamish Mackay Weâre ending todayâs live coverage here, but we'll be back tomorrow with more updates. Here are this eveningâs headlines:  The anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases is an ""appropriate"" time for people to thank all NHS workers, the head of the health service has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens praised treatment innovations on a visit to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on Friday. The hospital treated the UK's first two Covid-19 patients a year ago. The pair, a Chinese student and his mother, were in York when they fell ill with the virus. Sir Simon said: ""These are the staff here at this hospital in Newcastle who treated the first coronavirus patients in England a year ago. ""Since then, hospitals across the country have looked after more than 300,000 severely ill coronavirus patients so I do think, on this one year anniversary, it is appropriate for the whole country to say a huge thank you to every member of staff across the health service."" You can read more from Sir Simon here. The UK is ""carefully considering"" its next steps after the EU introduced export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under Northern Ireland's Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Cabinet Office minister Michael
Gove has spoken with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ to express
the UKâs concern over a lack of notification from the EU about its actions in
relation to the NI protocol. ""Gove told him the UK would now be carefully
considering next steps,"" Downing Street said in a statement. The incident happened at one of New Zealand's managed isolation hotels in Auckland An employee at a quarantine hotel in New Zealand has been sacked after what officials described as an inappropriate encounter with a person who should have been isolating. Officials say the pair shared notes, including one written on a face mask, before spending 20 minutes in a room together. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said it was ""unacceptable"": ""I didn't enquire specifically into the nature of the encounter, but the fact it was a 20-minute encounter, it was long enough for me to be unacceptable,"" he said. He added that the staff member had brought a bottle of wine to the room. People returning to New Zealand have to spend at least 14 days in isolation. The country has been hailed as one of the world's leaders in containing the virus. It has recorded 25 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Earlier this week, it reported its first case of Covid-19 outside of quarantine facilities in more than two months. Read more here.

American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan disembark at a US military base on 29 January 2020. In late January, a cargo aircraft carrying nearly 200 Americans - the first to be evacuated from Wuhan, China - landed at a military base in California. They were greeted by health officials who did not wear the proper protective gear and had also been advised to avoid the ""bad optics"" of wearing any. As civilians disembarked and began to quarantine at the base, there were no officials leading an effort to manage ""infection control and prevention measures"" and little PPE on hand for the officials present. Days later, these officials boarded commercial airlines and flew to other parts of the country. These details - initially the subject of a whistleblower complaint against the US health department - are the findings of a federal watchdog's investigation into how the US handled its first up-close encounter with the virus. The âmost troubling findingâ is that the handling of the 
Wuhan evacuees âincreased the risk of infection transmission not only to
 deployed [government] personnel, but also to the American public as a 
whole,â wrote lead investigator Henry Kerner in a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday. The US is now well past 25 million total cases of the virus. Over 433,000 Americans have died.

The Navy Times reports that 41 crew members aboard the USS Chafee have either been infected with the virus or been in close contact with sick shipmates. Sailors on board told The Times there has been a lack of ship-wide testing to identify more cases and a shortage of N95 masks. Some have used a single dirty mask for several days on end, according to one petty officer, who told the paper: ""We have asked for more, but they donât have enough."" ""When we kick back, we are either told to wear the 
dirty mask or face (non-judicial punishment)."" An official spokesman for the ship's fleet has however disputed the reporting and said: ""The ship remains able to meet its mission."" The warship - currently stationed in California - typically docks in Hawaii, which has seen over 25,000 cases of the virus and over 400 deaths. Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Cross-border travel with Northern Ireland and Britain makes a ""zero Covid"" strategy unlikely to work, an Irish expert says A senior member of the Republic of Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team hasrejected the ""zero Covid"" strategy advocated by opposition politicians. Those supporting the measure point to Australia and New Zealand's approach of suppressing the virus with much stricter lockdowns and rules on inbound travel. But Prof Philip Nolan said it was a ""false promise"" to say Ireland could go from the highest level of restrictions to the lowest levels ""in the space of weeks or months"" - adding that it ""won't happen"". Prof Nolan, who chairs the government's epidemiological modelling advisory group, said it ""would be an incredibly risky thing to do because we will inevitably be a leaky country and get re-introduction of the disease and that could easily be new variants"". The Irish government has always cited the open border with Northern Ireland and the lack of restriction on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as reasons why a zero Covid policy would be unlikely to work. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on non-essential airline travel in and out of the country. He says the countryâs main airlines have agreed to cancel service to âall Caribbeans destinations and Mexicoâ until the end of April. In addition, the government will mandate new testing and quarantine requirements for people returning to Canada. âNew variants of Covid-19 pose a real challenge to Canada,â
 says Mr Trudeau. âThatâs why we need to take extra measures.â It comes as media reports suggest Canadians are escaping to more sunny destinations amid the chilly and virus-afflicted winter. âWith the challenges we currently face with Covid-19, both here at home and abroad, we all agree that now is just not the time to be flying,"" says Mr Trudeau. That's all from the AstraZeneca press conference. Researchers are asked about comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, where he questioned how effective the vaccine was in over-65s. In response, Prof Pollard says there's ""good evidence"" to support the use of vaccine, including a strong immune response in older adults. He says there is much more limited data on efficacy in older adults but that doesn't mean there is necessarily a lack of protection. He adds ""everything points to the likelihood"" the vaccine will offer the same level of protection across all age groups. Prof Pollard says it is ""perhaps a misunderstanding"" of the data by the French president. Menelaos Pangolas, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D, is asked about the half dose of the vaccine that appeared to show better efficacy. Trials showed 62% effectiveness for two doses. But a subset of data showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. Pangolas says he is ""very confident"" with the dosing regimen they have, adding they are no longer needing to explore the half dose. He says hopefully when the data is published that will become apparent. Away from the AstraZeneca press conference, the EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines. The EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. It has therefore invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. You can read the full story here. The Associated Press asks Soriot whether the company will look at today with ""some regret"" given the disputes with the EU. He says ""a lot has been done"" to provide the vaccine to the bloc. Soriot says nine months ago the firm had nothing and the company is focused on supplying the EU, but everyone has to recognise it's ""a complicated process"". He says what has been done ""people take for granted"". It is not simple and is indeed very complicated, he says. ""We are really trying to catch up - there's not much more we can do."" Researchers are asked about the South African variant and its impact on vaccine efficacy. Prof Pollard says he doesn't have the data on what sort of effect the variant will have on the AstraZeneca vaccine. But he says he when you look at the changes in the spike protein caused by the variant, researchers would expect an ""impact on efficacy"" in vaccines. He says some of this has been shown in the data released in the last 24 hours for the Janssen and Novavax vaccines. But he says the ""really good news"" is if new vaccines do need to be made they can be done within a ""matter of months"". It's not like the situation a year ago, where it took a year of development, he says. He also says that although there are some concerns about new variants, it's still possible the current vaccines will be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalisation. AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot is asked about a problem with production of the vaccine at a factory in Belgium. He says the firm never mentions any of its partners, but adds that it has had ""teething issues"" in terms of the yield of vaccine at some of its production sites. ""We're talking about biology manufacturing here,"" he says, adding that making vaccines ""is extremely complicated"". ""It's not like doing an orange juice,"" he says. ""Everybody's on a learning curve, which usually you develop over year. We've had months. ""Some sites are more advanced."" He says the reasons for yield issues vary from site to site, but adds: ""We believe we have now fixed most of the issues and the productivity of the sites should improve rapidly over the next few months."" AstraZeneca is ""ready to launch"" its vaccine in the US as soon as it is approved by the regulator, the firm's chief executive says. Pascal Soriot says the firm has been working ""hand in hand"" with the US to manufacture the jab. Executive vice president Mene Pangolas says the US study is fully recruited and they are now waiting for enough Covid cases to be able to report their data. He says he imagines this will be in February. Asked whether he is concerned that some EU states are considering not giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to over 65s, Prof Andrew Pollard says ""there's no reason to be concerned about using it"". He stresses it ""can be used in all ages"", but adds that ""we have to respect how member states choose to use the vaccine"". Prof Pollard says the team is ""very confident in the data that we have"", adding that they have ""data showing that there's good immune response in older adults"". He also notes that trials are still running in the UK and Brazil, so ""there's a lot more data to come"". Asked by Alistair Smout of Reuters about Astra Zeneca's requirement to fulfil its ""best efforts"" to supply the vaccine to the EU, the company's chief executive officer Pascal Soriot says he is going to disappoint him with his reply. Soriot declines to answer and says he only wants to talk about the positive news of the deal to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the EU. Â© 2025 BBC.

Here are this eveningâs headlines:  The anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases is an ""appropriate"" time for people to thank all NHS workers, the head of the health service has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens praised treatment innovations on a visit to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on Friday. The hospital treated the UK's first two Covid-19 patients a year ago. The pair, a Chinese student and his mother, were in York when they fell ill with the virus. Sir Simon said: ""These are the staff here at this hospital in Newcastle who treated the first coronavirus patients in England a year ago. ""Since then, hospitals across the country have looked after more than 300,000 severely ill coronavirus patients so I do think, on this one year anniversary, it is appropriate for the whole country to say a huge thank you to every member of staff across the health service."" You can read more from Sir Simon here. The UK is ""carefully considering"" its next steps after the EU introduced export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under Northern Ireland's Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Cabinet Office minister Michael
Gove has spoken with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ to express
the UKâs concern over a lack of notification from the EU about its actions in
relation to the NI protocol. ""Gove told him the UK would now be carefully
considering next steps,"" Downing Street said in a statement. The incident happened at one of New Zealand's managed isolation hotels in Auckland An employee at a quarantine hotel in New Zealand has been sacked after what officials described as an inappropriate encounter with a person who should have been isolating. Officials say the pair shared notes, including one written on a face mask, before spending 20 minutes in a room together. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said it was ""unacceptable"": ""I didn't enquire specifically into the nature of the encounter, but the fact it was a 20-minute encounter, it was long enough for me to be unacceptable,"" he said. He added that the staff member had brought a bottle of wine to the room. People returning to New Zealand have to spend at least 14 days in isolation. The country has been hailed as one of the world's leaders in containing the virus. It has recorded 25 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Earlier this week, it reported its first case of Covid-19 outside of quarantine facilities in more than two months. Read more here. Andy Burnham with Matt Healy of the band The 1975 - in pre-social distancing times Record labels should help bail out small music venues struggling to survive the pandemic, Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham says. Burnham, a former culture secretary, is calling on the ""big players"" in music to pay a levy, just as football clubs do for grassroots facilities. The musicians who go on to sustain the industry often start in ""critical"" small venues, he says. The Music Venue Trust says 30 venues are at imminent risk of permanent closure because of the pandemic, with hundreds more in trouble. You can read more about Burnham's comments here. American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan disembark at a US military base on 29 January 2020. In late January, a cargo aircraft carrying nearly 200 Americans - the first to be evacuated from Wuhan, China - landed at a military base in California. They were greeted by health officials who did not wear the proper protective gear and had also been advised to avoid the ""bad optics"" of wearing any. As civilians disembarked and began to quarantine at the base, there were no officials leading an effort to manage ""infection control and prevention measures"" and little PPE on hand for the officials present. Days later, these officials boarded commercial airlines and flew to other parts of the country. These details - initially the subject of a whistleblower complaint against the US health department - are the findings of a federal watchdog's investigation into how the US handled its first up-close encounter with the virus. The âmost troubling findingâ is that the handling of the 
Wuhan evacuees âincreased the risk of infection transmission not only to
 deployed [government] personnel, but also to the American public as a 
whole,â wrote lead investigator Henry Kerner in a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday. The US is now well past 25 million total cases of the virus. Over 433,000 Americans have died.

He's been speaking to Radio 1 Newsbeat. The US Navy's warship USS Chafee Several sailors aboard a US Navy warship have tested positive for Covid. The Navy Times reports that 41 crew members aboard the USS Chafee have either been infected with the virus or been in close contact with sick shipmates. Sailors on board told The Times there has been a lack of ship-wide testing to identify more cases and a shortage of N95 masks. Some have used a single dirty mask for several days on end, according to one petty officer, who told the paper: ""We have asked for more, but they donât have enough."" ""When we kick back, we are either told to wear the 
dirty mask or face (non-judicial punishment)."" An official spokesman for the ship's fleet has however disputed the reporting and said: ""The ship remains able to meet its mission."" The warship - currently stationed in California - typically docks in Hawaii, which has seen over 25,000 cases of the virus and over 400 deaths. Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Cross-border travel with Northern Ireland and Britain makes a ""zero Covid"" strategy unlikely to work, an Irish expert says A senior member of the Republic of Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team hasrejected the ""zero Covid"" strategy advocated by opposition politicians. Those supporting the measure point to Australia and New Zealand's approach of suppressing the virus with much stricter lockdowns and rules on inbound travel. But Prof Philip Nolan said it was a ""false promise"" to say Ireland could go from the highest level of restrictions to the lowest levels ""in the space of weeks or months"" - adding that it ""won't happen"". Prof Nolan, who chairs the government's epidemiological modelling advisory group, said it ""would be an incredibly risky thing to do because we will inevitably be a leaky country and get re-introduction of the disease and that could easily be new variants"". The Irish government has always cited the open border with Northern Ireland and the lack of restriction on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as reasons why a zero Covid policy would be unlikely to work. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on non-essential airline travel in and out of the country. He says the countryâs main airlines have agreed to cancel service to âall Caribbeans destinations and Mexicoâ until the end of April. In addition, the government will mandate new testing and quarantine requirements for people returning to Canada. âNew variants of Covid-19 pose a real challenge to Canada,â
 says Mr Trudeau. âThatâs why we need to take extra measures.â It comes as media reports suggest Canadians are escaping to more sunny destinations amid the chilly and virus-afflicted winter. âWith the challenges we currently face with Covid-19, both here at home and abroad, we all agree that now is just not the time to be flying,"" says Mr Trudeau. That's all from the AstraZeneca press conference. Researchers are asked about comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, where he questioned how effective the vaccine was in over-65s. In response, Prof Pollard says there's ""good evidence"" to support the use of vaccine, including a strong immune response in older adults. He says there is much more limited data on efficacy in older adults but that doesn't mean there is necessarily a lack of protection. He adds ""everything points to the likelihood"" the vaccine will offer the same level of protection across all age groups. Prof Pollard says it is ""perhaps a misunderstanding"" of the data by the French president. Menelaos Pangolas, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D, is asked about the half dose of the vaccine that appeared to show better efficacy.

Minister: Debate on Empire and BLM 'cartoon-like',"Kwasi Kwarteng said Brexit offered the chance to strengthen rights, not erode them. Debate about Britain's imperial past and the Black Lives Matter movement has a ""cartoon-like view"" of history, Kwasi Kwarteng has told the BBC. The business secretary, the first black MP to head a department, toldNick Robinson's Political Thinkingthe Empire must be seen in its 400-year context and arguments fully explored. Calls to ""de-colonise"" the curriculum were not the way forward, he added. ""I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism."" British institutions have faced growing calls in recent years to account for their colonial links and wealth they accrued directly as a result of the British Empire and the Atlantic Slave trade. During anti-racism protests last summer following the death of George Floyd in the US, the statue of slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston was toppled by protesters in Bristol and a number of others were removed. Mr Kwarteng, whose parents moved from Ghana to the UK in the 1960s, said ""ripping down"" statues was counter-productive, as well as illegal, and people should ""learn more"" about the British Empire in all its various facets. ""I'm not someone who is obsessed with trying to correct history. I think you've got to understand history and understand that it's very complex and there are different arguments that are presented and I have a plea to understand the arguments and the context of the British Empire,"" he said. Statues to get protection from 'baying mobs' Sharma leaves business job to focus on climate role ""Even when you say the phrase the British Empire, you're talking about something that lasted more or less 400 years and covered a huge expanse of territory. ""So within that time and geography there's a huge amount of variety, different cultures and different time periods and getting a sensitivity to that is hugely important. ""I think a lot of the debate around Black Lives Matter and imperialism or colonialism has a very kind of cartoon-like view of what was happening over centuries across a quarter of the world."" He said he did not understand what those calling for university and school curriculums to be ""de-colonised"" were trying to achieve. ""Is the implication that it's a colonial relic and that you've got to try and decolonise it? I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism."" During the interview, Mr Kwarteng also explained whyhe put a stop to a post-Brexit review of workers' rightsand employment practices when he took over at the business department three weeks ago. ""I don't think that's a constructive thing to do. I don't think the opportunities of Brexit are about whittling away workers' rights or trying to have a race to the bottom or trying to reduce wages. On the contrary, a lot of people in my constituency voted for Brexit because of a stagnation of wages."" Mr Kwarteng was one of the authors of a 2012 series of essays, called Britannia Unchained, which suggested the UK did not encourage risk-taking and must strive to emulate the work ethic and low-tax culture of Singapore and other Asian successful economies. Pressed on whether he still holds to pro-free market views on deregulation or whether he supported a more interventionist role for the state, Mr Kwarteng said 2021 was very different from 2012, let alone previous decades. ""We've had a huge amount of money spent rightly to support businesses and people in employment. We've got a net zero agenda, which says we've got to decarbonise our economy in 30 years, and we've got a Brexit deal which is going to set us on a totally different course in terms of international trade. All of these mean that we can't simply apply the orthodoxies of 30 or 40 years ago to the context in which we now live or even five or six years ago.' He added: ""You can't simply go back to the Milton Friedman and Margaret Thatcher playbook of the 1970s and 1980s of deregulation and apply that.'

Novavax Covid jab shows 89% efficacy in UK trials,"Biotech firm Novavax has labs in the US (pictured) and has carried out trials in the UK and South Africa A new coronavirus vaccine has been shown to be 89% effective in large-scale UK trials. The Novavax jab is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said. The UK has secured 60 million doses of the jab, which will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England. Meanwhile,a single-dose vaccine developed by Janssen is 66% effective, trial results have shown. Janssen, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson, is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The company said its initial findings showed one dose prevented 85% of severe cases. Both the Novavax and Janssen jabs will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. EU chief wants AstraZeneca jab contract published When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery The PM welcomed the ""good news"", with doses of the Novavax jab expected to be delivered in the second half of this year if approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the government said. The UK has so far approved three coronavirus vaccines for emergency use - one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, another by Pfizer and BioNTech, and a third from drug firm Moderna. The Novavax jab, which is given in two doses, was shown to be 89.3% effective at preventing Covid-19 in participants in its Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK, and around 86% effective at protecting against the new UK variant. The jab's efficacy against the original Covid-19 strainwas calculated to be 95.6%,external. The Phase 3 trials - the final stage before a vaccine is looked at by a regulator - enrolled more than 15,000 people aged between 18-84, of whom 27% were older than 65, US firm Novavax said. In the South African part of the trial, where most of the cases were the South African variant of the virus, the vaccine was 60% effective among those without HIV. Stan Erck, chief executive of Novavax, said the results from the UK trial were ""spectacular"" and ""as good as we could have hoped"", while the efficacy in South Africa was ""above people's expectations"". He told the BBC the manufacturing plant in Stockton-on-Tees should be up and running by March or April, with the company hoping to get approval for the vaccine from the MHRA around the same time. This video can not be played Novavax chief executive: UK trial results are ""spectacular"" Minister Lucy Frazer told BBC Breakfast the government could not put an exact timeframe on when the Novavax jab might be approved as the regulation process is ""out of our control"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the new vaccine would be ""another weapon in our arsenal to beat this awful virus"", if approved. Prof Paul Heath, chief investigator of the UK Novavax trial, said the trial findings were ""enormously exciting"", particularly because of the jab's efficacy against the UK variant. These extremely encouraging trial results suggest another powerful vaccine against coronavirus could soon be within reach. It works in a slightly different way to the ones that are already available - but does the same job of teaching the body's immune system to recognise and fight the pandemic virus. What is more, it appears to be effective against emerging and more infectious variants of coronavirus too - something scientists have feared might not be possible because the vaccines were all designed to match the original virus, not these new, mutated versions. Protection against illness from the new UK variant was high - around 86%. Even with the South Africa variant, which has undergone the most worrisome changes, it offered a level of protection similar to that given by flu shots against influenza. England's chief medical officerProf Chris Whitty said,external, if the jab is approved, it ""increases our future resilience"" against the virus. Nadhim Zahawi, the UK minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said he was ""particularly thrilled"" to see the positive results as he had taken part in Novavax's trials himself. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? In total,the UK has ordered100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 40 million of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - both are currently being rolled out in the UK. Another 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which was approved by the MHRA in early January, are expected in the spring. The aim is to give everyone in the top four priority groups - up to 15 million people - a first dose by mid-February. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines rely on technology that has not been used in previous vaccines, but the Novavax jab uses a more traditional method of recreating part of the spike protein of the virus to stimulate the immune system. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial Like the Oxford vaccine, the Novavax jab can be stored at regular fridge temperature - which means it can be distributed more easily. More than 7.4 million people in the UK have so far received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine,according to the latest government figures.,external Meanwhile,the latest estimate for the UK's R rate,externalfrom the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1. The latest growth rate range is between -5% and 0%, indicating that the number of new infections is broadly flat or shrinking by up to 5% every day. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Separately, the EU's vaccine contract with AstraZenecahas been published, in a growing row over reduced supplies of their jab. Kate Bingham, who used to chair the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, said the reason the UK had a good supply of vaccines compared with other countries was because of its ability to get clinical trials completed quickly and at a high standard through the NHS's registry - with some 400,000 volunteers signing up ""before the US even started their Phase 3 studies"". The UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.

NI Protocol 'obstructs free movement of military'The UUP says the MoD must now fill out customs declaration forms to move equipment.Northern IrelandBreaking|Breaking newsEU drugs regulator approves AstraZeneca vaccineThe European Medicines Agency approves use of the AstraZeneca Covid vaccine for people across the bloc.Europe,"Doug Beattie said a customs form will be needed to move army equipment from GB to NI The government is facing fresh criticism over the Northern Ireland Protocol amid warnings it obstructs the ""free movement"" of the military. The Ulster Unionist Party has said that, under the protocol, the MoD must now give 15 days notice and fill out customs declaration forms before it moves equipment from GB to NI. It also said Nato has to be notified about the move. But the Ministry of Defence insists its NI operations will not be affected. Ulster Unionist MLA and former Army officer Doug Beattie said it is ""ludicrous where UK armed forces cannot move around the UK with equipment without permission"". In a letter to Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, he called for urgent action to ""protect military operations"" in Northern Ireland. He wrote that ""military equipment, and in some cases personnel, cannot be moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland unless they complete a customs form"". ""More worryingly, there will also be a need to complete a Nato form before any movement takes place,"" Mr Beattie added. The days of heavy duty military hardware rolling into Northern Ireland are long gone. But the military still provides support to the PSNI against the threat from paramilitaries under Operation Helvetic. It also has two bases used for training soldiers. But one military source said much of the equipment needed is already here, hence the MoD statement insisting its operations will not be affected by the new protocol arrangements. Though, for some unionists, the very thought of the military having to give notice and fill out forms before moving equipment from one part of the UK to another is a bitter pill. For them it is much more than a paper exercise. ""This Nato form is usually for the movement of UK forces and their equipment around the globe, but in this instance it is to allow UK forces to move within the confines of our own country. ""This is quite incredible and I simply cannot believe that any UK government would tolerate such a situation."" Mr Beattie told the secretary of state if the ""barriers"" cannot be removed, then Mr Lewis must invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The clause allows the EU or UK to ""unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures"", if the application of the protocol is triggering ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist"" or trade friction. First Minister Arlene Foster told Good Morning Ulster it was ""another example of the hundreds of problems with the protocol which we (the DUP) vehemently opposed"". ""We find it and its outworkings offensive,"" she said. ""No sovereign country should have barriers to trade and customs arrangements placed within it,"" she added. She said she had spoken to Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, who was ""concerned about the principle and sovereignty of the UK"". She added that they would be working on ""not just the function but on the principle - that the UK military has to be able to work at speed within its own jurisdiction"". It is understood one of the documents required is a form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"" Mr Beattie has also raised his concerns with the Armed Forces Minister James Heappey. Military on duty in wards to help ease pressures Brexit means NI eels can't be sold in Britain What will happen in Northern Ireland after Brexit? It is understood one of the documents required is a Nato 302 form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"". According to the EU Customs Transit regulations covering Nato and other military activities, the 302 form is used for a number of reasons, including ""temporary admission in the EU"". But an MoD spokesperson said: ""The Northern Ireland Protocol has not placed any limitations on the Ministry of Defence's ability to conduct operations.""

Watchdog fires warning as GameStop frenzy spreads,"This video can not be played AOC calls the GameStop saga ""a weird collision of social forces and economic factors"" Regulators have fired warning shots over frenzied share dealing in GameShop and other firms fuelled by social media chat on sites like Reddit and Facebook. Watchdogs in the US and UK said they were monitoring activity and potential lawbreaking, and warned traders they risked facing huge losses. Traders should ensure they are familiar with all rules, ""including market abuse"", the UK's regulator said. GameStop is the focus of a trading war between amateurs and Wall Street pros. This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? Shares in the US bricks-and-mortar video games retailer surged again on Friday, ending 68% higher. Another stock in the traders' sights, AMC Entertainment, jumped 54%. That bucked broader market trends, which saw all three main US indexes fall roughly 2%. For the week they were down more than 3% - the biggest weekly decline since October. Some share trading firms temporarily halted dealings on Thursday amid extreme volatility in GameStop, which has soared as much as 700% in the past week. AMC Entertainment and Blackberry, which have also seen huge trading activity, were among the other companies also hit by the restrictions. UK traders have also been sharing their thoughts and tips on trading chat forums amid mounting concerns about misinformation and share ramping. London-listed companies have also been the focus of social media attention, including publisher Pearson and cinema operator Cineworld, although the share price movements were minimal compared with the GameStop surge. Anger as trading in GameStop shares is restricted Confused investors inundate Robin Hood society GameStop: What is it and why is it trending? In a statement on Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said: ""The FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks. ""Firms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in."" The retailer has made heavy losses as games sales moved online In the US, the US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) warned against illegal ""manipulative trading activity"". The regulator added: ""Our core market infrastructure has proven resilient under the weight of this week's extraordinary trading volumes. ""Nevertheless, extreme stock price volatility has the potential to expose investors to rapid and severe losses and undermine market confidence."" The SEC also said it would review actions that could ""unduly inhibit"" and ""disadvantage investors"". The war between amateur private investors and heavyweight firms like hedge funds centres on so-called short selling. Over recent months, hedge funds had made big bets that shares in loss-making GameStop would fall. But an army of private investors, swapping tips on social media, spotted a chance for a buying frenzy that would push up the price and ""squeeze"" the hedge fund short sellers. Many private traders made profits - and losses - along the way, but their actions also dealt a big financial blow to hedge funds that spent billions of dollars gambling GameStop's shares would tumble. The decision on Thursday by several brokerages to halt purchases of shares in Gamestop and some other firms  sparked outrage among investors, who accused the companies of working on behalf of traditional Wall Street investors who were losing out to the army of amateurs. Some disgruntled investors said they were preparing legal action. Investor anger over their temporary ban from trading spread beyond the investment community, with rappers and US politicians on both sides of the Washington divide joining the backlash against Wall Street. ""This is unacceptable,"" tweeted Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat. ""We now need to know more about @RobinhoodApp's decision to block retail investors from purchasing stock while hedge funds are freely able to trade the stock as they see fit."" Her tweet was shared by Republican Senator Ted Cruz who commented ""fully agree."" Tesla founder Elon Musk, whose shares have also been a retail favourite, also commented on Ms Ocasio-Cortez's tweet, saying ""Absolutely"". Much of the anger was directed atRobinhood, a new breed of broker popular among a new generation of younger, tech-savvy investor, but which has been accused of ""gamifying"" share trading. On Friday, a Robinhood chat forum on Facebook was also removed for breaking its Community Standards rules, although the social media giant did not expand on the reasons. After the backlash, Robinhood late Thursday said it would ease the restrictions. The firm also said it had raised more than $1bn from existing investors to bolster its finances amid questions about strains caused by the buying frenzy. But Senator Elizabeth Warren, a Democrat known as a supporter of tougher financial rules, said the chaos was another sign of ""years of distortion in securities markets that have allowed the wealthy few to artificially inflate and deflate share prices and reap short-term profits while exacerbating wealth inequality"". She said regulators must review the trades and make changes to ensure that markets ""reflect real value, rather than the highly leveraged bets of wealthy traders or those who seek to inflict financial damage on those traders"". Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment firm such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall. The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses - a process known as covering. However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still.

Hotel porter sentenced over fatal fire,"Aerial photographs show the extent of the damage to Cameron House A Scottish luxury hotel has been fined half a million pounds over a fire that claimed the lives of two guests. Cameron House has been ordered to pay Â£500,000 after admitting to breaches of fire safety rules. A hotel porter has also been given a community payback order to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Richard Dyson, 38, and his partner Simon Midgley, 32, died in the hotel blaze on the banks of Loch Lomond in December 2017. The fire started after night porter Christopher O'Malley, 35, placed a plastic bag of ash in a cupboard containing kindling and newspapers. O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. Christopher O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act Sheriff William Gallacher said the families of Mr Dyson and Mr Midgley will ""always endure the heartbreak"" caused by the fire. Cameron Housepreviously pleaded guiltyto two charges of failing to take fire safety measures which were necessary to ensure the safety of staff and guests. Survivor Hannah Munns, who was in the room next to the couple, said she felt ""ignored and angry"" after the sentencing. Ms Munns toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""Two men have lost their lives, many families have been impacted and they (Cameron House) continue to trade. They are barely going to notice it."" She also criticised the lack of communication since the blaze and said she could not make sense of O'Malley's ""ridiculous"" actions. But Ms Munns added she felt more aggrieved at the fine handed down to Cameron House. She said: ""That's nothing. No lessons will be learned from that. Nothing will change as a result of that. ""It just feels like no-one has taken it very seriously. I am just in shock, really. It is almost saying our lives don't matter."" Richard Dyson, left, and Simon Midgley, right, who both died, had been on a winter break in Scotland Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie said the fire had been devastating for the victims' families. The Scottish Labour interim leader spoke to Mr Midgley's mother, Jane, after the sentencing and said she remains ""heartbroken"". Ms Baillie added: ""What we heard today, in the context of two young men losing their lives, does not seem enough to her. ""We have a major hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond that failed to heed the advice given to them by the fire brigade and others. ""The deaths of these two young men did not need to happen at all."" Dumbarton Sheriff Court heard staff were not properly trained in the safe disposal of ash and no written procedures were in place. That was contrary to recommendations made in two fire risk assessments carried out by an independent company in 2016 and 2017. There was no safe system for emptying the ash bins outside the hotel, which is next to Loch Lomond. The day before the fatal fire, O'Malley had discovered they were both full. They had not been emptied since October 2017, two months before the 18 December blaze. In August 2017, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service told managers not to store combustibles - like kindling and newspapers - in the concierge cupboard, but staff continued to do so. This video can not be played CCTV captures moment hotel fire takes hold Peter Gray QC, acting for Cameron House, said the failings were not deliberate breaches but occurred ""as a result of genuine errors"". He also told the court the fire had gone undetected for a long period before being discovered, and that the hotel had a ""suite of measures in place"" to deal with fire safety. Sheriff William Gallacher also heard of an incident three nights before the fatal fire, when O'Malley and another night porter were told not to put ash into plastic bags because it was a fire hazard. Mr Gray said it was therefore ""extremely difficult to understand"" why O'Malley did not follow this guidance on the night of the fire. Fatal hotel fire caused by ash left in cupboard Couple killed in hotel fire named Mum 'tortured' by son's death in hotel fire After the sentencing, Alistair Duncan, head of the Health and Safety Investigation Unit, said: ""The failings on the part of Cameron House Resort and Christopher O'Malley led to the deaths of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson. ""This incident should serve as a reminder to other companies that failure to implement the necessary fire safety measures can have terrible consequences."" Stuart Stevens, assistant chief officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said the ""needless loss of two lives"" could have been prevented. Det Insp Stuart Grainger from Police Scotland said: ""While nothing will ever diminish the pain of their loss, we hope that the conclusion of this case brings at least a small measure of comfort."" The interior of the hotel reception where the fire started in the concierge cupboard The court was previously told O'Malley, of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, deeply regretted his actions and they were not deliberate. More than 200 guests were staying in the hotel when an initial fire alarm sounded at about 06:40. O'Malley opened the door and flames took hold, spreading to the hall. He and two others tried to fight the blaze with fire extinguishers, but were overcome by the flames. The overflowing ash bins outside the luxury hotel Firefighters arrived within 10 minutes to find a ""well-developed"" fire in the mansion, which is near Balloch in West Dunbartonshire. It was after 08:00 when it was discovered that Mr Dyson, 38, and Mr Midgley, 32, were missing. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus found Mr Dyson on a landing at the top of a staircase. Mr Midgley was lying in a fire escape passageway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Mr Dyson was taken to hospital, where he was also pronounced dead. Post-mortem examinations said the men's causes of death had been inhalation of smoke and fire gases. The couple had travelled from London, and were staying at the five-star resort as the final stop on their winter break to Scotland.

'Stansted 15' win appeal against convictionsThe protesters locked themselves around a plane that was deporting people from the UK.Essex,"The ""Stansted 15"" tried to stop an aircraft being used to deport people to Africa (one of the 15 did not make the photo call in time) Protesters who broke into Stansted Airport to stop a plane deporting people to Africa have won an appeal against their convictions. The group, known as the Stansted 15, cut through the perimeter fence and locked themselves together around a Boeing 767 jet in 2017. They were convicted of theintentional disruption of services at an aerodrome. The Lord Chief Justice said they ""should not have been prosecuted for the extremely serious offence"". A spokesman for the Crown Prosecution Service said: ""We will consider the judgment carefully in the next 28 days."" The jet they surrounded in March 2017 had been chartered by the Home Office to transport people from UK detention centres for repatriation to Nigeria, Ghana and Sierra Leone. The protesters put their arms inside pipes which were then filled with expandable foam, and secured themselves around the nose wheel and wing of the aircraft, the court was told during their trial. They were convicted under the Aviation and Maritime Security Act (Amsa) 1990. In February 2019, three were given suspended jail sentences, and the other 12 were handed community orders. Amnesty International placards were held up outside Chelmsford Crown Court during the trial Sitting with Mr Justice Jay and Mrs Justice Whipple, Lord Burnett said the protesters' ""conduct did not satisfy the various elements of the offence"". ""There was, in truth, no case to answer,"" he said. ""We recognise that the various summary-only offences with which the appellants were originally charged, if proved, might well not reflect the gravity of their actions. ""That, however, does not allow the use of an offence which aims at conduct of a different nature. ""All the appellants' convictions must be quashed."" Six members of the ""Stansted 15"" were photographed outside the court on the first day of the appeal hearing At the appeal hearing in November, lawyers for the activists argued the legislation used to convict the 15 is rarely used and not intended for this type of case. The Stansted 15's barristers argued that the Amsa law is intended to deal with violence of the ""utmost seriousness"", such as terrorism, not demonstrators. 'Stansted 15' counter-terrorism appeal begins Protesters 'tried to stop deportees dying' 'Stansted 15' surrounded deportation jet Lord Burnett said in the judgement that it could not be established on the evidence in the case that the group's actions caused disruption which was ""likely to endanger"" the safe operation of the airport or the safety of people there. After the judgment was published, one of the protesters, Lyndsay Burtonshaw, tweeted: ""We got the judgement from our appeal for our terrorism-related conviction for the #Stansted15 action. WE WON!"" The Court of Appeal's judgment in favour of the 15 underlines a fundamental safeguard in the law: You can only be prosecuted for something you've actually done - and that means the evidence has to fit the wording of the offence. The crime the 15 were charged with had its genesis in the need to protect airports from terrorism - yet the prosecution didn't suggest at the trial that the incident was remotely that kind of attack. And the protesters insisted that despite their plan to stop the flight, they never intended to do anything that was likely to endanger safety at the airport. The three senior judges agreed that this critical test had not been met and so the prosecution was unjustified. The 15 may have created a health-and-safety risk by going onto the airport tarmac - but that was well below a genuinely dangerous situation that would have justified charging them with this very serious offence. In a statement on behalf of the group, May MacKeith, one of the protesters, said: ""The nightmare of this bogus charge, a 10-week trial and the threat of prison has dominated our lives for four years. ""Despite the draconian response we know our actions were justified. ""Eleven people, including survivors of trafficking, who would have been deported that night are still in the UK. ""Mothers, fathers, colleagues, friends and family members are rebuilding lives the Government attempted to destroy."" The 15 are: Helen Brewer, 31; Lyndsay Burtonshaw, 30; Nathan Clack, 32; Laura Clayson, 30; Melanie Evans, 37; Joseph McGahan, 37; Benjamin Smoke, 29; Jyotsna Ram, 35; Nicholas Sigsworth, 31; Melanie Strickland, 37; Alistair Tamlit, 32; Edward Thacker, 31; Emma Hughes, 40; May MacKeith, 35; and Ruth Potts, 46.

"Man 'felt degraded' by 'power-hungry' Covid policeA force apologises over viral footage of an officer calling him an idiot amid ""lock up"" threats.Birmingham & Black Country","This video can not be played Video of 'power hungry' male police officer goes viral A man said he felt degraded after being detained in a police car when challenged on his way to work by an officer citing Covid legislation. His video of the events in Solihull on Wednesday has been viewed more than a million times on Twitter. It shows Nino Romano, 21, questioned on his plans, before he is called an idiot and threatened with ""locking up"". West Midlands Police said the officer's actions were ""unacceptable"" and there was no suspicion of any offence. Mr Romano accused him of being ""power-hungry"". The force said it had reviewed both the footage and police camera video of the challenge to Mr Romano and concluded ""conduct fell far below what we would expect"". A spokesperson added: ""[The officer's] manner was not acceptable, not the face of [the force] and we will deal with the situation."" The male officer was with a colleague and their duties were to ensure people adhered to Covid restrictions, police said. Footage shows him asking Mr Romano what he is up to and where he lives - information readily shared by the 21-year-old, who says he is going to work. But matters take a turn when Mr Romano - on his way to catch a train to his job in nearby Birmingham - refuses to give police his name.

West Midlands Police said: ""[Mr Romano] explained he was heading to work - that's clearly a justifiable reason to be out and about and there was no suspicion he had committed any offences."" Mr Romano said when put into the police car he eventually gave his name, and was released without being formally arrested. But he said the episode had left him ""annoyed"", and accused the officer of being ""power hungry"". He said: ""I've just got used to it, that's how the police act to the younger generation. ""I think they targeted me because of the clothes I was wearing - a tracksuit and a coat. ""I'm going to carry on going to work, but the fact they feel entitled to stop people [is] a bit degrading; it's not nice at all. ""There were so many people around, why pick me?"" In the video, the officer says that under virus legislation Mr Romano must provide his details, otherwise he will be arrested. He is then threatened with ""locking up"". Mr Romano accuses the officer of harassment, and suggests he has been targeted due to his hoodie, and adds he takes issue with someone pulling him over. ""We're the police, we're not just someone, you idiot,"" the officer says. Mr Romano then states ""just 'cause you're the police that gives you the right to stop anyone you want and get their details?"", to which the officer says ""yes"". On saying the officer needed to be ""re-informed"" about the law, Mr Romano is put into a police car and told the matter will be settled in a police station.

West Midlands Police said: ""[Mr Romano] explained he was heading to work - that's clearly a justifiable reason to be out and about and there was no suspicion he had committed any offences."" Mr Romano said when put into the police car he eventually gave his name, and was released without being formally arrested. But he said the episode had left him ""annoyed"", and accused the officer of being ""power hungry"". He said: ""I've just got used to it, that's how the police act to the younger generation. ""I think they targeted me because of the clothes I was wearing - a tracksuit and a coat. ""I'm going to carry on going to work, but the fact they feel entitled to stop people [is] a bit degrading; it's not nice at all. ""There were so many people around, why pick me?"" In the video, the officer says that under virus legislation Mr Romano must provide his details, otherwise he will be arrested. He is then threatened with ""locking up"". Mr Romano accuses the officer of harassment, and suggests he has been targeted due to his hoodie, and adds he takes issue with someone pulling him over. ""We're the police, we're not just someone, you idiot,"" the officer says. Mr Romano then states ""just 'cause you're the police that gives you the right to stop anyone you want and get their details?"", to which the officer says ""yes"". On saying the officer needed to be ""re-informed"" about the law, Mr Romano is put into a police car and told the matter will be settled in a police station.

Data shows Covid outbreaks in offices in lockdown,"More than 60 suspected Covid outbreaks in offices were recorded in the first two weeks of the current lockdown in England, a BBC investigation has found. Under England's lockdown rules, in force since 6 January, people should work from home if they can. Public Health England figures, obtained via a Freedom of Information request, suggests offices have had more outbreaks compared to other workplaces. The government has urged firms to help employees work from home. It said it has worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to  produce ""comprehensive guidance"" to help firms that are permitted to stay open and it has introduced rapid testing of employees. Can my boss force me to go to work? What are the UK's lockdown rules and when will they end? 'My boss made me come to work and I caught Covid' The data from Public Health England, obtained by the 5 Live Investigations team, lists the different types of workplaces where there have been clusters of cases. The figures reveal for the first time which are the most susceptible to Covid outbreaks, with offices coming top. The data showed there were more than 500 outbreaks, or suspected outbreaks, in offices in the second half of 2020 - more than in supermarkets, construction sites, warehouses, restaurants and cafes combined. This has prompted calls for curbs on employers bringing non-essential staff into offices as well as demands from unions for tougher safety rules. The rules for Englandstate that ""you may only leave your home for work if you cannot reasonably work from home"". The list of people who may still travel to work,externalincludes healthcare professionals, teachers, childcare providers, transport workers, people who work in construction or manufacturing, funeral directors, and essential retail workers. However, the Health and Safety Executivereceived nearly 4,000 Covid-related complaintsabout workplaces in January. ""It's likely I got ill at work,"" says call centre worker Dan, not his real name, who contracted Covid this month and passed the virus to his girlfriend. He works in the Bristol office of outsourcing firm Woven - where he says up to 30 people can work on his floor. He says they hot-desk, share toilets and the windows are always closed. Many of his colleagues have worked in the office throughout the pandemic and several have had Covid, Dan says. ""We've had five or six cases in the office and still everybody is being asked to come into work to answer calls,"" he says. Woven said it had been working on its IT infrastructure for several months to allow more employees to work from home. ""Our primary concern is the health and wellbeing of our colleagues,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have worked closely with Public Health England since the start of the pandemic to implement extensive safety measures in line with government advice."" Although clinically vulnerable workers have been told not to attend work, their family members have no such protection. Michelle, not her real name, works in an office for Greater Manchester Police, where she says there have been multiple Covid cases. ""If I bring Covid into my house, there's a very real chance that my partner wouldn't survive,"" says Michelle, whose husband is vulnerable. ""It's extremely stressful for him as well as for me."" The office she works in is small and stuffy, she says, with police officers coming in and out throughout the day. ""I just stepped out of the office, and when I came back, somebody was sitting at the workstation on the computer and using the phone with no mask,"" Michelle says. ""I was really angry and very upset."" Michelle, who was not expected to come in during last year's first national lockdown - when people could only travel to work if it was ""absolutely necessary"" - cannot do her job from home. She feels it is unfair that she is made to work in the office because of the risk posed to her husband. ""I perceive myself to be vulnerable due to the fact that I have a vulnerable partner,"" she says. In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said the health safety of its workers was a priority and it had taken a ""proactive approach to keep our officers and staff safe in the workplace"". The force said it follows the latest government advice regarding staff living with vulnerable people and is doing all it can to try to support them. All of its buildings are ""Covid-secure"", the statement added, and staff can raise any concerns in a number of ways. Prof Phil Taylor, who has spent years researching call centre and office work, says offices provide the perfect environment for Covid to spread. ""They have high occupational densities with little social distancing and are often sealed, with air con just recirculating pathogens like Covid,"" said Prof Taylor, from the University of Strathclyde. ""Hot-desking is commonplace and cleansing is hit and miss. It's a toxic combination."" In a modern building where the windows are sealed, occupants rely on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building. The professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply - but the mix of outside and inside air will be determined by the building's managers. Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Prof Cath Noakes, who sits on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee, said poorly ventilated offices could increase the chances of contracting Covid from tiny airborne particles by up to 70%. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Everyone has the right to be safe at work. But Boris Johnson and his ministers have failed to get a grip on Covid safety in workplaces."" Labour called on the government  to ""urgently"" strengthen workplace safety rules. ""To help prevent the spread of the virus, the government must clarify the stay at home message, rewrite outdated workplace safety rules and strengthen health and safety enforcement,"" Labour's shadow secretary for employment rights and protections Andy McDonald said. A government spokesperson said: ""We continue to reinforce the stay at home messaging to businesses and the overwhelming majority are doing the right thing, but we need all employers to act responsibly and take every possible step to help their employees work from home.""

Novavax Covid jab shows 89% efficacy in UK trialsThe vaccine is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the UK variant of the virus.UK,"Biotech firm Novavax has labs in the US (pictured) and has carried out trials in the UK and South Africa A new coronavirus vaccine has been shown to be 89% effective in large-scale UK trials. The Novavax jab is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said. The UK has secured 60 million doses of the jab, which will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England. Meanwhile,a single-dose vaccine developed by Janssen is 66% effective, trial results have shown. Janssen, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson, is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The company said its initial findings showed one dose prevented 85% of severe cases. Both the Novavax and Janssen jabs will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. EU chief wants AstraZeneca jab contract published When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery The PM welcomed the ""good news"", with doses of the Novavax jab expected to be delivered in the second half of this year if approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the government said. The UK has so far approved three coronavirus vaccines for emergency use - one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, another by Pfizer and BioNTech, and a third from drug firm Moderna. The Novavax jab, which is given in two doses, was shown to be 89.3% effective at preventing Covid-19 in participants in its Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK, and around 86% effective at protecting against the new UK variant. The jab's efficacy against the original Covid-19 strainwas calculated to be 95.6%,external. The Phase 3 trials - the final stage before a vaccine is looked at by a regulator - enrolled more than 15,000 people aged between 18-84, of whom 27% were older than 65, US firm Novavax said. In the South African part of the trial, where most of the cases were the South African variant of the virus, the vaccine was 60% effective among those without HIV. Stan Erck, chief executive of Novavax, said the results from the UK trial were ""spectacular"" and ""as good as we could have hoped"", while the efficacy in South Africa was ""above people's expectations"". He told the BBC the manufacturing plant in Stockton-on-Tees should be up and running by March or April, with the company hoping to get approval for the vaccine from the MHRA around the same time. This video can not be played Novavax chief executive: UK trial results are ""spectacular"" Minister Lucy Frazer told BBC Breakfast the government could not put an exact timeframe on when the Novavax jab might be approved as the regulation process is ""out of our control"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the new vaccine would be ""another weapon in our arsenal to beat this awful virus"", if approved. Prof Paul Heath, chief investigator of the UK Novavax trial, said the trial findings were ""enormously exciting"", particularly because of the jab's efficacy against the UK variant. These extremely encouraging trial results suggest another powerful vaccine against coronavirus could soon be within reach. It works in a slightly different way to the ones that are already available - but does the same job of teaching the body's immune system to recognise and fight the pandemic virus. What is more, it appears to be effective against emerging and more infectious variants of coronavirus too - something scientists have feared might not be possible because the vaccines were all designed to match the original virus, not these new, mutated versions. Protection against illness from the new UK variant was high - around 86%. Even with the South Africa variant, which has undergone the most worrisome changes, it offered a level of protection similar to that given by flu shots against influenza. England's chief medical officerProf Chris Whitty said,external, if the jab is approved, it ""increases our future resilience"" against the virus. Nadhim Zahawi, the UK minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said he was ""particularly thrilled"" to see the positive results as he had taken part in Novavax's trials himself. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? In total,the UK has ordered100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 40 million of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - both are currently being rolled out in the UK. Another 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which was approved by the MHRA in early January, are expected in the spring. The aim is to give everyone in the top four priority groups - up to 15 million people - a first dose by mid-February. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines rely on technology that has not been used in previous vaccines, but the Novavax jab uses a more traditional method of recreating part of the spike protein of the virus to stimulate the immune system. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial Like the Oxford vaccine, the Novavax jab can be stored at regular fridge temperature - which means it can be distributed more easily. More than 7.4 million people in the UK have so far received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine,according to the latest government figures.,external Meanwhile,the latest estimate for the UK's R rate,externalfrom the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1. The latest growth rate range is between -5% and 0%, indicating that the number of new infections is broadly flat or shrinking by up to 5% every day. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Separately, the EU's vaccine contract with AstraZenecahas been published, in a growing row over reduced supplies of their jab. Kate Bingham, who used to chair the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, said the reason the UK had a good supply of vaccines compared with other countries was because of its ability to get clinical trials completed quickly and at a high standard through the NHS's registry - with some 400,000 volunteers signing up ""before the US even started their Phase 3 studies"". The UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.

NI Protocol 'obstructs free movement of military'The UUP says the MoD must now fill out customs declaration forms to move equipment.Northern IrelandNovavax Covid jab shows 89% efficacy in UK trialsThe vaccine is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the UK variant of the virus.UK,"Doug Beattie said a customs form will be needed to move army equipment from GB to NI The government is facing fresh criticism over the Northern Ireland Protocol amid warnings it obstructs the ""free movement"" of the military. The Ulster Unionist Party has said that, under the protocol, the MoD must now give 15 days notice and fill out customs declaration forms before it moves equipment from GB to NI. It also said Nato has to be notified about the move. But the Ministry of Defence insists its NI operations will not be affected. Ulster Unionist MLA and former Army officer Doug Beattie said it is ""ludicrous where UK armed forces cannot move around the UK with equipment without permission"". In a letter to Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, he called for urgent action to ""protect military operations"" in Northern Ireland. He wrote that ""military equipment, and in some cases personnel, cannot be moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland unless they complete a customs form"". ""More worryingly, there will also be a need to complete a Nato form before any movement takes place,"" Mr Beattie added. The days of heavy duty military hardware rolling into Northern Ireland are long gone. But the military still provides support to the PSNI against the threat from paramilitaries under Operation Helvetic. It also has two bases used for training soldiers. But one military source said much of the equipment needed is already here, hence the MoD statement insisting its operations will not be affected by the new protocol arrangements. Though, for some unionists, the very thought of the military having to give notice and fill out forms before moving equipment from one part of the UK to another is a bitter pill. For them it is much more than a paper exercise. ""This Nato form is usually for the movement of UK forces and their equipment around the globe, but in this instance it is to allow UK forces to move within the confines of our own country. ""This is quite incredible and I simply cannot believe that any UK government would tolerate such a situation."" Mr Beattie told the secretary of state if the ""barriers"" cannot be removed, then Mr Lewis must invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The clause allows the EU or UK to ""unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures"", if the application of the protocol is triggering ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist"" or trade friction. First Minister Arlene Foster told Good Morning Ulster it was ""another example of the hundreds of problems with the protocol which we (the DUP) vehemently opposed"". ""We find it and its outworkings offensive,"" she said. ""No sovereign country should have barriers to trade and customs arrangements placed within it,"" she added. She said she had spoken to Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, who was ""concerned about the principle and sovereignty of the UK"". She added that they would be working on ""not just the function but on the principle - that the UK military has to be able to work at speed within its own jurisdiction"". It is understood one of the documents required is a form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"" Mr Beattie has also raised his concerns with the Armed Forces Minister James Heappey. Military on duty in wards to help ease pressures Brexit means NI eels can't be sold in Britain What will happen in Northern Ireland after Brexit? It is understood one of the documents required is a Nato 302 form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"". According to the EU Customs Transit regulations covering Nato and other military activities, the 302 form is used for a number of reasons, including ""temporary admission in the EU"".

LiveLiveSingle-dose jab could 'significantly bolster' UK rollout1 minute ago,"AstraZeneca says it is ""unprecedented"" the world has produced multiple vaccines in a year, after the EU approved its jab Prof Andrew Pollard, director of the Oxford vaccine group, adds there is ""no reason"" to be concerned about using the vaccine on over-65s Some EU states are considering only giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to under-65s, citing a lack of data for its use on older age groups Meanwhile, a new coronavirus vaccine developed by Janssen prevents 66% of Covid cases after a single dose, the Belgian company says And another new vaccine, Novavax, is said to be the first to show in trials it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK Meanwhile, lockdown will continue in Wales for a further three weeks, First Minister Mark Drakeford says The UK's R rate - the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect - is now estimated to be between 0.7 and 1.1 Edited by Hamish Mackay Weâre ending todayâs live coverage here, but we'll be back tomorrow with more updates. Here are this eveningâs headlines:  The anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases is an ""appropriate"" time for people to thank all NHS workers, the head of the health service has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens praised treatment innovations on a visit to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on Friday. The hospital treated the UK's first two Covid-19 patients a year ago. The pair, a Chinese student and his mother, were in York when they fell ill with the virus. Sir Simon said: ""These are the staff here at this hospital in Newcastle who treated the first coronavirus patients in England a year ago. ""Since then, hospitals across the country have looked after more than 300,000 severely ill coronavirus patients so I do think, on this one year anniversary, it is appropriate for the whole country to say a huge thank you to every member of staff across the health service.""

Under Northern Ireland's Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Cabinet Office minister Michael
Gove has spoken with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ to express
the UKâs concern over a lack of notification from the EU about its actions in
relation to the NI protocol. ""Gove told him the UK would now be carefully
considering next steps,"" Downing Street said in a statement. The incident happened at one of New Zealand's managed isolation hotels in Auckland An employee at a quarantine hotel in New Zealand has been sacked after what officials described as an inappropriate encounter with a person who should have been isolating. Officials say the pair shared notes, including one written on a face mask, before spending 20 minutes in a room together. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said it was ""unacceptable"": ""I didn't enquire specifically into the nature of the encounter, but the fact it was a 20-minute encounter, it was long enough for me to be unacceptable,"" he said. He added that the staff member had brought a bottle of wine to the room. People returning to New Zealand have to spend at least 14 days in isolation. The country has been hailed as one of the world's leaders in containing the virus. It has recorded 25 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Earlier this week, it reported its first case of Covid-19 outside of quarantine facilities in more than two months. Read more here.

American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan disembark at a US military base on 29 January 2020. In late January, a cargo aircraft carrying nearly 200 Americans - the first to be evacuated from Wuhan, China - landed at a military base in California. They were greeted by health officials who did not wear the proper protective gear and had also been advised to avoid the ""bad optics"" of wearing any. As civilians disembarked and began to quarantine at the base, there were no officials leading an effort to manage ""infection control and prevention measures"" and little PPE on hand for the officials present. Days later, these officials boarded commercial airlines and flew to other parts of the country. These details - initially the subject of a whistleblower complaint against the US health department - are the findings of a federal watchdog's investigation into how the US handled its first up-close encounter with the virus. The âmost troubling findingâ is that the handling of the 
Wuhan evacuees âincreased the risk of infection transmission not only to
 deployed [government] personnel, but also to the American public as a 
whole,â wrote lead investigator Henry Kerner in a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday. The US is now well past 25 million total cases of the virus. Over 433,000 Americans have died.

The Navy Times reports that 41 crew members aboard the USS Chafee have either been infected with the virus or been in close contact with sick shipmates. Sailors on board told The Times there has been a lack of ship-wide testing to identify more cases and a shortage of N95 masks. Some have used a single dirty mask for several days on end, according to one petty officer, who told the paper: ""We have asked for more, but they donât have enough."" ""When we kick back, we are either told to wear the 
dirty mask or face (non-judicial punishment)."" An official spokesman for the ship's fleet has however disputed the reporting and said: ""The ship remains able to meet its mission."" The warship - currently stationed in California - typically docks in Hawaii, which has seen over 25,000 cases of the virus and over 400 deaths. Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Cross-border travel with Northern Ireland and Britain makes a ""zero Covid"" strategy unlikely to work, an Irish expert says A senior member of the Republic of Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team hasrejected the ""zero Covid"" strategy advocated by opposition politicians. Those supporting the measure point to Australia and New Zealand's approach of suppressing the virus with much stricter lockdowns and rules on inbound travel. But Prof Philip Nolan said it was a ""false promise"" to say Ireland could go from the highest level of restrictions to the lowest levels ""in the space of weeks or months"" - adding that it ""won't happen"". Prof Nolan, who chairs the government's epidemiological modelling advisory group, said it ""would be an incredibly risky thing to do because we will inevitably be a leaky country and get re-introduction of the disease and that could easily be new variants"". The Irish government has always cited the open border with Northern Ireland and the lack of restriction on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as reasons why a zero Covid policy would be unlikely to work. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on non-essential airline travel in and out of the country. He says the countryâs main airlines have agreed to cancel service to âall Caribbeans destinations and Mexicoâ until the end of April. In addition, the government will mandate new testing and quarantine requirements for people returning to Canada. âNew variants of Covid-19 pose a real challenge to Canada,â
 says Mr Trudeau. âThatâs why we need to take extra measures.â It comes as media reports suggest Canadians are escaping to more sunny destinations amid the chilly and virus-afflicted winter. âWith the challenges we currently face with Covid-19, both here at home and abroad, we all agree that now is just not the time to be flying,"" says Mr Trudeau. That's all from the AstraZeneca press conference. Researchers are asked about comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, where he questioned how effective the vaccine was in over-65s. In response, Prof Pollard says there's ""good evidence"" to support the use of vaccine, including a strong immune response in older adults. He says there is much more limited data on efficacy in older adults but that doesn't mean there is necessarily a lack of protection. He adds ""everything points to the likelihood"" the vaccine will offer the same level of protection across all age groups. Prof Pollard says it is ""perhaps a misunderstanding"" of the data by the French president. Menelaos Pangolas, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D, is asked about the half dose of the vaccine that appeared to show better efficacy. Trials showed 62% effectiveness for two doses. But a subset of data showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. Pangolas says he is ""very confident"" with the dosing regimen they have, adding they are no longer needing to explore the half dose. He says hopefully when the data is published that will become apparent. Away from the AstraZeneca press conference, the EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines. The EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. It has therefore invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. You can read the full story here. The Associated Press asks Soriot whether the company will look at today with ""some regret"" given the disputes with the EU. He says ""a lot has been done"" to provide the vaccine to the bloc. Soriot says nine months ago the firm had nothing and the company is focused on supplying the EU, but everyone has to recognise it's ""a complicated process"". He says what has been done ""people take for granted"". It is not simple and is indeed very complicated, he says. ""We are really trying to catch up - there's not much more we can do."" Researchers are asked about the South African variant and its impact on vaccine efficacy. Prof Pollard says he doesn't have the data on what sort of effect the variant will have on the AstraZeneca vaccine. But he says he when you look at the changes in the spike protein caused by the variant, researchers would expect an ""impact on efficacy"" in vaccines. He says some of this has been shown in the data released in the last 24 hours for the Janssen and Novavax vaccines. But he says the ""really good news"" is if new vaccines do need to be made they can be done within a ""matter of months"". It's not like the situation a year ago, where it took a year of development, he says. He also says that although there are some concerns about new variants, it's still possible the current vaccines will be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalisation. AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot is asked about a problem with production of the vaccine at a factory in Belgium. He says the firm never mentions any of its partners, but adds that it has had ""teething issues"" in terms of the yield of vaccine at some of its production sites. ""We're talking about biology manufacturing here,"" he says, adding that making vaccines ""is extremely complicated"". ""It's not like doing an orange juice,"" he says. ""Everybody's on a learning curve, which usually you develop over year. We've had months. ""Some sites are more advanced."" He says the reasons for yield issues vary from site to site, but adds: ""We believe we have now fixed most of the issues and the productivity of the sites should improve rapidly over the next few months."" AstraZeneca is ""ready to launch"" its vaccine in the US as soon as it is approved by the regulator, the firm's chief executive says. Pascal Soriot says the firm has been working ""hand in hand"" with the US to manufacture the jab. Executive vice president Mene Pangolas says the US study is fully recruited and they are now waiting for enough Covid cases to be able to report their data. He says he imagines this will be in February. Asked whether he is concerned that some EU states are considering not giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to over 65s, Prof Andrew Pollard says ""there's no reason to be concerned about using it"". He stresses it ""can be used in all ages"", but adds that ""we have to respect how member states choose to use the vaccine"". Prof Pollard says the team is ""very confident in the data that we have"", adding that they have ""data showing that there's good immune response in older adults"". He also notes that trials are still running in the UK and Brazil, so ""there's a lot more data to come"". Asked by Alistair Smout of Reuters about Astra Zeneca's requirement to fulfil its ""best efforts"" to supply the vaccine to the EU, the company's chief executive officer Pascal Soriot says he is going to disappoint him with his reply. Soriot declines to answer and says he only wants to talk about the positive news of the deal to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the EU. Â© 2025 BBC.

Novavax Covid jab shows 89% efficacy in UK trialsThe vaccine is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the UK variant of the virus.,"Biotech firm Novavax has labs in the US (pictured) and has carried out trials in the UK and South Africa A new coronavirus vaccine has been shown to be 89% effective in large-scale UK trials. The Novavax jab is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said. The UK has secured 60 million doses of the jab, which will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England. Meanwhile,a single-dose vaccine developed by Janssen is 66% effective, trial results have shown. Janssen, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson, is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The company said its initial findings showed one dose prevented 85% of severe cases. Both the Novavax and Janssen jabs will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. EU chief wants AstraZeneca jab contract published When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery The PM welcomed the ""good news"", with doses of the Novavax jab expected to be delivered in the second half of this year if approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the government said. The UK has so far approved three coronavirus vaccines for emergency use - one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, another by Pfizer and BioNTech, and a third from drug firm Moderna. The Novavax jab, which is given in two doses, was shown to be 89.3% effective at preventing Covid-19 in participants in its Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK, and around 86% effective at protecting against the new UK variant. The jab's efficacy against the original Covid-19 strainwas calculated to be 95.6%,external. The Phase 3 trials - the final stage before a vaccine is looked at by a regulator - enrolled more than 15,000 people aged between 18-84, of whom 27% were older than 65, US firm Novavax said. In the South African part of the trial, where most of the cases were the South African variant of the virus, the vaccine was 60% effective among those without HIV. Stan Erck, chief executive of Novavax, said the results from the UK trial were ""spectacular"" and ""as good as we could have hoped"", while the efficacy in South Africa was ""above people's expectations"". He told the BBC the manufacturing plant in Stockton-on-Tees should be up and running by March or April, with the company hoping to get approval for the vaccine from the MHRA around the same time. This video can not be played Novavax chief executive: UK trial results are ""spectacular"" Minister Lucy Frazer told BBC Breakfast the government could not put an exact timeframe on when the Novavax jab might be approved as the regulation process is ""out of our control"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the new vaccine would be ""another weapon in our arsenal to beat this awful virus"", if approved. Prof Paul Heath, chief investigator of the UK Novavax trial, said the trial findings were ""enormously exciting"", particularly because of the jab's efficacy against the UK variant. These extremely encouraging trial results suggest another powerful vaccine against coronavirus could soon be within reach. It works in a slightly different way to the ones that are already available - but does the same job of teaching the body's immune system to recognise and fight the pandemic virus. What is more, it appears to be effective against emerging and more infectious variants of coronavirus too - something scientists have feared might not be possible because the vaccines were all designed to match the original virus, not these new, mutated versions. Protection against illness from the new UK variant was high - around 86%. Even with the South Africa variant, which has undergone the most worrisome changes, it offered a level of protection similar to that given by flu shots against influenza. England's chief medical officerProf Chris Whitty said,external, if the jab is approved, it ""increases our future resilience"" against the virus. Nadhim Zahawi, the UK minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said he was ""particularly thrilled"" to see the positive results as he had taken part in Novavax's trials himself. This video can not be played Covid vaccine safety: How does a vaccine get approved? In total,the UK has ordered100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 40 million of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - both are currently being rolled out in the UK. Another 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which was approved by the MHRA in early January, are expected in the spring. The aim is to give everyone in the top four priority groups - up to 15 million people - a first dose by mid-February. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines rely on technology that has not been used in previous vaccines, but the Novavax jab uses a more traditional method of recreating part of the spike protein of the virus to stimulate the immune system. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial Like the Oxford vaccine, the Novavax jab can be stored at regular fridge temperature - which means it can be distributed more easily. More than 7.4 million people in the UK have so far received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine,according to the latest government figures.,external Meanwhile,the latest estimate for the UK's R rate,externalfrom the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1. The latest growth rate range is between -5% and 0%, indicating that the number of new infections is broadly flat or shrinking by up to 5% every day. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Separately, the EU's vaccine contract with AstraZenecahas been published, in a growing row over reduced supplies of their jab. Kate Bingham, who used to chair the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, said the reason the UK had a good supply of vaccines compared with other countries was because of its ability to get clinical trials completed quickly and at a high standard through the NHS's registry - with some 400,000 volunteers signing up ""before the US even started their Phase 3 studies"". The UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.

Away from the AstraZeneca press conference, the EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines. The EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. It has therefore invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. You can read the full story here. The Associated Press asks Soriot whether the company will look at today with ""some regret"" given the disputes with the EU. He says ""a lot has been done"" to provide the vaccine to the bloc. Soriot says nine months ago the firm had nothing and the company is focused on supplying the EU, but everyone has to recognise it's ""a complicated process"". He says what has been done ""people take for granted"". It is not simple and is indeed very complicated, he says. ""We are really trying to catch up - there's not much more we can do."" Researchers are asked about the South African variant and its impact on vaccine efficacy. Prof Pollard says he doesn't have the data on what sort of effect the variant will have on the AstraZeneca vaccine. But he says he when you look at the changes in the spike protein caused by the variant, researchers would expect an ""impact on efficacy"" in vaccines. He says some of this has been shown in the data released in the last 24 hours for the Janssen and Novavax vaccines. But he says the ""really good news"" is if new vaccines do need to be made they can be done within a ""matter of months"". It's not like the situation a year ago, where it took a year of development, he says. He also says that although there are some concerns about new variants, it's still possible the current vaccines will be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalisation. AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot is asked about a problem with production of the vaccine at a factory in Belgium. He says the firm never mentions any of its partners, but adds that it has had ""teething issues"" in terms of the yield of vaccine at some of its production sites. ""We're talking about biology manufacturing here,"" he says, adding that making vaccines ""is extremely complicated"". ""It's not like doing an orange juice,"" he says. ""Everybody's on a learning curve, which usually you develop over year. We've had months. ""Some sites are more advanced."" He says the reasons for yield issues vary from site to site, but adds: ""We believe we have now fixed most of the issues and the productivity of the sites should improve rapidly over the next few months."" AstraZeneca is ""ready to launch"" its vaccine in the US as soon as it is approved by the regulator, the firm's chief executive says. Pascal Soriot says the firm has been working ""hand in hand"" with the US to manufacture the jab. Executive vice president Mene Pangolas says the US study is fully recruited and they are now waiting for enough Covid cases to be able to report their data. He says he imagines this will be in February. Asked whether he is concerned that some EU states are considering not giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to over 65s, Prof Andrew Pollard says ""there's no reason to be concerned about using it"". He stresses it ""can be used in all ages"", but adds that ""we have to respect how member states choose to use the vaccine"". Prof Pollard says the team is ""very confident in the data that we have"", adding that they have ""data showing that there's good immune response in older adults"". He also notes that trials are still running in the UK and Brazil, so ""there's a lot more data to come"". Asked by Alistair Smout of Reuters about Astra Zeneca's requirement to fulfil its ""best efforts"" to supply the vaccine to the EU, the company's chief executive officer Pascal Soriot says he is going to disappoint him with his reply. Soriot declines to answer and says he only wants to talk about the positive news of the deal to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the EU. Â© 2025 BBC.

Minister: Debate on Empire and BLM 'cartoon-like'The business secretary tells the BBC's Nick Robinson people should learn more about UK's imperial past.UK Politics,"Kwasi Kwarteng said Brexit offered the chance to strengthen rights, not erode them. Debate about Britain's imperial past and the Black Lives Matter movement has a ""cartoon-like view"" of history, Kwasi Kwarteng has told the BBC. The business secretary, the first black MP to head a department, toldNick Robinson's Political Thinkingthe Empire must be seen in its 400-year context and arguments fully explored. Calls to ""de-colonise"" the curriculum were not the way forward, he added. ""I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism."" British institutions have faced growing calls in recent years to account for their colonial links and wealth they accrued directly as a result of the British Empire and the Atlantic Slave trade. During anti-racism protests last summer following the death of George Floyd in the US, the statue of slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston was toppled by protesters in Bristol and a number of others were removed. Mr Kwarteng, whose parents moved from Ghana to the UK in the 1960s, said ""ripping down"" statues was counter-productive, as well as illegal, and people should ""learn more"" about the British Empire in all its various facets. ""I'm not someone who is obsessed with trying to correct history. I think you've got to understand history and understand that it's very complex and there are different arguments that are presented and I have a plea to understand the arguments and the context of the British Empire,"" he said. Statues to get protection from 'baying mobs' Sharma leaves business job to focus on climate role ""Even when you say the phrase the British Empire, you're talking about something that lasted more or less 400 years and covered a huge expanse of territory. ""So within that time and geography there's a huge amount of variety, different cultures and different time periods and getting a sensitivity to that is hugely important. ""I think a lot of the debate around Black Lives Matter and imperialism or colonialism has a very kind of cartoon-like view of what was happening over centuries across a quarter of the world."" He said he did not understand what those calling for university and school curriculums to be ""de-colonised"" were trying to achieve. ""Is the implication that it's a colonial relic and that you've got to try and decolonise it? I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism."" During the interview, Mr Kwarteng also explained whyhe put a stop to a post-Brexit review of workers' rightsand employment practices when he took over at the business department three weeks ago. ""I don't think that's a constructive thing to do. I don't think the opportunities of Brexit are about whittling away workers' rights or trying to have a race to the bottom or trying to reduce wages. On the contrary, a lot of people in my constituency voted for Brexit because of a stagnation of wages."" Mr Kwarteng was one of the authors of a 2012 series of essays, called Britannia Unchained, which suggested the UK did not encourage risk-taking and must strive to emulate the work ethic and low-tax culture of Singapore and other Asian successful economies. Pressed on whether he still holds to pro-free market views on deregulation or whether he supported a more interventionist role for the state, Mr Kwarteng said 2021 was very different from 2012, let alone previous decades. ""We've had a huge amount of money spent rightly to support businesses and people in employment. We've got a net zero agenda, which says we've got to decarbonise our economy in 30 years, and we've got a Brexit deal which is going to set us on a totally different course in terms of international trade. All of these mean that we can't simply apply the orthodoxies of 30 or 40 years ago to the context in which we now live or even five or six years ago.' He added: ""You can't simply go back to the Milton Friedman and Margaret Thatcher playbook of the 1970s and 1980s of deregulation and apply that.' The full podcast will be published today and Political Thinking will also be on Radio 4 tomorrow (Saturday) at 5.30pm.

"LiveLiveCovid-19: Welsh Government update3 minutes ago3 minutes ago GoodbyeGoodbye10 minutes ago 'Don't exploit' lockdown rule changes, says Drakeford'Don't exploit' lockdown rule changes, says Drakeford13 minutes ago 'Promising' results for fourth Covid vaccine'Promising' results for fourth Covid vaccine","First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic Level Four lockdown including the closure of licensed premises and non-essential shops will remain in force for another three weeks Some primary school children could begin a phased return to school from 22 February - just after half term - if Covid rates continue to fall, he says People will be allowed to exercise outdoors with one other person they do not live with Single people will be able to change their support bubble and stay with a different household after a 10-day gap Chris Wood and Andy Roberts That's it from our live coverage of the Welsh Government's update on the pandemic.  Here are the main developments:  You can keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Thanks for joining us and take care. First Minister Mark Drakeford called on people in Wales not to ""exploit"" slight changes to lockdown rules, which include allowing two people from different households to exercise outdoors together. He said it had prompted a ""very lively debate"" among ministers and chief advisors discussing the scope to relax the Level Four restrictions. ""There will be some people who once they can do one thing, want to push that, want to lean on the rules, game the system,"" he said. ""In the end, our conclusion was that, where we could, to make very minor easements but easements which can be very important to some people, we should do that. ""If you think this is an excuse to push the rules, to do more than is allowed, all you do is delay the day when we can lift other restrictions for us all. ""I've referred previously to small acts of selfishness, and it would be a small act of selfishness to try and exploit the very modest steps that we are able to provide today. ""When people do that, they let themselves down and they let other people down as well."" Almost 500 people from the Wrexham area took part in a trial that gave interim results of anew vaccine called Novavax having 89% effectivenessagainst the virus. The study was a collaboration between Public Health Wales, Health and Care Research Wales and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, with people recruited within a 30-mile radius of the town. In total, 15,000 volunteers were recruited UK-wide. Dr Orod Osanlou, Public Health Wales' principal investigator for the Novavax trial, said: âEven though these are just interim results, itâs promising to see weâre moving in the right direction to hopefully secure the fourth vaccine to help fight against Covid-19 and start saving lives. âWe had such a phenomenal response to our request for trial participants in north Wales and weâre thankful to everyone for selflessly donating their time - without those individuals we wouldnât have been able to have achieved these results."" Biotech firm Novavax has labs in the US (pictured) and has carried out trials in the UK and South Africa People who have already had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine will be invited for their second jab from 22 February, the first minister said. ""Starting from the 22 February it'll be a rolling programme - those who have been vaccinated first will get their second vaccine first, and so on,"" Mark Drakeford said. Out of more than 360,000 people in Wales to have been vaccinated so far, 717 have already had a second jab. Wales' first minister has said it's âpreferableâ for politicians to follow the lockdown rules when they make the rules themselves. Mark Drakeford was commentingon a trip made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to Scotlandearlier this week, which was criticised by some including Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for being ânot essentialâ. The first minister told journalists he had only left Cardiff twice since November and was only leaving his home or place of work âin a genuine emergencyâ. He said: âWe are at level four of a public health emergency, and on the whole, I think it is preferable for people who make rules that we expect other people to follow, to observe them ourselves.â Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has rejected a call by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer for all teachers and support staff to be vaccinated using ""the window"" of the February half term. Sir Keir made the call in relation to England at this week's Prime Minister's Questions. ""I take a different view here in Wales,"" the Labour first minister said. ""When you're in government you have to rely on the advice of those people who are appointed to give you that advice."" Mr Drakeford said the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) ""continues to be that we should prioritise those people who are on those nine groups"" recommended to be vaccinated first. ""When the JCVI changes its advice we will follow the new advice,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said new data from the Office for National Statistics suggested the fall in infections in Wales was levelling off. However, he added: âWe need to be very, very careful. ""In fact we probably need to be looking at what things we could possibly be doing in order to drive down those levels further - for instance, helping people isolate, getting the right level of money to people. ""Too many people are being refused the self-isolation support, and itâs not at the level which enables people to isolate as they would wish.â The first minister said he wants âeverything to be on the tableâ in discussions to determine the safest way of sending children back to school in Wales. Mark Drakeford said that a variety of approaches were being looked at, adding he would prefer to rule nothing out at this stage. âWe have a common aim of getting as many children as safely as possible back into the classroom,"" he said. ""Thatâs what our teachers want, and thatâs what parents and children want as well. âWhether it is reduced groups of people, whether it is part-weeks for some children, whether it is different use of the physical estate, whether itâs a contribution that testing can make to it, I want the longest possible list of solutions to the issues."" Mr Drakeford warned that while it would be his aim to resume face-to-face teaching as early as possible, the fast-changing nature of the virus meant that plans could have to be revised. âI wish I could tell you when I thought all children would be back, but even three weeks is a very long time with this virus,â he said. âWhen it is safe to do so we will bring more children back, and Iâd like to see it build up as quickly as it is safe to do so, but you can only judge that in the circumstances at the time."" First Minister Mark Drakeford was cautious when asked whether activities like golf could restart in Wales in light of the relaxation on meeting another person for exercise. âThe problem is those things all add up cumulatively,"" he said. ""Every bit that you do creates new opportunities for people to get together and when people get together, coronavirus thrives. ""So tough as it is, and frustrating as it is for many people, weâre still at a point in the pandemic where doing the minimum to get together is the right thing to do. ""If we continue to be on the right track, then in three weeks time, maybe we will be able to make some response to those people who make special cases for other forms of activity."" More than a third of a million people in the top priority groups have been given their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine in Wales so far. The aim is to have just under three-quarters of a million people, including health workers and people over 70,given a first dose by mid-February. The daily numbers show 122,412 of the over-80s - 66.9% - have now received a first dose. Meanwhile, just over 73% of care home residents have had their first dose. There is a little overlap between the two groups in these figures. In addition, nearly 77% - that's nearly 27,500 - care home workers have received a vaccine dose. The other key priority group is healthcare workers, with 107,364 of them so far given a vaccine dose. The latest daily figures, however, show the total receiving a first dose up to Thursday night was 362,253 - and the rate has jumped to 11.5% of the population. If this latest daily rate was maintained, the mid-February target for reaching four priority groups, including the over-70s, would be met by 12 February, although at the current daily seven-day average it would take a few days longer. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government would not rely on a ""crude"" single piece of data to decide whether to confirm plans tostart fully reopening schools from 22 Februaryafter half term. Ministers would look at many indicators, he said. That included the ""very important threshold of the number of people suffering from coronavirus"", the positivity rate from testing, and the numbers of people being admitted to hospital, as well as ""the mitigation measures that we are able to put in place in schools"". ""We will make a judgement in the round and we will make it in partnership with our colleagues in the local education authorities and the unions who represent all those people who work in our schools,"" the first minister added. A teachers' union leader has said schools in Wales should only reopen fully when it is safe to do so, claiming the announcement of ""arbitrary dates"" was ""profoundly unhelpful"". Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, was commenting on the first ministerâs announcement thatschools in Wales could start to reopen for younger pupils from 22 February. ""It is essential that the Wales national lockdown restrictions are supported fully in order to reduce the rates of virus transmission in the wider community and in order to ensure that schools can reopen fully as soon as it is safe to do so whilst minimising the risks to public health,"" Dr Roach said. âIt is important that the majority of children and young people in all schools are now supported to stay at home and that teachers also work from home to provide support for childrenâs learning remotely. âThe Welsh Government must deliver urgently extra support to families during the lockdown, many of whom are experiencing very serious financial difficulties at this time. âGiven previous experience, the announcement of arbitrary dates for schools to reopen to all pupils can be profoundly unhelpful to parents and to those working in schools. ""However, a clear plan for how schools will be fully reopened whenever the lockdown restrictions are lifted remains a key question which the Welsh Government must now work urgently and openly with the profession to address, and I welcome the commitment from the First Minister to work with the education unions on this.â Wales' first minister has called for ""simple, calm negotiation"" in the ongoing row between the European Union and drug-maker AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies. Mark Drakeford said it was better ""to take the temperature out of the difficulties rather than adding to them"". The European Commission has published its contract with AstraZenecaover the drug company's decision to reduce supplies to the EU. Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Mr Drakeford said: ""I don't think threats are ever a good way of arriving at a conclusion. ""What needs to happen here is simple, calm negotiation and discussion. ""Everybody is anxious to get a supply of the vaccine, everybody wants to do the best by their local populations. ""The companies and where governments are involved, getting around the table, having those discussions, coming to an agreement."" There is âunlikely to be much headroomâ for further coronavirus restrictions in Wales to be lifted at the time of the next review, according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said that despite falling case rates, the gradual reopening of schools was likely to be the only major change to rules in the coming weeks. âThereâs unlikely to be much headroom at the end of the next three weeks for other things to reopen,â he said. âIf things were to continue in the direction they are now, where things are going well, then more headroom may emerge in the month of March."" He said that changes with the spread of the virus could happen quickly, and that it would be difficult to predict when restrictions could start to be eased in the longer term. âWe could be blown off course by things that we know nothing about today,â Mr Drakeford said. âI think itâs sensible for people to look at what we can achieve in the next three weeks and the three weeks beyond, but I think itâs just looking into the tea leaves to think we can predict the future beyond that."" Wales' first minister says he âunderstands the anxietiesâ teaching staff might have in returning back to the classroom. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government would ""do everything"" it could to work with teachers and unions to make sure the workplace was âas safe as it can beâ before they return to school. âWe have to work together on this agenda, because we have a common aim of trying to repair the damage that has been done to the education of our young people during the 12 months that has just gone byâ, he said. âI look to all of those who share that ambition to come round the table and make those plans together."" Rules allowing people in Wales to exercise in a public outdoor place with others in their household or support bubble are being amended on Saturday to allow exercise with one person from another household, the Welsh Government has confirmed. ""If you choose to exercise with one person from outside your household or support bubble, you cannot exercise with members of your household or support bubble at the same time,"" a statement said. ""This does not apply to children under 11 who can accompany you on your exercise. ""You should ensure that you maintain social distancing from the person you are exercising with. ""You should also be mindful that exercise must start and finish from your home. You therefore should not travel to meet with someone outside of your household or support bubble.â  Wales' first minister said he is ""very keen"" to give ""two clear weeks notice"" that plans for a phasedreturn of some primary school children to school from 22 Februaryare going ahead. Mark Drakeford said there was a ""lot of hard work to be done on the detail of that"" with local councils and schools, and he wanted that to happen ""intensively next week"". ""By the end of next week we would therefore be in a position to confirm the plans that we will have put together,"" he added at the coronavirus briefing. The new Welsh Conservatives' leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, has pledged to work with ministers to see the easing of Covid restrictions. ""We want this to be the last lockdown and we will work with the Welsh Government to do whatever it takes to make sure that's the case,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

The latest figures show that the number of people receiving a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in Wales is now 362,253, which is 11.5% of the population. Deaths with Covid have increased by 29 to 4,695 and positive cases are up by 546 to 190,940. Covid vaccination rates are âgetting faster and fasterâ each day, First Minister Mark Drakeford said today. The Welsh Government had faced criticism last week after rates in Wales were lower than elsewhere in the UK. But daily vaccination rates have since overtaken the other three UK nations, with more than 362,000 people in Wales now having received their first dose. More than 400 GP practices are now offering vaccines, with 34 mass vaccination centres and 17 hospitals being used. âWeâre getting faster and faster with every day that goes by,â said Mr Drakeford, adding that someone was now vaccinated every five seconds. Ministers missed a target of vaccinating 70% of over-80s by last weekend. The next milestone will be the target of vaccinating all those over 70 and the clinically vulnerable by mid-February. Cases of Covid have fallen dramatically since Christmas, but there are still 1,300 patients with the infection in hospital. âDespite the very real progress we have made, itâs too soon to start lifting the lockdown restrictions,â Mr Drakeford said.

Janssen's single dose Covid vaccine 66% effective,"Dr Claire Cole from Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust volunteered in the Janssen jab's Phase 3 trial A new single-dose vaccine has shown to be 66% effective against Covid-19, and offered complete protection against hospitalisation and death in trials. However, there are signs the jab, made by Belgian pharmaceutical firm Janssen, is less effective against the new variant spreading in South Africa. The Johnson & Johnson-owned company is looking at whether two doses will give stronger or longer-lasting protection. It aims to make one billion doses this year. The UK has ordered 30 million doses, the US 100 million and Canada 38 million. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said if the jab was approved by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) it could ""significantly bolster"" the country's vaccine programme. Crucially, no one needed hospital treatment or died from coronavirus after the Janssen vaccine took effect in the international trial. The news comes shortly after Novavax announcedtheir jab was 89% effective overallin the UK and 60% in South Africa. Both new vaccines will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. Meanwhile, the EU's drugs regulator hasapproved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged over 18. It comes amid an ongoing dispute over whether AstraZeneca is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the bloc, which has seen the EU confirm that it will bring inexport controls on Covid vaccines made in the bloc. The EU hastemporarily overridden a section of the Brexit deal in relation to Northern Ireland, over concerns the country could become a backdoor for vaccines from the EU to be sent into the wider UK. Arlene Foster, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's first minister, called the move ""an incredible act of hostility"" by the EU. It comes as the UK reported a further 29,079 new coronavirus cases on Friday, and 1,245 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the government's daily figures, bringing the total deaths by that measure to 104,371. How many people have had the jab so far? When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery Crucially, the Janssen trial looked at giving just one dose of the vaccine, which makes it significantly easier to roll out than those requiring two.  It is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The fact it works as a single dose and can be kept in a standard fridge, while others need super-cold storage, means the vaccine could have a significant role around the world. ""A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings,"" said Dr Paul Stoffels, the chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson. He added the vaccine could ""potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of Covid-19"". It is easy to become complacent after the astounding success of the first vaccines to go through trials. But having another two effective vaccines is a cause for massive celebration. It will take vast quantities of vaccine to immunise the world - remember this is a pandemic - and the more options we have available, the better. However, there is also a warning sign in the new data from the Janssen and Novavax trials. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results from South Africa were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all. But they do emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change the vaccines we use in the future. The Janssen vaccine uses a common cold virus that has been engineered to make it harmless. It then safely carries part of the coronavirus's genetic code into the body. This is enough for the body to recognise the threat and then learn to fight coronavirus. This trains the body's immune system to fight coronavirus when it encounters the virus for real. This is similar to the approach used by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Dr Mathai Mammen, from Janssen, said: ""A single dose regimen with fast onset of protection and ease of delivery and storage provides a potential solution to reaching as many people as possible. ""The ability to avoid hospitalisations and deaths would change the game in combating the pandemic."" The results are based on nearly 44,000 people who took part in the trial and 468 cases of Covid-19. However the vaccine was just 57% effective in the South African part of the trial, where a new version of the coronavirus is spreading, compared with 72% in the US. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said thatthe results from the early trials were ""very encouraging"",external, and if the vaccine was approved doses should be available later this year. Mr Hancock said the Janssen announcement was ""yet more good news"". ""If this jab is approved this could significantly bolster our vaccination programme, especially as a single-dose vaccine,"" he said. ""Once the full data has been submitted [to the MHRA], they will consider the evidence to determine whether the vaccine meets robust standards of safety, effectiveness & quality.""

In the UK,the latest estimate for the R rate,externalfrom the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK remained virtually unchanged in the week to 23 January,according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data.  Its survey suggests the epidemic is levelling off or perhaps very slightly falling - but not at the rate hoped.

Minister: Debate on Empire and BLM 'cartoon-like'The business secretary tells the BBC's Nick Robinson people should learn more about UK's imperial past.,"Kwasi Kwarteng said Brexit offered the chance to strengthen rights, not erode them. Debate about Britain's imperial past and the Black Lives Matter movement has a ""cartoon-like view"" of history, Kwasi Kwarteng has told the BBC. The business secretary, the first black MP to head a department, toldNick Robinson's Political Thinkingthe Empire must be seen in its 400-year context and arguments fully explored. Calls to ""de-colonise"" the curriculum were not the way forward, he added. ""I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism."" British institutions have faced growing calls in recent years to account for their colonial links and wealth they accrued directly as a result of the British Empire and the Atlantic Slave trade. During anti-racism protests last summer following the death of George Floyd in the US, the statue of slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston was toppled by protesters in Bristol and a number of others were removed. Mr Kwarteng, whose parents moved from Ghana to the UK in the 1960s, said ""ripping down"" statues was counter-productive, as well as illegal, and people should ""learn more"" about the British Empire in all its various facets. ""I'm not someone who is obsessed with trying to correct history. I think you've got to understand history and understand that it's very complex and there are different arguments that are presented and I have a plea to understand the arguments and the context of the British Empire,"" he said. Statues to get protection from 'baying mobs' Sharma leaves business job to focus on climate role ""Even when you say the phrase the British Empire, you're talking about something that lasted more or less 400 years and covered a huge expanse of territory. ""So within that time and geography there's a huge amount of variety, different cultures and different time periods and getting a sensitivity to that is hugely important. ""I think a lot of the debate around Black Lives Matter and imperialism or colonialism has a very kind of cartoon-like view of what was happening over centuries across a quarter of the world."" He said he did not understand what those calling for university and school curriculums to be ""de-colonised"" were trying to achieve. ""Is the implication that it's a colonial relic and that you've got to try and decolonise it? I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism."" During the interview, Mr Kwarteng also explained whyhe put a stop to a post-Brexit review of workers' rightsand employment practices when he took over at the business department three weeks ago. ""I don't think that's a constructive thing to do. I don't think the opportunities of Brexit are about whittling away workers' rights or trying to have a race to the bottom or trying to reduce wages. On the contrary, a lot of people in my constituency voted for Brexit because of a stagnation of wages."" Mr Kwarteng was one of the authors of a 2012 series of essays, called Britannia Unchained, which suggested the UK did not encourage risk-taking and must strive to emulate the work ethic and low-tax culture of Singapore and other Asian successful economies. Pressed on whether he still holds to pro-free market views on deregulation or whether he supported a more interventionist role for the state, Mr Kwarteng said 2021 was very different from 2012, let alone previous decades. ""We've had a huge amount of money spent rightly to support businesses and people in employment. We've got a net zero agenda, which says we've got to decarbonise our economy in 30 years, and we've got a Brexit deal which is going to set us on a totally different course in terms of international trade. All of these mean that we can't simply apply the orthodoxies of 30 or 40 years ago to the context in which we now live or even five or six years ago.' He added: ""You can't simply go back to the Milton Friedman and Margaret Thatcher playbook of the 1970s and 1980s of deregulation and apply that.' The full podcast will be published today and Political Thinking will also be on Radio 4 tomorrow (Saturday) at 5.30pm.

"Breaking|Breaking newsJanssen's single dose Covid vaccine 66% effectiveThe news comes shortly after another company, Novavax, showed their approach worked.Health","Dr Claire Cole from Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust volunteered in the Janssen jab's Phase 3 trial A new single-dose vaccine has shown to be 66% effective against Covid-19, and offered complete protection against hospitalisation and death in trials. However, there are signs the jab, made by Belgian pharmaceutical firm Janssen, is less effective against the new variant spreading in South Africa. The Johnson & Johnson-owned company is looking at whether two doses will give stronger or longer-lasting protection. It aims to make one billion doses this year. The UK has ordered 30 million doses, the US 100 million and Canada 38 million. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said if the jab was approved by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) it could ""significantly bolster"" the country's vaccine programme. Crucially, no one needed hospital treatment or died from coronavirus after the Janssen vaccine took effect in the international trial. The news comes shortly after Novavax announcedtheir jab was 89% effective overallin the UK and 60% in South Africa. Both new vaccines will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. Meanwhile, the EU's drugs regulator hasapproved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged over 18. It comes amid an ongoing dispute over whether AstraZeneca is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the bloc, which has seen the EU confirm that it will bring inexport controls on Covid vaccines made in the bloc. The EU hastemporarily overridden a section of the Brexit deal in relation to Northern Ireland, over concerns the country could become a backdoor for vaccines from the EU to be sent into the wider UK. Arlene Foster, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's first minister, called the move ""an incredible act of hostility"" by the EU. It comes as the UK reported a further 29,079 new coronavirus cases on Friday, and 1,245 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the government's daily figures, bringing the total deaths by that measure to 104,371. How many people have had the jab so far? When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery Crucially, the Janssen trial looked at giving just one dose of the vaccine, which makes it significantly easier to roll out than those requiring two.  It is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The fact it works as a single dose and can be kept in a standard fridge, while others need super-cold storage, means the vaccine could have a significant role around the world. ""A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings,"" said Dr Paul Stoffels, the chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson. He added the vaccine could ""potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of Covid-19"". It is easy to become complacent after the astounding success of the first vaccines to go through trials. But having another two effective vaccines is a cause for massive celebration. It will take vast quantities of vaccine to immunise the world - remember this is a pandemic - and the more options we have available, the better. However, there is also a warning sign in the new data from the Janssen and Novavax trials. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results from South Africa were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all. But they do emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change the vaccines we use in the future. The Janssen vaccine uses a common cold virus that has been engineered to make it harmless. It then safely carries part of the coronavirus's genetic code into the body. This is enough for the body to recognise the threat and then learn to fight coronavirus. This trains the body's immune system to fight coronavirus when it encounters the virus for real. This is similar to the approach used by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Dr Mathai Mammen, from Janssen, said: ""A single dose regimen with fast onset of protection and ease of delivery and storage provides a potential solution to reaching as many people as possible. ""The ability to avoid hospitalisations and deaths would change the game in combating the pandemic."" The results are based on nearly 44,000 people who took part in the trial and 468 cases of Covid-19. However the vaccine was just 57% effective in the South African part of the trial, where a new version of the coronavirus is spreading, compared with 72% in the US. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

NI Protocol 'obstructs free movement of military',"Doug Beattie said a customs form will be needed to move army equipment from GB to NI The government is facing fresh criticism over the Northern Ireland Protocol amid warnings it obstructs the ""free movement"" of the military. The Ulster Unionist Party has said that, under the protocol, the MoD must now give 15 days notice and fill out customs declaration forms before it moves equipment from GB to NI. It also said Nato has to be notified about the move. But the Ministry of Defence insists its NI operations will not be affected. Ulster Unionist MLA and former Army officer Doug Beattie said it is ""ludicrous where UK armed forces cannot move around the UK with equipment without permission"". In a letter to Secretary of State Brandon Lewis, he called for urgent action to ""protect military operations"" in Northern Ireland. He wrote that ""military equipment, and in some cases personnel, cannot be moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland unless they complete a customs form"". ""More worryingly, there will also be a need to complete a Nato form before any movement takes place,"" Mr Beattie added. The days of heavy duty military hardware rolling into Northern Ireland are long gone. But the military still provides support to the PSNI against the threat from paramilitaries under Operation Helvetic. It also has two bases used for training soldiers. But one military source said much of the equipment needed is already here, hence the MoD statement insisting its operations will not be affected by the new protocol arrangements. Though, for some unionists, the very thought of the military having to give notice and fill out forms before moving equipment from one part of the UK to another is a bitter pill. For them it is much more than a paper exercise. ""This Nato form is usually for the movement of UK forces and their equipment around the globe, but in this instance it is to allow UK forces to move within the confines of our own country. ""This is quite incredible and I simply cannot believe that any UK government would tolerate such a situation."" Mr Beattie told the secretary of state if the ""barriers"" cannot be removed, then Mr Lewis must invoke Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol. The clause allows the EU or UK to ""unilaterally take appropriate safeguard measures"", if the application of the protocol is triggering ""serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist"" or trade friction. First Minister Arlene Foster told Good Morning Ulster it was ""another example of the hundreds of problems with the protocol which we (the DUP) vehemently opposed"". ""We find it and its outworkings offensive,"" she said. ""No sovereign country should have barriers to trade and customs arrangements placed within it,"" she added. She said she had spoken to Secretary of State for Defence, Ben Wallace, who was ""concerned about the principle and sovereignty of the UK"". She added that they would be working on ""not just the function but on the principle - that the UK military has to be able to work at speed within its own jurisdiction"". It is understood one of the documents required is a form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"" Mr Beattie has also raised his concerns with the Armed Forces Minister James Heappey. Military on duty in wards to help ease pressures Brexit means NI eels can't be sold in Britain What will happen in Northern Ireland after Brexit? It is understood one of the documents required is a Nato 302 form for the ""cross-border movement of military goods"". According to the EU Customs Transit regulations covering Nato and other military activities, the 302 form is used for a number of reasons, including ""temporary admission in the EU"". But an MoD spokesperson said: ""The Northern Ireland Protocol has not placed any limitations on the Ministry of Defence's ability to conduct operations.""

Archbishop supports mother and baby home inquiry,"This video can not be played Archbishop of Armagh, Eamon Martin, was speaking on BBC NI's The View programme The leader of the Catholic Church in Ireland has said he would support a public inquiry into what happened at mother and baby homes across NI. A Department of Health report on the homes was published on Tuesday. Archbishop Eamon Martin was speaking on BBC NI's The View programme on Thursday night. He also agreed that victims of mother and baby homes should be entitled to compensation. Archbishop Martin appealed to anyone in Northern Ireland who has information on what happened to women and children at the homes to ""lift the lid on this stark reality and let the glaring light of truth shine in"". Reaction to NI mother-and-baby homes statement Major findings of NI mother-and-baby homes report Watch back: Eamon Martin on The View The research into the homes was commissioned by the Department of Health and carried out by Queen's University and Ulster University. It examined eight mother and baby homes, a number of former workhouses, four Magdalene Laundries and sought personal testimony from women and children with ""lived experience"" of the institutions. Mother-and-baby institutions housed women and girls who became pregnant outside marriage and the laundries were Catholic-run workhouses that operated across the island of Ireland. It examined a number of issues including whether a public inquiry should be held. The findings of the research included details of how some were the victims of sexual crime, including rape and incest. Read more on the report's contents here. Speaking on The View, Archbishop Martin said any inquiry ""will require a very firm legislative and statutory framework... in order to help these people understand their story"". First Minister Arlene Foster has said that there would be a ""new independent investigation"" . Meanwhile Judith Gillespie, who chaired the executive's independent inter-departmental working group on the issue, said a public inquiry was ""not off the table"" and insisted survivors would have ""agency in the process"". A man who was placed in a mother-and-baby home in north Belfast in 1945 has said Archbishop Eamon Martin's apology ""helps so much"". Peter Quigley was taken to the home shortly after his birth in Bethany Home orphanage in Dublin. When he was 42, he managed to trace his birth mother and met up with her on Mother's Day in 1987. ""It was quite an emotional experience, and such a joy to put all those pieces together,"" Mr Quigley told BBC Radio Ulster. ""I sent her flowers in advance for Mother's Day, my stepdad met me in the train station at Bognor Regis and we walked up the Linden Road together and I met my mum for the very first time. ""There was no recrimination, there was no regret, it wasn't perfect but it was just normal, healthy and good."" Mr Quigley said a full inquiry would be ""tremendously helpful"" because many people, like himself, need to get information and ""want to fill in the blanks"". Billy Scampton was born in Marianvale in Newry, County Down in the 1960s and was then adopted from the Nazareth House in Donegal in 1962. A Londonderry man who was also born in a mother-and-baby home echoed that call and said there needed to be an investigation into how babies were transported across the border without ""questions being asked"". Billy Scampton was born in Marianvale in Newry, County Down, in the 1960s and was then adopted from the Nazareth House in Donegal in 1962. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, Mr Scampton said in the last couple of years he has tried to track down his biological family, but has never met his birth mother. ""What still gets me to this day, the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was very much a fixed entity in the 1960s, even before that, when we were born. ""To move even as much as a cow or a chicken you needed the proper paperwork, yet there was the likes of us being moved freely back and forward on what was an international frontier by individuals. ""There were more checks-and-balances put in place to move livestock across than there were to move babies."" First Minister Arlene Foster told Good Morning Ulster that Peter Quigley's testimony of being placed in a mother-and-baby home was ""moving"". She said it was important that people like him were involved in the design and structure of an inquiry. ""It will need statutory powers and a legislative framework to ensure we have access to everything we need,"" she said. However, she added that the form and function should be ""decided by the victims and facilitated and chaired by Victims Commissioner Judith Thompson"". ""It is important that victims must have ownership of everything going forward given that they were not in that position either as young women or the children of those women,"" she added. Thousands of women and girls entered the institutions in Northern Ireland over a 68-year period Following publication of the research earlier this week, Archbishop Martinapologised to victims on behalf of the church and asked for their forgiveness. He reiterated his apology on The View on Thursday night, saying: ""I'm deeply sorry for the way you were treated. As a church leader in Ireland today, it is I who feels the shame that was placed on your shoulders."" He said the Catholic Church ""lost sight of the merciful Christ"" when they mistreated mothers and babies at the homes. ""The gospel I follow is about the dignity of every person, a gospel that calls me to reach out to the vulnerable and the marginalised."" He added: ""We clearly had obscured the light of the gospel underneath a fixation with a judgemental, authoritarian approach to our faith and it is extremely sad that at the brunt of that were often women and vulnerable, those who society was perhaps also rejecting and who perhaps would have wanted to find in their church some refuge, some solace in their church and didn't find it."" Archbishop Martin also said the Catholic Church ""cannot shirk its responsibility for this, which is why I very humbly and sincerely offer that apology"". 'Significant wrongs' in NI mother-and-baby homes Reaction to NI mother-and-baby homes statement Asked if compensation should be paid to victims, Bishop Martin said ""definitely"". He added: ""Victims will require practical support.  What I have found from talking survivors, often they aren't seeking money but answers denied to them in decades previously"". ""We have to find maybe a multitude of ways or memorialisation, recognition. ""If that means financial reparation and it is possible to do that in a way which is just and proportionate and takes account of the findings, I think all of us have to step up and play our part."" The publication of the report in Northern Ireland comes after a similar investigation into mother-and-baby homes and laundries in the Republic of Ireland, which prompted anapology from Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin.

"Data shows Covid outbreaks in offices in lockdownUnder England's lockdown rules, in force since 6 January, people should work from home if they can.UK","More than 60 suspected Covid outbreaks in offices were recorded in the first two weeks of the current lockdown in England, a BBC investigation has found. Under England's lockdown rules, in force since 6 January, people should work from home if they can. Public Health England figures, obtained via a Freedom of Information request, suggests offices have had more outbreaks compared to other workplaces. The government has urged firms to help employees work from home. It said it has worked with trade unions, businesses and medical experts to  produce ""comprehensive guidance"" to help firms that are permitted to stay open and it has introduced rapid testing of employees. Can my boss force me to go to work? What are the UK's lockdown rules and when will they end? 'My boss made me come to work and I caught Covid' The data from Public Health England, obtained by the 5 Live Investigations team, lists the different types of workplaces where there have been clusters of cases. The figures reveal for the first time which are the most susceptible to Covid outbreaks, with offices coming top. The data showed there were more than 500 outbreaks, or suspected outbreaks, in offices in the second half of 2020 - more than in supermarkets, construction sites, warehouses, restaurants and cafes combined. This has prompted calls for curbs on employers bringing non-essential staff into offices as well as demands from unions for tougher safety rules. The rules for Englandstate that ""you may only leave your home for work if you cannot reasonably work from home"". The list of people who may still travel to work,externalincludes healthcare professionals, teachers, childcare providers, transport workers, people who work in construction or manufacturing, funeral directors, and essential retail workers. However, the Health and Safety Executivereceived nearly 4,000 Covid-related complaintsabout workplaces in January. ""It's likely I got ill at work,"" says call centre worker Dan, not his real name, who contracted Covid this month and passed the virus to his girlfriend. He works in the Bristol office of outsourcing firm Woven - where he says up to 30 people can work on his floor. He says they hot-desk, share toilets and the windows are always closed. Many of his colleagues have worked in the office throughout the pandemic and several have had Covid, Dan says. ""We've had five or six cases in the office and still everybody is being asked to come into work to answer calls,"" he says. Woven said it had been working on its IT infrastructure for several months to allow more employees to work from home. ""Our primary concern is the health and wellbeing of our colleagues,"" a spokesperson said. ""We have worked closely with Public Health England since the start of the pandemic to implement extensive safety measures in line with government advice."" Although clinically vulnerable workers have been told not to attend work, their family members have no such protection. Michelle, not her real name, works in an office for Greater Manchester Police, where she says there have been multiple Covid cases. ""If I bring Covid into my house, there's a very real chance that my partner wouldn't survive,"" says Michelle, whose husband is vulnerable. ""It's extremely stressful for him as well as for me."" The office she works in is small and stuffy, she says, with police officers coming in and out throughout the day. ""I just stepped out of the office, and when I came back, somebody was sitting at the workstation on the computer and using the phone with no mask,"" Michelle says. ""I was really angry and very upset."" Michelle, who was not expected to come in during last year's first national lockdown - when people could only travel to work if it was ""absolutely necessary"" - cannot do her job from home. She feels it is unfair that she is made to work in the office because of the risk posed to her husband. ""I perceive myself to be vulnerable due to the fact that I have a vulnerable partner,"" she says. In a statement, Greater Manchester Police said the health safety of its workers was a priority and it had taken a ""proactive approach to keep our officers and staff safe in the workplace"". The force said it follows the latest government advice regarding staff living with vulnerable people and is doing all it can to try to support them. All of its buildings are ""Covid-secure"", the statement added, and staff can raise any concerns in a number of ways. Prof Phil Taylor, who has spent years researching call centre and office work, says offices provide the perfect environment for Covid to spread. ""They have high occupational densities with little social distancing and are often sealed, with air con just recirculating pathogens like Covid,"" said Prof Taylor, from the University of Strathclyde. ""Hot-desking is commonplace and cleansing is hit and miss. It's a toxic combination."" In a modern building where the windows are sealed, occupants rely on a ventilation system in which stale air is extracted from the rooms and piped to an air handling unit, often on the roof. There, fresh air can be pulled in from outside and mixed with the old inside air, before being sent back into the building. The professional advice is to maximise the fresh supply - but the mix of outside and inside air will be determined by the building's managers. Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Prof Cath Noakes, who sits on the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) committee, said poorly ventilated offices could increase the chances of contracting Covid from tiny airborne particles by up to 70%. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Everyone has the right to be safe at work. But Boris Johnson and his ministers have failed to get a grip on Covid safety in workplaces."" Labour called on the government  to ""urgently"" strengthen workplace safety rules. ""To help prevent the spread of the virus, the government must clarify the stay at home message, rewrite outdated workplace safety rules and strengthen health and safety enforcement,"" Labour's shadow secretary for employment rights and protections Andy McDonald said. A government spokesperson said: ""We continue to reinforce the stay at home messaging to businesses and the overwhelming majority are doing the right thing, but we need all employers to act responsibly and take every possible step to help their employees work from home.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsJanssen's single dose Covid vaccine 66% effectiveThe news comes shortly after another company, Novavax, showed their approach worked.HealthCameron House fined Â£500,000 over fatal hotel fireTwo guests died after a fire broke out in a cupboard at the hotel in West Dunbartonshire in 2017.Glasgow & West Scotland","Dr Claire Cole from Manchester University NHS Foundation Trust volunteered in the Janssen jab's Phase 3 trial A new single-dose vaccine has shown to be 66% effective against Covid-19, and offered complete protection against hospitalisation and death in trials. However, there are signs the jab, made by Belgian pharmaceutical firm Janssen, is less effective against the new variant spreading in South Africa. The Johnson & Johnson-owned company is looking at whether two doses will give stronger or longer-lasting protection. It aims to make one billion doses this year. The UK has ordered 30 million doses, the US 100 million and Canada 38 million. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said if the jab was approved by Britain's Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) it could ""significantly bolster"" the country's vaccine programme. Crucially, no one needed hospital treatment or died from coronavirus after the Janssen vaccine took effect in the international trial. The news comes shortly after Novavax announcedtheir jab was 89% effective overallin the UK and 60% in South Africa. Both new vaccines will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. Meanwhile, the EU's drugs regulator hasapproved the use of the AstraZeneca vaccine for people aged over 18. It comes amid an ongoing dispute over whether AstraZeneca is breaking its vaccine delivery commitments to the bloc, which has seen the EU confirm that it will bring inexport controls on Covid vaccines made in the bloc. The EU hastemporarily overridden a section of the Brexit deal in relation to Northern Ireland, over concerns the country could become a backdoor for vaccines from the EU to be sent into the wider UK. Arlene Foster, DUP leader and Northern Ireland's first minister, called the move ""an incredible act of hostility"" by the EU. It comes as the UK reported a further 29,079 new coronavirus cases on Friday, and 1,245 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test in the government's daily figures, bringing the total deaths by that measure to 104,371. How many people have had the jab so far? When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery Crucially, the Janssen trial looked at giving just one dose of the vaccine, which makes it significantly easier to roll out than those requiring two.  It is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The fact it works as a single dose and can be kept in a standard fridge, while others need super-cold storage, means the vaccine could have a significant role around the world. ""A one-shot vaccine is considered by the World Health Organization to be the best option in pandemic settings,"" said Dr Paul Stoffels, the chief scientific officer at Johnson & Johnson. He added the vaccine could ""potentially protect hundreds of millions of people from serious and fatal outcomes of Covid-19"". It is easy to become complacent after the astounding success of the first vaccines to go through trials. But having another two effective vaccines is a cause for massive celebration. It will take vast quantities of vaccine to immunise the world - remember this is a pandemic - and the more options we have available, the better. However, there is also a warning sign in the new data from the Janssen and Novavax trials. Both showed a dip in their overall effectiveness in South Africa, where a new and worrying variant has been spreading. The results from South Africa were still good and clearly better than no vaccine at all. But they do emphasise how coronavirus is a moving target and that we may need to change the vaccines we use in the future. The Janssen vaccine uses a common cold virus that has been engineered to make it harmless. It then safely carries part of the coronavirus's genetic code into the body. This is enough for the body to recognise the threat and then learn to fight coronavirus. This trains the body's immune system to fight coronavirus when it encounters the virus for real. This is similar to the approach used by the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca. Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Dr Mathai Mammen, from Janssen, said: ""A single dose regimen with fast onset of protection and ease of delivery and storage provides a potential solution to reaching as many people as possible. ""The ability to avoid hospitalisations and deaths would change the game in combating the pandemic."" The results are based on nearly 44,000 people who took part in the trial and 468 cases of Covid-19. However the vaccine was just 57% effective in the South African part of the trial, where a new version of the coronavirus is spreading, compared with 72% in the US. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Prime Minister Boris Johnson said thatthe results from the early trials were ""very encouraging"",external, and if the vaccine was approved doses should be available later this year. Mr Hancock said the Janssen announcement was ""yet more good news"". ""If this jab is approved this could significantly bolster our vaccination programme, especially as a single-dose vaccine,"" he said. ""Once the full data has been submitted [to the MHRA], they will consider the evidence to determine whether the vaccine meets robust standards of safety, effectiveness & quality.""

In the UK,the latest estimate for the R rate,externalfrom the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1. The number of coronavirus cases in the UK remained virtually unchanged in the week to 23 January,according to Office for National Statistics (ONS) data.

"Cameron House fined Â£500,000 over fatal hotel fireTwo guests died after a fire broke out in a cupboard at the hotel in West Dunbartonshire in 2017.Glasgow & West Scotland","Aerial photographs show the extent of the damage to Cameron House A Scottish luxury hotel has been fined half a million pounds over a fire that claimed the lives of two guests. Cameron House has been ordered to pay Â£500,000 after admitting to breaches of fire safety rules. A hotel porter has also been given a community payback order to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Richard Dyson, 38, and his partner Simon Midgley, 32, died in the hotel blaze on the banks of Loch Lomond in December 2017. The fire started after night porter Christopher O'Malley, 35, placed a plastic bag of ash in a cupboard containing kindling and newspapers. O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. Christopher O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act Sheriff William Gallacher said the families of Mr Dyson and Mr Midgley will ""always endure the heartbreak"" caused by the fire. Cameron Housepreviously pleaded guiltyto two charges of failing to take fire safety measures which were necessary to ensure the safety of staff and guests. Survivor Hannah Munns, who was in the room next to the couple, said she felt ""ignored and angry"" after the sentencing. Ms Munns toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""Two men have lost their lives, many families have been impacted and they (Cameron House) continue to trade. They are barely going to notice it."" She also criticised the lack of communication since the blaze and said she could not make sense of O'Malley's ""ridiculous"" actions. But Ms Munns added she felt more aggrieved at the fine handed down to Cameron House. She said: ""That's nothing. No lessons will be learned from that. Nothing will change as a result of that. ""It just feels like no-one has taken it very seriously. I am just in shock, really. It is almost saying our lives don't matter."" Richard Dyson, left, and Simon Midgley, right, who both died, had been on a winter break in Scotland Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie said the fire had been devastating for the victims' families. The Scottish Labour interim leader spoke to Mr Midgley's mother, Jane, after the sentencing and said she remains ""heartbroken"". Ms Baillie added: ""What we heard today, in the context of two young men losing their lives, does not seem enough to her. ""We have a major hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond that failed to heed the advice given to them by the fire brigade and others. ""The deaths of these two young men did not need to happen at all."" Dumbarton Sheriff Court heard staff were not properly trained in the safe disposal of ash and no written procedures were in place. That was contrary to recommendations made in two fire risk assessments carried out by an independent company in 2016 and 2017. There was no safe system for emptying the ash bins outside the hotel, which is next to Loch Lomond. The day before the fatal fire, O'Malley had discovered they were both full. They had not been emptied since October 2017, two months before the 18 December blaze. In August 2017, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service told managers not to store combustibles - like kindling and newspapers - in the concierge cupboard, but staff continued to do so. This video can not be played CCTV captures moment hotel fire takes hold Peter Gray QC, acting for Cameron House, said the failings were not deliberate breaches but occurred ""as a result of genuine errors"". He also told the court the fire had gone undetected for a long period before being discovered, and that the hotel had a ""suite of measures in place"" to deal with fire safety. Sheriff William Gallacher also heard of an incident three nights before the fatal fire, when O'Malley and another night porter were told not to put ash into plastic bags because it was a fire hazard. Mr Gray said it was therefore ""extremely difficult to understand"" why O'Malley did not follow this guidance on the night of the fire. Fatal hotel fire caused by ash left in cupboard Couple killed in hotel fire named Mum 'tortured' by son's death in hotel fire After the sentencing, Alistair Duncan, head of the Health and Safety Investigation Unit, said: ""The failings on the part of Cameron House Resort and Christopher O'Malley led to the deaths of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson. ""This incident should serve as a reminder to other companies that failure to implement the necessary fire safety measures can have terrible consequences."" Stuart Stevens, assistant chief officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said the ""needless loss of two lives"" could have been prevented. Det Insp Stuart Grainger from Police Scotland said: ""While nothing will ever diminish the pain of their loss, we hope that the conclusion of this case brings at least a small measure of comfort."" The interior of the hotel reception where the fire started in the concierge cupboard The court was previously told O'Malley, of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, deeply regretted his actions and they were not deliberate. More than 200 guests were staying in the hotel when an initial fire alarm sounded at about 06:40. O'Malley opened the door and flames took hold, spreading to the hall. He and two others tried to fight the blaze with fire extinguishers, but were overcome by the flames. The overflowing ash bins outside the luxury hotel Firefighters arrived within 10 minutes to find a ""well-developed"" fire in the mansion, which is near Balloch in West Dunbartonshire. It was after 08:00 when it was discovered that Mr Dyson, 38, and Mr Midgley, 32, were missing. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus found Mr Dyson on a landing at the top of a staircase. Mr Midgley was lying in a fire escape passageway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Mr Dyson was taken to hospital, where he was also pronounced dead. Post-mortem examinations said the men's causes of death had been inhalation of smoke and fire gases. The couple had travelled from London, and were staying at the five-star resort as the final stop on their winter break to Scotland.

Man 'felt degraded' by 'power-hungry' Covid police,"This video can not be played Video of 'power hungry' male police officer goes viral A man said he felt degraded after being detained in a police car when challenged on his way to work by an officer citing Covid legislation. His video of the events in Solihull on Wednesday has been viewed more than a million times on Twitter. It shows Nino Romano, 21, questioned on his plans, before he is called an idiot and threatened with ""locking up"". West Midlands Police said the officer's actions were ""unacceptable"" and there was no suspicion of any offence. Mr Romano accused him of being ""power-hungry"". The force said it had reviewed both the footage and police camera video of the challenge to Mr Romano and concluded ""conduct fell far below what we would expect"". A spokesperson added: ""[The officer's] manner was not acceptable, not the face of [the force] and we will deal with the situation."" The male officer was with a colleague and their duties were to ensure people adhered to Covid restrictions, police said. Footage shows him asking Mr Romano what he is up to and where he lives - information readily shared by the 21-year-old, who says he is going to work. But matters take a turn when Mr Romano - on his way to catch a train to his job in nearby Birmingham - refuses to give police his name. Nino Romano says he feels ""annoyed"" and ""degraded"" The government's website,externalsays police might stop members of the public to ask their name, their purpose in the area and where they are going, but people do not have to stop or answer. It adds not giving the detail cannot be used as a basis for search or arrest if there is no other reason to suspect a person. The officer can be heard saying that as Mr Romano had refused to give his name, he had ""reasonable suspicion"" he was ""telling lies"". West Midlands Police said: ""[Mr Romano] explained he was heading to work - that's clearly a justifiable reason to be out and about and there was no suspicion he had committed any offences."" Mr Romano said when put into the police car he eventually gave his name, and was released without being formally arrested. But he said the episode had left him ""annoyed"", and accused the officer of being ""power hungry"". He said: ""I've just got used to it, that's how the police act to the younger generation. ""I think they targeted me because of the clothes I was wearing - a tracksuit and a coat. ""I'm going to carry on going to work, but the fact they feel entitled to stop people [is] a bit degrading; it's not nice at all. ""There were so many people around, why pick me?"" In the video, the officer says that under virus legislation Mr Romano must provide his details, otherwise he will be arrested. He is then threatened with ""locking up"". Mr Romano accuses the officer of harassment, and suggests he has been targeted due to his hoodie, and adds he takes issue with someone pulling him over. ""We're the police, we're not just someone, you idiot,"" the officer says. Mr Romano then states ""just 'cause you're the police that gives you the right to stop anyone you want and get their details?"", to which the officer says ""yes"". On saying the officer needed to be ""re-informed"" about the law, Mr Romano is put into a police car and told the matter will be settled in a police station.

Boohoo in talks to buy Dorothy Perkins and Wallis,"Online fashion retailer Boohoo is in ""exclusive"" talks to buy the Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton brands from failed retail group Arcadia. Sir Philip Green's Arcadia group fell into administration in November last year casting doubt over the future of its brands and 13,000 jobs. Any deal would be for the brands, and not the High Street shops. Rival online fashion chain Asos is the frontrunner to buy Topshop, Topman, Miss Selfridge and HIIT brands. Asos frontrunner to buy Topshop and Miss Selfridge Debenhams' 118 shops to shut permanently after deal In a short statement to shareholders, Boohoo said the talks with Arcadia's administrators ""may or may not result in agreement of a transaction"". ""A further announcement will be made when appropriate,"" it added. Earlier this week, Boohoo sealed a deal to buy the Debenhams brand and website for Â£55m. However, the price tag did not include any of the retailer's remaining 118 High Street stores or its workforce, resulting in up to 12,000 job losses. Last year, Boohoo bought the online businesses of Oasis and Warehouse for Â£5.25m. That added to its portfolio, which included the Karen Millen and Coast brands, which it bought from administrators in 2019. ''Fresh from its shopping spree, snapping up the Debenhams brand and website, Boohoo is rifling through the bargain bins once more, this time at Arcadia,"" said Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown. She said Asos had ""turned its nose up"" at Dorothy Perkins, Wallis and Burton, leaving them for Boohoo to bid for. ""As an online-only fashion giant, Boohoo would be only interested in the brands, seeing little value in the store estate as the shift to digital sales intensifies,"" she said. ""So the rescue of the famous names, wouldn't throw a lifeline to the thousands of shop workers who are very likely to still face redundancy.'' Arcadia's administrators had requested that final bids for the group's assets be submitted last Monday, with the auction expected to conclude at the end of January. Arcadia's Evans brand was sold by the administrators to Australia's City Chic for Â£23m last month. Sir Philip Green is under pressure to use his own money to plug an estimated Â£350m hole in Arcadia's pension fund, which has about 10,000 members. Last year the retail tycoon had an estimated fortune of Â£930m, according to the Sunday Times Rich List. Arcadia employed about 13,000 people and had 444 shops at the time of its collapse.

Kwarteng: Debate on Empire and BLM 'cartoon-like',"Kwasi Kwarteng said Brexit offered the chance to strengthen rights, not erode them. Debate about Britain's imperial past and the Black Lives Matter movement has a ""cartoon-like view"" of history, Kwasi Kwarteng has told the BBC. The business secretary, the first black MP to head a department, toldNick Robinson's Political Thinkingthe Empire must be seen in its 400-year context and arguments fully explored. Calls to ""de-colonise"" the curriculum were not the way forward, he added. ""I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism."" British institutions have faced growing calls in recent years to account for their colonial links and wealth they accrued directly as a result of the British Empire and the Atlantic Slave trade. During anti-racism protests last summer following the death of George Floyd in the US, the statue of slave trader and philanthropist Edward Colston was toppled by protesters in Bristol and a number of others were removed. Mr Kwarteng, whose parents moved from Ghana to the UK in the 1960s, said ""ripping down"" statues was counter-productive, as well as illegal, and people should ""learn more"" about the British Empire in all its various facets. ""I'm not someone who is obsessed with trying to correct history. I think you've got to understand history and understand that it's very complex and there are different arguments that are presented and I have a plea to understand the arguments and the context of the British Empire,"" he said. Statues to get protection from 'baying mobs' Sharma leaves business job to focus on climate role ""Even when you say the phrase the British Empire, you're talking about something that lasted more or less 400 years and covered a huge expanse of territory. ""So within that time and geography there's a huge amount of variety, different cultures and different time periods and getting a sensitivity to that is hugely important. ""I think a lot of the debate around Black Lives Matter and imperialism or colonialism has a very kind of cartoon-like view of what was happening over centuries across a quarter of the world."" He said he did not understand what those calling for university and school curriculums to be ""de-colonised"" were trying to achieve. ""Is the implication that it's a colonial relic and that you've got to try and decolonise it? I'm saying the opposite - that you've got to learn more about colonialism."" During the interview, Mr Kwarteng also explained whyhe put a stop to a post-Brexit review of workers' rightsand employment practices when he took over at the business department three weeks ago. ""I don't think that's a constructive thing to do. I don't think the opportunities of Brexit are about whittling away workers' rights or trying to have a race to the bottom or trying to reduce wages. On the contrary, a lot of people in my constituency voted for Brexit because of a stagnation of wages."" Mr Kwarteng was one of the authors of a 2012 series of essays, called Britannia Unchained, which suggested the UK did not encourage risk-taking and must strive to emulate the work ethic and low-tax culture of Singapore and other Asian successful economies. Pressed on whether he still holds to pro-free market views on deregulation or whether he supported a more interventionist role for the state, Mr Kwarteng said 2021 was very different from 2012, let alone previous decades. ""We've had a huge amount of money spent rightly to support businesses and people in employment. We've got a net zero agenda, which says we've got to decarbonise our economy in 30 years, and we've got a Brexit deal which is going to set us on a totally different course in terms of international trade. All of these mean that we can't simply apply the orthodoxies of 30 or 40 years ago to the context in which we now live or even five or six years ago.' He added: ""You can't simply go back to the Milton Friedman and Margaret Thatcher playbook of the 1970s and 1980s of deregulation and apply that.' The full podcast will be published today and Political Thinking will also be on Radio 4 tomorrow (Saturday) at 5.30pm.

'I got a Â£30 Klarna bill - but I've never used it',"Stephanie McDaid received a Klarna bill although she'd never signed up for its services Last year, Glasgow-based Stephanie McDaid was surprised by a phone call out of the blue from her mum and dad. She was puzzled when they said a parcel for her had been delivered to their house, her former address. The 26-year-old accountant hadn't done any clothes shopping online recently. She arrived to find a Topshop parcel containing a black ""going out"" dress - not in her size - as well as an unexpected Â£30 bill from buy now, pay later firm Klarna.

To use Klarna's pay later service, which defers payments for up to 30 days, shoppers only have to provide a name, email, date of birth, mobile number and billing address. Fraudsters had signed up for the service using some of Stephanie's details - but forgot to change the delivery address to their own. ""I was really lucky.

LiveLiveCovid-19: Welsh Government update2 minutes ago2 minutes ago New Covid vaccine shows 89% efficacy in UK trialsNew Covid vaccine shows 89% efficacy in UK trials5 minutes ago Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules?Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules?10 minutes ago Wales' school return could start after half termWales' school return could start after half termLive Covid-19: Welsh Government update  2 minutes ago,"First Minister Mark Drakeford has been giving a Welsh Government update on the pandemic Level Four lockdown including the closure of licensed premises and non-essential shops will remain in force for another three weeks Some primary school children could begin a phased return to school from 22 February - just after half term - if Covid rates continue to fall, he says People will be allowed to exercise outdoors with one other person they do not live with Single people will be able to change their support bubble and stay with a different household after a 10-day gap Chris Wood and Andy Roberts That's it from our live coverage of the Welsh Government's update on the pandemic.  Here are the main developments:  You can keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. Thanks for joining us and take care. First Minister Mark Drakeford called on people in Wales not to ""exploit"" slight changes to lockdown rules, which include allowing two people from different households to exercise outdoors together. He said it had prompted a ""very lively debate"" among ministers and chief advisors discussing the scope to relax the Level Four restrictions. ""There will be some people who once they can do one thing, want to push that, want to lean on the rules, game the system,"" he said. ""In the end, our conclusion was that, where we could, to make very minor easements but easements which can be very important to some people, we should do that. ""If you think this is an excuse to push the rules, to do more than is allowed, all you do is delay the day when we can lift other restrictions for us all. ""I've referred previously to small acts of selfishness, and it would be a small act of selfishness to try and exploit the very modest steps that we are able to provide today. ""When people do that, they let themselves down and they let other people down as well."" Almost 500 people from the Wrexham area took part in a trial that gave interim results of anew vaccine called Novavax having 89% effectivenessagainst the virus. The study was a collaboration between Public Health Wales, Health and Care Research Wales and Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, with people recruited within a 30-mile radius of the town. In total, 15,000 volunteers were recruited UK-wide. Dr Orod Osanlou, Public Health Wales' principal investigator for the Novavax trial, said: âEven though these are just interim results, itâs promising to see weâre moving in the right direction to hopefully secure the fourth vaccine to help fight against Covid-19 and start saving lives. âWe had such a phenomenal response to our request for trial participants in north Wales and weâre thankful to everyone for selflessly donating their time - without those individuals we wouldnât have been able to have achieved these results."" Biotech firm Novavax has labs in the US (pictured) and has carried out trials in the UK and South Africa People who have already had their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine will be invited for their second jab from 22 February, the first minister said. ""Starting from the 22 February it'll be a rolling programme - those who have been vaccinated first will get their second vaccine first, and so on,"" Mark Drakeford said. Out of more than 360,000 people in Wales to have been vaccinated so far, 717 have already had a second jab. Wales' first minister has said it's âpreferableâ for politicians to follow the lockdown rules when they make the rules themselves. Mark Drakeford was commentingon a trip made by Prime Minister Boris Johnson to Scotlandearlier this week, which was criticised by some including Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon for being ânot essentialâ. The first minister told journalists he had only left Cardiff twice since November and was only leaving his home or place of work âin a genuine emergencyâ. He said: âWe are at level four of a public health emergency, and on the whole, I think it is preferable for people who make rules that we expect other people to follow, to observe them ourselves.â Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has rejected a call by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer for all teachers and support staff to be vaccinated using ""the window"" of the February half term. Sir Keir made the call in relation to England at this week's Prime Minister's Questions. ""I take a different view here in Wales,"" the Labour first minister said. ""When you're in government you have to rely on the advice of those people who are appointed to give you that advice."" Mr Drakeford said the advice from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) ""continues to be that we should prioritise those people who are on those nine groups"" recommended to be vaccinated first. ""When the JCVI changes its advice we will follow the new advice,"" he said. Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said new data from the Office for National Statistics suggested the fall in infections in Wales was levelling off. However, he added: âWe need to be very, very careful. ""In fact we probably need to be looking at what things we could possibly be doing in order to drive down those levels further - for instance, helping people isolate, getting the right level of money to people. ""Too many people are being refused the self-isolation support, and itâs not at the level which enables people to isolate as they would wish.â The first minister said he wants âeverything to be on the tableâ in discussions to determine the safest way of sending children back to school in Wales. Mark Drakeford said that a variety of approaches were being looked at, adding he would prefer to rule nothing out at this stage. âWe have a common aim of getting as many children as safely as possible back into the classroom,"" he said. ""Thatâs what our teachers want, and thatâs what parents and children want as well. âWhether it is reduced groups of people, whether it is part-weeks for some children, whether it is different use of the physical estate, whether itâs a contribution that testing can make to it, I want the longest possible list of solutions to the issues."" Mr Drakeford warned that while it would be his aim to resume face-to-face teaching as early as possible, the fast-changing nature of the virus meant that plans could have to be revised. âI wish I could tell you when I thought all children would be back, but even three weeks is a very long time with this virus,â he said. âWhen it is safe to do so we will bring more children back, and Iâd like to see it build up as quickly as it is safe to do so, but you can only judge that in the circumstances at the time."" First Minister Mark Drakeford was cautious when asked whether activities like golf could restart in Wales in light of the relaxation on meeting another person for exercise. âThe problem is those things all add up cumulatively,"" he said. ""Every bit that you do creates new opportunities for people to get together and when people get together, coronavirus thrives. ""So tough as it is, and frustrating as it is for many people, weâre still at a point in the pandemic where doing the minimum to get together is the right thing to do. ""If we continue to be on the right track, then in three weeks time, maybe we will be able to make some response to those people who make special cases for other forms of activity."" More than a third of a million people in the top priority groups have been given their first dose of Covid-19 vaccine in Wales so far. The aim is to have just under three-quarters of a million people, including health workers and people over 70,given a first dose by mid-February. The daily numbers show 122,412 of the over-80s - 66.9% - have now received a first dose. Meanwhile, just over 73% of care home residents have had their first dose. There is a little overlap between the two groups in these figures. In addition, nearly 77% - that's nearly 27,500 - care home workers have received a vaccine dose. The other key priority group is healthcare workers, with 107,364 of them so far given a vaccine dose. The latest daily figures, however, show the total receiving a first dose up to Thursday night was 362,253 - and the rate has jumped to 11.5% of the population. If this latest daily rate was maintained, the mid-February target for reaching four priority groups, including the over-70s, would be met by 12 February, although at the current daily seven-day average it would take a few days longer. First Minister Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government would not rely on a ""crude"" single piece of data to decide whether to confirm plans tostart fully reopening schools from 22 Februaryafter half term. Ministers would look at many indicators, he said. That included the ""very important threshold of the number of people suffering from coronavirus"", the positivity rate from testing, and the numbers of people being admitted to hospital, as well as ""the mitigation measures that we are able to put in place in schools"". ""We will make a judgement in the round and we will make it in partnership with our colleagues in the local education authorities and the unions who represent all those people who work in our schools,"" the first minister added. A teachers' union leader has said schools in Wales should only reopen fully when it is safe to do so, claiming the announcement of ""arbitrary dates"" was ""profoundly unhelpful"". Dr Patrick Roach, general secretary of the NASUWT, was commenting on the first ministerâs announcement thatschools in Wales could start to reopen for younger pupils from 22 February. ""It is essential that the Wales national lockdown restrictions are supported fully in order to reduce the rates of virus transmission in the wider community and in order to ensure that schools can reopen fully as soon as it is safe to do so whilst minimising the risks to public health,"" Dr Roach said. âIt is important that the majority of children and young people in all schools are now supported to stay at home and that teachers also work from home to provide support for childrenâs learning remotely. âThe Welsh Government must deliver urgently extra support to families during the lockdown, many of whom are experiencing very serious financial difficulties at this time. âGiven previous experience, the announcement of arbitrary dates for schools to reopen to all pupils can be profoundly unhelpful to parents and to those working in schools. ""However, a clear plan for how schools will be fully reopened whenever the lockdown restrictions are lifted remains a key question which the Welsh Government must now work urgently and openly with the profession to address, and I welcome the commitment from the First Minister to work with the education unions on this.â Wales' first minister has called for ""simple, calm negotiation"" in the ongoing row between the European Union and drug-maker AstraZeneca over vaccine supplies. Mark Drakeford said it was better ""to take the temperature out of the difficulties rather than adding to them"". The European Commission has published its contract with AstraZenecaover the drug company's decision to reduce supplies to the EU. Speaking at the Welsh Government's press conference, Mr Drakeford said: ""I don't think threats are ever a good way of arriving at a conclusion. ""What needs to happen here is simple, calm negotiation and discussion. ""Everybody is anxious to get a supply of the vaccine, everybody wants to do the best by their local populations. ""The companies and where governments are involved, getting around the table, having those discussions, coming to an agreement."" There is âunlikely to be much headroomâ for further coronavirus restrictions in Wales to be lifted at the time of the next review, according to the first minister. Mark Drakeford said that despite falling case rates, the gradual reopening of schools was likely to be the only major change to rules in the coming weeks. âThereâs unlikely to be much headroom at the end of the next three weeks for other things to reopen,â he said. âIf things were to continue in the direction they are now, where things are going well, then more headroom may emerge in the month of March."" He said that changes with the spread of the virus could happen quickly, and that it would be difficult to predict when restrictions could start to be eased in the longer term. âWe could be blown off course by things that we know nothing about today,â Mr Drakeford said. âI think itâs sensible for people to look at what we can achieve in the next three weeks and the three weeks beyond, but I think itâs just looking into the tea leaves to think we can predict the future beyond that."" Wales' first minister says he âunderstands the anxietiesâ teaching staff might have in returning back to the classroom. Mark Drakeford said the Welsh Government would ""do everything"" it could to work with teachers and unions to make sure the workplace was âas safe as it can beâ before they return to school. âWe have to work together on this agenda, because we have a common aim of trying to repair the damage that has been done to the education of our young people during the 12 months that has just gone byâ, he said. âI look to all of those who share that ambition to come round the table and make those plans together."" Rules allowing people in Wales to exercise in a public outdoor place with others in their household or support bubble are being amended on Saturday to allow exercise with one person from another household, the Welsh Government has confirmed. ""If you choose to exercise with one person from outside your household or support bubble, you cannot exercise with members of your household or support bubble at the same time,"" a statement said. ""This does not apply to children under 11 who can accompany you on your exercise. ""You should ensure that you maintain social distancing from the person you are exercising with. ""You should also be mindful that exercise must start and finish from your home. You therefore should not travel to meet with someone outside of your household or support bubble.â  Wales' first minister said he is ""very keen"" to give ""two clear weeks notice"" that plans for a phasedreturn of some primary school children to school from 22 Februaryare going ahead. Mark Drakeford said there was a ""lot of hard work to be done on the detail of that"" with local councils and schools, and he wanted that to happen ""intensively next week"". ""By the end of next week we would therefore be in a position to confirm the plans that we will have put together,"" he added at the coronavirus briefing. The new Welsh Conservatives' leader in the Senedd, Andrew RT Davies, has pledged to work with ministers to see the easing of Covid restrictions. ""We want this to be the last lockdown and we will work with the Welsh Government to do whatever it takes to make sure that's the case,"" he said. Allow Twitter content?

The latest figures show that the number of people receiving a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in Wales is now 362,253, which is 11.5% of the population. Deaths with Covid have increased by 29 to 4,695 and positive cases are up by 546 to 190,940. Covid vaccination rates are âgetting faster and fasterâ each day, First Minister Mark Drakeford said today. The Welsh Government had faced criticism last week after rates in Wales were lower than elsewhere in the UK. But daily vaccination rates have since overtaken the other three UK nations, with more than 362,000 people in Wales now having received their first dose. More than 400 GP practices are now offering vaccines, with 34 mass vaccination centres and 17 hospitals being used. âWeâre getting faster and faster with every day that goes by,â said Mr Drakeford, adding that someone was now vaccinated every five seconds. Ministers missed a target of vaccinating 70% of over-80s by last weekend. The next milestone will be the target of vaccinating all those over 70 and the clinically vulnerable by mid-February. Cases of Covid have fallen dramatically since Christmas, but there are still 1,300 patients with the infection in hospital. âDespite the very real progress we have made, itâs too soon to start lifting the lockdown restrictions,â Mr Drakeford said.

Cameron House porter sentenced over fatal fireTwo guests died after a fire broke out in a cupboard at the hotel in West Dunbartonshire in 2017.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Aerial photographs show the extent of the damage to Cameron House A Scottish luxury hotel has been fined half a million pounds over a fire that claimed the lives of two guests. Cameron House has been ordered to pay Â£500,000 after admitting to breaches of fire safety rules. A hotel porter has also been given a community payback order to carry out 300 hours of unpaid work. Richard Dyson, 38, and his partner Simon Midgley, 32, died in the hotel blaze on the banks of Loch Lomond in December 2017. The fire started after night porter Christopher O'Malley, 35, placed a plastic bag of ash in a cupboard containing kindling and newspapers. O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act. Christopher O'Malley admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act Sheriff William Gallacher said the families of Mr Dyson and Mr Midgley will ""always endure the heartbreak"" caused by the fire. Cameron Housepreviously pleaded guiltyto two charges of failing to take fire safety measures which were necessary to ensure the safety of staff and guests. Survivor Hannah Munns, who was in the room next to the couple, said she felt ""ignored and angry"" after the sentencing. Ms Munns toldBBC Radio Scotland's Drivetime: ""Two men have lost their lives, many families have been impacted and they (Cameron House) continue to trade. They are barely going to notice it."" She also criticised the lack of communication since the blaze and said she could not make sense of O'Malley's ""ridiculous"" actions. But Ms Munns added she felt more aggrieved at the fine handed down to Cameron House. She said: ""That's nothing. No lessons will be learned from that. Nothing will change as a result of that. ""It just feels like no-one has taken it very seriously. I am just in shock, really. It is almost saying our lives don't matter."" Richard Dyson, left, and Simon Midgley, right, who both died, had been on a winter break in Scotland Dumbarton MSP Jackie Baillie said the fire had been devastating for the victims' families. The Scottish Labour interim leader spoke to Mr Midgley's mother, Jane, after the sentencing and said she remains ""heartbroken"". Ms Baillie added: ""What we heard today, in the context of two young men losing their lives, does not seem enough to her. ""We have a major hotel on the banks of Loch Lomond that failed to heed the advice given to them by the fire brigade and others. ""The deaths of these two young men did not need to happen at all."" Dumbarton Sheriff Court heard staff were not properly trained in the safe disposal of ash and no written procedures were in place. That was contrary to recommendations made in two fire risk assessments carried out by an independent company in 2016 and 2017. There was no safe system for emptying the ash bins outside the hotel, which is next to Loch Lomond. The day before the fatal fire, O'Malley had discovered they were both full. They had not been emptied since October 2017, two months before the 18 December blaze. In August 2017, the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service told managers not to store combustibles - like kindling and newspapers - in the concierge cupboard, but staff continued to do so. This video can not be played CCTV captures moment hotel fire takes hold Peter Gray QC, acting for Cameron House, said the failings were not deliberate breaches but occurred ""as a result of genuine errors"". He also told the court the fire had gone undetected for a long period before being discovered, and that the hotel had a ""suite of measures in place"" to deal with fire safety. Sheriff William Gallacher also heard of an incident three nights before the fatal fire, when O'Malley and another night porter were told not to put ash into plastic bags because it was a fire hazard. Mr Gray said it was therefore ""extremely difficult to understand"" why O'Malley did not follow this guidance on the night of the fire. Fatal hotel fire caused by ash left in cupboard Couple killed in hotel fire named Mum 'tortured' by son's death in hotel fire After the sentencing, Alistair Duncan, head of the Health and Safety Investigation Unit, said: ""The failings on the part of Cameron House Resort and Christopher O'Malley led to the deaths of Simon Midgley and Richard Dyson. ""This incident should serve as a reminder to other companies that failure to implement the necessary fire safety measures can have terrible consequences."" Stuart Stevens, assistant chief officer of the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service, said the ""needless loss of two lives"" could have been prevented. Det Insp Stuart Grainger from Police Scotland said: ""While nothing will ever diminish the pain of their loss, we hope that the conclusion of this case brings at least a small measure of comfort."" The interior of the hotel reception where the fire started in the concierge cupboard The court was previously told O'Malley, of Renton, West Dunbartonshire, deeply regretted his actions and they were not deliberate. More than 200 guests were staying in the hotel when an initial fire alarm sounded at about 06:40. O'Malley opened the door and flames took hold, spreading to the hall. He and two others tried to fight the blaze with fire extinguishers, but were overcome by the flames. The overflowing ash bins outside the luxury hotel Firefighters arrived within 10 minutes to find a ""well-developed"" fire in the mansion, which is near Balloch in West Dunbartonshire. It was after 08:00 when it was discovered that Mr Dyson, 38, and Mr Midgley, 32, were missing. Firefighters wearing breathing apparatus found Mr Dyson on a landing at the top of a staircase. Mr Midgley was lying in a fire escape passageway. Paramedics pronounced him dead at the scene. Mr Dyson was taken to hospital, where he was also pronounced dead. Post-mortem examinations said the men's causes of death had been inhalation of smoke and fire gases. The couple had travelled from London, and were staying at the five-star resort as the final stop on their winter break to Scotland.

Tyson turned down stereotypical roles for black women, agreeing only to play characters that were strong, positive and realistic. ""I have managed Miss Tyson's career for over 40 years, and each year was a privilege and blessing,"" her manager Larry Thompson said in Thursday's statement announcing her death. ""Cicely thought of her new memoir as a Christmas tree decorated with all the ornaments of her personal and professional life. Today she placed the last ornament, a star, on top of the tree,"" the manager said, adding that she died peacefully. Tyson's memoir Just As I Am was published on Tuesday andVulture wrote about seven highlights from the book,external, including her accidentally hanging up on Mr Obama's aide ringing to tell her she had won the prestigious medal. Lupita Nyong'o and Tyson embraced at last year's National Equal Justice Awards dinner in New York ""'Oh please,' I said laughing, feeling sure it was a prankster talking some foolishness,"" she recalled. ""How did you even get this number? She tried to persuade me that her declaration was true, but I wouldn't hear of it'."" It also mentioned how she met her future husband, trumpeter Miles Davis, in the 60s after he knocked on the door of his neighbour Diahann Carroll's house, where Tyler was a guest. He appeared in just a robe, to ask for some sugar. Vulture said the book later went on to detail the couple falling out after their marriage, after Tyson first sniffed out ""the stench of Miles's philandering"". They were married from 1981 to 1988. Tyson spoke at the 47th AFI Life Achievement Award honouring fellow actor Denzel Washington Born in New York's Harlem, she was raised by her devoutly religious parents from the Caribbean island of Nevis.

By 1957, she was acting in off-Broadway productions and went on to gain small roles in feature films before she was cast as Portia in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter in 1968. After paying tribute, US broadcaster and actress Oprah Winfrey said: ""She used her career to illuminate the humanity of black people. The roles she played reflected her values; she never compromised."" Tyson recently told CBS interviewer Gayle King: ""I had no idea I would touch anybody."" Allow Twitter content?

In 1973, Tysontold the BBC's Film Programme,externalshe hoped the acclaim for her role in Sounder ""allows me to be considered for roles simply because I'm a good actress rather than because I'm a black actress, which limits my ability to work.

China warns Taiwan independence 'means war',"China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province China has warned Taiwan that any attempt to seek independence ""means war"". The warning comes days after China stepped up its military activities and flew warplanes near the island. It also comes after new US President Joe Biden reaffirmed his commitment to Taiwan, and set out his stance in Asia. The US has called China's latest warning ""unfortunate"", adding that tensions did not need to lead to ""anything like confrontation"". China sees democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province, but Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, with its own constitution, military, and elected leaders. Taiwan reports 'large incursion' by Chinese war jets The Taiwan-sized problem for the next US president What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Analysts say Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and it wants to warn President Tsai Ing-wen against taking steps in that direction. President Tsai, however, has repeatedly said that Taiwan is already an independent state, making any formal declaration unnecessary. On Thursday, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian defended the recent military activities near Taiwan, saying they were ""necessary actions to address the current security situation in the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty and security"". ""They are a solemn response to external interference and provocations by 'Taiwan independence' forces,"" he added. ""We warn those 'Taiwan independence' elements - those who play with fire will burn themselves, and Taiwan independence means war."" China and Taiwan have had separate governments since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has long tried to limit Taiwan's international activities and both have vied for influence in the Pacific region Tensions have increased in recent years and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to take the island back Although Taiwan is officially recognised by only a handful of nations, its democratically elected government has strong commercial and informal links with many countries Like most nations, the US has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but a US law does require it to provide the island with the means to defend itself The US responded later on Thursday. ""We find that comment unfortunate,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters, in the first statement by the new administration on China-Taiwan relations. Mr Kirby added that the Pentagon ""sees no reason why tensions over Taiwan need to lead to anything like confrontation"". The new US administration led by Joe Biden, seen here in a 2013 photo with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, is expected to maintain pressure on China The new US administration is expected to maintain pressure on China over a wide range of issues including human rights, trade disputes, Hong Kong and Taiwan, amid the deteriorating relationship between the two powers. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, meanwhile, said China should ""not underestimate"" the island's determination to defend its sovereignty and uphold freedom and democracy. China's official spokespeople try not to talk about war. They almost always emphasise that theirs is a peace-loving country. China is not a nation with a history of expeditionary military confrontation far beyond what it regards as its borders. However, under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has repeatedly said that it would use military force to prevent any move towards formal independence by Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade province. Threatening a war isn't as nuanced as talk of military intervention. It's blunt, more frightening. It is different too. Military intervention could come in a multitude of ways; not necessarily an out-and-out war between two competing sides and their allies. But Taiwan's status is a red line for Beijing, a part of what it regards as its unimpeachable territorial integrity. An ""internal affair"", alongside Hong Kong. The language deployed by the government spokespeople may not always be this provocative but when it comes to Taiwan it's fair to assume this is what China is, ultimately, willing to resort to. In January 2020 Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen told the BBC that China needed to respect the will of Taiwanese people. ""We don't have a need to declare ourselves an independent state,"" she said.

Here are this eveningâs headlines:  The anniversary of the UK's first Covid cases is an ""appropriate"" time for people to thank all NHS workers, the head of the health service has said. NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens praised treatment innovations on a visit to Newcastle's Royal Victoria Infirmary on Friday. The hospital treated the UK's first two Covid-19 patients a year ago. The pair, a Chinese student and his mother, were in York when they fell ill with the virus. Sir Simon said: ""These are the staff here at this hospital in Newcastle who treated the first coronavirus patients in England a year ago. ""Since then, hospitals across the country have looked after more than 300,000 severely ill coronavirus patients so I do think, on this one year anniversary, it is appropriate for the whole country to say a huge thank you to every member of staff across the health service."" You can read more from Sir Simon here. The UK is ""carefully considering"" its next steps after the EU introduced export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under Northern Ireland's Brexit deal, all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. Cabinet Office minister Michael
Gove has spoken with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ to express
the UKâs concern over a lack of notification from the EU about its actions in
relation to the NI protocol. ""Gove told him the UK would now be carefully
considering next steps,"" Downing Street said in a statement. The incident happened at one of New Zealand's managed isolation hotels in Auckland An employee at a quarantine hotel in New Zealand has been sacked after what officials described as an inappropriate encounter with a person who should have been isolating. Officials say the pair shared notes, including one written on a face mask, before spending 20 minutes in a room together. Covid-19 Response Minister Chris Hipkins said it was ""unacceptable"": ""I didn't enquire specifically into the nature of the encounter, but the fact it was a 20-minute encounter, it was long enough for me to be unacceptable,"" he said. He added that the staff member had brought a bottle of wine to the room. People returning to New Zealand have to spend at least 14 days in isolation. The country has been hailed as one of the world's leaders in containing the virus. It has recorded 25 deaths since the beginning of the pandemic. Earlier this week, it reported its first case of Covid-19 outside of quarantine facilities in more than two months. Read more here. Andy Burnham with Matt Healy of the band The 1975 - in pre-social distancing times Record labels should help bail out small music venues struggling to survive the pandemic, Greater Manchester's mayor Andy Burnham says. Burnham, a former culture secretary, is calling on the ""big players"" in music to pay a levy, just as football clubs do for grassroots facilities. The musicians who go on to sustain the industry often start in ""critical"" small venues, he says. The Music Venue Trust says 30 venues are at imminent risk of permanent closure because of the pandemic, with hundreds more in trouble. You can read more about Burnham's comments here. American evacuees from the Chinese city of Wuhan disembark at a US military base on 29 January 2020. In late January, a cargo aircraft carrying nearly 200 Americans - the first to be evacuated from Wuhan, China - landed at a military base in California. They were greeted by health officials who did not wear the proper protective gear and had also been advised to avoid the ""bad optics"" of wearing any. As civilians disembarked and began to quarantine at the base, there were no officials leading an effort to manage ""infection control and prevention measures"" and little PPE on hand for the officials present. Days later, these officials boarded commercial airlines and flew to other parts of the country. These details - initially the subject of a whistleblower complaint against the US health department - are the findings of a federal watchdog's investigation into how the US handled its first up-close encounter with the virus. The âmost troubling findingâ is that the handling of the 
Wuhan evacuees âincreased the risk of infection transmission not only to
 deployed [government] personnel, but also to the American public as a 
whole,â wrote lead investigator Henry Kerner in a letter to President Joe Biden on Thursday. The US is now well past 25 million total cases of the virus. Over 433,000 Americans have died.

The Navy Times reports that 41 crew members aboard the USS Chafee have either been infected with the virus or been in close contact with sick shipmates.

dirty mask or face (non-judicial punishment)."" An official spokesman for the ship's fleet has however disputed the reporting and said: ""The ship remains able to meet its mission."" The warship - currently stationed in California - typically docks in Hawaii, which has seen over 25,000 cases of the virus and over 400 deaths. Shane HarrisonBBC NI Dublin correspondent Cross-border travel with Northern Ireland and Britain makes a ""zero Covid"" strategy unlikely to work, an Irish expert says A senior member of the Republic of Ireland's National Public Health Emergency Team hasrejected the ""zero Covid"" strategy advocated by opposition politicians. Those supporting the measure point to Australia and New Zealand's approach of suppressing the virus with much stricter lockdowns and rules on inbound travel. But Prof Philip Nolan said it was a ""false promise"" to say Ireland could go from the highest level of restrictions to the lowest levels ""in the space of weeks or months"" - adding that it ""won't happen"". Prof Nolan, who chairs the government's epidemiological modelling advisory group, said it ""would be an incredibly risky thing to do because we will inevitably be a leaky country and get re-introduction of the disease and that could easily be new variants"". The Irish government has always cited the open border with Northern Ireland and the lack of restriction on travel between Northern Ireland and Great Britain as reasons why a zero Covid policy would be unlikely to work. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau is cracking down on non-essential airline travel in and out of the country. He says the countryâs main airlines have agreed to cancel service to âall Caribbeans destinations and Mexicoâ until the end of April. In addition, the government will mandate new testing and quarantine requirements for people returning to Canada. âNew variants of Covid-19 pose a real challenge to Canada,â
 says Mr Trudeau. âThatâs why we need to take extra measures.â It comes as media reports suggest Canadians are escaping to more sunny destinations amid the chilly and virus-afflicted winter. âWith the challenges we currently face with Covid-19, both here at home and abroad, we all agree that now is just not the time to be flying,"" says Mr Trudeau. That's all from the AstraZeneca press conference. Researchers are asked about comments made by French President Emmanuel Macron, where he questioned how effective the vaccine was in over-65s. In response, Prof Pollard says there's ""good evidence"" to support the use of vaccine, including a strong immune response in older adults. He says there is much more limited data on efficacy in older adults but that doesn't mean there is necessarily a lack of protection. He adds ""everything points to the likelihood"" the vaccine will offer the same level of protection across all age groups. Prof Pollard says it is ""perhaps a misunderstanding"" of the data by the French president. Menelaos Pangolas, executive vice president of biopharmaceuticals R&D, is asked about the half dose of the vaccine that appeared to show better efficacy. Trials showed 62% effectiveness for two doses. But a subset of data showed that when people were given a half dose then a full dose, effectiveness hit 90%. Pangolas says he is ""very confident"" with the dosing regimen they have, adding they are no longer needing to explore the half dose. He says hopefully when the data is published that will become apparent. Away from the AstraZeneca press conference, the EU has temporarily overridden a section of the Northern Ireland Brexit deal as part of its export controls on coronavirus vaccines. The EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc, amid a row about delivery shortfalls. Under the Brexit deal all products should be exported from the EU to NI without checks or controls. But the EU believed this could be used to circumvent export controls, with NI becoming a backdoor to the wider UK. It has therefore invoked Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol which allows parts of the deal to be unilaterally overridden. You can read the full story here. The Associated Press asks Soriot whether the company will look at today with ""some regret"" given the disputes with the EU. He says ""a lot has been done"" to provide the vaccine to the bloc. Soriot says nine months ago the firm had nothing and the company is focused on supplying the EU, but everyone has to recognise it's ""a complicated process"". He says what has been done ""people take for granted"". It is not simple and is indeed very complicated, he says. ""We are really trying to catch up - there's not much more we can do."" Researchers are asked about the South African variant and its impact on vaccine efficacy. Prof Pollard says he doesn't have the data on what sort of effect the variant will have on the AstraZeneca vaccine. But he says he when you look at the changes in the spike protein caused by the variant, researchers would expect an ""impact on efficacy"" in vaccines. He says some of this has been shown in the data released in the last 24 hours for the Janssen and Novavax vaccines. But he says the ""really good news"" is if new vaccines do need to be made they can be done within a ""matter of months"". It's not like the situation a year ago, where it took a year of development, he says. He also says that although there are some concerns about new variants, it's still possible the current vaccines will be able to prevent severe disease and hospitalisation. AstraZeneca's Pascal Soriot is asked about a problem with production of the vaccine at a factory in Belgium. He says the firm never mentions any of its partners, but adds that it has had ""teething issues"" in terms of the yield of vaccine at some of its production sites. ""We're talking about biology manufacturing here,"" he says, adding that making vaccines ""is extremely complicated"". ""It's not like doing an orange juice,"" he says. ""Everybody's on a learning curve, which usually you develop over year. We've had months. ""Some sites are more advanced."" He says the reasons for yield issues vary from site to site, but adds: ""We believe we have now fixed most of the issues and the productivity of the sites should improve rapidly over the next few months."" AstraZeneca is ""ready to launch"" its vaccine in the US as soon as it is approved by the regulator, the firm's chief executive says. Pascal Soriot says the firm has been working ""hand in hand"" with the US to manufacture the jab. Executive vice president Mene Pangolas says the US study is fully recruited and they are now waiting for enough Covid cases to be able to report their data. He says he imagines this will be in February. Asked whether he is concerned that some EU states are considering not giving the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine to over 65s, Prof Andrew Pollard says ""there's no reason to be concerned about using it"". He stresses it ""can be used in all ages"", but adds that ""we have to respect how member states choose to use the vaccine"". Prof Pollard says the team is ""very confident in the data that we have"", adding that they have ""data showing that there's good immune response in older adults"". He also notes that trials are still running in the UK and Brazil, so ""there's a lot more data to come"". Asked by Alistair Smout of Reuters about Astra Zeneca's requirement to fulfil its ""best efforts"" to supply the vaccine to the EU, the company's chief executive officer Pascal Soriot says he is going to disappoint him with his reply. Soriot declines to answer and says he only wants to talk about the positive news of the deal to approve the AstraZeneca vaccine for use in the EU. Â© 2025 BBC.

Anger as trading in GameStop shares restrictedShares in the games firm dive as major trading platforms try to control frenzied buying.BusinessComments,"Amateur investors are responding with outrage after trading platforms curbed buying of shares in the US games firm GameStop and other companies. The moves by Robinhood and Interactive Brokers follow days of frenzied trading that led to massive gains for some stocks. Shares in GameStop dived by as much as 55% after the restrictions. It is the latest twist in a battle that has pitted amateur investors against Wall Street giants. Major hedge funds had bet billions of dollars that GameStop's shares would fall. But they have faced major losses after amateurs, swapping tips on social media sites such as Reddit, drove up the share price by more than 700% in a week. Other firms, such as AMC Entertainment, Koss Corp and BlackBerry, also saw sharp gains. They were embraced by day traders after hedge funds bet against them. The activity has drawn questions from regulators, who are monitoring trading amid fears of illegal actions. GameStop: What is it and why is it trending? 'Failing' firm soars in value as amateurs buy stock Victims typically lose Â£45,000 in investment scams However, the amateur investors say they are just playing Wall Street at its own game. In online forums they discussed legal action and accused Robinhood and other brokerages enacting their own form of market manipulation by restricting purchases of certain shares. Robinhood co-founder Vladimir Tenev tweeted that the firm had taken its decision based on regulatory requirements, and said limited buys of the restricted stocks would be allowed from Friday.

Myron Sakkas says traders like him are angry ""They support a capitalist free market only when it works for them. What we saw today was not a free market and it forced an awful lot of people to lose an awful lot of money,"" said 18-year-old Myron Sakkas of Coventry, a student at Warwick University. Myron, who has had an account on the Trading 212 platform since August last year, said he had lost Â£30 on Gamestop shares, which he owned for ""a couple of hours"" and sold when he saw what was happening. Myron said he had since been locked out of his account and unable to use it while his identity is being checked. But when he gains access again, he plans to take out the Â£1,000 he has in it and call a halt. Though hoping to go into investment banking after he gets his degree, he said he was disillusioned by what he sees as ""market manipulation"" directed against people like him. ""When ordinary people try to make money in a system where only rich traders can make money, that's what happens,"" he told the BBC. ""Maybe I won't trade for a while, to be honest,"" he added. ""I've got other stuff to do."" Key to what's going on is ""short selling"" or ""shorting"", where a big investment company such as a hedge fund tries to make money by betting that a company's share price will fall. The hedge fund borrows shares in a company from other investors (for a fee) and sells the shares on the markets at, for example, $10 each, waits until they fall to $5, and buys them back. The borrowed shares are returned to the original owner, and the hedge fund pockets a profit. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But in the last week, amateur investors who follow the Wall Street Bets forum on Reddit have poured money into buying the company's stock with the aim of pushing up the price. If the price rises dramatically, short sellers face big losses and they need to buy back the shares they have borrowed quickly to prevent bigger losses  - a process known as covering. However, buying back the shares only adds to demand for the stock and pushes its price higher still. And amateurs aren't the only ones getting in on the action. This week, for example, private equity firm Silver Lake Group, which had loaned money to AMC Entertainment, converted its bonds to shares after the surge in the firm's prices, a swap worth hundreds of millions of dollars. In the US, anger over the trading restrictions united politicians whose stances typically sharply diverge. Senator Sherrod Brown, a Democrat who is taking over as chair of the banking committee, said he would hold a hearing about the ""state of the stock market"". ""People on Wall Street only care about the rules when they're the ones getting hurt,"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A one-word tweet by the billionaire entrepreneur on Tuesday - he tweeted ""Gamestonk!!"" -had been seen as giving Gamestop shares an extra boost. The fracas follows a jump in casual investing during the pandemic, which saw people stuck at home with time on their hands and limited places to spend pour money into the market. This video can not be played Despite the economy shrinking, US stocks have rallied The surge has produced ripples of worry on Wall Street, including concerns that inexperienced investors could cause bubbles in certain stocks or were dabbling in investments with risks they did not fully understand. Robinhood - which has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of the new interest in investing - has faced particular scrutiny for the way its app has made investment seem like a game. Last year, Massachusetts regulators filed a complaint accusing the company of marketing to inexperienced users and failing to protect them. Officials said this week they were following the market battle. Press secretary Jen Psaki said Wednesday President Joe Bidenâs economic team, including newly-appointed Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen, was âmonitoring the situationâ.

China warns Taiwan independence 'means war'The warning comes days after China stepped up military activities near the self-governed island.,"China sees Taiwan as a breakaway province China has warned Taiwan that any attempt to seek independence ""means war"". The warning comes days after China stepped up its military activities and flew warplanes near the island. It also comes after new US President Joe Biden reaffirmed his commitment to Taiwan, and set out his stance in Asia. The US has called China's latest warning ""unfortunate"", adding that tensions did not need to lead to ""anything like confrontation"". China sees democratic Taiwan as a breakaway province, but Taiwan sees itself as a sovereign state, with its own constitution, military, and elected leaders. Taiwan reports 'large incursion' by Chinese war jets The Taiwan-sized problem for the next US president What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? Analysts say Beijing is becoming increasingly concerned that Taiwan's government is moving the island towards a formal declaration of independence and it wants to warn President Tsai Ing-wen against taking steps in that direction. President Tsai, however, has repeatedly said that Taiwan is already an independent state, making any formal declaration unnecessary. On Thursday, Chinese defence ministry spokesman Wu Qian defended the recent military activities near Taiwan, saying they were ""necessary actions to address the current security situation in the Taiwan Strait and to safeguard national sovereignty and security"". ""They are a solemn response to external interference and provocations by 'Taiwan independence' forces,"" he added. ""We warn those 'Taiwan independence' elements - those who play with fire will burn themselves, and Taiwan independence means war."" China and Taiwan have had separate governments since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has long tried to limit Taiwan's international activities and both have vied for influence in the Pacific region Tensions have increased in recent years and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to take the island back Although Taiwan is officially recognised by only a handful of nations, its democratically elected government has strong commercial and informal links with many countries Like most nations, the US has no official diplomatic ties with Taiwan, but a US law does require it to provide the island with the means to defend itself The US responded later on Thursday. ""We find that comment unfortunate,"" Pentagon press secretary John Kirby told reporters, in the first statement by the new administration on China-Taiwan relations. Mr Kirby added that the Pentagon ""sees no reason why tensions over Taiwan need to lead to anything like confrontation"". The new US administration led by Joe Biden, seen here in a 2013 photo with Chinese leader Xi Jinping, is expected to maintain pressure on China The new US administration is expected to maintain pressure on China over a wide range of issues including human rights, trade disputes, Hong Kong and Taiwan, amid the deteriorating relationship between the two powers. Taiwan's Mainland Affairs Council, meanwhile, said China should ""not underestimate"" the island's determination to defend its sovereignty and uphold freedom and democracy. China's official spokespeople try not to talk about war. They almost always emphasise that theirs is a peace-loving country. China is not a nation with a history of expeditionary military confrontation far beyond what it regards as its borders. However, under Xi Jinping's leadership, China has repeatedly said that it would use military force to prevent any move towards formal independence by Taiwan, which it regards as a renegade province. Threatening a war isn't as nuanced as talk of military intervention. It's blunt, more frightening. It is different too. Military intervention could come in a multitude of ways; not necessarily an out-and-out war between two competing sides and their allies. But Taiwan's status is a red line for Beijing, a part of what it regards as its unimpeachable territorial integrity. An ""internal affair"", alongside Hong Kong. The language deployed by the government spokespeople may not always be this provocative but when it comes to Taiwan it's fair to assume this is what China is, ultimately, willing to resort to. In January 2020 Taiwan's president Tsai Ing-wen told the BBC that China needed to respect the will of Taiwanese people. ""We don't have a need to declare ourselves an independent state,"" she said. This video can not be played President Tsai Ing-wen tells China to âface realityâ and show Taiwan respect What's behind China-Taiwan tensions?

No cause of the death was given. The former fashion model had a career that spanned seven decades. Tyson won two Emmys for her performance in the 1974 civil rights-era film The Autobiography of Miss Jane Pittman. She also became the first black woman to take on a main role in the TV drama East Side/West Side in the 1960s. Presenting Tyson with the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2016, the then US President Barack Obama said that apart from her achievements as an actress, she had also shaped the course of history.

Tyson turned down stereotypical roles for black women, agreeing only to play characters that were strong, positive and realistic. ""I have managed Miss Tyson's career for over 40 years, and each year was a privilege and blessing,"" her manager Larry Thompson said in Thursday's statement announcing her death. ""Cicely thought of her new memoir as a Christmas tree decorated with all the ornaments of her personal and professional life. Today she placed the last ornament, a star, on top of the tree,"" the manager said, adding that she died peacefully. Tyson's memoir Just As I Am was published on Tuesday andVulture wrote about seven highlights from the book,external, including her accidentally hanging up on Mr Obama's aide ringing to tell her she had won the prestigious medal. Lupita Nyong'o and Tyson embraced at last year's National Equal Justice Awards dinner in New York ""'Oh please,' I said laughing, feeling sure it was a prankster talking some foolishness,"" she recalled. ""How did you even get this number? She tried to persuade me that her declaration was true, but I wouldn't hear of it'."" It also mentioned how she met her future husband, trumpeter Miles Davis, in the 60s after he knocked on the door of his neighbour Diahann Carroll's house, where Tyler was a guest. He appeared in just a robe, to ask for some sugar. Vulture said the book later went on to detail the couple falling out after their marriage, after Tyson first sniffed out ""the stench of Miles's philandering"". They were married from 1981 to 1988. Tyson spoke at the 47th AFI Life Achievement Award honouring fellow actor Denzel Washington Born in New York's Harlem, she was raised by her devoutly religious parents from the Caribbean island of Nevis. After being discovered by a fashion editor at Ebony magazine her modelling career took off. By 1957, she was acting in off-Broadway productions and went on to gain small roles in feature films before she was cast as Portia in The Heart Is a Lonely Hunter in 1968. After paying tribute, US broadcaster and actress Oprah Winfrey said: ""She used her career to illuminate the humanity of black people. The roles she played reflected her values; she never compromised."" Tyson recently told CBS interviewer Gayle King: ""I had no idea I would touch anybody."" Allow Twitter content?

Tyson was nominated for a best actress Oscar and Golden Globe in 1973 for Sounder, about a family of poor black sharecroppers in the midst of the Great Depression in 1933 Louisiana. In 1973, Tysontold the BBC's Film Programme,externalshe hoped the acclaim for her role in Sounder ""allows me to be considered for roles simply because I'm a good actress rather than because I'm a black actress, which limits my ability to work.

The Tony Awards also nominated her in 2013 for lead actress for the play The Trip to Bountiful, about an unhappy, elderly woman desperate to visit her girlhood home before she dies. Tyson also appeared in 2011 film The Help and TV shows including 1977's Roots, season four of House of Cards andthe recent How to Get Away with Murder, which starred Viola Davis.

New Covid vaccine shows 89% efficacy in UK trialsThe Novavax jab is the first to show it is effective against the UK variant of the virus.UK,"Biotech firm Novavax has labs in the US (pictured) and has carried out trials in the UK and South Africa A new coronavirus vaccine has been shown to be 89% effective in large-scale UK trials. The Novavax jab is the first to show in trials that it is effective against the new virus variant found in the UK, the BBC's medical editor Fergus Walsh said. The UK has secured 60 million doses of the jab, which will be made in Stockton-on-Tees in north-east England. Meanwhile,a single-dose vaccine developed by Janssen is 66% effective, trial results have shown. Janssen, a company owned by Johnson & Johnson, is also investigating whether giving two doses will give either stronger or longer-lasting protection. The company said its initial findings showed one dose prevented 85% of severe cases. Both the Novavax and Janssen jabs will need to be reviewed by regulators before they can be used. EU chief wants AstraZeneca jab contract published When will I get a Covid vaccine? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery The PM welcomed the ""good news"", with doses of the Novavax jab expected to be delivered in the second half of this year if approved for use by the Medicines and Healthcare Products Regulatory Agency (MHRA), the government said. The UK has so far approved three coronavirus vaccines for emergency use - one from Oxford University and AstraZeneca, another by Pfizer and BioNTech, and a third from drug firm Moderna. The Novavax jab, which is given in two doses, was shown to be 89.3% effective at preventing Covid-19 in participants in its Phase 3 clinical trial in the UK, and around 86% effective at protecting against the new UK variant. The jab's efficacy against the original Covid-19 strainwas calculated to be 95.6%,external. The Phase 3 trials - the final stage before a vaccine is looked at by a regulator - enrolled more than 15,000 people aged between 18-84, of whom 27% were older than 65, US firm Novavax said. In the South African part of the trial, where most of the cases were the South African variant of the virus, the vaccine was 60% effective among those without HIV. Stan Erck, chief executive of Novavax, said the results from the UK trial were ""spectacular"" and ""as good as we could have hoped"", while the efficacy in South Africa was ""above people's expectations"". He told the BBC the manufacturing plant in Stockton-on-Tees should be up and running by March or April, with the company hoping to get approval for the vaccine from the MHRA around the same time. This video can not be played Novavax chief executive: UK trial results are ""spectacular"" Minister Lucy Frazer told BBC Breakfast the government could not put an exact timeframe on when the Novavax jab might be approved as the regulation process is ""out of our control"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the new vaccine would be ""another weapon in our arsenal to beat this awful virus"", if approved. Prof Paul Heath, chief investigator of the UK Novavax trial, said the trial findings were ""enormously exciting"", particularly because of the jab's efficacy against the UK variant. These extremely encouraging trial results suggest another powerful vaccine against coronavirus could soon be within reach. It works in a slightly different way to the ones that are already available - but does the same job of teaching the body's immune system to recognise and fight the pandemic virus. What is more, it appears to be effective against emerging and more infectious variants of coronavirus too - something scientists have feared might not be possible because the vaccines were all designed to match the original virus, not these new, mutated versions. Protection against illness from the new UK variant was high - around 86%. Even with the South Africa variant, which has undergone the most worrisome changes, it offered a level of protection similar to that given by flu shots against influenza. England's chief medical officerProf Chris Whitty said,external, if the jab is approved, it ""increases our future resilience"" against the virus. Nadhim Zahawi, the UK minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said he was ""particularly thrilled"" to see the positive results as he had taken part in Novavax's trials himself.

In total,the UK has ordered100 million doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine and 40 million of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - both are currently being rolled out in the UK. Another 17 million doses of the Moderna vaccine, which was approved by the MHRA in early January, are expected in the spring. The aim is to give everyone in the top four priority groups - up to 15 million people - a first dose by mid-February. Pfizer and Moderna vaccines rely on technology that has not been used in previous vaccines, but the Novavax jab uses a more traditional method of recreating part of the spike protein of the virus to stimulate the immune system. How does the Pfizer vaccine work? Watch: Covid vaccine differences Ministers take part in Covid vaccine trial Like the Oxford vaccine, the Novavax jab can be stored at regular fridge temperature - which means it can be distributed more easily. More than 7.4 million people in the UK have so far received a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine,according to the latest government figures.,external Meanwhile,the latest estimate for the UK's R rate,externalfrom the government's scientific advisory group, Sage, is 0.7 to 1.1. It means that on average, every 10 people with the virus will infect between seven and 11 other people. Last week, the R rate was between 0.8 and 1. The latest growth rate range is between -5% and 0%, indicating that the number of new infections is broadly flat or shrinking by up to 5% every day. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Separately, the EU's vaccine contract with AstraZenecahas been published, in a growing row over reduced supplies of their jab. Kate Bingham, who used to chair the UK's Vaccine Taskforce, said the reason the UK had a good supply of vaccines compared with other countries was because of its ability to get clinical trials completed quickly and at a high standard through the NHS's registry - with some 400,000 volunteers signing up ""before the US even started their Phase 3 studies"". The UK recorded a further 1,239 deaths within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test on Thursday. There have also been another 28,680 new infections.
