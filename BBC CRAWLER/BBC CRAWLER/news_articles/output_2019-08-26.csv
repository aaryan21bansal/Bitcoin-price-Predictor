Pork pie makers and No 10 clash over Johnson claim,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson's claim on pork pie exports was queried by the head of the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association The humble Melton Mowbray pork pie is at the centre of an unlikely political dispute about British exports. Boris Johnson had said pork pies are exported to Thailand and Iceland, but cannot be to the US due to red tape. However the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association said the pies were not even exported to Thailand and Iceland. Downing Street insisted pies were exported, citing producer Walker & Son - but the company said this was not correct. Walker & Son told the BBC it had previously exported a ""tiny amount"" of pork pies to Singapore, but had not done so for ""at least two years"" and is now ""entirely focused on the UK market"". When asked if the company had ever exported to any other countries, the spokeswoman said she was unsure. The topic of pork pies arose on Sunday at the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, when Mr Johnson was discussing a possible post-Brexit free trade deal with the US. Mr Johnson spoke about trying to ""prise open the American market"" by removing restrictions on UK exports. Offering an example of an American trade restriction,Mr Johnson said:""Melton Mowbray pork pies, which are sold in Thailand and in Iceland, are currently unable to enter the US market because of, I don't know, some sort of food and drug administration restriction."" Matthew O'Callaghan - who chairs the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association, which represents the pies' makers - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, as far as he knew, the claim was wrong. Asked if Mr Johnson was right, Mr O'Callaghan replied: ""Not really. With all of these things there is a little bit of give and take. We don't actually export to Thailand or Iceland."" When pressed again, Mr O'Callaghan said: ""Not that I know of I'm afraid. ""It is certainly available in Iceland the shop."" Mr O'Callaghan said there was a possibility that pies could be exported frozen to the US or Australia and cooked in the country. Speaking about trading with the US, Mr O'Callaghan said: ""A Melton Mowbray pork pie is a delicate fresh meat product so the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), like most other countries in the world, are very aware of meat products and you have to go through all the regulations to get them over there. ""Because of the short shelf life it is not really viable economically."" UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Trump adviser 'No chance of US deal' if Brexit hits Irish accord What trade deals has the UK done so far? In response to Mr O'Callaghan, No 10 said the PM was correct when he said that Melton Mowbray pork pies are exported to Thailand and Iceland. His remarks, it added, were based on a briefing note from the Department for International Trade, which said the company Walker & Sons exports small shipments to Iceland, Thailand, Singapore and the Caribbean. It said the information came from a document produced by Walker & Son. However, when contacted by the BBC, Walker & Son - which says it makes and bakes 80% of all of the UK's Melton Mowbray pork pies - said it no longer exports pork pies.

Trump 'would meet Rouhani if circumstances right',"This video can not be played Trump: 'We're not looking for leadership change in Iran' US President Donald Trump says he is open to meeting Iran's President Hassan Rouhani under the right circumstances. It comes after Iran's foreign minister made a brief and unannounced visit to the G7 summit in France on Sunday. Relations between Iran and the US have deteriorated since Washington withdrew last year from a 2015 deal to limit Iran's nuclear activities. However, on Monday, Mr Trump said he had ""good feelings"" about the prospect of a new nuclear deal with Iran. ""Iran is not the same country it was two and a half years ago when I came into office,"" he told reporters at a joint G7 press conference with French leader Emmanuel Macron. ""I really believe that Iran can be a great nation... but they can't have nuclear weapons,"" he said, adding that they had to be ""good players"" before he would agree to a meeting. Earlier on Monday, Mr Rouhani said he was ready to meet anyone if he felt it would benefit Iran. ""If I am sure that attending a session or having a meeting with someone will help develop my country and resolve the people's problems, I will not hesitate to do so,"" he said. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Can the nuclear deal can be saved? Iran and the crisis in the Gulf explained Mr Trump's remarks came at the close of the G7 summit - where leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - met in Biarritz. Other issues they discussed included world trade,external, fires in the Amazon, and developments in Ukraine, Libya and Hong Kong. What is the G7 and what does it do? G7 countries to provide $22m to fight Amazon fires Tensions with Iran have been heightened since the US unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal, and re-imposed sanctions. Other parties to the agreement - the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China - have sought to salvage the nuclear deal. On Sunday, Iranian Foreign MinisterMohammad Javad Zarif said he had had ""constructive"" talks with his French counterpart, and Mr Macron, on the sidelines of the G7 talks in Biarritz. Mr Macron, who has taken an active role to try to save the accord, said he had informed Mr Trump of his plan to invite Mr Zarif, after discussions with Iranian officials on possible solutions. He said he believed the ""conditions for a meeting"" between Mr Trump and Mr Rouhani ""in the next few weeks"" had been established. ""Nothing is set yet and things are still fragile, but technical discussions have started with some real progress,"" he said, adding that he had told Mr Rouhani that ""if he accepts a meeting with President Trump, I am convinced an agreement can be found"". The 2015 agreement involved Iran limiting its nuclear activities for between 10 and 15 years, in return for sanctions relief. The deal restricted Iran's enrichment of uranium and required it to allow international inspections. The accord also stipulated that Iran should redesign a heavy-water reactor being built so that it could not produce any weapons-grade plutonium. The US withdrew from the deal in May 2018, and issued a list of 12 ""requirements"" for a new nuclear deal and the lifting of US sanctions. These included Iran curbing its ballistic missile programme, and ending its involvement in regional conflicts. Iran has described the requirements as unacceptable. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained At Monday's press conference, Mr Trump said that for any new deal, he was ""looking for no nuclear weapons, no ballistic missiles and a longer period of time"". It is not clear whether Iran would accept any new conditions - Iran's state-run Press TV, quoting unnamed sources, said that Iran had rejected talks about its missile programme, as ""non-negotiable"". Meanwhile, Mr Macron said that ""we need to be sure Iran will never get nuclear weapons"", but he recognised the Iranians would also want ""economic compensation of some form"" to convince them to agree to additional security demands. Mr Trump also appeared to be open to this, as he said talks were already under way for other countries to potentially provide Iran with credit, secured by oil, to keep its economy afloat. The US would not be paying, but there was the possibility of ""a letter of credit... from numerous countries"", he said.

G7 countries to provide $22m to fight Amazon fires,"This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state International leaders at the G7 summit have agreed to provide logistical and financial support to help fight fires in the Amazon rainforest. French President Emmanuel Macron said G7 countries would release $22m (Â£18m). However, President Jair Bolsonaro said Mr Macron's plan of an ""alliance"" to ""save"" the Amazon treated Brazil ""as if we were a colony or no man's land"". Tens of thousands of fires are burning in Brazil, mostly in the Amazon, according to the country's space research agency. The funding pledge was announced as the leaders of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - continue to meet in Biarritz, France. Mr Macron said the funds would be made available ""immediately"" - primarily to pay for more fire-fighting planes - and that France would also ""offer concrete support with military in the region within the next few hours"". However, Mr Bolsonaro - who has been engaged in a public row with Mr Macron in recent weeks - accused the French leader of launching ""unreasonable and gratuitous attacks against the Amazon region"", and ""hiding his intentions behind the idea of an 'alliance' of G7 countries"". He wrote on Twitter that Brazil's sovereignty should be respected - and said he had discussed with Colombia's president the need for ""a joint plan"" from the countries that actually made up the Amazon region. Despite Mr Bolsonaro's comments, his environment minister, Ricardo Salles, told reporters that the funding was welcome, Reuters news agency reports. Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? What is the 'historic' EU-Mercosur trade deal? President Macron last week described the fires as an ""international crisis"" and pushed for them to be prioritised at the G7 summit which his country is hosting. G7 leaders also intend to discuss plans to reforest the Amazon, at the United Nations general assembly meeting in September. The severity of the fires, and the response by Brazil's government, has prompted a global outcry and protests. According to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), more than 75,000 fires have been recorded in Brazil so far in 2019, most of them in the Amazon region. This is the highest number of fires in the same period since 2010, though some way off the record of 133,000 in 2005. Critics have accused Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, of ""green lighting"" the Amazon's destruction through anti-environmental rhetoric and a lack of action on deforestation violations. On Friday, facing mounting pressure from abroad, President Bolsonaro authorised the military to help tackle the blazes. The Defence Ministry has said that 44,000 troops are available to help in the effort and officials said on Sunday that military intervention has been authorised in seven states. Warplanes have also been drafted in to dump water on the areas affected. The president tweeted on Sunday that he had also accepted an offer of support from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Protests calling for intervention have continued in Brazil across the weekend President Bolsonaro has previously been critical of the response of foreign governments and accused them of interfering in Brazil's national sovereignty. On Saturday, EU Council president Donald Tusk admitted it was hard to imagine the bloc ratifying the long-awaited EU-Mercosur agreement - a landmark trade deal with South American nations - while Brazil was still failing to curb the blazes. As criticism mounted again last week, Finland's finance minister went as far as calling for the EU to consider banning Brazilian beef imports altogether. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil, but satellitedata published by Inpe has shown an increase of 85% this year,external. Environmental activists have drawn links between President Bolsonaro's attitudes towards the environment and the recent surge in the number of fires in the famous rainforest. This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land President Bolsonaro has been accused of emboldening miners and loggers who deliberately start fires to illegally deforest land. Earlier this monthhe accused Inpe of trying to undermine his governmentwith data revealing sharp increases in deforestation levels. BBC analysis has also found that the record number of fires being recorded also coincide with a sharp drop off in finesbeing handed out for environmental violations. Neighbouring Bolivia is also struggling to contain fires burning in its forests. On Sunday President Evo Morales suspended his re-election campaign and said he was prepared to accept international help to tackle blazes in his country's Chiquitania region. As the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It spans a number of countries, but the majority of it falls within Brazil. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change It is known as the ""lungs of the world"" for its role in absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. The rainforest is also home to about three million species of plants and animals and one million indigenous people. Amazon: Lungs of the planet Political leaders, celebrities and environmentalists are among those who have called for action to protect the Amazon. Thousands of protesters have also taken to the streets across the world calling on governments to intervene. On Sunday, Pope Francis also joined the call to protect the rainforest. ""We are all worried about the vast fires that have developed in the Amazon. Let us pray so that with the commitment of all, they can be put out soon. That lung of forests is vital for our planet,"" he told thousands of people in St Peter's Square.

Job of all MPs is to deliver Brexit - Johnson,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: Brexit ""is a matter for parliamentarians to get right ourselves"" ""The job of everybody in Parliament"" is to deliver Brexit, the PM has said at the end of the G7 summit in France. Boris Johnson also said he was ""marginally more optimistic"" about striking a new Brexit deal with the EU. But he refused to be drawn on whether he would suspend Parliament to stop it preventing a no-deal exit. Mr Johnson's comments come as MPs from other partiesprepare to meetto discuss ways to avoid the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hopes to win a vote of no confidence in the government and then delay Brexit to stop a no-deal exit. Asked about the possibility of MPs thwarting plans to leave the EU at the end of October, Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's the job of everybody in Parliament to get this thing done. ""I think it's what the people want, I also think, by the way, it's what our friends and partners on the other side of the Channel want - they want it over."" Corbyn: General election will stop Brexit 'crisis' What is a vote of no confidence? Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? On Sunday, Mr Johnson had told the BBCthe chances of securing a new Brexit deal were ""touch and go""- but on Monday he said: ""I am marginally more optimistic."" He continued: ""But, remember that all statistical estimates that I give about the chances of a deal - whether they are expressed in odds of millions to one, or getting closer, or hotter or colder, or whatever - they all depend exclusively on the willingness of our friends and partners to compromise on that crucial point and to get rid of the backstop and the current withdrawal agreement."" Labour leader Mr Corbynwants to calla vote of no confidence in the government to prevent a no-deal Brexit. If he were to win a vote, Mr Corbyn plans to become a caretaker prime minister, delay Brexit, call a snap election and campaign for another referendum. However, in Biarritz on Monday, Mr Johnson reiterated his determination to stop Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister. ""One of my many missions in life is to protect the people of this country from the appalling consequences of a Labour government,"" Mr Johnson said. He added that Mr Corbyn, if in power, ""would also renege, reject, revoke the mandate of the people"". ""I cannot think of anything worse for democracy or for trust in politics and I very much hope that does not happen,"" he said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In the last few days there's been a sort of dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals"" Beginning his final speech at the G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - Mr Johnson said that in ""every conversation"" he had had with his fellow leaders, he had been ""struck by their enthusiasm to expand and strengthen their relations with our country"". He added the subjects discussed included ""the biggest global challenges confronting us all today"". Referencing both the fires in the Amazon rainforest and a global decline in biodiversity, Mr Johnson said nations could not just ""sit back as animals and plants are wiped off the face of the planet"". The summit comes just two months before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. Mr Johnson previously said if the UK left without a deal, the UK would keep a ""very substantial"" part of the Â£39bn former prime minister Theresa May had agreed to pay the EU in her withdrawal agreement - the deal which British MPs rejected three times. But, responding, European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the UK must honour commitments made during its EU membership, and said this was ""especially true in a no-deal scenario"". European press sees growing Johnson-Trump bond Pork pie makers and No 10 clash over Johnson claim She said that ""settling accounts is essential to starting off a new relationship on the right foot"". Guy Verhofstadt, the European Parliament's Brexit co-ordinator, said: ""If the UK doesn't pay what is due, the EU will not negotiate a trade deal."" The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have all accepted an invitation to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss his proposals to avert a no-deal Brexit on Tuesday. But Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said Mr Corbyn's plansrisks jeopardising a potential vote of no confidence in the government. She said the discussions should examine how to seize control of Commons business, oust Mr Johnson and install an emergency ""government of national unity"". The Labour leader's insistence on being interim leader meant there was a danger not enough MPs would support the vote, Ms Swinson said.

This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In the last few days there's been a sort of dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals"" Beginning his final speech at the G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - Mr Johnson said that in ""every conversation"" he had had with his fellow leaders, he had been ""struck by their enthusiasm to expand and strengthen their relations with our country"". He added the subjects discussed included ""the biggest global challenges confronting us all today"". Referencing both the fires in the Amazon rainforest and a global decline in biodiversity, Mr Johnson said nations could not just ""sit back as animals and plants are wiped off the face of the planet"". The summit comes just two months before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. Mr Johnson previously said if the UK left without a deal, the UK would keep a ""very substantial"" part of the Â£39bn former prime minister Theresa May had agreed to pay the EU in her withdrawal agreement - the deal which British MPs rejected three times. But, responding, European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the UK must honour commitments made during its EU membership, and said this was ""especially true in a no-deal scenario"".

Corbyn warned over no-confidence vote,"Jo Swinson said the success of a no-confidence vote ""must be the priority"" Jeremy Corbyn risks jeopardising a vote of no confidence in the government by insisting he becomes caretaker PM, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said. If he wins a no-confidence vote, the Labour leader plans to form an emergency government and then delay Brexit to avoid a no-deal scenario. But in a new letter, Ms Swinson said Mr Corbyn's insistence on being interim leader meant there was a danger not enough MPs would support the vote. Labour did not respond to the letter. Instead, the party referred to comments made by its shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, who on Sunday described Ms Swinson as ""extremely petulant"" for dismissing Mr Corbyn's initial proposal to lead a temporary government. Corbyn: General election will stop Brexit 'crisis' What is a vote of no confidence? Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. On Sunday, he told the BBCthe chances of securing a new Brexit deal were ""touch and go"", having previously said the odds of no deal were ""a million to one"". Ahead of cross-party talks on how to avoid no deal - due to take place on Tuesday - Ms Swinson said the discussions should examine how to seize control of Commons business, oust Mr Johnson and install an emergency ""government of national unity"". In her letter to Mr Corbyn, Ms Swinson added: ""Insisting you lead that emergency government will therefore jeopardise the chances of a no confidence vote gaining enough support to pass in the first place. ""As you have said that you would do anything to avoid no deal, I hope you are open to a discussion about how conceding this point may open the door to a no-confidence vote succeeding. Its success must be the priority."" Jeremy Corbyn's plans to avert a no-deal Brexit have been met with resistance by some key potential allies Earlier this month, Mr Corbyn outlined his plans to avert a no-deal Brexit - which involve him becoming a caretaker prime minister - but wasmet with resistance from some key potential allies. Ms Swinson and Conservatives opposed to no deal were among those who rejected the idea of Mr Corbyn being interim leader, but Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon criticised the Lib Dem leader's stance, adding that ""nothing should be ruled out"". Mr Corbyn said he would call a no-confidence vote at the ""earliest opportunity when we can be confident of success"". That cannot happen before 3 September, when MPs return from summer recess. In order for such a vote to succeed, Labour would require support from across the House of Commons, including the Lib Dems, the SNP and Conservative rebels. Ms Swinson has suggested Tory MP Ken Clarke and former deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman as possible caretaker leaders, and both have expressed willingness to do the role, she said. In her letter, Ms Swinson also called on Mr Corbyn to ""clarify"" his position on whether he was opposed to Brexit altogether. The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have all accepted the invitation to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss proposals for an alternative government to be formed when Parliament returns in September. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Labour's Barry Gardiner told Sophy Ridge on Sky News on Sunday Labour was offering a ""failsafe procedure to stop no deal"" by holding a vote of no confidence followed by a temporary government to set up a general election. What is a vote of no confidence? Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it is more likely Parliament will force Boris Johnson to delay a no deal and the question is whether in these circumstances he will think it is the right thing to call an election. ""My view is that an election at this point will not solve the problem we have - and the problem we have is making sure that we do not inflict harm on ourselves, by leaving the EU with no deal.""

Johnson & Johnson fined in landmark opioid ruling,"This video can not be played Oklahoma Attorney General: Johnson & Johnson built its brand out of ""greed"" Drugmaker Johnson & Johnson must pay $572m (Â£468m) for its part in fuelling Oklahoma's opioid addiction crisis, a judge in the US state has ruled. The company said immediately after the judgement that it would appeal. The case was the first to go to trial out of thousands of lawsuits filed against opioid makers and distributors. Opioids were involved in almost 400,000 overdose deaths in the US from 1999 to 2017, according to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Since 2000, some 6,000 people in Oklahoma have died from opioid overdoses, according to the state's lawyers. Earlier this year, Oklahoma settled with OxyContin maker Purdue Pharma for $270m and Teva Pharmaceutical for $85m, leaving Johnson & Johnson as the lone defendant. What are opioids and what are the risks? Why opioids are such an American problem The teachers battling opioid overdose fears During Oklahoma's seven-week non-jury trial, lawyers for the state argued that Johnson & Johnson carried out a years-long marketing campaign that minimised the addictive painkillers' risks and promoted their benefits. The state's lawyers had called Johnson & Johnson an opioid ""kingpin"" and argued that its marketing efforts created a public nuisance as doctors over-prescribed the drugs, leading to a surge in overdose deaths in Oklahoma. Johnson & Johnson vigorously denied wrongdoing, arguing that its marketing claims had scientific support and that its painkillers, Duragesic and Nucynta, made up a tiny fraction of opioids prescribed in Oklahoma. Judge Thad Balkman, of Cleveland County District Court in Norman, Oklahoma, said prosecutors had demonstrated that Johnson & Johnson contributed to a ""public nuisance"" in its deceptive promotion of highly addictive prescription painkillers. ""Those actions compromised the health and safety of thousands of Oklahomans.The opioid crisis is an imminent danger and menace to Oklahomans,"" he said in his ruling. The payment would be used for the care and treatment of opioid addicts, he said. The outcome of the case is being closely watched by plaintiffs in about 2,000 opioid lawsuits due to go to trial in Ohio in October, unless the parties can reach a settlement. This video can not be played On America's trail of destruction The state's case rested on a ""radical"" interpretation of the state's public nuisance law, Johnson & Johnson said. The company said in a statement that since 2008, its painkillers had accounted for less than 1% of the US market, including generics. ""The decision in this case is flawed. The State failed to present evidence that the company's products or actions caused a public nuisance in Oklahoma,"" it said. ""This judgement is a misapplication of public nuisance law that has already been rejected by judges in other states."" Sabrina Strong, the lawyer representing Johnson & Johnson, said: ""We have sympathy for all who suffer from substance abuse, but Johnson & Johnson did not cause the opioid abuse crisis here in Oklahoma, or anywhere in this country. ""We do not believe that the facts or the law supports the decision today. We have many strong grounds for appeal, and we intend to pursue those vigorously."" The company added that it wants the fine to be put on hold during its appeal process, which could last until 2021. The Oklahoma case was brought by the state's Attorney General, Mike Hunter. ""Johnson & Johnson will finally be held accountable for thousands of deaths and addictions caused by their actions,"" he said after the ruling. ""There's no question in my mind that these companies knew what was going on at the highest level, they just couldn't quit making money from it and that's why they're responsible."" One Oklahoma state attorney, Reggie Whitten, told US reporters: ""This is very personal to all of us. My partner lost a niece to this opioid epidemic. I lost my firstborn son to the opioid epidemic."" The company's share price rose following the ruling because investors had been expecting a much bigger fine, says BBC North America correspondent Peter Bowes. Jared Holz, healthcare strategist for financial services company Jefferies, said: ""The expectation was this was going to be a $1.5bn to $2bn fine, and $572m is a much lower number than had been feared.""

A supporter of the Brazilian president mocked Mr Macron's wife, Brigitte, 66, in a Facebook post. The post contained a photo contrasting the French first lady's appearance with that of Mr Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle Bolsonaro, 37. ""Now you understand why Macron is persecuting Bolsonaro?"" it reads. In response to the comment, Mr Bolsonaro wrote (in Portuguese): ""Do not humiliate (him)... man, ha ha."" Asked about Mr Bolsonaro's remarks, Mr Macron said it was ""extraordinarily rude"" and ""sad"". Jair Bolsonaro with his wife Michelle in a presidential convoy ""He said very disrespectful things about my wife. I have great respect for the Brazilian people and can only hope they soon have a president who is up to the job,"" Mr Macron said at a news conference at the G7 summit in Biarritz on Monday. The exchange highlights the acrimony between Mr Macron and Mr Bolsonaro in a diplomatic spat sparked by the Amazon fires.

Mr Macron is spearheading efforts to get world leaders to do something about the fires ravaging parts of the Amazon rainforest.

"Trump 'would meet Rouhani if circumstances right'The US president says he has ""good feelings"" that a new nuclear deal with Iran could work.US & Canada","This video can not be played Trump: 'We're not looking for leadership change in Iran' US President Donald Trump says he is open to meeting Iran's President Hassan Rouhani under the right circumstances. It comes after Iran's foreign minister made a brief and unannounced visit to the G7 summit in France on Sunday. Relations between Iran and the US have deteriorated since Washington withdrew last year from a 2015 deal to limit Iran's nuclear activities. However, on Monday, Mr Trump said he had ""good feelings"" about the prospect of a new nuclear deal with Iran. ""Iran is not the same country it was two and a half years ago when I came into office,"" he told reporters at a joint G7 press conference with French leader Emmanuel Macron. ""I really believe that Iran can be a great nation... but they can't have nuclear weapons,"" he said, adding that they had to be ""good players"" before he would agree to a meeting. Earlier on Monday, Mr Rouhani said he was ready to meet anyone if he felt it would benefit Iran. ""If I am sure that attending a session or having a meeting with someone will help develop my country and resolve the people's problems, I will not hesitate to do so,"" he said. Iran nuclear crisis in 300 words Can the nuclear deal can be saved? Iran and the crisis in the Gulf explained Mr Trump's remarks came at the close of the G7 summit - where leaders from Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - met in Biarritz. Other issues they discussed included world trade,external, fires in the Amazon, and developments in Ukraine, Libya and Hong Kong. What is the G7 and what does it do? G7 countries to provide $22m to fight Amazon fires Tensions with Iran have been heightened since the US unilaterally withdrew from the 2015 nuclear deal, and re-imposed sanctions. Other parties to the agreement - the UK, France, Germany, Russia and China - have sought to salvage the nuclear deal. On Sunday, Iranian Foreign MinisterMohammad Javad Zarif said he had had ""constructive"" talks with his French counterpart, and Mr Macron, on the sidelines of the G7 talks in Biarritz. Mr Macron, who has taken an active role to try to save the accord, said he had informed Mr Trump of his plan to invite Mr Zarif, after discussions with Iranian officials on possible solutions. He said he believed the ""conditions for a meeting"" between Mr Trump and Mr Rouhani ""in the next few weeks"" had been established. ""Nothing is set yet and things are still fragile, but technical discussions have started with some real progress,"" he said, adding that he had told Mr Rouhani that ""if he accepts a meeting with President Trump, I am convinced an agreement can be found"". The 2015 agreement involved Iran limiting its nuclear activities for between 10 and 15 years, in return for sanctions relief. The deal restricted Iran's enrichment of uranium and required it to allow international inspections. The accord also stipulated that Iran should redesign a heavy-water reactor being built so that it could not produce any weapons-grade plutonium. The US withdrew from the deal in May 2018, and issued a list of 12 ""requirements"" for a new nuclear deal and the lifting of US sanctions. These included Iran curbing its ballistic missile programme, and ending its involvement in regional conflicts. Iran has described the requirements as unacceptable. This video can not be played Feeling the squeeze: Iran sanctions explained At Monday's press conference, Mr Trump said that for any new deal, he was ""looking for no nuclear weapons, no ballistic missiles and a longer period of time"". It is not clear whether Iran would accept any new conditions - Iran's state-run Press TV, quoting unnamed sources, said that Iran had rejected talks about its missile programme, as ""non-negotiable"". Meanwhile, Mr Macron said that ""we need to be sure Iran will never get nuclear weapons"", but he recognised the Iranians would also want ""economic compensation of some form"" to convince them to agree to additional security demands. Mr Trump also appeared to be open to this, as he said talks were already under way for other countries to potentially provide Iran with credit, secured by oil, to keep its economy afloat. The US would not be paying, but there was the possibility of ""a letter of credit... from numerous countries"", he said.

"Latest Bolton takeover bid collapsesThe latest takeover deal to buy Bolton has collapsed with administrators warning the ""process of closing down the company"" could begin as early as Wednesday.","Only 5,454 fans attended Bolton's 5-0 loss to Ipswich on Saturday - the lowest attendance for a league game at the University of Bolton Stadium in its 22-year history Bolton Wanderers are on the brink of liquidation after the latest deal to buy the club collapsed. The League One side has until 17:00 BST on Tuesday to complete the sale or offer reasons for an extension, or face expulsion from the EFL. But administrators say the 145-year-old club is not in a position to carry on trading and ""the process of closing down"" could start on Wednesday. That would lead to its liquidation and the loss of over 150 jobs. Paul Appleton, joint administrator for Bolton Wanderers, said the deal collapsed on Saturday and, despite working around the clock since, they are still some way from reaching a solution. He said in a statement: ""Unless there is a change of position from any of the parties involved, the process of closing down the club and ultimately placing Bolton Wanderers into liquidation will begin this week."" The EFL said that if Bolton, one of the founder members of the Football League in 1888, cannot complete the sale or provide credible plans to continue, they will be served with a 14-day notice for their expulsion from the league. But that may prove irrelevant if Wanderers, who finished seventh in the Premier League and competed in Europe a little over a decade ago, cease to exist. The club has been in administration since May, saw manager Phil Parkinson quit in midweek and conceded five goals for a third consecutive game in front of arecord low crowdat the University of Bolton Stadium on Saturday. EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans said on Sunday: ""What is really disappointing is that on Saturday morning, our understanding was that all the parties involved had signed off and the deal was going to be completed yesterday morning. ""Then something happened, a signature wasn't provided and therefore it was postponed again. This is incredibly frustrating. It has been going on for months."" Describing the collapse, Appleton added: ""At this stage, there seems little point in apportioning blame because that makes no difference to the staff, players, management, supporters and the community who have once more seen their club taken back to the brink. ""On Sunday evening, there was some tentative dialogue but we are still some way from reaching a solution. Therefore, I am appealing to those parties whose position seems intractable to do everything to reach a compromise. ""In just over 24 hours, the club will have its membership of the EFL revoked. Over and above that, the club is currently not in a position to carry on trading and, as such, the process of closing down the company will commence on Wednesday. ""This will ultimately lead to its liquidation, the expulsion of the club from the EFL and the inevitable loss of over 150 jobs. More than that, it will devastate a community for whom the football club is a beacon of hope and expectation."" Mike Minay, BBC Radio Manchester This has set panic alarms ringing across the University of Bolton Stadium - with a real fear that the club may not have a future. There are four options that face Bolton in the next 24 hours: three positive, one severely negative. The first being that somehow the parties involved revert to the agreed deal that was in place on Friday. The second would see a compromise between Ken Anderson and the Eddie Davies Trust - creditors who are owed around Â£7m. The third option, with so little time remaining, is that another buyer comes to the table with cash. The fourth is the most concerning.

Johnson: A Brexit deal is now 'touch and go',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In the last few days there's been a sort of dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals"" Boris Johnson has said the chances of a Brexit deal are ""touch and go"" - having previously said the odds of a no-deal Brexit were ""a million to one"". In a BBC interview at the G7 summit in France, he said it ""all depends on our EU friends and partners"". When pressed on the chances, he said: ""I think it's going to be touch and go. But the important thing is to get ready to come out without a deal."" Donald Tusk told the PM the EU is open to alternatives to the backstop. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said the European Council president and Mr Johnson held talks on Sunday, which were in a ""genuinely positive atmosphere"". But she said Mr Tusk repeated the EU's position that any alternatives to the Irish backstop would have to be ""realistic"" and ""immediately operational"". An EU official added the meeting had ""mainly restated known positions"" and Brussels had been hoping for ""new elements to unblock the situation"". Mr Johnson and Mr Tusk discussed the possibility of meeting again in New York The two menclashed on Saturdayover who would be ""Mr No Deal"" - the person to blame in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson has previously said the UK must leave on 31 October ""deal or no deal"", but that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening are a ""million to one"". Asked if people would still be able to get their medicine if there was a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister told the BBC: ""That is certainly a guarantee that we can make."" But he added: ""I do not want at this stage to say there won't be unforeseen difficulties."" Trump: UK is losing 'anchor round its ankle' Tusk and Johnson clash over who is 'Mr No Deal' Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Speaking at the G7 summit on Sunday, he reiterated his desire to scrap the backstop from the current withdrawal agreement, saying it could keep the UK ""locked in"" EU rules, if a trade deal is not agreed after Brexit. He said: ""I think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK."" Mr Johnson said he was an ""optimist"" and thought the EU would understand there is an ""opportunity to do a deal"". The PM also said if there is no deal, the UK would keep a ""very substantial"" part of the Â£39bn Theresa May had agreed to pay the EU in her withdrawal agreement. The G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of October. Mr Johnson and other world leaders have gathered for the G7 summit in Biarritz, France Mrs May struck a withdrawal agreement with the EU - the so-called ""divorce deal"" - but British MPs rejected the deal three times. Mr Johnson wants to remove the Irish backstop from the deal but the EU has consistently ruled this out, saying it will not renegotiate the agreement. If implemented, the backstop - a last resort should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit - would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. This week German ChancellorAngela Merkel suggested there could be an alternativeto the backstop but the onus was on the UK to find it. But the next day French President Emmanuel Macron said the backstop was""indispensable"" to preserving political stability and the single market. This video can not be played President Trump said Boris Johnson was the ""right man"" to deliver Brexit Also on Sunday, the PM met President Donald Trump to discuss a trade deal between the UK and the US. Mr Johnson said the US's aim to strike a deal within a year was ""going to be tight"", adding: ""These [Americans] are tough guys."" Meanwhile, former chancellor Philip Hammond has written to the PM about theleaked Operation Yellowhammer documents on preparations for a no-deal Brexit. He said it was now apparent the document was dated August 2019, and therefore could not have been leaked by a minister from Mrs May's government.

Man behind 'Labour isn't working' poster dies,"The spin doctor responsible for the famous ""Labour isn't working"" poster during Margaret Thatcher's general election campaign has died aged 77. Lord Bell was surrounded by his family when he died following a ""prolonged illness"", said close friend and business partner Piers Pottinger. The poster was regarded as having made a key contribution to Mrs Thatcher's general election triumph in 1979. He was awarded a knighthood by Mrs Thatcher and a peerage by Tony Blair. The poster that helped Margaret Thatcher win her first election campaign The poster, showing a snaking queue of unemployed people, is said to have changed political advertising in the UK. Lord Bell co-founded the public relations firm Bell Pottinger, which went into administration in 2017. Mr Pottinger described Lord Bell as a ""pioneer in political communication"". ""He was a devoted family man and passionate supporter of the Conservative Party, most famously helping Margaret Thatcher win three general elections,"" he added.

Latest Bolton takeover bid collapses,"Only 5,454 fans attended Bolton's 5-0 loss to Ipswich on Saturday - the lowest attendance for a league game at the University of Bolton Stadium in its 22-year history Bolton Wanderers are on the brink of liquidation after the latest deal to buy the club collapsed. The League One side has until 17:00 BST on Tuesday to complete the sale or offer reasons for an extension, or face expulsion from the EFL. But administrators say the 145-year-old club is not in a position to carry on trading and ""the process of closing down"" could start on Wednesday. That would lead to its liquidation and the loss of over 150 jobs. Paul Appleton, joint administrator for Bolton Wanderers, said the deal collapsed on Saturday and, despite working around the clock since, they are still some way from reaching a solution. He said in a statement: ""Unless there is a change of position from any of the parties involved, the process of closing down the club and ultimately placing Bolton Wanderers into liquidation will begin this week."" The EFL said that if Bolton, one of the founder members of the Football League in 1888, cannot complete the sale or provide credible plans to continue, they will be served with a 14-day notice for their expulsion from the league. But that may prove irrelevant if Wanderers, who finished seventh in the Premier League and competed in Europe a little over a decade ago, cease to exist. The club has been in administration since May, saw manager Phil Parkinson quit in midweek and conceded five goals for a third consecutive game in front of arecord low crowdat the University of Bolton Stadium on Saturday. EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans said on Sunday: ""What is really disappointing is that on Saturday morning, our understanding was that all the parties involved had signed off and the deal was going to be completed yesterday morning. ""Then something happened, a signature wasn't provided and therefore it was postponed again. This is incredibly frustrating. It has been going on for months."" Describing the collapse, Appleton added: ""At this stage, there seems little point in apportioning blame because that makes no difference to the staff, players, management, supporters and the community who have once more seen their club taken back to the brink. ""On Sunday evening, there was some tentative dialogue but we are still some way from reaching a solution. Therefore, I am appealing to those parties whose position seems intractable to do everything to reach a compromise. ""In just over 24 hours, the club will have its membership of the EFL revoked. Over and above that, the club is currently not in a position to carry on trading and, as such, the process of closing down the company will commence on Wednesday. ""This will ultimately lead to its liquidation, the expulsion of the club from the EFL and the inevitable loss of over 150 jobs. More than that, it will devastate a community for whom the football club is a beacon of hope and expectation."" Mike Minay, BBC Radio Manchester This has set panic alarms ringing across the University of Bolton Stadium - with a real fear that the club may not have a future. There are four options that face Bolton in the next 24 hours: three positive, one severely negative. The first being that somehow the parties involved revert to the agreed deal that was in place on Friday. The second would see a compromise between Ken Anderson and the Eddie Davies Trust - creditors who are owed around Â£7m. The third option, with so little time remaining, is that another buyer comes to the table with cash. The fourth is the most concerning. Administration cannot be afforded for much longer, and therefore a process of winding-up the club and liquidation could begin as soon as Wednesday morning.

Trump says US and China to resume trade talks,"US allies have pressured Donald Trump at the G7 summit, saying the trade war is threatening the world economy President Donald Trump has said the US and China will ""very shortly"" resume trade talks after a weekend of escalating tension with Beijing. ""China called last night... said let's get back to the table. So we'll be getting back to the table,"" he said. On Friday Mr Trump sharply hiked tariffs on billions of dollars of Chinese imports in retaliation for fresh duties from Beijing. China said it was unaware of any recent telephone call with the US on trade. Mr Trump sent out conflicting messages over the weekend, at first appearing to express regret about the latest tariffs,only for the White House to retract his comments on Sunday. However, at the G7 summit in Biarritz on Monday he said Chinese officials had made two ""very, very good calls"" on Sunday night and that Beijing wanted to ""make a deal"". A quick guide to the US-China trade war The US-China trade war in charts US-China trade war: 'We're all paying for this' Suggesting his pressure had brought the Chinese back to the negotiating table, he added: ""They hurt very badly, but they understand this is the right thing to do. ""We're going to start very shortly to negotiate... but I think we're going to make a deal."" The US is trying to force Beijing to reform its trade practices, arguing that American firms face an uneven playing field due to issues such as intellectual property theft. However, US allies have pressured Mr Trump at the G7 summit in France, warning that the trade war is threatening the global economy. This video can not be played Jay Powell or Xi Jinping: Which chairman is Trump's enemy? Asian stock markets tumbled on Monday, but US and European shares ended higher after Mr Trump's more conciliatory comments. However, it was a more mixed picture on Tuesday, as European markets traded lower and most Asian indexes climbed. A report from S&P Global suggested that, despite the apparent detente, investors remained nervous. ""These recent events have shaken investor confidence further, and incrementally worsened the global business and economic outlook,"" it said. On Friday, theUS said it would begin the process of raising tariffs on around $250bn (Â£203.8bn) of Chinese imports,externalfrom 25% to 30% from 1 October. The US also said fresh tariffs on an additional $300bn of Chinese goods, announced earlier this month, would now be at a rate of 15% instead of 10%. The first batch of those tariffs will be introduced in September. In a tweet, Mr Trump saidhe planned to order US firms working in Chinato move their operations back to the US, although it is unclear how he could force them to comply. The moves came after China delivered its latest trade war strike, announcing plans to hit $75bn worth of US goods with new tariffs and hikes to existing duties. In Beijing, foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said he had not heard that talks were about to re-start. But he said: ""We strongly urge the US not to miscalculate the situation and immediately cease its wrong actions. If the US implements its plan of raising tariffs, China will definitely continue to take measures and safeguard its own legitimate rights. China does not accept any threats or intimidation."" The world's two largest economies have been locked in a bruising trade battle for the past year that has seen tariffs imposed on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. This video can not be played Gary Cohn, Trump's former US chief economic adviser, weighs in on US-China trade war Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices, but in China there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise.

Gamer tops e-sports rich list after Dota 2 victory,"Johan ""N0tail"" Sundstein held the Dota 2 contest's trophy aloft after his team's victory in Shanghai A European team has become the first to win one of the highest-profile and most lucrative video games competitions for two years in a row. OG triumphed at Dota 2 tournament The International, defeating runner-up Team Liquid 3-1 in the final on Sunday. OG's five teammates shared the $15.6m (Â£12.7m) top prize. It made team captain Johan ""N0tail"" Sundstein, 25,the top prize-winning e-sports player of all time,external, according to statistics site Esports Earnings. It has calculated the Dane has earned about $6.9m to date. The sum excludes money he has made from sponsorships and online Dota 2 tutorials. Furthermore, his four OG colleagues fill out the other five rankings in the Esports Earnings' list. OG overwhelmed its opponent in the final games of the match It was the first time the annual competition had been held in China in its nine year history. It was organised by Dota 2's developer Valve, but much of the prize pool was crowdfunded by fans buying a ""battle pass"", which unlocked a new game mode and other items in the title. This year'swinnings pot totalled a record $34.3m,external, trumping the $30m shared out among the victors of the Fortnite World Cup in July. Team Liquid walked away with a $4.5m share of the prize. Dota 2 - an acronym for Defense of the Ancients 2 - is a fantasy-themed multiplayer battle-arena game that pits two teams against each other. The goal is to take down the opponent's towers and destroy a structure known as the ""Ancient"" on the other side of the map. Playershave more than 100 characters to choose from,external, each with their own abilities that can be augmented within the game, which adds complexity to the challenge.

Along with 14 other teams, they battled for glory over the six-day-long contest held at Shanghai's Mercedes Benz Arena. This was the second year in a row that OG had won the competitions It had seating capacity for about 18,000 spectators. And many more watched online via the event's official Twitch and SteamTV streams, where commentary was provided in English, Mandarin and Russian. Footage has also been published to YouTube. This was the first time that a Chinese team had not qualified for the grand final since 2013. Home-team PSG.LGD had been knocked out by Team Liquid in a prior round after a closely-fought 2-1 match. Team Liquid looked like it might repeat the trick in the competition's final stage when it beat OG in the first game of the best-of-five match.

Why nuking hurricanes is a bad ideaPresident Donald Trump reportedly suggested bombing hurricanes before they made landfall.,"Hurricane Florence battered the US East Coast last year Using nuclear weapons to destroy hurricanes is not a good idea, a US scientific agency has said, following reports that President Donald Trump wanted to explore the option. The Axios news website said Mr Trump had asked several national security officials about the possibility. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) saidthe results would be ""devastating"",external. Mr Trump has denied making the suggestion. Hurricanes typically affect the US east coast, often causing serious damage. It's not the first time the idea has been considered. Following reports of Mr Trump's suggestion, the hashtag #ThatsHowTheApocalyseStarted has been trending on Twitter. Mr Trump asked why the US couldn't drop a bomb into the eye of the storm,externalto stop it from making landfall, news site Axios said. The NOAA says that using nuclear weapons on a hurricane ""might not even alter the storm"" and the ""radioactive fallout would fairly quickly move with the tradewinds to affect land areas"". The difficulty with using explosives to change hurricanes, it says, is the amount of energy needed. The heat release of a hurricane is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes. Atlantic hurricane season starts early Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Even though the mechanical energy of a bomb is closer to that of the storm, ""the task of focusing even half of the energy on a spot in the middle of a remote ocean would be formidable"", it adds. ""Attacking weak tropical waves or depressions before they have a chance to grow into hurricanes isn't promising either,"" says the NOAA. ""About 80 of these disturbances form every year in the Atlantic basin but only about five become hurricanes in a typical year. There is no way to tell in advance which ones will develop."" The idea of bombing a hurricane has been around since the 1950s when the suggestion was originally made by a government scientist. During a speech at the National Press Club in 1961, Francis Riechelderfer, head of the US Weather Bureau, said he could ""imagine the possibility of someday exploding a nuclear bomb on a hurricane far at sea"". The Weather Bureauwould only begin acquiring nuclear weapons when ""we know what we're doing,external"", he added, according to National Geographic. The NOAA says the idea is often suggested during hurricane season. George Washington University Professor Sharon Squassoni says the idea stems from the Plowshares Program of the 1950s when a ""laundry list of different weird... fantastical, slightly crazy"" uses for nuclear weapons was devised by government researchers. In nearly 20 years, the US exploded 31 warheads in 27 tests in order to test whether America's nuclear arsenal could be used to excavate canals or mines, or create a harbour for ships. As the dangers of radiation became more clear, the notion was dropped, Prof Squassoni tells BBC News, adding that current international treaties would ban the US from exploding a nuclear weapon in a hurricane. Several other outlandish ideas have been floated in recent years, including one Facebook event calling for US gun owners to ""shoot down"" Hurricane Irma in 2017 with bullets and flamethrowers. The event attracted 55,000 people to sign up and was taken seriously enough by one Florida sheriff that he issued a stern warning on Twitter saying: ""You won't make it turn around & it will have very dangerous side effects."" Why some Americans tried to 'shoot down' Hurricane Irma The Atlantic Hurricane season runs from 1 June until the end of November. The peak of the season comes in September when sea temperatures are at their highest. Tropical Storm Dorian is currently swirling towards the Caribbean islands and is forecast to become a hurricane by Tuesday, and will threaten the US island territory of Puerto Rico in the coming days. When asked for a comment by BBC News, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the agency is focused on Dorian and deferred questions on the ""topic of hurricanes and nukes"" to the NOAA guidelines. This video can not be played Hurricane survivorâs unusual new home The NOAA warned earlier this month that conditions were now more favourable for above-normal hurricane activity. It is predicting between 10 and 17 named storms, of which 5-9 will become hurricanes, including 2-4 major hurricanes. Four named storms have formed so far this year. They were Andrea, Barry, Chantal and Dorian.

Giant volcanic rock 'raft' found in Pacific Ocean,"This video can not be played Sailors Tom Whitehead and Shannon Lenz said the floating rocks left ""no water visible"" A vast ""raft"" of volcanic rocks stretching over 150 sq km (58 sq miles) is drifting through the Pacific Ocean, scientists say. The sea of pumice -  the size of 20,000 football fields - was first reported by Australian sailors earlier this month. Experts say the mass probably came from an underwater volcano near Tonga which erupted around 7 August according to satellite images. Sailors have been warned to stay clear of the potential hazard. Pumice is a lightweight, bubble-rich rock that can float in water. It is produced when lava goes through rapid cooling and loss of gases. Sailor Michael Hoult was one of the first to report the volcanic rock raft Large ""rafts"" of the volcanic rock are more likely to form when a volcano is located in more shallow waters, say experts. Massive volcanic 'raft' found near New Zealand Deep sea volcanoes found off Sydney An Australian couple sailing their catamaran to Fiji were the first to report the ""pumice raft"", after inadvertently entering the rubble at night. ""The waves were knocked back to almost calm and the boat was slowed to one knot,"" Michael Hoult and Larissa Brill wrote online on 16 August. The Australian couple collected samples of the pumice ""The rubble slick went as far as we could see in the moonlight and with our spotlight."" They were temporarily stuck after rocks jammed their rudder, but then were able to navigate out of the field. They have since sent samples of the pumice stone - which range ""from marble to basketball size"" - to researchers at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia. Associate Prof Scott Bryan, a geologist studying the samples at QUT,  said such pumice masses could be seen about once every five years in the region. ""It is a phenomenon reported over time, usually as islands in the middle of the ocean that people encounter but then can't find again,"" he told the BBC. ""It can be as if the whole surface [of the ocean] has turned to land"". Associate Prof Bryan said satellite images showed the field had since divided into two main surface masses, with many trailing ""ribbons"" of rock. ""At the moment there are more than a trillion pieces of pumice all floating together, but over time it will break up and disperse across the area,"" he said. The pumice is currently drifting westwards towards Fiji, and is likely to pass New Caledonia and Vanuatu. It has also been forecast to reach Australia. ""It possibly could reach Australia in a year's time, but we don't know if it could even last,"" said Dr Martin Jutzeler from the University of Tasmania. Experts say the pumice is likely to become home to marine life as it drifts across the Pacific on ocean currents. ""A lot of life... can attach themselves to the pumice and be transported thousands of km away.  So it's a way to renew ecosystems somewhere, but it also can introduce invasive species,"" Dr Jutzeler said. If it reaches Australia, that could be a boon for the damaged Great Barrier Reef, some experts say. Rock rafts 'potential cradles of life' Barrier Reef 'coral babies' in mass decline ""This is a potential mechanism for restocking the Great Barrier Reef,"" Associate Prof Bryan said.

Gamer tops e-sports rich list after Dota 2 victoryThe Danish team captain has now won nearly $7m across his career.Technology,"Johan ""N0tail"" Sundstein held the Dota 2 contest's trophy aloft after his team's victory in Shanghai A European team has become the first to win one of the highest-profile and most lucrative video games competitions for two years in a row. OG triumphed at Dota 2 tournament The International, defeating runner-up Team Liquid 3-1 in the final on Sunday. OG's five teammates shared the $15.6m (Â£12.7m) top prize. It made team captain Johan ""N0tail"" Sundstein, 25,the top prize-winning e-sports player of all time,external, according to statistics site Esports Earnings. It has calculated the Dane has earned about $6.9m to date. The sum excludes money he has made from sponsorships and online Dota 2 tutorials. Furthermore, his four OG colleagues fill out the other five rankings in the Esports Earnings' list. OG overwhelmed its opponent in the final games of the match It was the first time the annual competition had been held in China in its nine year history. It was organised by Dota 2's developer Valve, but much of the prize pool was crowdfunded by fans buying a ""battle pass"", which unlocked a new game mode and other items in the title. This year'swinnings pot totalled a record $34.3m,external, trumping the $30m shared out among the victors of the Fortnite World Cup in July. Team Liquid walked away with a $4.5m share of the prize. Dota 2 - an acronym for Defense of the Ancients 2 - is a fantasy-themed multiplayer battle-arena game that pits two teams against each other. The goal is to take down the opponent's towers and destroy a structure known as the ""Ancient"" on the other side of the map. Playershave more than 100 characters to choose from,external, each with their own abilities that can be augmented within the game, which adds complexity to the challenge. What does it take to become a gaming millionaire? Strange words from Dota 2 explained The Fortnite coach who helped create teenage millionaires OG and Team Liquid - which is also Europe-based - had both won the competition once before. Along with 14 other teams, they battled for glory over the six-day-long contest held at Shanghai's Mercedes Benz Arena. This was the second year in a row that OG had won the competitions It had seating capacity for about 18,000 spectators. And many more watched online via the event's official Twitch and SteamTV streams, where commentary was provided in English, Mandarin and Russian. Footage has also been published to YouTube. This was the first time that a Chinese team had not qualified for the grand final since 2013. Home-team PSG.LGD had been knocked out by Team Liquid in a prior round after a closely-fought 2-1 match. Team Liquid looked like it might repeat the trick in the competition's final stage when it beat OG in the first game of the best-of-five match. But a change of tactics saw OG dominate the next two games before going on clinch the title. Thousands of spectators bought tickets to watch the game on giant screens Allow Twitter content?

Why nuking hurricanes is a bad idea,"Hurricane Florence battered the US East Coast last year Using nuclear weapons to destroy hurricanes is not a good idea, a US scientific agency has said, following reports that President Donald Trump wanted to explore the option. The Axios news website said Mr Trump had asked several national security officials about the possibility. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) saidthe results would be ""devastating"",external. Mr Trump has denied making the suggestion. Hurricanes typically affect the US east coast, often causing serious damage. It's not the first time the idea has been considered. Following reports of Mr Trump's suggestion, the hashtag #ThatsHowTheApocalyseStarted has been trending on Twitter. Mr Trump asked why the US couldn't drop a bomb into the eye of the storm,externalto stop it from making landfall, news site Axios said. The NOAA says that using nuclear weapons on a hurricane ""might not even alter the storm"" and the ""radioactive fallout would fairly quickly move with the tradewinds to affect land areas"". The difficulty with using explosives to change hurricanes, it says, is the amount of energy needed. The heat release of a hurricane is equivalent to a 10-megaton nuclear bomb exploding every 20 minutes. Atlantic hurricane season starts early Hurricanes, typhoons and cyclones: What's the difference? Even though the mechanical energy of a bomb is closer to that of the storm, ""the task of focusing even half of the energy on a spot in the middle of a remote ocean would be formidable"", it adds. ""Attacking weak tropical waves or depressions before they have a chance to grow into hurricanes isn't promising either,"" says the NOAA. ""About 80 of these disturbances form every year in the Atlantic basin but only about five become hurricanes in a typical year. There is no way to tell in advance which ones will develop."" The idea of bombing a hurricane has been around since the 1950s when the suggestion was originally made by a government scientist. During a speech at the National Press Club in 1961, Francis Riechelderfer, head of the US Weather Bureau, said he could ""imagine the possibility of someday exploding a nuclear bomb on a hurricane far at sea"". The Weather Bureauwould only begin acquiring nuclear weapons when ""we know what we're doing,external"", he added, according to National Geographic. The NOAA says the idea is often suggested during hurricane season. George Washington University Professor Sharon Squassoni says the idea stems from the Plowshares Program of the 1950s when a ""laundry list of different weird... fantastical, slightly crazy"" uses for nuclear weapons was devised by government researchers. In nearly 20 years, the US exploded 31 warheads in 27 tests in order to test whether America's nuclear arsenal could be used to excavate canals or mines, or create a harbour for ships. As the dangers of radiation became more clear, the notion was dropped, Prof Squassoni tells BBC News, adding that current international treaties would ban the US from exploding a nuclear weapon in a hurricane. Several other outlandish ideas have been floated in recent years, including one Facebook event calling for US gun owners to ""shoot down"" Hurricane Irma in 2017 with bullets and flamethrowers. The event attracted 55,000 people to sign up and was taken seriously enough by one Florida sheriff that he issued a stern warning on Twitter saying: ""You won't make it turn around & it will have very dangerous side effects."" Why some Americans tried to 'shoot down' Hurricane Irma The Atlantic Hurricane season runs from 1 June until the end of November. The peak of the season comes in September when sea temperatures are at their highest. Tropical Storm Dorian is currently swirling towards the Caribbean islands and is forecast to become a hurricane by Tuesday, and will threaten the US island territory of Puerto Rico in the coming days. When asked for a comment by BBC News, a spokesman for the National Hurricane Center in Miami said the agency is focused on Dorian and deferred questions on the ""topic of hurricanes and nukes"" to the NOAA guidelines. This video can not be played Hurricane survivorâs unusual new home The NOAA warned earlier this month that conditions were now more favourable for above-normal hurricane activity. It is predicting between 10 and 17 named storms, of which 5-9 will become hurricanes, including 2-4 major hurricanes. Four named storms have formed so far this year. They were Andrea, Barry, Chantal and Dorian.

"Giant volcanic rock 'raft' found in Pacific OceanThe mass of pumice, the size of Manhattan, is believed to come from an underwater volcano near Tonga.Australia","This video can not be played Sailors Tom Whitehead and Shannon Lenz said the floating rocks left ""no water visible"" A vast ""raft"" of volcanic rocks stretching over 150 sq km (58 sq miles) is drifting through the Pacific Ocean, scientists say. The sea of pumice -  the size of 20,000 football fields - was first reported by Australian sailors earlier this month. Experts say the mass probably came from an underwater volcano near Tonga which erupted around 7 August according to satellite images. Sailors have been warned to stay clear of the potential hazard. Pumice is a lightweight, bubble-rich rock that can float in water. It is produced when lava goes through rapid cooling and loss of gases. Sailor Michael Hoult was one of the first to report the volcanic rock raft Large ""rafts"" of the volcanic rock are more likely to form when a volcano is located in more shallow waters, say experts. Massive volcanic 'raft' found near New Zealand Deep sea volcanoes found off Sydney An Australian couple sailing their catamaran to Fiji were the first to report the ""pumice raft"", after inadvertently entering the rubble at night. ""The waves were knocked back to almost calm and the boat was slowed to one knot,"" Michael Hoult and Larissa Brill wrote online on 16 August. The Australian couple collected samples of the pumice ""The rubble slick went as far as we could see in the moonlight and with our spotlight."" They were temporarily stuck after rocks jammed their rudder, but then were able to navigate out of the field. They have since sent samples of the pumice stone - which range ""from marble to basketball size"" - to researchers at the Queensland University of Technology (QUT) in Australia. Associate Prof Scott Bryan, a geologist studying the samples at QUT,  said such pumice masses could be seen about once every five years in the region. ""It is a phenomenon reported over time, usually as islands in the middle of the ocean that people encounter but then can't find again,"" he told the BBC. ""It can be as if the whole surface [of the ocean] has turned to land"". Associate Prof Bryan said satellite images showed the field had since divided into two main surface masses, with many trailing ""ribbons"" of rock. ""At the moment there are more than a trillion pieces of pumice all floating together, but over time it will break up and disperse across the area,"" he said. The pumice is currently drifting westwards towards Fiji, and is likely to pass New Caledonia and Vanuatu. It has also been forecast to reach Australia. ""It possibly could reach Australia in a year's time, but we don't know if it could even last,"" said Dr Martin Jutzeler from the University of Tasmania. Experts say the pumice is likely to become home to marine life as it drifts across the Pacific on ocean currents. ""A lot of life... can attach themselves to the pumice and be transported thousands of km away.  So it's a way to renew ecosystems somewhere, but it also can introduce invasive species,"" Dr Jutzeler said. If it reaches Australia, that could be a boon for the damaged Great Barrier Reef, some experts say. Rock rafts 'potential cradles of life' Barrier Reef 'coral babies' in mass decline ""This is a potential mechanism for restocking the Great Barrier Reef,"" Associate Prof Bryan said.

G7 to provide support to fight Amazon fires,"This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state International leaders at the G7 summit have agreed to provide logistical and financial support to help fight fires in the Amazon rainforest. French President Emmanuel Macron said G7 countries would release $22m (Â£18m). However, President Jair Bolsonaro said Mr Macron's plan of an ""alliance"" to ""save"" the Amazon treated Brazil ""as if we were a colony or no man's land"". Tens of thousands of fires are burning in Brazil, mostly in the Amazon, according to the country's space research agency. The funding pledge was announced as the leaders of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - continue to meet in Biarritz, France. Mr Macron said the funds would be made available ""immediately"" - primarily to pay for more fire-fighting planes - and that France would also ""offer concrete support with military in the region within the next few hours"". However, Mr Bolsonaro - who has been engaged in a public row with Mr Macron in recent weeks - accused the French leader of launching ""unreasonable and gratuitous attacks against the Amazon region"", and ""hiding his intentions behind the idea of an 'alliance' of G7 countries"". He wrote on Twitter that Brazil's sovereignty should be respected - and said he had discussed with Colombia's president the need for ""a joint plan"" from the countries that actually made up the Amazon region. Despite Mr Bolsonaro's comments, his environment minister, Ricardo Salles, told reporters that the funding was welcome, Reuters news agency reports. Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? What is the 'historic' EU-Mercosur trade deal? President Macron last week described the fires as an ""international crisis"" and pushed for them to be prioritised at the G7 summit which his country is hosting. G7 leaders also intend to discuss plans to reforest the Amazon, at the United Nations general assembly meeting in September. The severity of the fires, and the response by Brazil's government, has prompted a global outcry and protests. According to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), more than 75,000 fires have been recorded in Brazil so far in 2019, most of them in the Amazon region. This is the highest number of fires in the same period since 2010, though some way off the record of 133,000 in 2005. Critics have accused Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, of ""green lighting"" the Amazon's destruction through anti-environmental rhetoric and a lack of action on deforestation violations. On Friday, facing mounting pressure from abroad, President Bolsonaro authorised the military to help tackle the blazes. The Defence Ministry has said that 44,000 troops are available to help in the effort and officials said on Sunday that military intervention has been authorised in seven states. Warplanes have also been drafted in to dump water on the areas affected. The president tweeted on Sunday that he had also accepted an offer of support from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Protests calling for intervention have continued in Brazil across the weekend President Bolsonaro has previously been critical of the response of foreign governments and accused them of interfering in Brazil's national sovereignty. On Saturday, EU Council president Donald Tusk admitted it was hard to imagine the bloc ratifying the long-awaited EU-Mercosur agreement - a landmark trade deal with South American nations - while Brazil was still failing to curb the blazes. As criticism mounted again last week, Finland's finance minister went as far as calling for the EU to consider banning Brazilian beef imports altogether. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil, but satellitedata published by Inpe has shown an increase of 85% this year,external. Environmental activists have drawn links between President Bolsonaro's attitudes towards the environment and the recent surge in the number of fires in the famous rainforest. This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land President Bolsonaro has been accused of emboldening miners and loggers who deliberately start fires to illegally deforest land. Earlier this monthhe accused Inpe of trying to undermine his governmentwith data revealing sharp increases in deforestation levels. BBC analysis has also found that the record number of fires being recorded also coincide with a sharp drop off in finesbeing handed out for environmental violations. Neighbouring Bolivia is also struggling to contain fires burning in its forests. On Sunday President Evo Morales suspended his re-election campaign and said he was prepared to accept international help to tackle blazes in his country's Chiquitania region. As the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It spans a number of countries, but the majority of it falls within Brazil. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change It is known as the ""lungs of the world"" for its role in absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. The rainforest is also home to about three million species of plants and animals and one million indigenous people. Amazon: Lungs of the planet Political leaders, celebrities and environmentalists are among those who have called for action to protect the Amazon. Thousands of protesters have also taken to the streets across the world calling on governments to intervene. On Sunday, Pope Francis also joined the call to protect the rainforest. ""We are all worried about the vast fires that have developed in the Amazon. Let us pray so that with the commitment of all, they can be put out soon. That lung of forests is vital for our planet,"" he told thousands of people in St Peter's Square.

PM: BBC must 'cough up' for over-75s TV licences,"The funding decision led to protests from pensioners The BBC should ""cough up"" and pay for TV licences for all over-75s, the prime minister has said. It comes after the BBC announced in June that it would restrict the benefit to those in low-income households. Speaking to reporters at the G7 summit, Boris Johnson said the BBC's funding settlement had been conditional on it continuing to fund the free licences - something the corporation disputes. Labour accused the PM of blaming the broadcaster for government policy. The BBC previously said it would limit free licences to low-income households to prevent it having to close services such as BBC Two and Radio 5 Live. Continuing to fund the free licences would have cost Â£745m - a fifth of its budget - by 2021-22, the corporation said. The decision, meaning around 3.7 million people aged over 75 will have to pay Â£154.50 for a colour TV licence from next June, sparked protests outside BBC studios. Mr Johnson told reporters at the summit in Biarritz, southern France: ""The BBC received a settlement that was conditional upon their paying for TV licences for the over-75s. ""They should cough up."" Over-75s TV licence fee decision was 'nuclear' Stars appeal to next PM over free TV licences Cuts to stars' pay 'cannot save free TV licence' People aged over 75 were granted free TV licences when Labour was in power, in 2000. Maintaining it was a Conservative manifesto pledge in 2017. However, the charter agreement hammered out with Conservative ministers in 2015 saw the BBC assume responsibility for funding the commitment from 2020. A BBC spokeswoman said: ""It was the government which decided to stop funding free TV licences for the over-75s, and Parliament gave responsibility to the BBC to make a decision on the future of the scheme. ""There was no guarantee that the BBC would continue to fund free licences for the over-75s."" In June, the culture secretary at the time the settlement was reached, John Whittingdale, said""it was understood that this would be a possible outcome"",external. In the same month, the BBC insisted that cutting stars' salaries would not save enough money to pay for over-75s' licences. ""Even if we stopped employing every presenter earning more than Â£150,000, that would save less than Â£20m,"" said director of policy Clare Sumner. ""If no senior manager were paid over Â£150,000 that would save only Â£5m."" Labour accused Mr Johnson of ""passing the buck"" Limiting the scheme to households where one person receives pension credit is expected to cost the BBC around Â£250 million by 2021-22. However, a No 10 source said BBC income had been boosted by requiring iPlayer users to have a licence and linking licence fee increases to inflation. ""At the time, the director general said it was a 'strong deal for the BBC' and provided 'financial stability',"" the source said, adding: ""The BBC must honour this agreement."" Labour deputy leader Tom Watson called on the government to stop ""passing the buck"". ""This prime minister's disregard for older people is appalling,"" he said. ""Because of this government's refusal to fund the concession, millions of older people will have their free TV licences scrapped next year."" And Labour MP Ben Bradshaw - a former BBC journalist - said: ""The BBC is an independent broadcaster. It's not a branch of the Department of Work and Pensions. ""This was always going to happen - the BBC was stupid to accept this as part of the licence fee [settlement] but it certainly wasn't a condition of it. ""And if the government wants over-75s to continue to receive free licences it needs to fund it."" Some 634,334 people havesigned a petition organised by charity Age UK,external, which is calling on the government to take back responsibility for funding the free licences and honour the 2017 manifesto commitment. Age UK director Caroline Abrahams said: ""The BBC and the government clearly are in different places on this and it is old people who are in the middle - which we are very uncomfortable about. ""The government created this situation by passing responsibility for the licence fee to the BBC at the last settlement without giving them all the money to pay for it. ""Whether the BBC is quite as skint as it is telling everybody I can't possibly say, I'm not a media commentator. ""It would be sensible for the two parties to come together and draw a line and try to stop this escalating row.""

EU leaders 'should not listen to anti-Brexit MPs',"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: Brexit ""is a matter for parliamentarians to get right ourselves"" ""The job of everybody in Parliament"" is to deliver Brexit, the PM has said at the end of the G7 summit in France. Boris Johnson also said he was ""marginally more optimistic"" about striking a new Brexit deal with the EU. But he refused to be drawn on whether he would suspend Parliament to stop it preventing a no-deal exit. Mr Johnson's comments come as MPs from other partiesprepare to meetto discuss ways to avoid the UK leaving the EU without a deal on 31 October. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn hopes to win a vote of no confidence in the government and then delay Brexit to stop a no-deal exit. Asked about the possibility of MPs thwarting plans to leave the EU at the end of October, Mr Johnson said: ""I think it's the job of everybody in Parliament to get this thing done. ""I think it's what the people want, I also think, by the way, it's what our friends and partners on the other side of the Channel want - they want it over."" Corbyn: General election will stop Brexit 'crisis' What is a vote of no confidence? Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? On Sunday, Mr Johnson had told the BBCthe chances of securing a new Brexit deal were ""touch and go""- but on Monday he said: ""I am marginally more optimistic."" He continued: ""But, remember that all statistical estimates that I give about the chances of a deal - whether they are expressed in odds of millions to one, or getting closer, or hotter or colder, or whatever - they all depend exclusively on the willingness of our friends and partners to compromise on that crucial point and to get rid of the backstop and the current withdrawal agreement."" Labour leader Mr Corbynwants to calla vote of no confidence in the government to prevent a no-deal Brexit. If he were to win a vote, Mr Corbyn plans to become a caretaker prime minister, delay Brexit, call a snap election and campaign for another referendum. However, in Biarritz on Monday, Mr Johnson reiterated his determination to stop Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister. ""One of my many missions in life is to protect the people of this country from the appalling consequences of a Labour government,"" Mr Johnson said. He added that Mr Corbyn, if in power, ""would also renege, reject, revoke the mandate of the people"". ""I cannot think of anything worse for democracy or for trust in politics and I very much hope that does not happen,"" he said. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In the last few days there's been a sort of dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals"" Beginning his final speech at the G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - Mr Johnson said that in ""every conversation"" he had had with his fellow leaders, he had been ""struck by their enthusiasm to expand and strengthen their relations with our country"". He added the subjects discussed included ""the biggest global challenges confronting us all today"". Referencing both the fires in the Amazon rainforest and a global decline in biodiversity, Mr Johnson said nations could not just ""sit back as animals and plants are wiped off the face of the planet"". The summit comes just two months before the UK is scheduled to leave the EU. Mr Johnson previously said if the UK left without a deal, the UK would keep a ""very substantial"" part of the Â£39bn former prime minister Theresa May had agreed to pay the EU in her withdrawal agreement - the deal which British MPs rejected three times. But, responding, European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the UK must honour commitments made during its EU membership, and said this was ""especially true in a no-deal scenario"".

G7 'close to agreeing' help for Amazon fires,"This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state International leaders at the G7 summit have agreed to provide logistical and financial support to help fight fires in the Amazon rainforest. French President Emmanuel Macron said G7 countries would release $22m (Â£18m). However, President Jair Bolsonaro said Mr Macron's plan of an ""alliance"" to ""save"" the Amazon treated Brazil ""as if we were a colony or no man's land"". Tens of thousands of fires are burning in Brazil, mostly in the Amazon, according to the country's space research agency. The funding pledge was announced as the leaders of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - continue to meet in Biarritz, France. Mr Macron said the funds would be made available ""immediately"" - primarily to pay for more fire-fighting planes - and that France would also ""offer concrete support with military in the region within the next few hours"". However, Mr Bolsonaro - who has been engaged in a public row with Mr Macron in recent weeks - accused the French leader of launching ""unreasonable and gratuitous attacks against the Amazon region"", and ""hiding his intentions behind the idea of an 'alliance' of G7 countries"". He wrote on Twitter that Brazil's sovereignty should be respected - and said he had discussed with Colombia's president the need for ""a joint plan"" from the countries that actually made up the Amazon region. Despite Mr Bolsonaro's comments, his environment minister, Ricardo Salles, told reporters that the funding was welcome, Reuters news agency reports. Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? What is the 'historic' EU-Mercosur trade deal? President Macron last week described the fires as an ""international crisis"" and pushed for them to be prioritised at the G7 summit which his country is hosting. G7 leaders also intend to discuss plans to reforest the Amazon, at the United Nations general assembly meeting in September. The severity of the fires, and the response by Brazil's government, has prompted a global outcry and protests. According to Brazil's National Institute for Space Research (Inpe), more than 75,000 fires have been recorded in Brazil so far in 2019, most of them in the Amazon region. This is the highest number of fires in the same period since 2010, though some way off the record of 133,000 in 2005. Critics have accused Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro, of ""green lighting"" the Amazon's destruction through anti-environmental rhetoric and a lack of action on deforestation violations. On Friday, facing mounting pressure from abroad, President Bolsonaro authorised the military to help tackle the blazes. The Defence Ministry has said that 44,000 troops are available to help in the effort and officials said on Sunday that military intervention has been authorised in seven states. Warplanes have also been drafted in to dump water on the areas affected. The president tweeted on Sunday that he had also accepted an offer of support from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Protests calling for intervention have continued in Brazil across the weekend President Bolsonaro has previously been critical of the response of foreign governments and accused them of interfering in Brazil's national sovereignty. On Saturday, EU Council president Donald Tusk admitted it was hard to imagine the bloc ratifying the long-awaited EU-Mercosur agreement - a landmark trade deal with South American nations - while Brazil was still failing to curb the blazes. As criticism mounted again last week, Finland's finance minister went as far as calling for the EU to consider banning Brazilian beef imports altogether. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil, but satellitedata published by Inpe has shown an increase of 85% this year,external. Environmental activists have drawn links between President Bolsonaro's attitudes towards the environment and the recent surge in the number of fires in the famous rainforest. This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land President Bolsonaro has been accused of emboldening miners and loggers who deliberately start fires to illegally deforest land. Earlier this monthhe accused Inpe of trying to undermine his governmentwith data revealing sharp increases in deforestation levels. BBC analysis has also found that the record number of fires being recorded also coincide with a sharp drop off in finesbeing handed out for environmental violations. Neighbouring Bolivia is also struggling to contain fires burning in its forests. On Sunday President Evo Morales suspended his re-election campaign and said he was prepared to accept international help to tackle blazes in his country's Chiquitania region. As the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It spans a number of countries, but the majority of it falls within Brazil. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change It is known as the ""lungs of the world"" for its role in absorbing carbon dioxide and producing oxygen. The rainforest is also home to about three million species of plants and animals and one million indigenous people. Amazon: Lungs of the planet Political leaders, celebrities and environmentalists are among those who have called for action to protect the Amazon. Thousands of protesters have also taken to the streets across the world calling on governments to intervene. On Sunday, Pope Francis also joined the call to protect the rainforest. ""We are all worried about the vast fires that have developed in the Amazon. Let us pray so that with the commitment of all, they can be put out soon. That lung of forests is vital for our planet,"" he told thousands of people in St Peter's Square. This video can not be played Worldwide protests over Brazilian government inaction on Amazon fires This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010. Amazon fires: How bad have they got?

Swinson warns Corbyn over no-confidence vote,"Jo Swinson said the success of a no-confidence vote ""must be the priority"" Jeremy Corbyn risks jeopardising a vote of no confidence in the government by insisting he becomes caretaker PM, Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson has said. If he wins a no-confidence vote, the Labour leader plans to form an emergency government and then delay Brexit to avoid a no-deal scenario. But in a new letter, Ms Swinson said Mr Corbyn's insistence on being interim leader meant there was a danger not enough MPs would support the vote. Labour did not respond to the letter. Instead, the party referred to comments made by its shadow international trade secretary, Barry Gardiner, who on Sunday described Ms Swinson as ""extremely petulant"" for dismissing Mr Corbyn's initial proposal to lead a temporary government. Corbyn: General election will stop Brexit 'crisis' What is a vote of no confidence? Do MPs have the power to stop a no-deal Brexit? Prime Minister Boris Johnson has repeatedly insisted that the UK will leave the EU on 31 October, with or without a deal. On Sunday, he told the BBCthe chances of securing a new Brexit deal were ""touch and go"", having previously said the odds of no deal were ""a million to one"". Ahead of cross-party talks on how to avoid no deal - due to take place on Tuesday - Ms Swinson said the discussions should examine how to seize control of Commons business, oust Mr Johnson and install an emergency ""government of national unity"". In her letter to Mr Corbyn, Ms Swinson added: ""Insisting you lead that emergency government will therefore jeopardise the chances of a no confidence vote gaining enough support to pass in the first place. ""As you have said that you would do anything to avoid no deal, I hope you are open to a discussion about how conceding this point may open the door to a no-confidence vote succeeding. Its success must be the priority."" Jeremy Corbyn's plans to avert a no-deal Brexit have been met with resistance by some key potential allies Earlier this month, Mr Corbyn outlined his plans to avert a no-deal Brexit - which involve him becoming a caretaker prime minister - but wasmet with resistance from some key potential allies. Ms Swinson and Conservatives opposed to no deal were among those who rejected the idea of Mr Corbyn being interim leader, but Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon criticised the Lib Dem leader's stance, adding that ""nothing should be ruled out"". Mr Corbyn said he would call a no-confidence vote at the ""earliest opportunity when we can be confident of success"". That cannot happen before 3 September, when MPs return from summer recess. In order for such a vote to succeed, Labour would require support from across the House of Commons, including the Lib Dems, the SNP and Conservative rebels. Ms Swinson has suggested Tory MP Ken Clarke and former deputy Labour leader Harriet Harman as possible caretaker leaders, and both have expressed willingness to do the role, she said. In her letter, Ms Swinson also called on Mr Corbyn to ""clarify"" his position on whether he was opposed to Brexit altogether. The SNP, Liberal Democrats, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party have all accepted the invitation to meet Mr Corbyn to discuss proposals for an alternative government to be formed when Parliament returns in September. Speaking ahead of the meeting, Labour's Barry Gardiner told Sophy Ridge on Sky News on Sunday Labour was offering a ""failsafe procedure to stop no deal"" by holding a vote of no confidence followed by a temporary government to set up a general election. What is a vote of no confidence? Former Prime Minister Gordon Brown told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it is more likely Parliament will force Boris Johnson to delay a no deal and the question is whether in these circumstances he will think it is the right thing to call an election. ""My view is that an election at this point will not solve the problem we have - and the problem we have is making sure that we do not inflict harm on ourselves, by leaving the EU with no deal.""

'The bank sent my safe house address to my abusive ex',"Claire had to move house when the bank accidentally sent a letter disclosing her address to her ex-husband. Only after Claire left her husband did she realise the extent of the abuse she had endured. In addition to physical violence, his abusive and controlling behaviour extended to money, too. ""I was the main earner, so would pay for holidays and anything extra,"" she says. ""The joint account was for bills and the mortgage. After a while he gave up his job. So I was topping up his half from my single account."" Claire - not her real name - felt she had to take on extra work. He would tell her she wasn't earning enough, while his threatening behaviour made her scared to question him. But he was not prepared to give up his lifestyle. ""I'd get clothes from charity shops, he always had to have a new suit for a wedding, always had to have the very best of everything,"" she says. Claire says she left after a bad assault. ""Police took me back to the house after a while. The furniture had gone, what he didn't want he had destroyed. He'd also taken every personal item of mine that was [proof of] identity. My passport, bank statement, file boxes with bank statements and pensions. I had nothing to prove who I was, I couldn't really do anything."" This behaviour is known as ""economic abuse"". Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, director of charity Surviving Economic Abuse, says the vast majority of those who experience a coercive and controlling pattern of abusive behaviour experience economic abuse as a part of it. Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, director of Surviving Economic Abuse, says economic abuse is a common feature of domestic abuse But Claire's experience was made even more harrowing because her bank did not understand what she was going through or how to support her. With a domestic abuse charity mentor, she went to a bank branch to get money from her joint account, as she was no longer working. ""They couldn't help me because I had no ID. ""They kept saying he needed to come because he'd have a bank card, they needed him to prove who I was. We were trying to explain I couldn't be near him."" When she finally gained access a few weeks later, everything - tens of thousands of pounds - had gone. ""I was devastated. There were direct debits set up which I couldn't close because they needed two signatures, so I kept having to borrow from my parents and friends."" The eventual closure of the account wasn't the end. While at a safe house, Claire says she received a bank letter. ""My address and my ex-husband's address were on the top of this letter."" The bank had accidentally told her violent abuser where she was living, and put her physical safety at risk. She phoned the bank who confirmed a standard letter about interest rates had been sent to both of them. ""I then had to move, because he then knew where I was. I was absolutely petrified. I just phoned everybody and said, 'Can I come and stay? I can't stay here.' I had to plan and move permanently."" Claire thinks banks could make changes to help people like her. ""They didn't protect me. I think that's because they didn't have the knowledge that these things make the difference."" When Claire was finally able to access the joint account, she discovered that all the money had gone The banking industry is trying to look after people like Claire better. ""The response by banks and building societies is significant,"" says Dr Sharp-Jeffs. ""Firstly, from a safety perspective. The other thing is understanding the impact. ""Victims may be left in a financially precarious situation, and the only way to make them safe is improve their financial stability. ""Banks can do lots, like indicate if there are other products in someone's name they may not be aware of, see whether breathing space from some credit card repayments might be appropriate."" The Domestic Abuse Bill entered Parliament last month, defining economic abuse as ""behaviour that has a substantial adverse effect on another person's ability to acquire, use or maintain money - or other property, or obtain goods or services"". It is a wider term than financial abuse, potentially including access to housing, food and clothing. However, it is not yet clear if or when it will become law. A Code of Practice on financial abuse was introduced by industry body UK Finance last Autumn, which has encouraged banks and building societies to improve support in relevant areas, says Dr Sharp-Jeffs. ""Since the code was introduced we've seen more of a will to address this issue, and actions."" The BBC asked major high street banks that signed up to the voluntary Code of Practice what they had done. To give a few examples, TSB has a procedure allowing cards and pins to be sent to an address which is not the customer's registered one, and greater flexibility for customers living in refuges. It will be reviewing procedures around removing a partner from a joint account, which currently requires two signatures. Santander said it had exceptions in place for customers who need to open an account after leaving an abuser, for example, using a letter from a refuge/shelter manager. It says staff training includes spotting subtle behavioural signs such as a customer being nervous. HSBC UK customers can request a national sort code that cannot be traced to a particular bank branch, if they are concerned an abuser could use these details to find out their location. Among Natwest's measures are protecting the customer's mailing address, and immediately stopping operations on a joint account where there is a dispute. Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs trains Lloyds staff how to spot signs of economic abuse Lloyds is starting a dedicated unit focusing on domestic abuse. Its team is receiving training from the Surviving Economic Abuse charity. Fiona Cannon, director of responsible business at Lloyds Banking Group, describes it as a clear business issue. ""All banks will start to look at it now. The most important thing is to believe victims. From that flows a whole range of other activities, you're able to support them effectively. ""[For example] even if you want to close a joint account, normally both people need to come into branch together. We don't expect people to do that now."" UK Finance said it continues to review the implementation of the code, encouraging best practice approaches across its membership. Dr Sharp-Jeffs described progress so far as the beginning of the journey, but a positive start in taking proper care of people like Claire. ""Some banks and building societies are doing more than others. We'd just hope UK finance and other bodies push banks and building societies do everything they can,"" she says. Claire had to move house in a hurry. Will future victims of economic abuse get better treatment? Illustrations by Katie Horwich. Is your partner a financial bully?

Asian markets drop after trade war escalates,"Asian stock markets tumbled on Monday after a sharp escalation in the US-China trade war rattled investors. On Friday, US President Donald Trump announced tariff hikes on effectively all Chinese imports to the US. It came after Beijing said it would impose fresh duties and raise tariffs on US imports into China. In China, Hong Kong's Hang Seng index slid 3.2% while the Shanghai Composite gave up 1.3%. Japan's benchmark Nikkei 225 index dropped 2.3%. The Chinese yuan weakened to a fresh 11-year low against the US dollar. The onshore yuan was around 7.15 per dollar in morning Asian trade. Sharp falls in the yuan earlier this month promptedthe US to officially name China a ""currency manipulator"", adding to tensions between the two countries. ""The trade war between the US and China has escalated dramatically,"" Louis Kuijs, head of Asia Economics at Oxford Economics said. ""This tit-for-tat escalation shows how unlikely a trade deal and de-escalation have become."" A quick guide to the US-China trade war The US-China trade war in charts US-China trade war: 'We're all paying for this' On Friday, theUS said it would begin the process of raising tariffs on around $250bn (Â£203.8bn) of Chinese imports,externalfrom 25% to 30%. Those hikes will be introduced from 1 October. The US also said fresh tariffs on an additional $300bn of Chinese goods, announced earlier this month, will now be at a rate of 15% instead of 10%. The first batch of those tariffs will be introduced in September. In a tweet, Mr Trump saidhe planned to order US firms working in Chinato move their operations back to the US. It is unclear how he could force firms to comply. The moves came after China delivered its latest trade war strike, announcing plans to hit $75bn worth of US goods with new tariffs and hikes to existing duties. The world's two largest economies have been locked in a bruising trade battle for the past year that has seen tariffs imposed on billions of dollars worth of one another's goods. Mr Trump has long accused China of unfair trading practices and intellectual property theft. In China, there is a perception that the US is trying to curb its rise.

Pork pie makers dispute Johnson's export claim,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson's claim on pork pie exports was queried by the head of the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association The humble Melton Mowbray pork pie is at the centre of an unlikely political dispute about British exports. Boris Johnson had said pork pies are exported to Thailand and Iceland, but cannot be to the US due to red tape. However the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association said the pies were not even exported to Thailand and Iceland. Downing Street insisted pies were exported, citing producer Walker & Son - but the company said this was not correct. Walker & Son told the BBC it had previously exported a ""tiny amount"" of pork pies to Singapore, but had not done so for ""at least two years"" and is now ""entirely focused on the UK market"". When asked if the company had ever exported to any other countries, the spokeswoman said she was unsure. The topic of pork pies arose on Sunday at the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, when Mr Johnson was discussing a possible post-Brexit free trade deal with the US. Mr Johnson spoke about trying to ""prise open the American market"" by removing restrictions on UK exports. Offering an example of an American trade restriction,Mr Johnson said:""Melton Mowbray pork pies, which are sold in Thailand and in Iceland, are currently unable to enter the US market because of, I don't know, some sort of food and drug administration restriction."" Matthew O'Callaghan - who chairs the Melton Mowbray Pork Pie Association, which represents the pies' makers - told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that, as far as he knew, the claim was wrong. Asked if Mr Johnson was right, Mr O'Callaghan replied: ""Not really. With all of these things there is a little bit of give and take. We don't actually export to Thailand or Iceland."" When pressed again, Mr O'Callaghan said: ""Not that I know of I'm afraid. ""It is certainly available in Iceland the shop."" Mr O'Callaghan said there was a possibility that pies could be exported frozen to the US or Australia and cooked in the country. Speaking about trading with the US, Mr O'Callaghan said: ""A Melton Mowbray pork pie is a delicate fresh meat product so the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), like most other countries in the world, are very aware of meat products and you have to go through all the regulations to get them over there. ""Because of the short shelf life it is not really viable economically."" UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Trump adviser 'No chance of US deal' if Brexit hits Irish accord What trade deals has the UK done so far? In response to Mr O'Callaghan, No 10 said the PM was correct when he said that Melton Mowbray pork pies are exported to Thailand and Iceland. His remarks, it added, were based on a briefing note from the Department for International Trade, which said the company Walker & Sons exports small shipments to Iceland, Thailand, Singapore and the Caribbean. It said the information came from a document produced by Walker & Son. However, when contacted by the BBC, Walker & Son - which says it makes and bakes 80% of all of the UK's Melton Mowbray pork pies - said it no longer exports pork pies. ""We are entirely focused on the UK market,"" a spokeswoman said. The company said it used to export a ""tiny amount"" to Singapore - but had not done so ""for some time"". Boris Johnson used the Melton Mowbray pork pie example in a bid to demonstrate US trade restriction A spokeswoman said none had been exported for ""at least two years"". She said those that were exported had to be sent out frozen and then baked on arrival. Â In 2015, an executive at the firm said,externalit sends small shipments abroad. The BBC also spoke to the British owner of one independent retailer in Singapore, who said they previously stocked pork pies, but that their distributor ""unfortunately doesn't do them now, due purely to demand rather than restrictions"". Melton Mowbray pork pies are distinctive as they are made from uncured pork, to ensure the inside is grey in colour. The Melton Mowbray pork pie hasspecial protected geographical status,externalunder EU rules, similar to Stilton cheese or Champagne. It means only producers making pork pies using the traditional recipe and in the vicinity of Melton Mowbray can use the town's name. After Mr Johnson's pork pie remarks, Rutland and Melton MP Sir Alan Duncan posted a series of tweets expressing support for the opportunity to export the famous food to the US. Allow Twitter content?

Ariana Grande 'overwhelmed' on Manchester return,"This video can not be played ""So healing"": Fans react to Ariana Grande's return to Manchester Ariana Grande told fans she was ""overwhelmed"" and ""so nervous"" as she was welcomed back to Manchester for the first time since the 2017 terror attack and subsequent benefit concert. The crowd chanted her name during her set at Manchester Pride on Sunday. Armed police patrolled outside the event, which came two years after a suicide bomber killed 22 people after her concert at Manchester Arena. ""Manchester holds a very special place in my heart,"" the superstar said. She told the crowd: ""I'm so happy to be with you, so thank you for having me. Sorry, I'm so nervous. I had so much more to say but I'm really very overwhelmed. So thank you."" The US singer began her 35-minute, nine-song set with No Tears Left To Cry, the first song she released after the bombing, and the night was at times emotional for both the singer and her fans. Ariana Grande on stage at Manchester Pride Mason Thomas, 20, from Manchester, was at Manchester Arena the night of the attack, and said the Pride show contained ""so many tears, so much happiness"". He said: ""I think she was crying at the start during No Tears Left To Cry, which obviously is heartbreaking. But she's so strong. She was there for us. She was there for the LGBT community. She was there for Manchester. ""I don't know that there was one person who didn't have tears in their eyes. It means so much to the city and it means so much to the world to show what she did tonight and show that hate doesn't win."" Molly Baigent (right, with friend Alex Richards) went to Pride as part of her therapy after the arena attack Molly Baigent, 20, from West Yorkshire, was also at the arena, and made sure she was in the front row for Pride. She said she screamed louder than usual because, ""I wanted to make her feel loved"". For Molly, going to the show was part of her therapy. ""Going back is a hard thing,"" she said. ""One of the things I wanted to do was go to this concert and see how I got on and try and manage my anxiety-related symptoms, which I did, so I'm really proud."" Another concertgoer, Sadie Scorah, 28, from Bolton, said it was ""beautiful and really emotional"" to see Grande back in Manchester - although she would have liked her to have played a full set. ""To see her perform at her best, and to see the way the crowd reacted... she is like a daughter of our city and it was absolutely beautiful to see her back here,"" she said. ""We would have loved to see her for longer, but it was really magical to see her back here."" Grande played a shortened version of the set from her current world tour. But unlike at other recent shows, she did play her 2014 single One Last Time, which took on extra meaning as an anthem after the arena attack. The star has previously said she experienced post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) after the bombing, and Sunday's gig was not back at the arena. It was at a new outdoor venue next to a disused train depot in the city centre. The choice of her as a headliner for Manchester Pride Live, the music strand of the city's annual LGBTQ+ celebration,had been criticised by some. She and her dancers waved rainbow flags during Thank U, Next, and she said ""the gays have always had my heart"" A Pride reveller in front of a mural of Ariana Grande's face in Manchester She told the crowd how she would regularly go to gay bars to sing when she was learning her trade in New York in her teens. ""Thank you so much for accepting and celebrating me the way I've always celebrated you guys,"" she said. There was also criticism after some ticket-holders said they were locked out because they didn't know they had to be in the venue by 19:00 BST. Allow Twitter content?

"'The bank sent my safe house address to my abusive ex'Banks are trying to better help victims of economic abuse, where a partner controls access to accounts.Business","Claire had to move house when the bank accidentally sent a letter disclosing her address to her ex-husband. Only after Claire left her husband did she realise the extent of the abuse she had endured. In addition to physical violence, his abusive and controlling behaviour extended to money, too. ""I was the main earner, so would pay for holidays and anything extra,"" she says. ""The joint account was for bills and the mortgage. After a while he gave up his job. So I was topping up his half from my single account."" Claire - not her real name - felt she had to take on extra work. He would tell her she wasn't earning enough, while his threatening behaviour made her scared to question him. But he was not prepared to give up his lifestyle. ""I'd get clothes from charity shops, he always had to have a new suit for a wedding, always had to have the very best of everything,"" she says. Claire says she left after a bad assault. ""Police took me back to the house after a while. The furniture had gone, what he didn't want he had destroyed. He'd also taken every personal item of mine that was [proof of] identity. My passport, bank statement, file boxes with bank statements and pensions. I had nothing to prove who I was, I couldn't really do anything."" This behaviour is known as ""economic abuse"". Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, director of charity Surviving Economic Abuse, says the vast majority of those who experience a coercive and controlling pattern of abusive behaviour experience economic abuse as a part of it. Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs, director of Surviving Economic Abuse, says economic abuse is a common feature of domestic abuse But Claire's experience was made even more harrowing because her bank did not understand what she was going through or how to support her. With a domestic abuse charity mentor, she went to a bank branch to get money from her joint account, as she was no longer working. ""They couldn't help me because I had no ID. ""They kept saying he needed to come because he'd have a bank card, they needed him to prove who I was. We were trying to explain I couldn't be near him."" When she finally gained access a few weeks later, everything - tens of thousands of pounds - had gone. ""I was devastated. There were direct debits set up which I couldn't close because they needed two signatures, so I kept having to borrow from my parents and friends."" The eventual closure of the account wasn't the end. While at a safe house, Claire says she received a bank letter. ""My address and my ex-husband's address were on the top of this letter."" The bank had accidentally told her violent abuser where she was living, and put her physical safety at risk. She phoned the bank who confirmed a standard letter about interest rates had been sent to both of them. ""I then had to move, because he then knew where I was. I was absolutely petrified. I just phoned everybody and said, 'Can I come and stay? I can't stay here.' I had to plan and move permanently."" Claire thinks banks could make changes to help people like her. ""They didn't protect me. I think that's because they didn't have the knowledge that these things make the difference."" When Claire was finally able to access the joint account, she discovered that all the money had gone The banking industry is trying to look after people like Claire better. ""The response by banks and building societies is significant,"" says Dr Sharp-Jeffs. ""Firstly, from a safety perspective. The other thing is understanding the impact. ""Victims may be left in a financially precarious situation, and the only way to make them safe is improve their financial stability. ""Banks can do lots, like indicate if there are other products in someone's name they may not be aware of, see whether breathing space from some credit card repayments might be appropriate."" The Domestic Abuse Bill entered Parliament last month, defining economic abuse as ""behaviour that has a substantial adverse effect on another person's ability to acquire, use or maintain money - or other property, or obtain goods or services"". It is a wider term than financial abuse, potentially including access to housing, food and clothing. However, it is not yet clear if or when it will become law. A Code of Practice on financial abuse was introduced by industry body UK Finance last Autumn, which has encouraged banks and building societies to improve support in relevant areas, says Dr Sharp-Jeffs. ""Since the code was introduced we've seen more of a will to address this issue, and actions."" The BBC asked major high street banks that signed up to the voluntary Code of Practice what they had done. To give a few examples, TSB has a procedure allowing cards and pins to be sent to an address which is not the customer's registered one, and greater flexibility for customers living in refuges. It will be reviewing procedures around removing a partner from a joint account, which currently requires two signatures. Santander said it had exceptions in place for customers who need to open an account after leaving an abuser, for example, using a letter from a refuge/shelter manager. It says staff training includes spotting subtle behavioural signs such as a customer being nervous. HSBC UK customers can request a national sort code that cannot be traced to a particular bank branch, if they are concerned an abuser could use these details to find out their location. Among Natwest's measures are protecting the customer's mailing address, and immediately stopping operations on a joint account where there is a dispute. Dr Nicola Sharp-Jeffs trains Lloyds staff how to spot signs of economic abuse Lloyds is starting a dedicated unit focusing on domestic abuse. Its team is receiving training from the Surviving Economic Abuse charity. Fiona Cannon, director of responsible business at Lloyds Banking Group, describes it as a clear business issue. ""All banks will start to look at it now. The most important thing is to believe victims. From that flows a whole range of other activities, you're able to support them effectively. ""[For example] even if you want to close a joint account, normally both people need to come into branch together. We don't expect people to do that now."" UK Finance said it continues to review the implementation of the code, encouraging best practice approaches across its membership. Dr Sharp-Jeffs described progress so far as the beginning of the journey, but a positive start in taking proper care of people like Claire. ""Some banks and building societies are doing more than others. We'd just hope UK finance and other bodies push banks and building societies do everything they can,"" she says. Claire had to move house in a hurry. Will future victims of economic abuse get better treatment? Illustrations by Katie Horwich. Is your partner a financial bully?

"A Brexit deal is now 'touch and go', says JohnsonBoris Johnson previously said the chances of leaving without a deal were ""a million to one"".UK Politics","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""In the last few days there's been a sort of dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals"" Boris Johnson has said the chances of a Brexit deal are ""touch and go"" - having previously said the odds of a no-deal Brexit were ""a million to one"". In a BBC interview at the G7 summit in France, he said it ""all depends on our EU friends and partners"". When pressed on the chances, he said: ""I think it's going to be touch and go. But the important thing is to get ready to come out without a deal."" Donald Tusk told the PM the EU is open to alternatives to the backstop. BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said the European Council president and Mr Johnson held talks on Sunday, which were in a ""genuinely positive atmosphere"". But she said Mr Tusk repeated the EU's position that any alternatives to the Irish backstop would have to be ""realistic"" and ""immediately operational"". An EU official added the meeting had ""mainly restated known positions"" and Brussels had been hoping for ""new elements to unblock the situation"". Mr Johnson and Mr Tusk discussed the possibility of meeting again in New York The two menclashed on Saturdayover who would be ""Mr No Deal"" - the person to blame in the case of a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson has previously said the UK must leave on 31 October ""deal or no deal"", but that the chances of a no-deal Brexit happening are a ""million to one"". Asked if people would still be able to get their medicine if there was a no-deal Brexit, the prime minister told the BBC: ""That is certainly a guarantee that we can make."" But he added: ""I do not want at this stage to say there won't be unforeseen difficulties."" Trump: UK is losing 'anchor round its ankle' Tusk and Johnson clash over who is 'Mr No Deal' Boris Johnson and the border blocking Brexit Speaking at the G7 summit on Sunday, he reiterated his desire to scrap the backstop from the current withdrawal agreement, saying it could keep the UK ""locked in"" EU rules, if a trade deal is not agreed after Brexit. He said: ""I think in the last few days there has been a dawning realisation in Brussels and other European capitals what the shape of the problem is for the UK."" Mr Johnson said he was an ""optimist"" and thought the EU would understand there is an ""opportunity to do a deal"". The PM also said if there is no deal, the UK would keep a ""very substantial"" part of the Â£39bn Theresa May had agreed to pay the EU in her withdrawal agreement. The G7 summit - a get-together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU at the end of October. Mr Johnson and other world leaders have gathered for the G7 summit in Biarritz, France Mrs May struck a withdrawal agreement with the EU - the so-called ""divorce deal"" - but British MPs rejected the deal three times. Mr Johnson wants to remove the Irish backstop from the deal but the EU has consistently ruled this out, saying it will not renegotiate the agreement. If implemented, the backstop - a last resort should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit - would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. This week German ChancellorAngela Merkel suggested there could be an alternativeto the backstop but the onus was on the UK to find it. But the next day French President Emmanuel Macron said the backstop was""indispensable"" to preserving political stability and the single market. This video can not be played President Trump said Boris Johnson was the ""right man"" to deliver Brexit Also on Sunday, the PM met President Donald Trump to discuss a trade deal between the UK and the US. Mr Johnson said the US's aim to strike a deal within a year was ""going to be tight"", adding: ""These [Americans] are tough guys."" Meanwhile, former chancellor Philip Hammond has written to the PM about theleaked Operation Yellowhammer documents on preparations for a no-deal Brexit. He said it was now apparent the document was dated August 2019, and therefore could not have been leaked by a minister from Mrs May's government.

Trump: UK is losing the 'anchor round its ankle'Boris Johnson and US President Donald Trump talk Brexit over breakfast during the G7 summit.,"This video can not be played The G7 leaders and some of their spouses posed for a ""family photo"" after a day of talks President Trump has promised a ""very big trade deal"" with the UK, saying its departure from the EU will be like losing ""an anchor round the ankle"". Mr Trump was speaking after a breakfast meeting with Mr Johnson at the G7 summit in Biarritz in France. But Mr Johnson said the US must open up its markets if a post-Brexit trade deal is to be agreed. ""I don't think we sell a single joint of British lamb in the United States, we don't sell any beef,"" the PM said. Mr Johnson's breakfast meeting came before a day of discussions with other world leaders at the summit. The PM also met European Council President Donald Tusk, a day after the two men clashedover who would be held responsible for a no-deal Brexit. This video can not be played President Trump said Boris Johnson was the ""right man"" to deliver Brexit Speaking to reporters after the working breakfast, Mr Trump said a deal with the UK would happen ""quickly"". ""We're going to do a very big trade deal, bigger than we've ever had with the UK,"" he said. ""And now at some point they won't have the obstacle, they won't have the anchor around their ankle, because that's what they have."" Mr Johnson told Mr Trump: ""Talking of the anchor, Donald, what we want is for our ships to take freight, say, from New York to Boston, which for the moment they're not able to do."" In a later interview with the BBC, Mr Johnson said agreeing any trade deals with the US within a year ""would be tight"". ""My own experience of the way Americans work, the size and complexity of the deal we want to do probably means we won't be able to do within a year. When asked if it could take five years, he replied: ""No, we'll do it faster than that. ""We need to do it fast, but to get the whole thing done from soup to nuts within a year is going to be a big ask."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson met with leaders at the annual G7 summit on Sunday Before his talks with the US President, Mr Johnson spoke about ""massive opportunities for the UK to prise open the American market"". As a member of the European Union, the UK cannot make its own trade deals with other countries - and the EU does not have a free trade deal with the US. The UK has already agreed 13 ""continuity"" deals with 38 countries that will apply post-Brexit. UK 'first in line' for US trade deal, says Trump adviser 'No chance of US deal' if Brexit hits Irish accord What trade deals has the UK done so far? Offering an example of an American trade restriction, Mr Johnson said: ""Melton Mowbray pork pies, which are sold in Thailand and in Iceland, are currently unable to enter the US market because of, I don't know, some sort of food and drug administration restriction."" He continued: ""UK bell peppers cannot get into the US market at all. ""Wine shipments are heavily restricted. If you want to export wine made in England to the US you have to go through a US distributor. ""There is a tax on British micro-breweries in the US that doesn't apply to US micro-breweries in the UK."" The government added that tariffs on some UK goods in the US can reach up to 28% for fashion, 15% for machinery and 35% for food and drink. Donald and Melania Trump arrived in France for the G7 summit on Saturday David Henig, the UK director of the European Centre For International Political Economy, said the US ""would be loathe"" to get rid of the barriers intended to protect US producers. He added: ""The US is quite protectionist - the US have never done a trade deal the likes of which Mr Johnson is describing. ""The question is whether the US is prepared to give the UK something and what we would have to give them in return. ""It is less clear what Trump wants in terms of trade altogether."" In June, Mr Trump made comments that theNHS ""was on the table"" in US-UK trade deal- but laterrowed back on his remarks. At the G7 summit Mr Johnson was asked if he had made it clear the NHS was not on the table. He replied: ""Not only have I made clear of that, the president has made that very, very clear. There is complete unanimity on that point."" Trade deals involve two or more countries agreeing a set of terms by which they buy and sell goods and services from each other. Deals are designed to increase trade by eliminating or reducing trade barriers. These barriers might include import or export taxes (tariffs), quotas, or differing regulations on things such as safety or labelling. Last month,President Trump saidtalks about a ""very substantial"" trade deal with the UK were already under way. He said a bilateral post-Brexit deal could lead to a ""three to four, five times"" increase in current trade - but provided no details about how that would be achieved. However, the Speaker of the US House of Representatives, Nancy Pelosi, said a UK-US trade dealwould not get through Congressif Brexit undermined the Good Friday Agreement. Ms Pelosi said the UK's exit from the EU could not be allowed to endanger the 1998 Irish peace deal, which the US helped facilitate. What is the Good Friday Agreement?
