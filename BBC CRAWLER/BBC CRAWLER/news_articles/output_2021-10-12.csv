Biggest UK commercial port hit by container logjam,"Felixstowe is the UK's busiest container port The UK's largest commercial port says the supply chain crisis has caused a logjam of shipping containers. The Port of Felixstowe, which handles 36% of the UK's freight container traffic, blamed the busy pre-Christmas period and haulage shortages. However, it said the situation has been improving over the last few days. Shipping giant Maersk told the BBC it is re-routing some of its biggest ships away from the port. The Financial Times,externalfirst reported on Tuesday that Maersk was re-routing ships away from Felixstowe to other European ports, where smaller vessels will be used for UK deliveries. Lars Mikael Jensen, head of global ocean network at Maersk, told BBC Radio 5 Live's Drive programme that some of its largest 20,000-container ships were waiting outside Felixstowe for between four to seven days. ""We've taken those measures because we saw, because of the big ships, there is a limit to how many berths they can call in Felixstowe, and because its slower, it took longer to handle every ship,"" he said. ""Instead of wasting time waiting, we progressed to the next stop, and arranged that the boxes are relayed from that port rather than wait for a week and then discharge."" Why is there an HGV driver shortage? Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Driver shortage: 'I got a big pay rise overnight' Problems at Felixstowe come as retailers and other groups warn of mounting concern about stocks in the run-up to Christmas trading. The port has blamed several factors for the build-up of shipping containers, including the busy pre-Christmas peak, haulage shortages, poor vessel scheduling, and the impact of the pandemic. On top of this, there are a high number of empty containers currently sitting at the port. Felixstowe said it is asking shipping lines to remove them as quickly as possible. ""The vast majority of import containers are cleared for collection within minutes of arriving and there are over 1,000 unused haulier bookings most days,"" the port stressed. ""However, the situation is improving and there is more spare space for import containers this week, than at any time since the beginning of July, when supply chain impacts first started to bite."" Industry bodies estimate there is a shortage of about 100,000 drivers with several sectors from retailers to domestic refuse collection affected. The government recently drafted in military personnel to help deliver fuel and to issue emergency temporary visa to foreign drivers. The shortage has been caused by several factors, including European drivers who went home during the pandemic, Brexit, tax changes anda backlog of HGV driver tests.,external Tim Morris, head of the Major Ports Group, which represents port operators, said the industry had been had been hit by a whole host of issues, including Brexit border changes, global demand for goods travelling by sea, and the pandemic. ""It has not been easy and there have been times of real stress on the ports system,"" he said. ""Ports have taken significant action to respond to the challenges and build resilience."" The problem is not just confined to the UK. Ports across the world have also suffered significant delays. Retailers have highlighted particular issues in China and east Asia, where pandemic restrictions and poor weather conditions have affected shipping. Sarah Treseder, chief executive of the trade group UK Chamber of Shipping, said there are reports of dozens of ships forced to wait outside ports in America and Asia. ""We anticipate the disruption will continue while the underlying market volatility stabilises,"" she said. Why is there an HGV driver shortage?

World leaders pledge to avert Afghan catastrophe,"Afghanistan is facing a severe humanitarian crisis, aid workers say Members of the G20 group of major economies have pledged to avert an economic catastrophe in Afghanistan. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country should not be allowed to ""descend into chaos"". The virtual summit came as the UN urged world leaders to put billions of dollars into the Afghan economy. US President Joe Biden stressed that aid should be provided via independent international organisations and not directly to the ruling Taliban. But so far the money forthcoming has largely been counted in millions, just to provide emergency food and medicine. Pledges include a promise by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to give â¬1bn ($1.15bn; Â£850m) to Afghanistan and to neighbouring countries taking in refugees. Mrs Merkel, who did not stand for re-election last month and will step down as chancellor once a new government is formed, reaffirmed Germany's pledge of â¬600m. ""None of us has anything to gain if the entire monetary system in Afghanistan collapses or the financial system collapses,"" she told reporters. ""Then humanitarian aid can no longer be provided. Of course it's never easy to draw the line, so to speak, but to look on as 40 million people descend into chaos because there's no electricity supply or financial system - that cannot and must not be the goal of the international community."" By Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Kabul The takeover of this country has caused a massive shock to an economy that was just about surviving. Banks were closed for many days after the Taliban seized control, and while many have opened now, accessing cash is still difficult. Many businesses shut down because their owners fled the country fearing for their lives. Many of those who had jobs haven't received salaries for months. With no cash in the market, there has been a sharp rise in prices of day to day necessities including food. An already difficult situation created by war and drought has become much worse. Women who had jobs and supported their families can no longer work and are now entirely dependent on handouts. In Kabul, hundreds of people are still living in the open in tents with harsher winter months fast approaching. Development aid given by foreign countries and agencies to Afghanistan, which helped to put cash into the economy, is all but frozen. This, on the ground, means that people who worked on development projects are out of jobs. The global community faces a tough decision - how to reach the Afghan people, without recognising a Taliban government. The chancellor said the Taliban must grant access to all UN bodies delivering aid, and stressed the need for the rights and girls and women to be respected. Mrs Merkel's words were echoed by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who was hosting the virtual summit. He said G20 countries had to have contact with the Taliban but that did not mean recognition of the Islamist group's government. For the poor the priority is staving off starvation Not all G20 leaders were present - Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sent representatives - but Mr Draghi said all participants had agreed on the need to provide more aid. The leaders also discussed ways to prevent Afghanistan becoming a haven for militants such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, and the need to provide safe passage for foreign nationals and Afghans hoping to leave Afghanistan. AT THE SCENE: Fighting off hunger under the Taliban ANALYSIS: What has changed in Afghanistan in 20 years ANALYSIS: A new order begins under Taliban rule The summit came as Western and Afghan officials met in Qatar to discuss aid, terrorism concerns and evacuation of foreigners. These were the first direct talks between the two sides since US troops left Afghanistan and the Taliban took power in August. The recent international moves come as Afghanistan faces what aid workers fear is a severe humanitarian crisis. Afghans have been describing their difficulties to the BBC. ""Nothing can be found, and even if it is available, it's too expensive and not affordable,"" one retired man said. ""I was paid last year and am still waiting on my salary, I have nothing to eat with my children."" Another, a government employee in the northern town of Takhar, complained that officials were lying about the payment of salaries. ""I've received nothing,"" he said. ""What type government is this?â¯ If an employee doesn't go to work, there would be complaints and an investigation. But if he's not being paid, how can he survive?"" UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned at a donor conference last month in Geneva that the poverty rate was soaring and public services were close to collapse. Some 40% of the country's GDP - national output - comes from aid, according to the World Bank. The US froze $10bn (Â£7.3bn) of the country's central bank assets after the Taliban captured Kabul on 15 August. For the poor in Kabul, the priority is staving off starvation, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen recently reported from the Afghan capital.

Tesco recalls own-brand chest and cold remedy,"Customers who have recently bought Tesco Max All-In-One Chesty Cough & Cold Lemon Sachets are being asked to check the dosing information on the packaging because some batches have been incorrectly labelled. The medicine should not be given to those under the age of 16, but some of the sachets being recalled say children aged 12 and over can take them. Around 78,000 packs are affected. Tesco has taken the product off shelves for now. MHRA Chief Safety Officer, Dr Alison Cave, said patient safety was paramount. ""We would like to reassure patients and parents that if you or someone under the age of 16 have used recently these sachets and have suffered no ill effects there is no cause for concern. If anyone has any questions please speak to your healthcare professional and report any adverse reactions via the Yellow Card scheme."" The Yellow Card Scheme is awebsite,externalfor reporting suspected adverse drug reactions. The packs involved each contain 10 sachets that have the drug paracetamol in them. Other ingredients include an expectorant (intended to help clear phlegm) called Guaifenesin and decongestant called Phenylephrine. Paracetamol is an everyday medicine that children can take, but, like other medicines it can be dangerous if your child takes too much. The affected sachets, which contain 1000mg of paracetamol, incorrectly state that children aged 12 years and over can take 4 sachets (diluted in water) over a 24-hour period, which would deliver the equivalent of 4000mg of paracetamol in total. The recommended dose by age, however, is: For Child 12-15 years, 500-750 mg every 4-6 hours with a maximum 4 doses per day For Child 16-17 years, 500-1000 mg every 4-6 hours with a maximum 4 doses per day It means someone who is 12-15 might potentially take 1000mg more than they should. Chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society Thorrun Govind said parents should not panic if this has happened, but should follow the advice to monitor their child for any potential side effects. ""Nausea and vomiting or drowsiness are some of the things to look out for,"" she said. The NHS says if your child has an extra dose of paracetamol by mistake, wait at least 24 hours before giving them any more. If they have taken two extra doses or more, they may need treatment. NHS advice on giving paracetamol to children,external The batch numbers affected are: 9MW0145 (expiry date Nov 2022) 0CW0054 (expiry date Jan 2023) 0FW0133 (expiry date May 2023) The recall does not affect any other products that share the same product licence number (PL 12063/0104) but are distributed by other retail stores.

Paddy Moloney playing tin whistle at Ground Zero in 2001 A former journalist who watched Paddy Moloney perform at a memorial service at Ground Zero for a banker who was killed in the 9/11 attacks said she had never forgotten the moment rescue workers and mourners stopped to listen to him play. Georgina Brennan-Stynes, a former reporter for Irish American magazine, interviewed Mr Moloney after his performance to remember Matthew O'Mahony. Mr Moloney was asked to play by Mr O'Mahony's widow who had described her husband as ""the Chieftains biggest fan"". ""Paddy felt he had to do it - he felt he could not walk away without leaving a piece of himself there, it was so beautiful,"" Ms Brennan-Stynes recalled. She said a crowd of thousands listened to his ""haunting"" performance the day after Mr O'Mahony's funeral. ""If there could've been any comfort, it was that the music he played on his tin whistle came from his heart to theirs,"" she said. ""He was giving all of those people some kind of farewell, a lament - it was almost as if he was playing in a very small graveyard in a small part of Ireland for a very loved neighbour and he did that for thousands of people and he was compelled to do it. Writing in Irish American magazine in 2002, Ms Brennan-Stynes recalled Mr Moloney saying he hadn't rehearsed for the event and had instead been inspired in the moment. ""Then as I played I felt I saw them all - the faces, faces without images,"" he said at the time. ""The mechanics of the music disappeared and my heart went into it. I got the shivers up my back.""

"Sorry for early Covid mistakes, says health minister","This video can not be played Eluned Morgan says she has never understood politicians who refuse to apologise where it's due Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has apologised for the mistakes made by the Welsh government in its initial handling of the pandemic. She was responding to a report by MPs which said the UK's early response to the pandemic isone of the worst ever public health failures. ""I'm prepared to apologise to all of those who have suffered,"" she said. The report said the slow move to lockdown led to a higher initial death toll than if ministers acted sooner. It said the slow move into restrictions - backed by UK government scientists and adopted by the UK's central and devolved governments - was ""wrong"" and ""deliberate"". The study, written by two House of Commons committees, claimed scientific advisers and government suffered ""a degree of group think"". Wales and the rest of the UK went into lockdown on 23 March - while the policy was controlled by ministers in Cardiff, early on they acted alongside the Westminster government. There were 2,289 deaths in Wales due to Covid, and 2,512 deaths involving Covid, in the first wave of the pandemic up to the end of July 2020. Wales went into lockdown on 23 March 2020 Opposition parties reiterated calls for a Wales-only public inquiry, with Plaid Cymru saying the Welsh government ""must take responsibility for its actions"". In the Senedd, First Minister Mark Drakeford declined to say whether he agreed the early response was one of the worst ever public health failures in the UK, and said he had not read the report. ""I've been asked the question many times, 'Were there things that you would have done differently had you known then what you know now?' "" he said. ""We didn't know those things then, we were following the advice that we had at the time."" He said as ""our knowledge grew"" ministers have ""not hesitated to take our own decisions where we thought that was in the best interests of Wales"". There have been a total of 8,262 deaths where Covid was mentioned on the death certificate up to 24 September this year. Speaking at a press briefing, Ms Morgan said: ""Of course I'm prepared to apologise to all of those who have suffered during the pandemic. ""This was a new disease that we'd never seen before. None of us knew how it was going to impact, none of us knew how it was going to spread, none of us had any idea that it could be spread even without showing any symptoms."" She added: ""Of course we made mistakes at the beginning of that process, because of the lack of information and data and knowledge that we have now learned. ""I think we have a duty and responsibility to say sorry to people where we've made mistakes."" The story of Wales' 100 days in lockdown UK's early Covid response was a failure - inquiry But the minister argued it would have been ""extremely difficult"" to have locked down Wales before England, because of the border and ""because furlough was not available"". She said since then, the Welsh government has taken a ""far more cautious approach compared to that of the rest of the United Kingdom"". But Ms Morgan denied that the Welsh government had suffered from group think - when a group of individuals reaches a consensus without critical reasoning. A decision to scrap community testing for coronavirus early in the pandemic was described by the report as a ""serious mistake"". Wales, in common with the rest of the UK, took the same approach. Ms Morgan partly blamed this on a limitation on the number of tests available at the time. Catherine Griffiths's father Harry died with Covid in his Aberystwyth care home Figures showed that there were 157% more care home deaths from all causes than there would be normally in April 2020, with 1,171 in total. The daughter of a man who died from Covid last year said it was ""good to have an apology"" but said it was ""slightly qualified"". Catherine Griffiths, whose father Harry Griffiths died with Covid in his Aberystwyth care home, told BBC Wales: ""They didn't know what was happening in the first wave but they knew what was happening in the second wave, my father died in the second wave. ""They should have protected people they should have acted and learned from countries in the Far East. While we were going into the second wave they were asking people to do quick tests before they enter care facilities, and we weren't doing that."" Ms Griffiths is part of the Covid Bereaved Families for Justice Cymru group, which is calling for a dedicated public inquiry for Wales into decisions made about the pandemic. 28 February - First Covid case confirmed in Wales 9 March - Mark Drakeford attends Cobra, chaired by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, with other first ministers 11 March - WHO declared coronavirus pandemic, first Welsh case found to have transmitted in the community 12 March - Mark Drakeford attends another Cobra meeting; chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton announces only targeted testing will take place in line with UK 'delay phase' response; Health Minister Vaughan Gething criticises demands for Wales v Scotland to be called off, saying advice says cancelling large events would not help save lives 13 March - WRU cancels Wales v Scotland, due to take place the next day. Non-urgent NHS care suspended in Wales 14 March - Stereophonics concert in Cardiff goes ahead 16 March - First Covid death in Wales confirmed, PM says all non-essential contact and unnecessary travel should stop 18 March - Schools told to close 20 March - Pubs, bars and cafes and other entertainment venues told to shut by midnight 23 March - Mark Drakeford announces stay-at-home lockdown at same time as Boris Johnson There are calls for a Wales-only public inquiry into the Covid response Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said the report showed the ""fatalistic approach at the heart of this Westminster government"" but also called for a Welsh public inquiry. Plaid health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth said: ""The Welsh government must take responsibility for its actions - good and bad, and there should be no avoidance of detailed scrutiny."" Welsh Conservative health spokesman Russell George said: ""The pandemic was an unprecedented crisis and as these reports show decision-makers in government followed the science and evidence provided by experts."" He added the report shows ""why we need a Wales-specific Covid inquiry"". However Mark Drakeford argued in the Senedd that the report strengthens the argument for the Welsh ""experience to be properly investigated within the wider UK context"". The first minister has backed a UK government inquiry, but has not ruled out a Wales-only effort if he is not satisfied with what is set up by the UK government. Mr Drakeford told the Senedd he was yet to receive a reply to a letter to Communities Secretary Michael Gove on the 10 September setting out a ""series of tests"" the Welsh government would apply ""to give us confidence"". The first minister said he was hoping to have a meeting with the prime minister in the coming days, and added he expects devolved governments to be ""properly involved"" in the appointment of the UK government's inquiry chair. During the press conference it was announced that the Welsh government had set a target of offering all 12 to 15-year-olds a Covid vaccine by the end of October. The government also said all residents of care homes will have been offered a booster by the same date. Dr Gill Richardson, Deputy Chief Medical Officer for Vaccines, said she expected the majority of people over 50 or who have an underlying health condition to have been offered their booster by the end of the year. A Welsh government statement said the committees' report ""does not scrutinise decisions made by any of the devolved governments in Wales, Scotland or Northern Ireland"". ""Some actions and decisions in the pandemic response were taken at a UK level on a four-nations basis - we have always been open to working together where there are shared decisions and shared responses. ""We have followed the advice of our medical and scientific advisers and have taken a more cautious approach. Independent reports, by Audit Wales, have shown our approach to testing, for example, was less costly and more efficient than that taken by the UK government.""

'Adapt or die' warning over UK climate change,"Hundreds of people could die in floods in the UK, the Environment Agency has warned in a hard-hitting report that says the country is not ready for the impact of climate change. Earlier this year in Germany,dozens of people diedin floods. ""That will happen in this country sooner or later"" unless the UK becomes more resilient to increasingly violent weather, the agency concludes. Emma Howard Boyd, chair of the agency, said: ""It is adapt or die."" The apocalyptic tone is deliberately intended to startle governments, companies and communities into preparing for global warming effects such as higher sea levels and more extremes of rainfall and drought. The new report, seen by the BBC ahead of its publication on Wednesday, assesses the country's readiness to cope with the many different risks of climate change. In its response, environment department Defra said it was taking key measures to protect the UK from the effects of global warming. We are currently heading for an increase in the global average temperature of just under 3C by the end of the century. But the agency projects that even a smaller rise of 2C would have severe consequences: Winter rainfall up by 6% by the 2050s and 8% by the 2080s (compared with 1981-2000) Summer rainfall down by about 15% by the 2050s London's sea level up by 23cm by the 2050s and 45cm by the 2080s By the 2050s, peak river flows could be up 27% while summer flows could be down as much as 82% An extra 3.4 billion litres of extra water needed every day before 2050, on top of the 15 billion used now According to Ms Howard Boyd: ""We can successfully tackle the climate emergency if we do the right things, but we are running out of time to implement effective adaptation measures. ""Some 200 people died in this summer's flooding in Germany. That will happen in this country sooner or later, however high we build our flood defences - unless we also make the places where we live, work and travel resilient to the effects of the more violent weather the climate emergency is bringing."" Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. The agency calls for new thinking on flood protection, closer partnerships between government and businesses, and projects to restore natural systems that absorb carbon and hold back rainwater. Ms Howard Boyd added: ""With the right approach we can be safer and more prosperous. So let's prepare, act and survive."" The loss of life in Germany last July is a reminder of the last time flooding led to a massive death toll in the UK. Back in 1953, a storm surge killed 307 people in England and 19 in Scotland. That tragedy forced a radical rethink about flood protection and a massive investment in coastal defences that eventually led to the Thames Barrier in London. Now, as officials across the UK weigh up future phases of flood defence, the report identifies what it calls five ""reality checks"" about climate change: The Environment Agency alone ""cannot protect everyone from increasing flood and coastal risks"". Agency staff have long warned of the long-term dangers of anaccelerating rise in sea level and of shifts in rainfall patterns Climate change ""makes it harder to ensure clean and plentiful water"". This comes as demand for water rises as the population grows, especially in eastern and south-east England Environmental rules are ""not yet ready for a changing climate"". The regulations on water use and pollution weren't drawn up with such rapid changes in mind ""Ecosystems cannot adapt as fast as the climate is changing"". This is a factor in the losses in biodiversity, particularly among freshwater species There'll be ""more and worst environmental incidents"". Emergencies in flooding, water shortages and pollution will strike more often and with greater severity The agency calls for new thinking on flood protection, saying that ""business as usual"" approaches are no longer adequate. In practical terms, that means better co-ordination between companies, national agencies and local authorities, with businesses and homeowners encouraged to take basic steps to flood-proof their own properties. It wants more investment in natural ways of reducing flood risk, such as restoring upland areas that can retain rainwater upstream and improving management of the soil so there's less run-off. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet it's climate targets? How extreme weather is linked to climate change The agency also suggests trialling new arrangements and technologies for warning local communities about flood risks, and having closer coordination with other emergency services. The agency acknowledges that billions of pounds have been spent on flood defences - and that more is earmarked. And it recognises that the UK, as host of the COP26 climate conference in Glasgow next month, is highlighting the importance of helping communities and nature adapt to climate change. In response, Defra highlighted several key measures designed to adapt to a changing climate: Â£5.2bn to protect 336,000 properties from flooding and coastal erosion better; a national framework to manage water supplies; and a Â£640m Nature for Climate Fund to tackle climate change and adaptation together. A spokesperson said: ""We are taking robust action to improve resilience to climate change across the whole country and economy, and adaptation to climate change is integrated in policies throughout government. ""We're also using our COP26 presidency to drive climate adaptation around the world, protecting communities and natural habitats.""

What COP26 could mean for us all,"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

Frost proposes new NI protocol in Brexit row,"Lord Frost warned the UK could still trigger Article 16 if the EU did not agree on changes to the existing protocol Brexit Minister Lord Frost has proposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing Northern Ireland Protocol. In a speech to diplomats in Portugal on Tuesday, he described his new legal text as ""a better way forward"". The protocol is thespecial Brexit deal agreed for Northern Irelandto prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Unionists argue it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the UK and creates a trade barrier. In a plea to the European Union to allow for ""significant change"" to post-Brexit rules governing trade with Northern Ireland, Lord Frost said his proposed text would support the Good Friday Agreement. He said it was forward-looking, improved on the current ""excessively rigid"" protocol, and would allow the EU and UK to ""get back to normal"" by removing ""the poison"" from their relationship. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Why are there tensions over the NI Brexit deal? Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? With the EU expected to putforward proposals on Wednesday, Lord Frost again warned Brussels London could unilaterally waive some of the terms of its agreement if the bloc failed to budge. ""We have a short, but real, opportunity to put in place a new arrangement, to defuse the political crisis that is brewing, both in Northern Ireland and between us,"" Lord Frost said. However, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Louise Haigh said the move to replace the protocol was ""stoking tension while solving nothing"". In a tweet, the Labour MP said Lord Frost's speech ""sets the stage for another destabilising stand-off, with the agreement businesses and communities need further away than ever"". ""Stability, jobs and livelihoods depend on real progress in Northern Ireland in the coming weeks,"" she said. ""It would be a serious abdication of responsibility to block a pragmatic way forward and provoke more poisonous instability."" Lord Frost urged the EU to look carefully at the UK's new legal text, and said the existing protocol could not survive, as it did not have support right across Northern Ireland. He also warned the UK could still trigger Article 16 - which allows either side to effectively override large parts of the agreement - if the EU and UK could not agree on changes to the existing protocol. ""We would not go down this route gratuitously or with any particular pleasure but it is our fundamental responsibility to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and that is why we cannot rest until this situation is addressed,"" said Lord Frost. There are two schools of thought about how this latest negotiation is shaping up. The first is that Lord Frost's hard line on the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is standard pre-negotiation tactics, aimed at grinding out another concession or two. After all the Brexit process has always delivered a deal, even at times when it seemed improbable. The UK government wants to remove the ECJ from its oversight role as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, sayingas long as it continues the protocol will never survive. The EU, on the other hand, has said it would be very hard for the protocol to continue without the court's oversight. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has warned that the UK's demands on the protocol could cause ""a breakdown in relations"" with the EU. He has hinted that maybe the UK doesn't want a deal unless it's total victory. Under that scenario, the UK would go through the motions before triggering Article 16. It would use this to gut the protocol while calculating that the EU's ability to retaliate is limited or or at least would take a long time to amount to anything. We should find out which view is right by the end of this year. The Brexit minister said the protocol represented ""a moment of EU overreach when the UK's negotiating hand was tied"" and that it could not ""reasonably last in its current form"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed up to the protocol as part of his Brexit agreement in 2020, but has since argued it was agreed in haste and was no longer working for the people of Northern Ireland. The EU has repeatedly said it would not renegotiate the protocol, criticising the UK for reneging on an agreement that both sides signed in good faith. The UK government also wants to reverse its previous agreement onthe oversight role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ),which is the EU's highest court. Lord Frost said his new text proposed reliance on ""international arbitration instead of a system of EU law ultimately policed in the court of one of the parties"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has threatened to pull his party out of Stormont Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - said if the current protocol was not replaced with a long-term solution Northern Ireland would be exposed to ""further harm and instability"". The DUP leader has previously warned his partymay quit Stormontif its demands over the protocol are not met. But Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the protocol was an international treaty that ""recognises the special status of this island."" Its implementation, the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president added, was ""not negotiable"". ""The conduct of the British government throughout these negotiations has been duplicitous and disgraceful and is an effort to break yet another international agreement"". She said: ""The attempts by the Tories and the DUP to undermine the protections and opportunities of the Protocol and impose a hard border must be opposed"". Ulster Unionist assembly member Steve Aiken said it was ""self-evident"" the existing protocol was not working. He said the party would consider the UK government's legal text and the EU proposals due on Wednesday. These will focus on easing practical problems, rather than changing oversight arrangements. But Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry MP said Lord Frost had ""chosen to enter into another layer of delusion"". Mr Farry said short of the UK ""rejoining the Customs Union and Single Market, there is no alternative than for the UK to work with the EU in a spirit of partnership to achieve as many mitigations and flexibilities as possible."" SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said Lord Frost's remarks represented a ""deliberate distortion of facts and contempt for people here"". He said Lord Frost had negotiated the protocol, agreed to its terms and ""backed Boris Johnson's campaign to sell it during the last general election"". Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said: ""If, as Lord Frost says, it is the UK that governs Northern Ireland, then, there must be an end to the European Union's writ in this part of the United Kingdom. ""Put simply, it requires an end to the Protocol in all its parts."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

DJ Emma B says Couzens exposed himself to her,"This video can not be played Magic FM DJ Emma Wilson believes Wayne Couzens exposed himself to her 13 years ago Radio presenter Emma Wilson has said Sarah Everard's murderer Wayne Couzens flashed her and that Met Police officers laughed when she reported it. The Magic FM DJ - who is also known as Emma B - said he exposed himself to her when she walked past an alleyway in Greenwich, south-east London, in 2008. She told BBC Radio 4's Woman's Hour she recognised him when she saw his photo in news reports. The Met Police is investigating the presenter's complaint. Ms Wilson told the programme she was ""so very sure"" it was Couzens - who at the time was a volunteer officer with Kent Police - and that it ""adds to the clamour of chances there were to stop this man"". Couzens - who went on to become a Met Police officer - was given a whole-life term last month for the kidnap, rape and murder of Ms Everard. The police watchdog, the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC), is looking into the Met's handling of three other alleged indecent exposure incidents involving Couzens, including two said to have taken place in south London three days before he murdered Ms Everard. The other allegation centres around a report of how Kent Police investigated a claim in 2015. Details of a car linked to Couzens had been passed on to police but he was not identified. A Met Police review found that an allegation Couzens exposed himself outside a fast-food restaurant in the days before he murdered Ms Everardhad been allocated for investigation, but by the time of the marketing executive's abduction it was not concluded. The IOPC said two Met officers had been served with misconduct notices for possible breaches of professional standards in relation to the incident. Sarah Everard was murdered after being tricked into Couzens' car as she walked from Clapham to Brixton Ms Wilson said she knows it was Couzens who exposed himself to her as he had a ""face that doesn't go anywhere, it stays with you"". She explained how she ran into a nearby shop to alert police who then visited her to take a statement. ""They were asking me what I could see... he was playing with himself and there were specifics about his state of arousal that they thought were quite amusing. It was really humiliating,"" Ms Wilson said. ""I remember clearly saying to them, 'I really hope this is all he needs to do' and I said that at the time because I was so struck by how feeble their response was."" Baroness Casey to lead Sarah Everard police review Inquiry into failures over Sarah Everard's killer What should you do if you are stopped by police? The presenter said the incident was ""aggressive, it was purposeful, it was calculated"" and that ""it wasn't this comic character that we have of this local peeping Tom or the local flasher in the flasher mac"". ""There's a really big part of me that hopes it wasn't him because if it was, this is horrific that it could have gone on for so very, very long."" Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape The Met Police said at the time, that a search of the area was conducted but the suspect could not be found. CCTV inquiries were unsuccessful and the matter was passed on to the local safer neighbourhoods team for intelligence. The force added that to the best of its knowledge, it was ""not aware"" of any reports before his March arrest where he had been named as a suspect. It said if it received any allegations it would investigate. Earlier on Tuesday, Met Police Deputy Commissioner Bas Javid acknowledged there was a ""crisis"" of confidence in policing in the wake of Ms Everard's murder. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Today programme, he said: ""We want women and girls particularly to feel safe in communities. ""There's a lot of work to be done to rebuild that trust and give people the confidence to come forward."" He said as well as theindependent review into the force's standards and culture, the Met Police was taking other steps to be ""proactive"". Those measures include undertaking an examination of all ongoing sexual and domestic abuse allegations against officers and staff, and significantly boosting the number of officers who investigate police misconduct.

Footballers threaten data firms with legal action,"This video can not be played Footballers 'have right to see where data goes' Hundreds of footballers have threatened legal action against the data collection industry, which could change how information is handled. Led by former Cardiff City, Leyton Orient and Yeovil Town manager Russell Slade, 850 players want compensation for the trading of their performance data over the past six years. They also want an annual fee from the companies for any future use. ""Letters before action"" have been sent to 17 big firms, alleging data misuse. Welsh government breached data laws 300 times How your data is being scraped from social media Anglesey cyber-attack affects island's five secondaries Data ranges from average goals-per-game for an outfield player to height - however, Mr Sladehas previously expressed concernthis is sometimes wrong. If the group pursues legal action and is successful, it could lead to a radical change of a multi-billion pound industry behind professional sport that trades on players' information. Slade's legal team said the fact players receive no payment for the unlicensed use of their data contravenes General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules that were strengthened in 2018. Under Article 4 of the GDPR, ""personal data"" refers to a range or identifiable information, such as physical attributes, location data or physiological information. BBC News understands that an initial 17 major betting, entertainment and data collection firms have been targeted, but Slade's Global Sports Data and Technology Group has highlighted more than 150 targets it believes have misused data. Former Cardiff City manager Russell Slade is leading the group While receiving a fee for the use of their data might not have much impact on the high earners of the Premier League, Slade feels strongly that those lower down the pyramid, in both the men's and women's game, would see tangible benefits. ""It's incredible where it's used,"" Slade said. ""On one player, and I'm not talking about a Premier League player or even a Championship player, there was some 7,000 pieces of information on one individual player at a lower league football club. ""There are companies that are taking that data and processing that data without the individual consent of that player. ""A big part of our journey has been looking at that ecosystem and plotting out where that data starts, who's processing it, where it finishes and that's a real global thing. ""It's making football - and all sports - aware of the implications and what needs to change."" The use of data in sport is nothing new. Its collection, distribution and use has become a staple part of the modern sporting environment, be it by clubs to manage player performance, or by third party companies to base things like odds on. If the move is successful, the implications could have far-reaching effects beyond football. TikTok sued for billions over children's data Welsh government breached data laws over 300 times Facebook sued for 'losing control' of usersâ data BBC News understand discussions are already underway within other professional sports to bring potential legal action regarding the trading of data. Former Wales international Dave Edwards, one the players behind the move, said it was a chance for players to take more control of the way information about them is used. Having seen how data has become a staple part of the modern game, he believes players rights to how information about them is used should be at the forefront of any future use. ""The more I've looked into it and you see how our data is used, the amount of channels its passed through, all the different organisations which use it, I feel as a player we should have a say on who is allowed to use it,"" he said. The footballers say they want compensation and an annual fee for the use of their data ""Anyone else in the world would have that say. Just because we're footballers and we're in the public domain that gets overlooked. ""If you were in another job, if you were a teacher or a lawyer and this sort of details was being passed around your field of work it wouldn't sit right with that person. ""I don't think we, as individuals really differ from that."" The lawyer behind Global Sports Data and Technology's action, Chris Farnell, believes it could be start of a sport-wide reshaping of how data is traded. ""This will be significant change if the precedent is set throughout football and how data is used throughout sport in general,"" he said. ""It will change significantly how that data is being used and how it's going to be rewarded.""

Irish author Sally Rooney in Israel boycott row,"Sally Rooney said she supported ""the Palestinian people in their struggle for freedom, justice and equality"" Irish author Sally Rooney is at the centre of a controversy after refusing to allow her new book to be translated into Hebrew by an Israeli company. The acclaimed writer said it was in support of calls to boycott Israel over its policies towards the Palestinians. She said it would ""be an honour"" to have Beautiful World, Where Are You translated into Hebrew by a company which shared her political position. A senior Israeli minister said such boycotts were a form of anti-Semitism. Rooney issued a statement clarifying her action after being accused of refusing to allow her novel to be translated into Hebrew at all. The allegations came after it emerged that she had turned down a bid by Israeli publisher Modan for the rights to translate the book. She said that while she was ""very proud"" that her two previous novels - Conversations With Friends (2017) and Normal People (2018) - had been translated into Hebrew, ""for the moment, I have chosen not to sell these translation rights to an Israeli-based publishing house"". Beautiful World, Where Are You was released last month to much acclaim Citing a recentreport by Human Rights Watch which accused Israel of practising apartheid, Ms Rooney said her decision was in support of the pro-Palestinian Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement, which calls for a complete boycott of Israel. She could not, she said, ""accept a new contract with an Israeli company that does not publicly distance itself from apartheid and support the UN-stipulated rights of the Palestinian people. ""The Hebrew-language translation rights to my new novel are still available, and if I can find a way to sell these rights that is compliant with the BDS movement's institutional boycott guidelines, I will be very pleased and proud to do so."" Apartheid was a policy of racial segregation and discrimination enforced by the white minority government against the black majority in South Africa from 1948 until 1991. Israel has long claimed BDS opposes the country's very existence and is motivated by anti-Semitism. It vehemently rejects any comparison with apartheid and called the HRW report ""preposterous and false"". Rooney's stance was met with an outpouring of anger and praise on social media. The Palestinian Campaign for the Academic and Cultural Boycott of Israel said Palestinians ""warmly welcomed"" her decision, while others said she had been misrepresented. Allow Twitter content?

Ex-Health Secretary Matt Hancock given UN role,"Matt Hancock resigned from government in July but remains an MP Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock has been given a role with the United Nations as a special representative. Writing on Twitter, the ex-minister said the job would focus on helping Africa's economy recover from Covid. It comes four months after Mr Hancockresigned from his cabinet postfor breaking social distancing guidelines by kissing a colleague. The Under Secretary General of the UN, Vera Songwe, praised his ""success"" in tackling the UK's pandemic response. In a letter posted online by Mr Hancock, Ms Songwe said the ""acceleration of vaccines that has led the UK move faster towards economic recovery is one testament to the strengths that you will bring to this role, together with your fiscal and monetary experience"". The announcement also comes on the day a report from MPs was published, claiming the government and its scientists' failure to do more to stop Covid spreading early in the pandemic wasone of the country's worst public health failures. Did Matt Hancock break the law? Matt Hancock: High profile former health secretary How will Covid-19 affect African economies? Mr Hancock's official title will be ""UN special representative on financial innovation and climate change for the United Nations Economic Commission for Africa"". His new role will be unpaid and he will continue as a Conservative MP. Mr Hancock said he was ""honoured"" to be appointed and would help ""promote sustainable development"", alongside working on the economic recovery.

When's the public inquiry?,"The Covid inquiry's next public hearings begin on Monday, 9 September, when it will consider how coronavirus affected healthcare systems across the UK. In July, the inquiry's first report said the UK's flawed pandemic preparations had led to more deaths and greater economic damage than there should have been. Just under 227,000 people died in the UK from Covid between March 2020 and May 2023, when the World Health Organization (WHO) said the ""global health emergency"" was over. The Covid inquirywas launched by former Prime Minister Boris Johnson in June 2022, more than a year after he said the government's actions would be put ""under the microscope"". The announcement came after the Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice campaign said it was considering launching a judicial review over government ""time-wasting"". Mr Johnson said the inquiry would cover decision-making during the pandemic by the UK government, as well as the administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. The first public hearings took place in June 2023. Public inquiries are established and funded by the government and are led by an independent chair. They can compel witnesses to give evidence. No-one is found guilty or innocent but the inquiry publishes conclusions and recommendations, which the government is not obliged to accept. Covid inquiry: The UK pandemic in numbers UK 'failed citizens' with flawed pandemic plans The inquiry is chaired by former judge and crossbench peerBaroness Hallett, who previously ledthe inquests into the 7 July London bombings. She said that loss and suffering would be at the heart of the inquiry, adding it would be ""firmly independent"". Baroness Hallett promised the inquiry would be ""thorough and fair"" She said the inquiry would consider how decisions on limiting the spread of Covid were made and communicated, and the use of lockdowns and face coverings. It is also looking at the impact on children and health and care sector workers, and the protection of the clinically vulnerable. The effect on bereaved families and how the findings could be applied to other national emergencies will also be part of the inquiry. Loss and suffering at heart of Covid inquiry At least nine reports are expected, covering everything from political decision-making to vaccines. Publishing the first of these, inquiry chair Baroness Hallett said the UK was ""ill-prepared for dealing with a catastrophic emergency, let alone the coronavirus pandemic"". ""Never again can a disease be allowed to lead to so many deaths and so much suffering,"" she added. The 217-page report argues the UK planned for the wrong pandemic - a mild one where spread of a new virus was inevitable - and this led to the ""untested"" policy of lockdown. It says the UK government and devolved nations ""failed their citizens"", and that government ministers did not sufficiently challenge scientific experts. It made a series of recommendations for reforming the way the government approaches emergency planning across the four nations of the UK. Baroness Hallett said she wants to see these acted on quickly, with changes in place within six months or a year. Covid inquiry: Full report,externalandCovid inquiry: Summary report,external UK 'failed citizens' with flawed pandemic plans Theinquiry is split into different parts.,externalWork has begun in several areas: resilience and preparedness decision-making and political governance in Westminster, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland the impact on healthcare systems across the UK vaccines, therapeutics and antiviral treatment government procurement and PPE the care sector test-and-trace the impact on children and young people the government's business and financial responses Future strands will consider: health inequalities the impact on other public services There is no specific timescale for how long the inquiry will last, but Baroness Hallett aims to hold the final public hearings in 2026.

In addition,witness transcripts are published on the inquiry website.,external In December 2023, former PM Rishi Sunak gave evidence during the second round of public hearings in Londonwhich focused on UK decision making and political governance,external. He apologised to ""all those who suffered... as a result of the actions that were taken"" butdenied his Eat Out to Help Out Scheme had increased Covid infections and deaths. Rishi Sunak served food at Wagamama as part of a promotional event for Eat Out to Help Out He also rejected earlier evidence from the government's chief medical officer, Prof Sir Chris Whitty, and former chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance thatthey were not consulted about the policy. Did Sunak's Eat Out scheme help to spread Covid? Former PM Boris Johnsongave evidence across two daysin December 2023 as part of the second round of hearings. The inquiry had already heard from government officials and advisers, academic experts and representatives of bereaved families, many of whom were extremely critical of his actions. Mr Johnson beganby apologising for the ""pain and the loss and the suffering"" experienced during the pandemic. His comments were interrupted by protesters, and some members of bereaved families held up signs reading: ""The dead can't hear your apologies"". This video can not be played Barnard Castle, ICU and heckling: Johnson grilled at Covid inquiry He admitted mistakes were made and that ""there were unquestionably things we should have done differently"". He said he took ""personal responsibility for all decisions made"", but insisted that ministers had done their ""level best"" in difficult circumstances. Five takeaways from Johnson at the Covid inquiry The second round of public hearings began in October 2023. Former Health Secretary Matt Hancock - who previously told the inquirythe UK's pandemic strategy had been completely wrong- deniedhe lied to colleagues during his period in office. But he admitted the UK should have locked down much soonerand criticised the ""toxic culture"" in government, for which he blamed Mr Johnson's former adviser Dominic Cummings. Former cabinet minister Michael Govealso apologised to ""victims and families who endured so much loss""but denied that Mr Johnson could not take decisions. Sir Chris, his former deputy Prof Sir Jonathan Van-Tam and Sir Patrickrevealed significant tensions between their advice to government and its political priorities, such as over Eat Out to Help Out. Mr Johnson, Sir Chris and Sir Patrick talked to journalists at Downing St during the pandemic Sir Jonathan revealedhe and his family had received death threats,while Sir Patrick saidhe had also considered resigning over abuse. Former deputy cabinet secretary Helen MacNamaratold the inquiry that she struggled ""to pick one day"" when Covid rules were properly followed inside a ""macho"" and ""toxic"" No 10. Dominic Cummings was highly critical of former MP Boris Johnson's approach In his evidence, Mr Cummings describeda ""dysfunctional"" government with no plans to lock down the country or shield the vulnerable. The inquiry heard scathing text messages which he sent,many of which contained offensive descriptions of ministers and officials. He said he regretted the disastrous handling of his infamous trip to Barnard Castle during the first lockdown, but denied his actions had damaged public trust. Covid inquiry WhatsApps paint picture of chaos How inquiry is exposing deep flaws in Covid decision-making The first public hearings examiningthe UK's resilience and preparedness,externalbegan in June 2023. The inquiry took evidence from 69 independent experts and former and current government officials and ministers. This video can not be played Prof Dame Sally Davies tells the Covid inquiry that ""it wasn't just the deaths, it was the way they died"". These included former health secretariesJeremy HuntandMatt Hancock,former PMDavid Cameronand former First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon. Sir Chris, his predecessor Prof Dame Sally Davies and Sir Patrick also gave evidence during the first hearings. Covid Inquiry: What have we learnt so far? Across 12 days of hearings in May 2024, the inquiry took evidence from senior politicians, including First Minister Michelle O'Neill, former Health Minister Robin Swann and former First Minister Baroness Foster. During her evidence, Lady Fosterrejected suggestions the Northern Ireland Executive ""sleepwalked"" into the pandemic. Separately, Ms O'Neillapologised for attending senior republican Bobby Storey's funeral during lockdown, when she was deputy first minister. Mr Swann saidmeetings he had attended on Covid rules in November 2020 had been the ""lowest days"" he had experiencedin politics. Other witnesses included civil servants, experts and groups representing bereaved families, older people and those with disabilities. Sorrys and surprises as O'Neill and Foster face inquiry 'Devastating evidence' as Covid policy scrutinised Most of the hearings in March 2024 focused on the first wave of the pandemic. The inquiry heard from 34 witnesses, including former First Minister Mark Drakeford, who likened then Prime Minister Boris Johnson during the crisisto an ""absent"" football manager. Former First Minister Mark Drakeford criticised Boris Johnson's leadership during the pandemic A number of witnesses accused the Welsh government of issuing conflicting, contradictory and confusing guidance and criticised the: approach to personal protection equipment (PPE) treatment of care home residents decision to close schools The cancellation of the Wales v Scotland Six Nations rugby match, in March 2020, 24 hours before it had been due to start, was referenced several times. Kirsten Heaven, counsel for the Covid-19 Bereaved Families Cymru saidthere had been a ""passive, slow and disjointed"" early response to the pandemic. She criticised the ""sloth-like urgency"" of ministers' response and called for the publication of all relevant government WhatsApp messages Andrew Kinnier KC, representing the Welsh government, said ministers accepted some policies had not worked as well as they had hoped but their decisions had been a ""reasonable response to the unprecedented challenge to civil society"". Five things we learned from the Covid inquiry The use of WhatsApp by Scottish government advisers and ministers was a key issue during the January 2024 hearings. Former First Minister Humza Yousaf apologised unreservedly for the Scottish government's failure to hand over relevant messages. Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon told the inquiry that she and her government were ""open, transparent and accountable"" Former First Minister Nicola Sturgeon admitted that she deleted messages from the period. But she insisted that she did not use these informal channels to reach decisions or to have substantial discussions and that everything of relevance was available on the public record. Ms Sturgeon was emotional during some of her evidence and appeared to fight back tears as she told the inquiry that ""part of me wishes I hadn't been [First Minister during the pandemic]"".

Don't let Afghanistan descend into chaos - Merkel,"Afghanistan is facing a severe humanitarian crisis, aid workers say Members of the G20 group of major economies have pledged to avert an economic catastrophe in Afghanistan. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the country should not be allowed to ""descend into chaos"". The virtual summit came as the UN urged world leaders to put billions of dollars into the Afghan economy. US President Joe Biden stressed that aid should be provided via independent international organisations and not directly to the ruling Taliban. But so far the money forthcoming has largely been counted in millions, just to provide emergency food and medicine. Pledges include a promise by European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen to give â¬1bn ($1.15bn; Â£850m) to Afghanistan and to neighbouring countries taking in refugees. Mrs Merkel, who did not stand for re-election last month and will step down as chancellor once a new government is formed, reaffirmed Germany's pledge of â¬600m. ""None of us has anything to gain if the entire monetary system in Afghanistan collapses or the financial system collapses,"" she told reporters. ""Then humanitarian aid can no longer be provided. Of course it's never easy to draw the line, so to speak, but to look on as 40 million people descend into chaos because there's no electricity supply or financial system - that cannot and must not be the goal of the international community."" By Yogita Limaye, BBC News, Kabul The takeover of this country has caused a massive shock to an economy that was just about surviving. Banks were closed for many days after the Taliban seized control, and while many have opened now, accessing cash is still difficult. Many businesses shut down because their owners fled the country fearing for their lives. Many of those who had jobs haven't received salaries for months. With no cash in the market, there has been a sharp rise in prices of day to day necessities including food. An already difficult situation created by war and drought has become much worse. Women who had jobs and supported their families can no longer work and are now entirely dependent on handouts. In Kabul, hundreds of people are still living in the open in tents with harsher winter months fast approaching. Development aid given by foreign countries and agencies to Afghanistan, which helped to put cash into the economy, is all but frozen. This, on the ground, means that people who worked on development projects are out of jobs. The global community faces a tough decision - how to reach the Afghan people, without recognising a Taliban government. The chancellor said the Taliban must grant access to all UN bodies delivering aid, and stressed the need for the rights and girls and women to be respected. Mrs Merkel's words were echoed by Italian Prime Minister Mario Draghi, who was hosting the virtual summit. He said G20 countries had to have contact with the Taliban but that did not mean recognition of the Islamist group's government. For the poor the priority is staving off starvation Not all G20 leaders were present - Chinese President Xi Jinping and Russian President Vladimir Putin sent representatives - but Mr Draghi said all participants had agreed on the need to provide more aid. The leaders also discussed ways to prevent Afghanistan becoming a haven for militants such as al-Qaeda and the Islamic State group, and the need to provide safe passage for foreign nationals and Afghans hoping to leave Afghanistan. AT THE SCENE: Fighting off hunger under the Taliban ANALYSIS: What has changed in Afghanistan in 20 years ANALYSIS: A new order begins under Taliban rule The summit came as Western and Afghan officials met in Qatar to discuss aid, terrorism concerns and evacuation of foreigners. These were the first direct talks between the two sides since US troops left Afghanistan and the Taliban took power in August. The recent international moves come as Afghanistan faces what aid workers fear is a severe humanitarian crisis. Afghans have been describing their difficulties to the BBC. ""Nothing can be found, and even if it is available, it's too expensive and not affordable,"" one retired man said. ""I was paid last year and am still waiting on my salary, I have nothing to eat with my children."" Another, a government employee in the northern town of Takhar, complained that officials were lying about the payment of salaries. ""I've received nothing,"" he said. ""What type government is this?â¯ If an employee doesn't go to work, there would be complaints and an investigation. But if he's not being paid, how can he survive?"" UN Secretary-General AntÃ³nio Guterres warned at a donor conference last month in Geneva that the poverty rate was soaring and public services were close to collapse. Some 40% of the country's GDP - national output - comes from aid, according to the World Bank. The US froze $10bn (Â£7.3bn) of the country's central bank assets after the Taliban captured Kabul on 15 August. For the poor in Kabul, the priority is staving off starvation, the BBC's Jeremy Bowen recently reported from the Afghan capital.

Young people at serious Covid risk - health boss,"This video can not be played People at Bulldogs Boxing and Community Centre talk about those swerving the jab ""Because I'm younger I'll be able to fight it off, but I feel for the elderly."" Mackenzie Itzstein got the Covid vaccine to protect his grandparents - at 22, he believed he was low risk. But even teenagers are being hospitalised with ""serious Covid"", Swansea Bay's public health director has said. Keith Reid called on more sports clubs and celebrities to back a campaign to encourage people to get the vaccine. Mackenzie was living with his grandparents when they all contracted Covid. Speaking to BBC Wales alongside other young people at the Bulldogs Boxing and Community Centre in Port Talbot, he said: ""I was in the family home with my Nana and Grampa and they had it too. ""I was more concerned for them rather than me,"" he said, believing younger people were relatively safe from the virus. Mackenzie Itzstein said he was more concerned for his grandparents' health than his own This is a common myth public health boss Mr Reid is keen to dispel. He said his own health board has recently seen cases of young people being admitted to hospital. ""Young people do get serious Covid,"" he said. ""We've seen 45 young people in hospital in the last three months - by young people, I mean below the age of 15, treated for Covid. ""And we've also seen a lot of cases where young people have taken Covid home and shared it with other household members, some of whom have been quite vulnerable."" Seren Jenkins, 22, rejected any notion that young people might feel ""invincible"" - that Covid wouldn't affect them so severely. ""I'm sure there are loads of younger people that are like that, but I know loads of older people who've been exactly the same - everyone's probably done so many things wrong, I don't think it's fair to put it on one age group."" When lockdown was announced she said she was ""pretty careful"". ""I didn't see my family for about 14 weeks."" Seren Jenkins said she also knows older people who think they won't be badly affected by Covid She has had Covid, has been vaccinated and says she routinely wears masks in shops and on public transport. But lockdown has had an unexpected effect. ""I think it's had a really positive influence on me - I tend to not really say no to anything any more."" Neath Port Talbot recently had the highest rate of Covid cases across the UK, as well as the highest case rate among the under-25s in Wales. Vaccine take-up rates amongst the under-30s are also the lowest - albeit they were last to be offered the jab. But not all sports clubs have backed a campaign to encourage people to get the Covid vaccine, according to Mr Reid. Of the region's two top sports clubs, he said, only the Ospreys had backed the drive. ""One avidly supported our vaccine campaign, another one haven't,"" he said. But Swansea City FC said it was committed to helping the local vaccination programme and the stadium had been provided free of charge as a Covid testing facility. The club said its players and staff were spoken to regularly by its medical team about safety and vaccinations, adding that ""we respect them with the decisions that they undertake for both themselves and their families."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? Police boss angry at anti-vax protest intimidation Welsh government spent Â£32k on GLC jabs campaign Mr Reid said seeing role models having the jab gave fans ""a lot of assurance that vaccines are safe and effective"". ""We've seen the contrast between two really high level sporting teams within Swansea Bay region - one who avidly supported our vaccine campaign and have been very prominent in the community and another one who haven't,"" he said. ""And that's due to attitudes amongst players themselves."" It is understoodfewer than half the players at most Premier League and English Football League clubs have been vaccinated. ""Undoubtedly people from other walks of life, and especially from sporting walks of life, can have great influence on the health behaviour of our communities and it's to their credit when they stand up and do that,"" said Mr Reid. Nudges like these can be all the more important when considering the health of a local authority area like Neath Port Talbot. ""We saw the arrival of a new highly transmissible and infectious version of coronavirus at the same time that people were starting to move around more freely and mix more freely and I think that's what's driven up the rates,"" said Mr Reid. ""With schools going back when Delta (variant) was already pretty prevalent in the region - that's just added an extra element to the mix and we've seen rates in school kids in particular drive those headline figures."" Shane Miller, 18, who works part time at Bulldogs Boxing Club in Port Talbot, said it was an easy decision to be vaccinated, as he works with people with disabilities at the club and needed to be cautious. Shane Miller works part time at Bulldogs Boxing Club ""I know a lot of people were very relaxed about Covid,"" he said. ""I know two people who don't want the vaccine - they don't like needles or they just don't believe in Covid. ""I try and explain it's safer to have it, just in case, but it's the type of people who just don't listen."" He added transport can be an issue for those travelling to vaccination centres. ""They could do them in local chemists - if it was more local than that I think more people would have a better chance of getting there."" It is a point acknowledged by Keith Reid. ""It's much more difficult if you're working or you've got childcare responsibilities to get along to a vaccination centre,"" he said. ""We've seen a slower rise in coverage in those age groups, partly maybe because of the difficulty of getting along to vaccination - and higher scepticism I think, about what's the benefit of getting vaccinated."" Professional boxer Connor McIntosh saw his first child born during lockdown Professional boxer Connor McIntosh, 26, said he and his girlfriend were expecting their first child during lockdown - Bronagh May is now a year old. ""I didn't even leave the house - we weren't going to take any risks,"" said the construction health and safety consultant. ""I've had my first jab and I'll have my second in the next couple of weeks - I'll have to have it done before my first professional fight anyway, for safety measures."" But did he have any reservations? ""Not really - it's a tough one, it's come out really quick - a lot of people don't know exactly what's in them - you get a lot of people on Facebook thinking they're proper scientists and they know exactly what's in them - but if it's going to make things go back to normal quicker, then I think yeah, everyone should have them. ""I think if everyone plays ball and just helps each other out, hopefully we can all get through it and things will go back to normal sooner rather than later."" Rhodri Williams said he was anxious about going to watch his first football match after lockdown ended Rhodri Williams' parents both work in the NHS - one for the ambulance service, one as a nurse. ""The only time I would go out of the house was to go for a run with my brother, once a day,"" said the 22-year-old, who has had both his jabs. ""The people that are coming out and saying that the vaccine could kill them, or the government are putting stuff in it - they're the people that would go to Mexico and have their jabs no problem, but they're not getting anything out of this so they don't see the point in getting it. ""Some people don't want it because they don't know what's in it - but they don't know what's in their cigarettes or their vapes either. ""I've got a season ticket down the Swans - the first game back against Sheffield United was a bit of a shock, because I hadn't been around that many people since Covid. ""It wasn't that I was scared, it was more that I had a bit of anxiety about going with all these people, but when you're in the game it's brilliant how they do it - where I was sitting there was plenty of spacing and I didn't feel at all at risk there."" So does he agree that sports stars and celebrities have a role here? ""I've seen a lot of people, especially on TikTok and Instagram - celebrities filming their experiences of going to get a vaccine and putting it in a positive light - and maybe that's going to inspire a couple of the younger people to go and get their vaccine."" Swansea City says it ""placed great importance on its role during the pandemic"" In a statement, Swansea City said it ""is committed to assisting with the regional vaccination programme in the Swansea Bay area. ""The club places great emphasis on its role within the community and we are already engaging with the local health board about ways in which we can help in the future. ""Our players and staff receive regular dialogue from the club's medical team regarding public safety and vaccinations, and we respect them with the decisions that they undertake for both themselves and their families. ""Swansea City placed great importance on its role during the pandemic, such as opening its doors to the NHS for healthcare training purposes and providing our North Car Park as a Covid testing facility. Both of these ran for over a year without any charge being made by the club, while other venues rented out their facilities at a cost. ""The club would also like to place on record its sincere thanks to all those who have, and continue to, play an active and important role in the vaccination programme.""

"Experts say Â£10,900 a year needed to retire","A single person will need post-tax annual income of Â£10,900 for a minimum standard of living in retirement, academics have estimated. That spending budget increases to Â£16,700 for a couple, the calculations for The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) suggest. For the first timein the assessment,external, Netflix subscriptions and items such as haircuts are included. The PLSA said lockdowns gave workers a foretaste of retirement needs. ""The pandemic has emphasised the importance of economic security as well as social and cultural participation in retirement,"" said Nigel Peaple, director of policy and advocacy at the PLSA. ""We hope the updated standards will encourage people to think about whether they are saving enough for the retirement lifestyle they want and, in particular, whether they are making the most of the employer contributions on offer in their workplace pension."" 'Serious questions' face DWP over unpaid pensions Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year The calculations for retirement living standards are pitched at three different levels - minimum, moderate and comfortable - and are developed and maintained independently by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. The assessment is intended as a guide for those planning their retirement savings. Housing costs are not included on the assumption that most pensioners have paid off mortgages, although the PLSA said that decision would be kept under review. The minimum retirement living standard covers a typical retiree's basic needs plus enough for some social activities, such as a week of holiday in the UK, eating out once a month, but not including running a car. The estimate of an annual budget for the minimum standard has risen since 2019 by Â£700 for a single person, and by Â£1,000 for a couple. The total requirement would generally be made up of a full state pension of Â£9,339 per year, as well as some workplace pension savings. The moderate retirement living standard includes a two-week holiday in Europe and more frequent eating out. This was assessed to require a budget of Â£20,800 for a single person, Â£600 higher than two years ago, and Â£30,600 for a couple, up Â£1,500. The PLSA said around half of single employees were on track to expect a lifestyle between minimum and moderate. The position would be better for couples who were able to share costs. The annual budget needed for a comfortable retirement living standard has increased since 2019 by Â£600 to Â£33,600 for one person and Â£2,200 to Â£49,700 for a couple. This covered items such as regular beauty treatments, theatre trips, and annual maintenance and servicing of a burglar alarm. About one in six single employees is projected to have an income between moderate and comfortable. Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at investment firm AJ Bell, said: ""The pandemic has exposed gaping holes in the finances of millions of people, with many having little or nothing saved for an emergency. ""What's more, contribution levels into pension schemes remain low, particularly among self-employed workers. As the UK economy slowly recovers from lockdown, it is vital financial resilience becomes a key focus for policymakers, both in the short and long-term.""

UK job vacancies reach 20-year high,"The number of job vacancies in the UK has hit a record high, according to the latest official figures. Vacancies hit 1.1 million between July and September,the Office for National Statistics said,external, the highest level since records began in 2001. The largest increase in vacancies was in the retail sector and in motor vehicle repair, it said. The UK unemployment rate was estimated at 4.5%, compared with a rate of 4% before the pandemic. The ONS said the number of employees on payrolls showed another monthly increase, rising 207,000 to a record 29.2 million in September. Job vacancies: How do I find a new job and who is hiring? ""The jobs market has continued to recover from the effects of the coronavirus, with the number of employees on payroll in September now well exceeding pre-pandemic levels,"" said Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS. ""Vacancies also reached a new one-month record in September, at nearly 1.2 million, with our latest estimates suggesting that all industries have at least as many jobs on offer now as before the onset of Covid-19."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak said it was ""encouraging"" to see the government's jobs strategy working. ""The number of expected redundancies remained very low in September, there are more employees on payrolls than ever before and the unemployment rate has fallen for eight months in a row."" Little room for Budget spending, says think tank Businesses welcome back workers as furlough ends However, Yael Selfin, chief economist at KPMG UK, said labour market shortages ""could stunt"" the UK's economic recovery from the pandemic. ""The recovery is testing the capacity of the economy to adjust to a new post-pandemic environment, a task made more difficult by the reduced availability of overseas workers,"" she said. ""Acute skill shortages have pushed vacancies to record levels for a second month in a row in September, as employers struggled to find skilled staff."" Mark Jenkins says the pressure in the food supply industry is ""extreme"" Mark Jenkins, a supply chain director for London-based food wholesaler Brakes, says pressure on the industry is ""extreme"". Staff retention is a problem, he says. ""For every two people we hire, only one person stays, because there are other jobs in the market. ""Wages have gone up by 15% to 20% in some parts of the business in order to attract the right kind of people. And on top of that we're paying retention bonuses to hang on to the staff we do have. ""Everything is making it really difficult for us to service our customers"". Mark says the cost of higher wages will have to be passed on. ""Our suppliers are passing on costs, we're passing some of those costs to our customers, and at the end of the day, the consumers will feel the pain."" Sectors that had large increases in vacancies included accommodation and food services, professional activities and manufacturing. Hospitality is the sector with the most vacancies per 100 workers. A shortage of lorry drivers, which the industry has blamed on factors including Covid, Brexit and tax changes, has affected fuel supplies in recent weeks and also disrupted food supply chains. The Institute for Employment Studies (IES) said labour shortages were ""affecting the whole economy, and where likely between a quarter and a third is explained by lower migration"". Tony Wilson, director of the IES, said there were now fewer unemployed people per vacancy than at any time in at least 40 years. In particular this is down to fewer older people in work and more young people in education he said. ""These shortages are holding back our economic recovery, and won't fix themselves by just exhorting firms to pay people more."" The number of people who were economically inactive - those who were not looking for work - fell by 91,000 compared to the previous quarter, but rose by 50,000 compared with last year. It's a good time to be looking for a job. The number of vacancies hit another record high of 1.1 million and average weekly earnings, including bonuses, are 7.2% higher than this time last year. However, these numbers contain a number of Covid-related distortions. The wage numbers are flattered by comparisons to last year when furlough schemes depressed wages and hours worked. If you strip that out wage rises are closer to 4%. That is higher than inflation currently, but the Bank of England expects inflation to rise to at least 4% by the end of the year. That will offset wage rises for those lucky enough to get them. But it will see lower living standards for the many who won't: 5.6 million public sector workers, for example. Higher wages have understandably been welcomed by the government, but there is less evidence of the higher skills that it is hoped will accompany them. And the high number of vacancies suggest that there is now a mismatch between the jobs people want and the ones that are available. Katy Jordan is paying higher wages, but her firm is not more productive. Like other sectors, the construction industry is struggling to fill vacancies at the moment. Katy Jordan runs Storey homes, a small house-building company in Bedfordshire. She's having trouble recruiting for certain roles such as site managers, and is having to pay staff more to keep them. ""It's really tough. What we're finding is that it's difficult to employ people on a permanent basis because it's easy for our site staff to have their heads turned by more money elsewhere."" Katy is having to raise wages to attract people to the company, and keep the people she already has, but she says that's not addressing a shortage of skills and experience in the industry. ""We're paying people what we need to pay them to attract them to come to work for us, because the labour market is so hot at the moment, but what we're not seeing is the productivity of those people adding value to our business on all levels and at all times, and that's what businesses need."" ""It's great that people can earn more money. We want people to be attracted to the construction industry. But we're not attracting people with the right skills at the moment,"" she says. The record level of vacancies and hiring rates in September ""bode well for the million workers coming off furlough in October"", the Resolution Foundation think tank said, and should ""help limit any increases in unemployment"". The furlough scheme, which saw the government pay towards wages during the Covid pandemic,ended at the end of Septemberwith nearly one million workers expected to have been on it. However, a wave of potential job cutshas not happened, early data has suggested. The ONS data showed annual growth in average pay, excluding bonuses, was 6% in the June-to-August period. However, the ONS stressed again this figure has been affected by the impact on lower paid jobs during the pandemic and also by comparisons with last year when more workers were on furlough. The number of people unemployed in the June-to-August period fell by 126,000 to 1.5 million,the ONS said,external, while the number employed rose 235,000 to 32.4 million. The rise in employment coupled with the strong wage growth ""increases the chances of the Bank of England raising interest rates in the coming months despite other evidence that the economic recovery is spluttering"" said Paul Dales, chief UK economist at Capital Economics. The Bank could become the first major central bank to raise interest rates since the beginning of the pandemic as inflation shoots up. Inflation isexpected to rise above 4%by the end of the year, fuelled by rising energy costs. But the Bank is watching to see how many people became unemployed after the end of the furlough programme before making a decision.

Tesco recall of Chest and Cold remedy,"Customers who have recently bought Tesco Max All-In-One Chesty Cough & Cold Lemon Sachets are being asked to check the dosing information on the packaging because some batches have been incorrectly labelled. The medicine should not be given to those under the age of 16, but some of the sachets being recalled say children aged 12 and over can take them. Around 78,000 packs are affected. Tesco has taken the product off shelves for now. MHRA Chief Safety Officer, Dr Alison Cave, said patient safety was paramount. ""We would like to reassure patients and parents that if you or someone under the age of 16 have used recently these sachets and have suffered no ill effects there is no cause for concern. If anyone has any questions please speak to your healthcare professional and report any adverse reactions via the Yellow Card scheme."" The Yellow Card Scheme is awebsite,externalfor reporting suspected adverse drug reactions. The packs involved each contain 10 sachets that have the drug paracetamol in them. Other ingredients include an expectorant (intended to help clear phlegm) called Guaifenesin and decongestant called Phenylephrine. Paracetamol is an everyday medicine that children can take, but, like other medicines it can be dangerous if your child takes too much. The affected sachets, which contain 1000mg of paracetamol, incorrectly state that children aged 12 years and over can take 4 sachets (diluted in water) over a 24-hour period, which would deliver the equivalent of 4000mg of paracetamol in total. The recommended dose by age, however, is: For Child 12-15 years, 500-750 mg every 4-6 hours with a maximum 4 doses per day For Child 16-17 years, 500-1000 mg every 4-6 hours with a maximum 4 doses per day It means someone who is 12-15 might potentially take 1000mg more than they should. Chair of the Royal Pharmaceutical Society Thorrun Govind said parents should not panic if this has happened, but should follow the advice to monitor their child for any potential side effects. ""Nausea and vomiting or drowsiness are some of the things to look out for,"" she said.

We're closing our live page now but will be back with more Covid news tomorrow. Today's updates were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee and Mary O'Connor and the page was edited by Becky Morton and Chris Clayton. We hope you have a good evening. Our live coverage today has focusedon a report by MPson the lessons learned from the UK government's handling of the pandemic so far. We've been sharing the report's findings as well as reaction throughout the day - here's a recap:  A&E nurse Mark Boothroyd said hospital staff wondered why the UK didn't take the same Covid measures as other nations As the government's pandemic response comes under renewed scrutiny, A&E nurse Mark Boothroyd recalls the anxiety he and colleagues felt as the number of UK cases began to grow. âWe were wondering when they were going to lock down, we were wondering what other countries were doing and we were wondering why they werenât copying them,"" says Boothroyd, who works at St Thomas' Hospital in London. ""They must have thought we were invincible."" He tells the BBC it was ""infuriating"" when Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on TV on 3 March last year that he shook hands with people he met on a hospital visit, including Covid patients. ""It was completely against all the guidance that was out at the time. It was almost making a joke out of it. That was entirely the wrong message to the public and showed he wasnât taking the thing seriously,â says Boothroyd. Along with the discussions about herd immunity, he says it reflected a belief that the country could just ""ride it out"" like the flu, and misunderstood how bad Covid-19 could be. Although Covid case numbers in the UK remain high - another 38,520 were reported in the last 24 hours - hospital admissions have fallen slightly. The 181 deaths in today's figures are higher than the weekly average of 114 - but there is often a delay in deaths being recorded over the weekend, meaning daily figures tend to be higher earlier in the week. Baroness Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, has been speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about the challenges facing care homes, following today's report on the government's response to the pandemic. She says the sector faces even more of a struggle in future as numbers requiring care increase. She says there are estimates the care sector  will lose up to 70,000 staff if full vaccination is made a condition of employment as planned on 11 November. ""Where are the
replacements coming from? We don't allow social care to qualify for relaxed,
immigration rules, so we can't get people coming in from overseas,"" Altmann adds. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played A woman has described what it was like not being able to visit her husband in a care home throughout the pandemic. Lynnâs husband Trevor, who has dementia, went into a care home at the start of the first lockdown. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: âIt still hurts now, a terrible memory, because I couldnât see him at all for all those weeks. ""Iâve never been on my own before and I couldnât even access help from my family."" The care homeâs rules mean that, even now, Lynn can only visit Trevor for half an hour twice a week â and is only just able to touch him without gloves. ""I havenât had a hug for 18 months,"" she said. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Today's figures show there have been another 38,520 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Cases have been rising since the beginning of the month, with a 13.5% increase over the last seven days compared to the previous week. The UK also recorded another 181 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Itâs one of the highest daily figures in recent weeks, but recorded deaths at the beginning of the week can sometimes be inflated by reporting lags over the weekend. New vaccinations continue at a low level, with 29,172 first doses and 23,632 second doses administered. As of 11 October, 85.6% of people aged over 12 had one dose of the vaccine and 78.6% had two. Katy Davis (left) and her identical twin Emma died with Covid in April 2020 A woman whose twin sisters died within three days of one another after testing positive for Covid says today's report uses the success of the vaccine programme to deflect from earlier failures. Zoe Davis' sisters Katy and Emma, who were both nurses,died in April 2020. She says: ""Nobody is saying that the vaccine programme hasn't been phenomenal but the frustrating thing is that's a deflection of what is actually being brought to attention and the overall message is that Covid failures have cost lives. ""As somebody who has lost family members you cannot help but think, what if they were in that20,000 people who might not have lost their lives if the government had implemented social distancing measures a week earlier? ""My relatives have been seen as dispensable they are just
numbers on a sheet to them, not the amazing people I know they were. ""Both
my sisters were nurses and had an impact on lots of people's lives, they were valued members of society, how can people
like that be labelled dispensable?"" As we've been hearing, Science Minister George Freeman has suggested that a major cause of the UK's Covid death toll was the country's high rate of obesity- related disease. But that's far from the only explanation. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle, data journalist Christine Jeavans and head of statistics Robert Cuffeexamined the reasons back in Januarywhen the death toll was at about 100,000 - now it is over 137,000. They found thatobesitywas a factor, with some studies suggesting it doubled the risk of death for an individual. The UK also hashigh levels of diabetes, kidney disease and respiratory problems, all of which increase the risk of Covid. These health issues are compounded byinequalityin the UK, with the pandemic exacerbating the gap in health and life expectancy between the wealthy and the poor. Some other factors may have been outside the UK's control. The UK - and London in particular - is aglobal hub. By the end of March 2020 the virus had been introduced from 1,300 separate locations. Countries such as Australia and New Zealand never had to deal with this on such a scale. The UK is also among the 10 mostdensely populatedbig nations - those with more than 20 million people - which meant the virus could spread quickly. They also examined policy mistakes, including thedelay in the first lockdown, although they say the data available to scientists and politicians making the decision at the time was poor. The fact that the UK only launched its Test and Trace system in May highlighted another failing - we werenot prepared, especially compared to Asian countries which already had testing and contact tracing systems in place for a pandemic. And in considering the delays over introducing later lockdowns, they quote one expert saying ""thefailure to learnfrom wave one stands out"" as a reason for the UK's poor response to the pandemic. Lobby Akinnola (right) lost his father Olufemi (centre) to Covid A science minister's remarks suggesting the high UK death toll was partly due to obesity-related disease are ""hideously offensive"", a campaign group representing families who lost loved ones to coronavirus says. Lobby Akinnola, a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families
for Justice, says: âIf itâs not bad enough Steve Barclay refuses to say sorry
over a dozen times or Jeremy Hunt insensitively describing the government
response as a 'game of two halves' we now have the Science Minister George
Freeman seemingly blaming the British people themselves for the high death toll
by saying the higher death toll is caused by obesity. ""Itâs grossly offensive to those of us who lost loved ones
to Covid-19 and makes a mockery of our concerns - the statutory inquiry truly
cannot come soon enough. ""If the prime minister can apologise constantly for losses of liberty he can
apologise for the failings the government made that caused our loved ones to
lose their lives. ""And Mr Freeman can certainly say sorry for his hideously
offensive comments and the flippancy he seems to associate mistakes with when
he says 'of course mistakes were made'. What he has failed to highlight is
those mistakes cost lives.â MPs were critical in their report of the UK government's decision
to delay the first nationwide lockdown in March 2020. But the UK was not alone - countries including Germany and France also had similar gaps between detecting their first cases and introducing lockdown measures. However, countries such as China and Italy acted more quickly. Sir Patrick Vallance was often seen flanking the prime minister at Downing Street briefings We've gota bit more from Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, who recorded an interview with BBC Radio 4 before today's report came out and touched on some of the criticisms of the government response. He said that his ""mantra"" for a long time in the pandemic has been that ""you've got to go sooner than you want to in terms of taking interventions, you've got to go harder than you want to, and you've got to go more geographically broad than you want to"". That's a stark contrast fromhis BBC interview on 13 March 2020,external, when he said the aim was to ""reduce the peak"" of infections, ""not to suppress it completely"", saying that the population would build up a ""degree of herd immunity"". Vallance suggested in his latest interview that they were dealing with a new virus and as new evidence came in, the scientific judgements changed. ""For a politician, that feels like a U-turn, or for the media that often feels like a U-turn,"" he said. ""It's not a U-turn, this is new evidence that gives you a new position: this is the way we progress, the way we learn."" Eluned Morgan said governments had a ""huge amount to learn"" about the new virus Wales' health minister Eluned Morgan was asked about the refusal of minister Stephen Barclay to apologise on Sky News for policy failings that led to Covid deaths in the UK. She said: âI never really understood why politicians have such a problem in apologising. âAnd so yes, of course Iâm prepared to apologise to all of those who have suffered during the pandemic."" Governments faced a new disease no one had seen before, and none of them knew what its effects would be or that it could spread by people who did not have any symptoms, she said, so they had ""a huge amount to learn"". ""I think we have a duty and responsibility to say sorry to people where weâve made mistakes,"" she added. Science minister George Freeman has been defending the government's Covid response, telling BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that the pandemic ""caught the world by surprise"". He says ""every country around the world has been hit hard"" with nations getting things right and wrong, adding: ""There was no perfect experience."" Asked about the higher UK death toll, he says: ""But a lot of that is actually to do with the very, very heavy obesity-related cardiometabolic chronic disease cohort that we've been carrying for years - that's a failure of public health in this country over decades. ""The prime minister was constantly last year apologising to the British people for the appalling loss of liberty and all of the measures that the government had to take. ""Look, I think the public would look at last year and say of course mistakes were made, but in the end this country led the world in finding a vaccine, developing a vaccine, inventing it."" Ministers have rejected suggestions that the UK's first lockdown was ordered too late by saying they followed the science. So what were the scientists telling them in the early months of 2020 as the virus spread across the world? Here's a timeline compiled from the Commons committees' report and minutes of government science advisers' meetings: Caroline Abrahams, charity director at Age UK, says today's report by MPs proves social care ""was something of an afterthought"" in the initial months of Covid. She says ""the focus on 'protecting the NHS' inadvertently resulted in older people and
staff in care homes being badly let down"". Meanwhile, Teresa Exelby of the Community Integrated Care Charity, tells BBC Radio 5 Live there are now concerns about staffing in the sector. She says there has been both a ""massive decline"" in new applicants over the past three months and the number of staff staying in employment. More from Dame Deirdre Hine who says while today's report is ""rightly critical"" it is also ""sympathetic to the point that there were some unknowns"". She says: ""The asymptomatic transmissibility of the virus was not well- known and also the fact that the Alpha variant was so much more infectious was not well-known and each of those were part of the cause of the delays of the two lockdowns,"" she says. Dame Deidre, former chief medical officer for Wales, also says although a public inquiry is important, she does not think its findings are ""going to be relevant to what happens this winter"" because they take a long time. Dame Deirdre Hine A former chief medical officer says she warned of the dangers of ""group-think"" - a criticism made by MPs in their Covid response report - when she led the review into the swine flu pandemic in 2009. Dame Deirdre Hine says a specific recommendation of her 2009 report was that in future pandemics information should be shared with a wider group of scientists to avoid group decisions being unchallenged. She tells BBC Radio 4's World at One programme: ""I felt that there was a danger of group think in the [swine flu] pandemic and I explored the idea of releasing Sage papers to a wider group of scientists, so that this group would be able to comment authoritatively on the overall government strategy and give the media greater assurance about the approach being taken."" This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer is calling for the future public inquiry into the government's handling of Covid to happen sooner. He says ministers should ""accept responsibility"" for the failures set out in the joint report from MPs. He thinks the government should ""have the decency"" to apologise to bereaved families. And he adds: ""The public will be tearing their hair out at the lack of leadership."" As we reported earlier (see post at12:02), Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has described the report as ""damning"". Discharging people from hospitals into care homes led to many thousands of avoidable deaths, the report said If you're just joining us on your lunch-break, we've been covering the reaction to a highly critical report by MPs on the government's coronavirus response today.

Frost proposes new NI protocol in Brexit rowThe UK's Brexit minister says the existing protocol cannot survive and warns the UK could still trigger Article 16.,"Lord Frost warned the UK could still trigger Article 16 if the EU did not agree on changes to the existing protocol Brexit Minister Lord Frost has proposed plans for an entirely new protocol to replace the existing Northern Ireland Protocol. In a speech to diplomats in Portugal on Tuesday, he described his new legal text as ""a better way forward"". The protocol is thespecial Brexit deal agreed for Northern Irelandto prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland. Unionists argue it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position in the UK and creates a trade barrier. In a plea to the European Union to allow for ""significant change"" to post-Brexit rules governing trade with Northern Ireland, Lord Frost said his proposed text would support the Good Friday Agreement. He said it was forward-looking, improved on the current ""excessively rigid"" protocol, and would allow the EU and UK to ""get back to normal"" by removing ""the poison"" from their relationship. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Why are there tensions over the NI Brexit deal? Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? With the EU expected to putforward proposals on Wednesday, Lord Frost again warned Brussels London could unilaterally waive some of the terms of its agreement if the bloc failed to budge. ""We have a short, but real, opportunity to put in place a new arrangement, to defuse the political crisis that is brewing, both in Northern Ireland and between us,"" Lord Frost said. However, Shadow Northern Ireland Secretary Louise Haigh said the move to replace the protocol was ""stoking tension while solving nothing"". In a tweet, the Labour MP said Lord Frost's speech ""sets the stage for another destabilising stand-off, with the agreement businesses and communities need further away than ever"". ""Stability, jobs and livelihoods depend on real progress in Northern Ireland in the coming weeks,"" she said. ""It would be a serious abdication of responsibility to block a pragmatic way forward and provoke more poisonous instability."" Lord Frost urged the EU to look carefully at the UK's new legal text, and said the existing protocol could not survive, as it did not have support right across Northern Ireland. He also warned the UK could still trigger Article 16 - which allows either side to effectively override large parts of the agreement - if the EU and UK could not agree on changes to the existing protocol. ""We would not go down this route gratuitously or with any particular pleasure but it is our fundamental responsibility to safeguard peace and prosperity in Northern Ireland and that is why we cannot rest until this situation is addressed,"" said Lord Frost. There are two schools of thought about how this latest negotiation is shaping up. The first is that Lord Frost's hard line on the European Court of Justice (ECJ) is standard pre-negotiation tactics, aimed at grinding out another concession or two. After all the Brexit process has always delivered a deal, even at times when it seemed improbable. The UK government wants to remove the ECJ from its oversight role as part of the Northern Ireland Protocol, sayingas long as it continues the protocol will never survive. The EU, on the other hand, has said it would be very hard for the protocol to continue without the court's oversight. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has warned that the UK's demands on the protocol could cause ""a breakdown in relations"" with the EU. He has hinted that maybe the UK doesn't want a deal unless it's total victory. Under that scenario, the UK would go through the motions before triggering Article 16. It would use this to gut the protocol while calculating that the EU's ability to retaliate is limited or or at least would take a long time to amount to anything. We should find out which view is right by the end of this year. The Brexit minister said the protocol represented ""a moment of EU overreach when the UK's negotiating hand was tied"" and that it could not ""reasonably last in its current form"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson signed up to the protocol as part of his Brexit agreement in 2020, but has since argued it was agreed in haste and was no longer working for the people of Northern Ireland. The EU has repeatedly said it would not renegotiate the protocol, criticising the UK for reneging on an agreement that both sides signed in good faith. The UK government also wants to reverse its previous agreement onthe oversight role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ),which is the EU's highest court. Lord Frost said his new text proposed reliance on ""international arbitration instead of a system of EU law ultimately policed in the court of one of the parties"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson has threatened to pull his party out of Stormont Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - said if the current protocol was not replaced with a long-term solution Northern Ireland would be exposed to ""further harm and instability"". The DUP leader has previously warned his partymay quit Stormontif its demands over the protocol are not met. But Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the protocol was an international treaty that ""recognises the special status of this island."" Its implementation, the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president added, was ""not negotiable"". ""The conduct of the British government throughout these negotiations has been duplicitous and disgraceful and is an effort to break yet another international agreement"". She said: ""The attempts by the Tories and the DUP to undermine the protections and opportunities of the Protocol and impose a hard border must be opposed"". Ulster Unionist assembly member Steve Aiken said it was ""self-evident"" the existing protocol was not working. He said the party would consider the UK government's legal text and the EU proposals due on Wednesday. These will focus on easing practical problems, rather than changing oversight arrangements. But Alliance deputy leader Stephen Farry MP said Lord Frost had ""chosen to enter into another layer of delusion"". Mr Farry said short of the UK ""rejoining the Customs Union and Single Market, there is no alternative than for the UK to work with the EU in a spirit of partnership to achieve as many mitigations and flexibilities as possible."" SDLP MLA Matthew O'Toole said Lord Frost's remarks represented a ""deliberate distortion of facts and contempt for people here"". He said Lord Frost had negotiated the protocol, agreed to its terms and ""backed Boris Johnson's campaign to sell it during the last general election"". Traditional Unionist Voice leader Jim Allister said: ""If, as Lord Frost says, it is the UK that governs Northern Ireland, then, there must be an end to the European Union's writ in this part of the United Kingdom. ""Put simply, it requires an end to the Protocol in all its parts."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Delivery driver killed cyclist while high on drugs,"Jonathon Ramsbottom admitted causing Mr White's death by careless driving while under the influence of drugs A delivery driver who knocked down and killed a cyclist while high on drugs has been jailed for seven years. Jonathon Ramsbottom, from Rochdale, collided head-on with Stephen White in Todmorden, West Yorkshire, in May 2020. Mr White, 54, who was training for an Ironman triathlon, died as a result of a ""catastrophic"" brain injury. Ramsbottom, 37, who was on bail for drugs offences at the time of the crash, pleaded guilty to causing death by careless driving. Stephen White, from Bolton, suffered a brain injury and died after the crash in May 2020 Bradford Crown Court heard Mr White, from Bolton, had been on a training ride when Ramsbottom crashed into him in his van on Church Road. A blood test later revealed the Yodel delivery driver had traces of cocaine in his system measuring four times the legal limit. The court heard Ramsbottom had also not worked the previous day because he did not feel fit enough after taking taking cocaine and cannabis. More stories from around Yorkshire Passing sentence Judge Richard Mansell QC said: ""Any careful, sensible and sober driver would have seen him and avoided him. ""You were driving too fast, one arm out of the window, with a passenger in the vehicle and with excess cocaine and some cannabis in your system. ""These two drugs, often used in combination by so many young men who work in manual or trade jobs, are fast becoming a scourge of our society. ""Cyclists take their life in their hands when they go out on just about any road in our country now."" He said the case was seriously aggravated by the fact Ramsbottom was on bail for conspiring to supply cocaine at the time. The court heard he was jailed in December 2020 for four-and-a-half-years for that offence. In a victim impact statement Mr White's wife described him as ""a loving and loyal family man"" and said: ""I still cannot really believe that Steve didn't come home that day."" Judge Mansell said Ramsbottom's seven year sentence would be served consecutively to the sentence for supplying cocaine. He also banned him from driving for 11 years.

Footballers demand compensation over 'data misuse',"This video can not be played Footballers 'have right to see where data goes' Hundreds of footballers have threatened legal action against the data collection industry, which could change how information is handled. Led by former Cardiff City, Leyton Orient and Yeovil Town manager Russell Slade, 850 players want compensation for the trading of their performance data over the past six years. They also want an annual fee from the companies for any future use. ""Letters before action"" have been sent to 17 big firms, alleging data misuse. Welsh government breached data laws 300 times How your data is being scraped from social media Anglesey cyber-attack affects island's five secondaries Data ranges from average goals-per-game for an outfield player to height - however, Mr Sladehas previously expressed concernthis is sometimes wrong. If the group pursues legal action and is successful, it could lead to a radical change of a multi-billion pound industry behind professional sport that trades on players' information. Slade's legal team said the fact players receive no payment for the unlicensed use of their data contravenes General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules that were strengthened in 2018. Under Article 4 of the GDPR, ""personal data"" refers to a range or identifiable information, such as physical attributes, location data or physiological information. BBC News understands that an initial 17 major betting, entertainment and data collection firms have been targeted, but Slade's Global Sports Data and Technology Group has highlighted more than 150 targets it believes have misused data. Former Cardiff City manager Russell Slade is leading the group While receiving a fee for the use of their data might not have much impact on the high earners of the Premier League, Slade feels strongly that those lower down the pyramid, in both the men's and women's game, would see tangible benefits. ""It's incredible where it's used,"" Slade said. ""On one player, and I'm not talking about a Premier League player or even a Championship player, there was some 7,000 pieces of information on one individual player at a lower league football club. ""There are companies that are taking that data and processing that data without the individual consent of that player. ""A big part of our journey has been looking at that ecosystem and plotting out where that data starts, who's processing it, where it finishes and that's a real global thing. ""It's making football - and all sports - aware of the implications and what needs to change."" The use of data in sport is nothing new. Its collection, distribution and use has become a staple part of the modern sporting environment, be it by clubs to manage player performance, or by third party companies to base things like odds on. If the move is successful, the implications could have far-reaching effects beyond football. TikTok sued for billions over children's data Welsh government breached data laws over 300 times Facebook sued for 'losing control' of usersâ data BBC News understand discussions are already underway within other professional sports to bring potential legal action regarding the trading of data. Former Wales international Dave Edwards, one the players behind the move, said it was a chance for players to take more control of the way information about them is used. Having seen how data has become a staple part of the modern game, he believes players rights to how information about them is used should be at the forefront of any future use. ""The more I've looked into it and you see how our data is used, the amount of channels its passed through, all the different organisations which use it, I feel as a player we should have a say on who is allowed to use it,"" he said. The footballers say they want compensation and an annual fee for the use of their data ""Anyone else in the world would have that say. Just because we're footballers and we're in the public domain that gets overlooked. ""If you were in another job, if you were a teacher or a lawyer and this sort of details was being passed around your field of work it wouldn't sit right with that person. ""I don't think we, as individuals really differ from that."" The lawyer behind Global Sports Data and Technology's action, Chris Farnell, believes it could be start of a sport-wide reshaping of how data is traded. ""This will be significant change if the precedent is set throughout football and how data is used throughout sport in general,"" he said. ""It will change significantly how that data is being used and how it's going to be rewarded.""

Not all sport stars back jab message - health boss,"This video can not be played People at Bulldogs Boxing and Community Centre talk about those swerving the jab ""Because I'm younger I'll be able to fight it off, but I feel for the elderly."" Mackenzie Itzstein got the Covid vaccine to protect his grandparents - at 22, he believed he was low risk. But even teenagers are being hospitalised with ""serious Covid"", Swansea Bay's public health director has said. Keith Reid called on more sports clubs and celebrities to back a campaign to encourage people to get the vaccine. Mackenzie was living with his grandparents when they all contracted Covid. Speaking to BBC Wales alongside other young people at the Bulldogs Boxing and Community Centre in Port Talbot, he said: ""I was in the family home with my Nana and Grampa and they had it too. ""I was more concerned for them rather than me,"" he said, believing younger people were relatively safe from the virus. Mackenzie Itzstein said he was more concerned for his grandparents' health than his own This is a common myth public health boss Mr Reid is keen to dispel. He said his own health board has recently seen cases of young people being admitted to hospital. ""Young people do get serious Covid,"" he said. ""We've seen 45 young people in hospital in the last three months - by young people, I mean below the age of 15, treated for Covid. ""And we've also seen a lot of cases where young people have taken Covid home and shared it with other household members, some of whom have been quite vulnerable."" Seren Jenkins, 22, rejected any notion that young people might feel ""invincible"" - that Covid wouldn't affect them so severely. ""I'm sure there are loads of younger people that are like that, but I know loads of older people who've been exactly the same - everyone's probably done so many things wrong, I don't think it's fair to put it on one age group."" When lockdown was announced she said she was ""pretty careful"". ""I didn't see my family for about 14 weeks."" Seren Jenkins said she also knows older people who think they won't be badly affected by Covid She has had Covid, has been vaccinated and says she routinely wears masks in shops and on public transport. But lockdown has had an unexpected effect. ""I think it's had a really positive influence on me - I tend to not really say no to anything any more."" Neath Port Talbot recently had the highest rate of Covid cases across the UK, as well as the highest case rate among the under-25s in Wales. Vaccine take-up rates amongst the under-30s are also the lowest - albeit they were last to be offered the jab. But not all sports clubs have backed a campaign to encourage people to get the Covid vaccine, according to Mr Reid. Of the region's two top sports clubs, he said, only the Ospreys had backed the drive. ""One avidly supported our vaccine campaign, another one haven't,"" he said. But Swansea City FC said it was committed to helping the local vaccination programme and the stadium had been provided free of charge as a Covid testing facility. The club said its players and staff were spoken to regularly by its medical team about safety and vaccinations, adding that ""we respect them with the decisions that they undertake for both themselves and their families."" How many people have been vaccinated so far? Police boss angry at anti-vax protest intimidation Welsh government spent Â£32k on GLC jabs campaign Mr Reid said seeing role models having the jab gave fans ""a lot of assurance that vaccines are safe and effective"". ""We've seen the contrast between two really high level sporting teams within Swansea Bay region - one who avidly supported our vaccine campaign and have been very prominent in the community and another one who haven't,"" he said. ""And that's due to attitudes amongst players themselves."" It is understoodfewer than half the players at most Premier League and English Football League clubs have been vaccinated. ""Undoubtedly people from other walks of life, and especially from sporting walks of life, can have great influence on the health behaviour of our communities and it's to their credit when they stand up and do that,"" said Mr Reid. Nudges like these can be all the more important when considering the health of a local authority area like Neath Port Talbot. ""We saw the arrival of a new highly transmissible and infectious version of coronavirus at the same time that people were starting to move around more freely and mix more freely and I think that's what's driven up the rates,"" said Mr Reid. ""With schools going back when Delta (variant) was already pretty prevalent in the region - that's just added an extra element to the mix and we've seen rates in school kids in particular drive those headline figures."" Shane Miller, 18, who works part time at Bulldogs Boxing Club in Port Talbot, said it was an easy decision to be vaccinated, as he works with people with disabilities at the club and needed to be cautious. Shane Miller works part time at Bulldogs Boxing Club ""I know a lot of people were very relaxed about Covid,"" he said. ""I know two people who don't want the vaccine - they don't like needles or they just don't believe in Covid. ""I try and explain it's safer to have it, just in case, but it's the type of people who just don't listen."" He added transport can be an issue for those travelling to vaccination centres. ""They could do them in local chemists - if it was more local than that I think more people would have a better chance of getting there."" It is a point acknowledged by Keith Reid. ""It's much more difficult if you're working or you've got childcare responsibilities to get along to a vaccination centre,"" he said. ""We've seen a slower rise in coverage in those age groups, partly maybe because of the difficulty of getting along to vaccination - and higher scepticism I think, about what's the benefit of getting vaccinated."" Professional boxer Connor McIntosh saw his first child born during lockdown Professional boxer Connor McIntosh, 26, said he and his girlfriend were expecting their first child during lockdown - Bronagh May is now a year old. ""I didn't even leave the house - we weren't going to take any risks,"" said the construction health and safety consultant. ""I've had my first jab and I'll have my second in the next couple of weeks - I'll have to have it done before my first professional fight anyway, for safety measures."" But did he have any reservations? ""Not really - it's a tough one, it's come out really quick - a lot of people don't know exactly what's in them - you get a lot of people on Facebook thinking they're proper scientists and they know exactly what's in them - but if it's going to make things go back to normal quicker, then I think yeah, everyone should have them. ""I think if everyone plays ball and just helps each other out, hopefully we can all get through it and things will go back to normal sooner rather than later."" Rhodri Williams said he was anxious about going to watch his first football match after lockdown ended Rhodri Williams' parents both work in the NHS - one for the ambulance service, one as a nurse. ""The only time I would go out of the house was to go for a run with my brother, once a day,"" said the 22-year-old, who has had both his jabs. ""The people that are coming out and saying that the vaccine could kill them, or the government are putting stuff in it - they're the people that would go to Mexico and have their jabs no problem, but they're not getting anything out of this so they don't see the point in getting it. ""Some people don't want it because they don't know what's in it - but they don't know what's in their cigarettes or their vapes either. ""I've got a season ticket down the Swans - the first game back against Sheffield United was a bit of a shock, because I hadn't been around that many people since Covid. ""It wasn't that I was scared, it was more that I had a bit of anxiety about going with all these people, but when you're in the game it's brilliant how they do it - where I was sitting there was plenty of spacing and I didn't feel at all at risk there."" So does he agree that sports stars and celebrities have a role here? ""I've seen a lot of people, especially on TikTok and Instagram - celebrities filming their experiences of going to get a vaccine and putting it in a positive light - and maybe that's going to inspire a couple of the younger people to go and get their vaccine."" Swansea City says it ""placed great importance on its role during the pandemic"" In a statement, Swansea City said it ""is committed to assisting with the regional vaccination programme in the Swansea Bay area. ""The club places great emphasis on its role within the community and we are already engaging with the local health board about ways in which we can help in the future. ""Our players and staff receive regular dialogue from the club's medical team regarding public safety and vaccinations, and we respect them with the decisions that they undertake for both themselves and their families. ""Swansea City placed great importance on its role during the pandemic, such as opening its doors to the NHS for healthcare training purposes and providing our North Car Park as a Covid testing facility. Both of these ran for over a year without any charge being made by the club, while other venues rented out their facilities at a cost. ""The club would also like to place on record its sincere thanks to all those who have, and continue to, play an active and important role in the vaccination programme.""

"Experts say Â£10,900 annual income needed to retire","A single person will need post-tax annual income of Â£10,900 for a minimum standard of living in retirement, academics have estimated. That spending budget increases to Â£16,700 for a couple, the calculations for The Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA) suggest. For the first timein the assessment,external, Netflix subscriptions and items such as haircuts are included. The PLSA said lockdowns gave workers a foretaste of retirement needs. ""The pandemic has emphasised the importance of economic security as well as social and cultural participation in retirement,"" said Nigel Peaple, director of policy and advocacy at the PLSA. ""We hope the updated standards will encourage people to think about whether they are saving enough for the retirement lifestyle they want and, in particular, whether they are making the most of the employer contributions on offer in their workplace pension."" 'Serious questions' face DWP over unpaid pensions Triple lock pension pledge suspended for one year The calculations for retirement living standards are pitched at three different levels - minimum, moderate and comfortable - and are developed and maintained independently by the Centre for Research in Social Policy at Loughborough University. The assessment is intended as a guide for those planning their retirement savings. Housing costs are not included on the assumption that most pensioners have paid off mortgages, although the PLSA said that decision would be kept under review. The minimum retirement living standard covers a typical retiree's basic needs plus enough for some social activities, such as a week of holiday in the UK, eating out once a month, but not including running a car. The estimate of an annual budget for the minimum standard has risen since 2019 by Â£700 for a single person, and by Â£1,000 for a couple. The total requirement would generally be made up of a full state pension of Â£9,339 per year, as well as some workplace pension savings. The moderate retirement living standard includes a two-week holiday in Europe and more frequent eating out. This was assessed to require a budget of Â£20,800 for a single person, Â£600 higher than two years ago, and Â£30,600 for a couple, up Â£1,500. The PLSA said around half of single employees were on track to expect a lifestyle between minimum and moderate. The position would be better for couples who were able to share costs. The annual budget needed for a comfortable retirement living standard has increased since 2019 by Â£600 to Â£33,600 for one person and Â£2,200 to Â£49,700 for a couple. This covered items such as regular beauty treatments, theatre trips, and annual maintenance and servicing of a burglar alarm. About one in six single employees is projected to have an income between moderate and comfortable. Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at investment firm AJ Bell, said: ""The pandemic has exposed gaping holes in the finances of millions of people, with many having little or nothing saved for an emergency. ""What's more, contribution levels into pension schemes remain low, particularly among self-employed workers. As the UK economy slowly recovers from lockdown, it is vital financial resilience becomes a key focus for policymakers, both in the short and long-term.""

"Little room for Budget spending, says think tank","There is no room for big spending announcements for hard-pressed public services in this month's Budget, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says. The influential think tank has published new analysis, suggesting borrowing will be lower than forecast. But the IFS says if the chancellor hopes to balance the government's finances, he will still have to keep a tight rein on spending. That's despite his planning the biggest tax rises for more than 25 years. Mr Sunak is due to deliver the next Budget on 27 October. ""Rishi Sunak, a Conservative chancellor, is presiding over an increase in the tax burden to record levels in the UK and an increase in the size of the state (public spending as a fraction of national income) to levels not seen since the days of [Margaret] Thatcher,"" said IFS director Paul Johnson. ""Yet the combined effects of ever-growing spending on the NHS, and an economy smaller than projected pre-pandemic, mean that he is still likely to be short of money to spend on many other public services,"" he said. Mr Johnson said that meant ""little or no scope"" to increase spending on things such as local government, the justice system and further education, which have seen sharp cuts over the last decade. Spending on services other than health, such as defence, schools and aid, might also have to increase by less than Mr Sunak was planning pre-pandemic, the IFS said. Will the government's economic plan work? Sunak: No magic wand to solve supply problems UK lockdown rebound stronger than first thought Mr Johnson said the chancellor would be ""hoping against hope"" that the economy performed better than expected over the next few years, pushing up tax revenues that would ""help to dig him out of what still looks like a fair-sized hole"". The IFS produces analysis of the country's finances in its Green Budget every year. Like a government green paper, the aim is to inform and provoke discussion around budgetary decisions. The report highlights the UK's strong economic recovery this year, in the wake of the vaccine roll-out, meaning that borrowing this year could be more than Â£50bn lower than was forecast in March. But it says less rapid growth after this year's bounce back would mean the public finances improve more slowly in the years to come. Anyone making forecasts like these a year ago would have been laughed at and called a crazy optimist. The amount the government is expected to borrow this financial year is Â£50bn less than was predicted even just back in March. That suggests those arguing against cutting public spending too soon, for the sake of reducing that borrowing, were right. In a pandemic, they argued, to prioritise sorting out the public finances before securing the economic recovery was putting the cart before the horse. In the meantime, the vaccine-led recovery has brought tax money rolling into the Treasury much faster than was expected. With 7% economic growth predicted this year and borrowing dropping rapidly, we can now see how quickly, when the economic horse is accelerating, the public finance cart comes trundling behind. Christian Schulz, director of European Economics at investment bank Citi, which collaborated on the Green Budget, said the global economic outlook had improved. However, the UK economy was still likely to be 4% short of its pre-pandemic trajectory at the end of 2021, he said. ""The medium-term recovery also remains far from secure,"" said Mr Schulz. ""Instead, an uneven rebound to date points to a more profound Brexit- and Covid-related reconfiguration in the years ahead. The Green Budget analysis also found: Borrowing for 2022-23 onwards should continue to be at least Â£20bn lower than forecast in the March 2020 Budget The government's budget should return to surplus from 2023-4 However, uncertainty is ""incredibly high"" - the economy could grow either more quickly or more slowly than currently forecast - meaning tax plans might have to change The costs of financing government debt will be Â£15bn higher this year, and in future years, than was forecast in the March 2020 Budget There may be more ""wiggle room"" by 2024-25 if economic growth is strong, but there will still be big demands on government spending, including the NHS, the fallout from Covid, the levelling-up agenda, social care and the transition to a lower carbon economy The IFS suggested that in order to cope with long-term pressures on spending, the chancellor might find he needs to raise taxes further, on top of the 1.25% health and social care levy announced last month. For the levy to meet future spending demand in those areas, the IFS estimates it could need to more than double to 3.15% by the end of this decade.

California to enforce 'gender neutral' toy aisles,"Large stores in California will be required to have a separate gender-neutral section, complete with a mixed variety of items California has become the first US state to require large retailers to display toys and childcare items in gender-neutral ways. The new law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday, does not ban boys and girls sections in shops. But large stores must have also have a separate, gender-neutral section. These must display ""a reasonable selection"" of toys and childcare items, regardless of whether they've been marketed towards a particular sex. Companies will face a $250 (Â£184) fine for their first violation, and $500 (Â£368) penalties for others. The new law was passed by California's state legislature last month, and will come into effect in 2024 now it has been signed by Governor Newsom. It will apply to retailers with 500 or more employees across their California stores. Clothing will be unaffected, but the law will affect toys and any ""childcare items"" intended to aid sleep, relaxation, feeding, teething or sucking. In its wording,external, it said the changes would help consumers spot ""unjustified differences in similar products"" and tackle gender bias in children's products. Evan Low, one of the law's co-authors, called the segregation of toys 'the antithesis of modern thinking' Democrat Assemblyman Evan Low, one of the law's co-authors,has previously said,externalthe bill was inspired by his staff member's eight-year-old daughter, who asked her mother why she had to go to the boys section to find a certain toy. ""The segregation of toys by a social construct of what is appropriate for which gender is the antithesis of modern thinking,"" said Mr Low in a statement. He said that categorising toys by gender had ""led to the proliferation of science, technology, engineering and mathematics-geared toys"" in boys sections, while those for girls were directed towards pursuits like ""caring for a baby, fashion, and domestic life."" The Consumer Federation of California, a consumer advocacy group, has been among those in favour of the law. In a statement to The Sacramento Bee newspaper,external, it said separating products by gender ""helps to disguise the unfortunate fact that female products are often priced higher than male products."" Some US retailers have already taken steps away from gender stereotypes in their businesses. In 2015, Target announced that it would stop using some gender-based signs in its stores. But in the last two years, similar bills to enforce gender-neutral commercial spaces have been shot down in California's legislature. Detractors have argued that it infringes on free speech, and business owners' ability to adapt to the free market. One of the most most vocal critics has been the California Family Council, a conservative advocacy group.It has accused,externalgender-fluid clothing entrepreneur Rob Smith of lobbying for the bill for his own commercial gain.

'I can't leave people without a tree at Christmas',"Matthew Corrie said he was struggling to recruit staff A Christmas tree seller is asking his customers to make deliveries for him because he cannot find staff to fill vacancies. Matthew Corrie, of Fife Christmas Trees in Dunfermline, said he came up with the idea because more and more people were opting for a delivery service. Before the pandemic, most customers collected their tree in person. He is offering customers a discount if they collect their own tree and deliver one to someone else near their home. Businesses in a range of sectors have been reporting difficulties in attracting workers. A shortage of HGV drivers and specialised workers has led to gaps on supermarket shelves and problems with fuel supplies across the UK in recent weeks. Matthew Corrie (left) with his children on the Harburn Estate, where he buys his Christmas trees from Charlie Spurway (R) There have also been shortages of workers in sectors such as hospitality and the care sector, and some retailers have warned that they may struggle to ensure supplies are in place for the Christmas trading period. Mr Corrie, who has some delivery drivers, said he had tried advertising everywhere for extra staff to deliver his trees this year, but without success. He said he had been deluged with delivery orders last year, and this year was already looking like it would be even busier. ""As with other businesses, I'm very short staffed and cannot get vacancies filled so I had to sit down and think of a way around it,"" he said. ""There is no way I can't deliver them and leave people without a tree at Christmas. There was no option but to think outside of the box."" There are more than one million Christmas trees, which take 10 years to grow, on 1,000 acres of the Harburn Estate He said he came up with the plan while looking at the list of addresses on the orders he has already received. He is offering customers a Â£10 discount if they will deliver a tree to someone else living nearby. Mr Corrie said: ""I've put this idea to friends and some laughed but others said they think people will help, especially when they know how desperate I am. ""Customers know of the global staff shortage so I'm sure most will be willing to help. ""Quite often people have room on their roof racks for more than one tree.""

PM expected to back loans for gas price-hit firms,"Firms hit by a sharp surge in energy prices are expected to get government help worth hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC understands. Glass, ceramic and paper manufacturers have warned that rising prices may mean they have to charge customers more. On Monday, business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng submitted a formal proposal asking the Treasury to help such firms. The Department for Business expects the prime minister to back its proposals, which could involve state-backed loans. The government is reluctant to prop up companies which would normally be competitive, which is why support is likely to involve loans rather than grants. The Treasury is said to be still analysing the proposal. Number 10 has declined to comment. Businesses have said they hope for a ""swift response"" on the plans. High energy costs have been forcing manufacturers in energy-intensive industries such as steel and chemical manufacturing to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Other firms have said they may be forced to shut down their factories if the rising cost of gas and electricity makes it uneconomic for them to produce their goods. Why are gas prices so high? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Dr Richard Leese, chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) - an umbrella group for several manufacturers including ceramics and paper, told the BBC's Today programme that a quick response from the Treasury to the proposals was ""crucial"". ""We need preventative action to stop the issue spreading further."" Dr Leese said firms in the sector faced higher tax and levies than European rivals. He said firms had put forward ""practical and sensible"" measures for help, and denied that government help would put any additional burden on taxpayers. Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, said he had yet to see details of the proposals put forward. He warned that without adequate support, plants could close and jobs could be under threat as high energy costs bite. ""The key test in this proposal is are we now going to be on an equal footing with steelmakers in Germany?,"" Mr Stace said. ""If this package results in us still paying 80% more for energy than our competitors in continental Europe, then really this will really be a flimsy sticking plaster on what is really a major crisis that we are going through at the moment."" Phil Wild is the boss of paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC Kendal paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC has been in business since 1845 and is one of the biggest employers in the area. Today, it also makes home insulation and carbon paper, with energy bills working out at about Â£60,000 every single week. Its chief executive, Phil Wild, told BBC Breakfast: ""Any price increase is significant for a manufacturer like ours that consumes the energy that we do. ""As it happens, we're probably OK here because of some actions we've put in place, but I can see some of those businesses may not make it."" He added that the recent increase in gas prices had highlighted the need for energy intensive firms to start using more renewable forms of energy, rather than fossil fuels and gas. But in the short-term, paper, glass, steel and ceramics manufacturers ""are really looking to the government for help to get them over that hump"", he said. The proposals by Business Secretary Kwarteng follow days of conversations with leaders from affected industries, as well as a very public row with the Treasury about the status of talks between the government departments. Demands for support from energy-intensive industries have been growing louder, but not all companies are affected in the same way. Some have long-term contracts to buy energy at fixed prices, protecting them from short-term increases, but others do not. Businesses themselves have called for their energy costs to be capped, in the same way that households currently benefit from a price cap imposed by regulator Ofgem. But that would risk simply passing on the extra costs to energy suppliers, says our correspondent. Direct subsidies would add to the burden on taxpayers, at a time when Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to seek to curb public spending in his next Budget on 27 October. There are many reasons, both in the UK and around the world. There's been a shortage of gas and energy in many countries as they emerged from lockdown and industry reopened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, less gas is being stored than normal. On top of that, the UK has fewer gas storage facilities than some countries - meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that Russia, a major gas supplier, is restricting output - an accusation it denies - which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises. This has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone.

Construction firm closes with loss of over 100 jobs,"A County Down construction firm has closed resulting in about 100 job losses. JMC Mechanical and Construction is based in Waringstown, but has premises in Bleary and Lisburn as well. Its work includes providing maintenance services to the Housing Executive and other social housing providers. ThePortadown Times,externalreported workers were told on Monday afternoon by the firm's owner James McCully and an accountant. The family business was established in 2000. Speaking to BBC News NI, Sinn FÃ©in assembly member John O'Dowd said employees were ""called in and told they had no work"". ""They were told they weren't going to be paid for last week's work and there was also a question mark over redundancy,"" he added. ""My main concern is for the workers and their families. ""I already have a question in to the economy minister asking how his department are going to support and protect these workers and have already made contact with the liquidators."" Democratic Unionist Party MP for Upper Bann Carla Lockhart said it was devastating news for employees and their families. She said JMC was a longstanding and respected company that had ""obviously suffered greatly as a result of the pandemic"". SDLP assembly member Dolores Kelly said the news came as a ""huge shock"". ""I am heartened to hear that a number of employees have already secured jobs and hope the rest will soon, especially at a time when skilled tradespeople are in such high demand,"" she added. In a statement, a spokesperson for the Housing Executive said: ""We are sorry to hear that one of our contractors, JMC Ltd, has announced that it is entering liquidation. ""The company was the repairs contractor for our tenants in the Lisburn and Castlereagh area and was also the contractor for a number of improvement schemes across Lisburn and Castlereagh and the Belfast area.

We're closing our live page now but will be back with more Covid news tomorrow. Today's updates were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee and Mary O'Connor and the page was edited by Becky Morton and Chris Clayton. We hope you have a good evening. Our live coverage today has focusedon a report by MPson the lessons learned from the UK government's handling of the pandemic so far. We've been sharing the report's findings as well as reaction throughout the day - here's a recap:  A&E nurse Mark Boothroyd said hospital staff wondered why the UK didn't take the same Covid measures as other nations As the government's pandemic response comes under renewed scrutiny, A&E nurse Mark Boothroyd recalls the anxiety he and colleagues felt as the number of UK cases began to grow. âWe were wondering when they were going to lock down, we were wondering what other countries were doing and we were wondering why they werenât copying them,"" says Boothroyd, who works at St Thomas' Hospital in London. ""They must have thought we were invincible."" He tells the BBC it was ""infuriating"" when Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on TV on 3 March last year that he shook hands with people he met on a hospital visit, including Covid patients. ""It was completely against all the guidance that was out at the time. It was almost making a joke out of it. That was entirely the wrong message to the public and showed he wasnât taking the thing seriously,â says Boothroyd. Along with the discussions about herd immunity, he says it reflected a belief that the country could just ""ride it out"" like the flu, and misunderstood how bad Covid-19 could be. Although Covid case numbers in the UK remain high - another 38,520 were reported in the last 24 hours - hospital admissions have fallen slightly. The 181 deaths in today's figures are higher than the weekly average of 114 - but there is often a delay in deaths being recorded over the weekend, meaning daily figures tend to be higher earlier in the week. Baroness Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, has been speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about the challenges facing care homes, following today's report on the government's response to the pandemic. She says the sector faces even more of a struggle in future as numbers requiring care increase. She says there are estimates the care sector  will lose up to 70,000 staff if full vaccination is made a condition of employment as planned on 11 November. ""Where are the
replacements coming from? We don't allow social care to qualify for relaxed,
immigration rules, so we can't get people coming in from overseas,"" Altmann adds. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played A woman has described what it was like not being able to visit her husband in a care home throughout the pandemic. Lynnâs husband Trevor, who has dementia, went into a care home at the start of the first lockdown. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: âIt still hurts now, a terrible memory, because I couldnât see him at all for all those weeks. ""Iâve never been on my own before and I couldnât even access help from my family."" The care homeâs rules mean that, even now, Lynn can only visit Trevor for half an hour twice a week â and is only just able to touch him without gloves. ""I havenât had a hug for 18 months,"" she said. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Today's figures show there have been another 38,520 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Cases have been rising since the beginning of the month, with a 13.5% increase over the last seven days compared to the previous week. The UK also recorded another 181 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Itâs one of the highest daily figures in recent weeks, but recorded deaths at the beginning of the week can sometimes be inflated by reporting lags over the weekend. New vaccinations continue at a low level, with 29,172 first doses and 23,632 second doses administered. As of 11 October, 85.6% of people aged over 12 had one dose of the vaccine and 78.6% had two. Katy Davis (left) and her identical twin Emma died with Covid in April 2020 A woman whose twin sisters died within three days of one another after testing positive for Covid says today's report uses the success of the vaccine programme to deflect from earlier failures. Zoe Davis' sisters Katy and Emma, who were both nurses,died in April 2020. She says: ""Nobody is saying that the vaccine programme hasn't been phenomenal but the frustrating thing is that's a deflection of what is actually being brought to attention and the overall message is that Covid failures have cost lives. ""As somebody who has lost family members you cannot help but think, what if they were in that20,000 people who might not have lost their lives if the government had implemented social distancing measures a week earlier? ""My relatives have been seen as dispensable they are just
numbers on a sheet to them, not the amazing people I know they were. ""Both
my sisters were nurses and had an impact on lots of people's lives, they were valued members of society, how can people
like that be labelled dispensable?"" As we've been hearing, Science Minister George Freeman has suggested that a major cause of the UK's Covid death toll was the country's high rate of obesity- related disease. But that's far from the only explanation. BBC health correspondent Nick Triggle, data journalist Christine Jeavans and head of statistics Robert Cuffeexamined the reasons back in Januarywhen the death toll was at about 100,000 - now it is over 137,000. They found thatobesitywas a factor, with some studies suggesting it doubled the risk of death for an individual. The UK also hashigh levels of diabetes, kidney disease and respiratory problems, all of which increase the risk of Covid. These health issues are compounded byinequalityin the UK, with the pandemic exacerbating the gap in health and life expectancy between the wealthy and the poor. Some other factors may have been outside the UK's control. The UK - and London in particular - is aglobal hub. By the end of March 2020 the virus had been introduced from 1,300 separate locations. Countries such as Australia and New Zealand never had to deal with this on such a scale. The UK is also among the 10 mostdensely populatedbig nations - those with more than 20 million people - which meant the virus could spread quickly. They also examined policy mistakes, including thedelay in the first lockdown, although they say the data available to scientists and politicians making the decision at the time was poor. The fact that the UK only launched its Test and Trace system in May highlighted another failing - we werenot prepared, especially compared to Asian countries which already had testing and contact tracing systems in place for a pandemic. And in considering the delays over introducing later lockdowns, they quote one expert saying ""thefailure to learnfrom wave one stands out"" as a reason for the UK's poor response to the pandemic. Lobby Akinnola (right) lost his father Olufemi (centre) to Covid A science minister's remarks suggesting the high UK death toll was partly due to obesity-related disease are ""hideously offensive"", a campaign group representing families who lost loved ones to coronavirus says. Lobby Akinnola, a spokesperson for Covid-19 Bereaved Families

Sir Patrick Vallance was often seen flanking the prime minister at Downing Street briefings We've gota bit more from Patrick Vallance, the government's chief scientific adviser, who recorded an interview with BBC Radio 4 before today's report came out and touched on some of the criticisms of the government response. He said that his ""mantra"" for a long time in the pandemic has been that ""you've got to go sooner than you want to in terms of taking interventions, you've got to go harder than you want to, and you've got to go more geographically broad than you want to"". That's a stark contrast fromhis BBC interview on 13 March 2020,external, when he said the aim was to ""reduce the peak"" of infections, ""not to suppress it completely"", saying that the population would build up a ""degree of herd immunity"".

""For a politician, that feels like a U-turn, or for the media that often feels like a U-turn,"" he said.

She said: âI never really understood why politicians have such a problem in apologising. âAnd so yes, of course Iâm prepared to apologise to all of those who have suffered during the pandemic."" Governments faced a new disease no one had seen before, and none of them knew what its effects would be or that it could spread by people who did not have any symptoms, she said, so they had ""a huge amount to learn"". ""I think we have a duty and responsibility to say sorry to people where weâve made mistakes,"" she added. Science minister George Freeman has been defending the government's Covid response, telling BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that the pandemic ""caught the world by surprise"". He says ""every country around the world has been hit hard"" with nations getting things right and wrong, adding: ""There was no perfect experience."" Asked about the higher UK death toll, he says: ""But a lot of that is actually to do with the very, very heavy obesity-related cardiometabolic chronic disease cohort that we've been carrying for years - that's a failure of public health in this country over decades. ""The prime minister was constantly last year apologising to the British people for the appalling loss of liberty and all of the measures that the government had to take.

"California to enforce 'gender neutral' toy aislesThe state has become the first in the US to pass the law, which aims to tackle gender stereotypes.US & Canada","Large stores in California will be required to have a separate gender-neutral section, complete with a mixed variety of items California has become the first US state to require large retailers to display toys and childcare items in gender-neutral ways. The new law, signed by Governor Gavin Newsom on Saturday, does not ban boys and girls sections in shops. But large stores must have also have a separate, gender-neutral section. These must display ""a reasonable selection"" of toys and childcare items, regardless of whether they've been marketed towards a particular sex. Companies will face a $250 (Â£184) fine for their first violation, and $500 (Â£368) penalties for others. The new law was passed by California's state legislature last month, and will come into effect in 2024 now it has been signed by Governor Newsom. It will apply to retailers with 500 or more employees across their California stores. Clothing will be unaffected, but the law will affect toys and any ""childcare items"" intended to aid sleep, relaxation, feeding, teething or sucking. In its wording,external, it said the changes would help consumers spot ""unjustified differences in similar products"" and tackle gender bias in children's products. Evan Low, one of the law's co-authors, called the segregation of toys 'the antithesis of modern thinking' Democrat Assemblyman Evan Low, one of the law's co-authors,has previously said,externalthe bill was inspired by his staff member's eight-year-old daughter, who asked her mother why she had to go to the boys section to find a certain toy. ""The segregation of toys by a social construct of what is appropriate for which gender is the antithesis of modern thinking,"" said Mr Low in a statement. He said that categorising toys by gender had ""led to the proliferation of science, technology, engineering and mathematics-geared toys"" in boys sections, while those for girls were directed towards pursuits like ""caring for a baby, fashion, and domestic life."" The Consumer Federation of California, a consumer advocacy group, has been among those in favour of the law. In a statement to The Sacramento Bee newspaper,external, it said separating products by gender ""helps to disguise the unfortunate fact that female products are often priced higher than male products."" Some US retailers have already taken steps away from gender stereotypes in their businesses. In 2015, Target announced that it would stop using some gender-based signs in its stores. But in the last two years, similar bills to enforce gender-neutral commercial spaces have been shot down in California's legislature. Detractors have argued that it infringes on free speech, and business owners' ability to adapt to the free market. One of the most most vocal critics has been the California Family Council, a conservative advocacy group.It has accused,externalgender-fluid clothing entrepreneur Rob Smith of lobbying for the bill for his own commercial gain.

DC Comics reveal latest Superman is bisexual,"In an upcoming comic book issue, Superman will become romantically involved with his friend, a pink-haired reporter named Jay Nakamura DC Comics has announced that its latest Superman, Jon Kent, will be bisexual. In its next comic book issue, due for release in November, Jon will be pictured in a same-sex relationship with his friend Jay Nakamura. The storyline is part of 'Superman: Son of Kal-El', a series following Jon as he takes on the mantle of Superman from his father, Clark Kent. DC Comics made the announcement on National Coming Out Day, an annual LGBT awareness day started in the US. Since the series was released in July, Jon has already fought wildfires caused by climate change, scuppered a high school shooting, and protested against the deportation of refugees. In an earlier issue, Jon struck up a friendship with Jay - a bespectacled, pink-haired reporter. DC Comics said the pair will become romantically involved in the upcoming fifth issue, after Jon ""mentally and physically burns out from trying to save everyone that he can"". Series writer Tom Taylor told the BBC that DC Comics was already mulling the idea of a same-sex relationship before he pitched it Details of the plot has yet to be revealed, but images shared by DC Comics show Jon and Jay sharing a kiss. Series writer Tom Taylor told the BBC that, when he was first offered the job, he pondered ""what Superman should be today."" ""It struck me that it would be a real missed opportunity if we replaced Clark Kent with another straight white saviour,"" said Mr Taylor. To his surprise, before he could pitch the idea of Jon being bisexual, he was told that DC Comics was already mulling the idea. ""There's been a real shift over the last few years - ten years ago, five years ago this would have been more difficult, but I think things have shifted in a really welcome way,"" said Mr Taylor. He said that, despite backlash from ""trolls"" on social media, reaction to the storyline has been overwhelmingly positive. ""We have people saying they read this news today and burst into tears - people saying they never thought in their life that they would be able to see themselves in Superman... literally the most powerful superhero in comics,"" recalled Mr Taylor. ""You'll always have people who'll use the old line of 'don't put politics into comics' - forgetting that every single [comic book] story ever has been political in some way,"" he said. ""People who don't realise that the [Marvel comic series] X-Men were an analogy for the civil rights movement."" ""We try to bring those people with us, but we are writing for the people who will hopefully see this Superman... and say 'This Superman is like me. This Superman is fighting for things that concern me',"" he added.

LiveLiveReaction as report criticises UK lockdown timing3 minutes ago,"A major report by MPs criticises the UK's early response to the Covid outbreak, saying ""big mistakes"" were made The late lockdown in early 2020 ""ranks as one of the most important public health failures"" the UK has ever had The report also says ""many thousands"" of care home deaths could have been avoided And it criticises the test-and-trace programme for its ""slow, uncertain and often chaotic performance"" But the MPs praise the vaccine programme and rollout as one of the best in the world A campaign group has criticised the report, saying the MPs ""explicitly refused"" to meet bereaved families Minister Steve Barclay defends the government's response, saying it always followed scientific advice The UK reported 38,520 cases on Tuesday, as well as 181 new Covid deaths Edited by Becky Morton Thanks for joining us for our coverage of today's report on the successes and failings of the government's coronavirus pandemic response. We're closing our live page now but will be back with more Covid news tomorrow. Today's updates were written by George Bowden, Jennifer Meierhans, Joseph Lee and Mary O'Connor and the page was edited by Becky Morton and Chris Clayton. We hope you have a good evening. Our live coverage today has focusedon a report by MPson the lessons learned from the UK government's handling of the pandemic so far. We've been sharing the report's findings as well as reaction throughout the day - here's a recap:  A&E nurse Mark Boothroyd said hospital staff wondered why the UK didn't take the same Covid measures as other nations As the government's pandemic response comes under renewed scrutiny, A&E nurse Mark Boothroyd recalls the anxiety he and colleagues felt as the number of UK cases began to grow. âWe were wondering when they were going to lock down, we were wondering what other countries were doing and we were wondering why they werenât copying them,"" says Boothroyd, who works at St Thomas' Hospital in London. ""They must have thought we were invincible."" He tells the BBC it was ""infuriating"" when Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on TV on 3 March last year that he shook hands with people he met on a hospital visit, including Covid patients. ""It was completely against all the guidance that was out at the time. It was almost making a joke out of it. That was entirely the wrong message to the public and showed he wasnât taking the thing seriously,â says Boothroyd. Along with the discussions about herd immunity, he says it reflected a belief that the country could just ""ride it out"" like the flu, and misunderstood how bad Covid-19 could be. Although Covid case numbers in the UK remain high - another 38,520 were reported in the last 24 hours - hospital admissions have fallen slightly. The 181 deaths in today's figures are higher than the weekly average of 114 - but there is often a delay in deaths being recorded over the weekend, meaning daily figures tend to be higher earlier in the week. Baroness Ros Altmann, the former pensions minister, has been speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live about the challenges facing care homes, following today's report on the government's response to the pandemic. She says the sector faces even more of a struggle in future as numbers requiring care increase. She says there are estimates the care sector  will lose up to 70,000 staff if full vaccination is made a condition of employment as planned on 11 November. ""Where are the
replacements coming from? We don't allow social care to qualify for relaxed,
immigration rules, so we can't get people coming in from overseas,"" Altmann adds. BBC Radio 5 Live This video can not be played A woman has described what it was like not being able to visit her husband in a care home throughout the pandemic. Lynnâs husband Trevor, who has dementia, went into a care home at the start of the first lockdown. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: âIt still hurts now, a terrible memory, because I couldnât see him at all for all those weeks. ""Iâve never been on my own before and I couldnât even access help from my family."" The care homeâs rules mean that, even now, Lynn can only visit Trevor for half an hour twice a week â and is only just able to touch him without gloves. ""I havenât had a hug for 18 months,"" she said. Listen to 5 Liveon the free BBC Sounds app. Today's figures show there have been another 38,520 confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours. Cases have been rising since the beginning of the month, with a 13.5% increase over the last seven days compared to the previous week. The UK also recorded another 181 deaths within 28 days of a positive test. Itâs one of the highest daily figures in recent weeks, but recorded deaths at the beginning of the week can sometimes be inflated by reporting lags over the weekend. New vaccinations continue at a low level, with 29,172 first doses and 23,632 second doses administered. As of 11 October, 85.6% of people aged over 12 had one dose of the vaccine and 78.6% had two. Katy Davis (left) and her identical twin Emma died with Covid in April 2020 A woman whose twin sisters died within three days of one another after testing positive for Covid says today's report uses the success of the vaccine programme to deflect from earlier failures. Zoe Davis' sisters Katy and Emma, who were both nurses,died in April 2020. She says: ""Nobody is saying that the vaccine programme hasn't been phenomenal but the frustrating thing is that's a deflection of what is actually being brought to attention and the overall message is that Covid failures have cost lives. ""As somebody who has lost family members you cannot help but think, what if they were in that20,000 people who might not have lost their lives if the government had implemented social distancing measures a week earlier? ""My relatives have been seen as dispensable they are just
numbers on a sheet to them, not the amazing people I know they were. ""Both
my sisters were nurses and had an impact on lots of people's lives, they were valued members of society, how can people
like that be labelled dispensable?"" As we've been hearing, Science Minister George Freeman has suggested that a major cause of the UK's Covid death toll was the country's high rate of obesity- related disease.

"PM expected to back loans for gas price-hit firmsBoris Johnson is set to approve plans for emergency loans to energy-intensive firms, the BBC understands.","Firms hit by a sharp surge in energy prices are expected to get government help worth hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC understands. Glass, ceramic and paper manufacturers have warned that rising prices may mean they have to charge customers more. On Monday, business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng submitted a formal proposal asking the Treasury to help such firms. The Department for Business expects the prime minister to back its proposals, which could involve state-backed loans. The government is reluctant to prop up companies which would normally be competitive, which is why support is likely to involve loans rather than grants. The Treasury is said to be still analysing the proposal. Number 10 has declined to comment. Businesses have said they hope for a ""swift response"" on the plans. High energy costs have been forcing manufacturers in energy-intensive industries such as steel and chemical manufacturing to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Other firms have said they may be forced to shut down their factories if the rising cost of gas and electricity makes it uneconomic for them to produce their goods. Why are gas prices so high? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Dr Richard Leese, chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) - an umbrella group for several manufacturers including ceramics and paper, told the BBC's Today programme that a quick response from the Treasury to the proposals was ""crucial"". ""We need preventative action to stop the issue spreading further."" Dr Leese said firms in the sector faced higher tax and levies than European rivals. He said firms had put forward ""practical and sensible"" measures for help, and denied that government help would put any additional burden on taxpayers. Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, said he had yet to see details of the proposals put forward. He warned that without adequate support, plants could close and jobs could be under threat as high energy costs bite. ""The key test in this proposal is are we now going to be on an equal footing with steelmakers in Germany?,"" Mr Stace said. ""If this package results in us still paying 80% more for energy than our competitors in continental Europe, then really this will really be a flimsy sticking plaster on what is really a major crisis that we are going through at the moment."" Phil Wild is the boss of paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC Kendal paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC has been in business since 1845 and is one of the biggest employers in the area. Today, it also makes home insulation and carbon paper, with energy bills working out at about Â£60,000 every single week. Its chief executive, Phil Wild, told BBC Breakfast: ""Any price increase is significant for a manufacturer like ours that consumes the energy that we do. ""As it happens, we're probably OK here because of some actions we've put in place, but I can see some of those businesses may not make it."" He added that the recent increase in gas prices had highlighted the need for energy intensive firms to start using more renewable forms of energy, rather than fossil fuels and gas. But in the short-term, paper, glass, steel and ceramics manufacturers ""are really looking to the government for help to get them over that hump"", he said. The proposals by Business Secretary Kwarteng follow days of conversations with leaders from affected industries, as well as a very public row with the Treasury about the status of talks between the government departments. Demands for support from energy-intensive industries have been growing louder, but not all companies are affected in the same way. Some have long-term contracts to buy energy at fixed prices, protecting them from short-term increases, but others do not. Businesses themselves have called for their energy costs to be capped, in the same way that households currently benefit from a price cap imposed by regulator Ofgem. But that would risk simply passing on the extra costs to energy suppliers, says our correspondent. Direct subsidies would add to the burden on taxpayers, at a time when Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to seek to curb public spending in his next Budget on 27 October. There are many reasons, both in the UK and around the world. There's been a shortage of gas and energy in many countries as they emerged from lockdown and industry reopened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, less gas is being stored than normal. On top of that, the UK has fewer gas storage facilities than some countries - meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that Russia, a major gas supplier, is restricting output - an accusation it denies - which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises. This has helped push up gas prices in the UK, Europe and Asia. Since January, they've risen 250%. And prices have soared 70% since August alone.

Footballers tackle industry over 'data misuse',"This video can not be played Footballers 'have right to see where data goes' Hundreds of footballers have threatened legal action against the data collection industry, which could change how information is handled. Led by former Cardiff City, Leyton Orient and Yeovil Town manager Russell Slade, 850 players want compensation for the trading of their performance data over the past six years. They also want an annual fee from the companies for any future use. ""Letters before action"" have been sent to 17 big firms, alleging data misuse. Welsh government breached data laws 300 times How your data is being scraped from social media Anglesey cyber-attack affects island's five secondaries Data ranges from average goals-per-game for an outfield player to height - however, Mr Sladehas previously expressed concernthis is sometimes wrong. If the group pursues legal action and is successful, it could lead to a radical change of a multi-billion pound industry behind professional sport that trades on players' information. Slade's legal team said the fact players receive no payment for the unlicensed use of their data contravenes General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) rules that were strengthened in 2018. Under Article 4 of the GDPR, ""personal data"" refers to a range or identifiable information, such as physical attributes, location data or physiological information. BBC News understands that an initial 17 major betting, entertainment and data collection firms have been targeted, but Slade's Global Sports Data and Technology Group has highlighted more than 150 targets it believes have misused data. Former Cardiff City manager Russell Slade is leading the group While receiving a fee for the use of their data might not have much impact on the high earners of the Premier League, Slade feels strongly that those lower down the pyramid, in both the men's and women's game, would see tangible benefits. ""It's incredible where it's used,"" Slade said. ""On one player, and I'm not talking about a Premier League player or even a Championship player, there was some 7,000 pieces of information on one individual player at a lower league football club. ""There are companies that are taking that data and processing that data without the individual consent of that player. ""A big part of our journey has been looking at that ecosystem and plotting out where that data starts, who's processing it, where it finishes and that's a real global thing. ""It's making football - and all sports - aware of the implications and what needs to change."" The use of data in sport is nothing new. Its collection, distribution and use has become a staple part of the modern sporting environment, be it by clubs to manage player performance, or by third party companies to base things like odds on. If the move is successful, the implications could have far-reaching effects beyond football. TikTok sued for billions over children's data Welsh government breached data laws over 300 times Facebook sued for 'losing control' of usersâ data BBC News understand discussions are already underway within other professional sports to bring potential legal action regarding the trading of data. Former Wales international Dave Edwards, one the players behind the move, said it was a chance for players to take more control of the way information about them is used. Having seen how data has become a staple part of the modern game, he believes players rights to how information about them is used should be at the forefront of any future use. ""The more I've looked into it and you see how our data is used, the amount of channels its passed through, all the different organisations which use it, I feel as a player we should have a say on who is allowed to use it,"" he said. The footballers say they want compensation and an annual fee for the use of their data ""Anyone else in the world would have that say. Just because we're footballers and we're in the public domain that gets overlooked. ""If you were in another job, if you were a teacher or a lawyer and this sort of details was being passed around your field of work it wouldn't sit right with that person. ""I don't think we, as individuals really differ from that."" The lawyer behind Global Sports Data and Technology's action, Chris Farnell, believes it could be start of a sport-wide reshaping of how data is traded. ""This will be significant change if the precedent is set throughout football and how data is used throughout sport in general,"" he said. ""It will change significantly how that data is being used and how it's going to be rewarded.""

'Crazy' period for recruitment puts workers on top,"Sectors including finance, tech and driving have suffered staff shortages alongside hospitality A shortage of skilled workers has created a ""crazy period"" for the Welsh jobs market, a leading recruitment firm has said. Cardiff-based Yolk Recruitment said candidates were in a ""position of control and power"". The firm said clients' job vacancies had increased by 35% compared to pre-pandemic levels. Official figures show numbers in work in Wales rose by 25,000 in the three months to August. There were also 44,000 more people in employment compared to the same quarter last year, Office for National Statistics (ONS) figures showed. Despite this, unemployment in the three months to August increased by 0.2% to 4% overall - below the UK average of 4.5%. Next: Overseas workers only way to solve shortages Prezzo gives staff pay rise and Boxing Day off Amazon to offer bonuses to attract temporary staff Researchers suggest that the shortage of skilled workers will remain a challenge for the next five years. Steven Lloyd, 47, from Gilfach, near Bridgend recently retrained as an HGV driver. ""The passion was always HGV and lorries, but unfortunately - with the cost - I was never able to afford the outlay for the training,"" said Steven. He previously drove buses, but after being made redundant during the pandemic, retrained for his dream job. After losing his job during the pandemic, Steven Lloyd is retraining for his dream job The cost, which can run into thousands of pounds, has been covered by Remploy, which Steven was referred to by his Job Centre in Porth, Rhondda Cynon Taf. ""It has made my dream come true really, it is just wonderful,"" he said. ""With lorries, you are delivering goods, you're in the cab on your own - with the radio on, you can sing along. But it is also just being part of a team, especially with the shortage [of drivers]. You are contributing something really valuable at the moment."" Chief operating officer of John Raymond Transport, Geraint Davies, said the Bridgend-based company had turned to organisations such as Remploy after struggling to recruit drivers through the usual channels. The company has had to increase wages to attract workers and while it has 140 drivers, could easily employ another 15 or 20 if they were available, he said. Pavan Arora of Yolk Recruitment says 35% more jobs are 'available and open' ""It is a crazy period that we have seen, especially since the start of the summer,"" said Pavan Arora, chief commercial officer for Yolk Recruitment in Cardiff. His own team of recruiters has expanded to deal with the boom in vacancies. The recruitment office has a gong which staff will strike when job deals are completed. It is being struck a lot these days. ""Right now, as a business, we have seen an increase of around 35% in demand compared to pre-pandemic levels. So that's 35% more jobs available and open,"" he said. There have beenwell-publicised shortages among lorry drivers, but sectors including technology companies and financial services firms are also having difficulty finding staff. Hospitality continues to struggle too, with wages increasing and some pubs and restaurants closing temporarily because of a lack of staff. Mr Arora recalled thousands of applicants were chasing a few jobs as the pandemic took hold last year, but the reopening of society has flipped the jobs market. It means some job candidates have a choice of roles, and can demand increased salaries or more flexible working patterns. ""It is your pickings, it is your time, the position of control and power is in your court slightly,"" Mr Arora said. ""What you have to be aware of is that there are a lot of counter offers. So there are a lot of employers that are trying to retain staff as they look to leave a business. ""That is a challenge for new employers, but also candidates have to be aware that maybe they can get more from their current employer before going to the employment market, because everyone is feeling the pinch of how crazy the current jobs market is."" Rhys Griffiths from the Open University said skills shortages predated Covid The shortage of skilled labour, even for entry level roles, is preoccupying businesses. Research by the Open University found the majority of Welsh companies it surveyed had suffered as a result of the shortage of workers. ""Employers are facing skills shortages, they are finding it challenging to recruit people into their businesses,"" said Rhys Griffiths, the business relationship manager for the Open University. ""Covid is having an impact on some of the decisions and challenges that they are facing,"" he added. ""But we have been tracking the skills shortage. What is apparent is that the skills shortages have been there for a number of years and will continue."" Universities and colleges are working with businesses to offer apprenticeships or tailored training, but the Open University's research found that firms expect staffing issues to continue for the next five years. Hospitality businesses are already attempting to work with training providers to address the shortage. Hospitality businesses are already attempting to work with training providers to address the shortage. The north Wales restaurant group Dylan's is launching an academy, and will work with schools and colleges to recruit and train staff by providing a qualification and a guaranteed job. The restaurant's head of marketing, David Retallick, said it was the company's response to the crisis in recruitment across the hospitality sector. ""It is an opportunity for us to offer working experience alongside the apprenticeship programmes that already exist. ""This is our own Dylan's spin on how we bring up and develop young people in the industry - allowing people to break in slowly, rather than giving them a shock-horror treatment where they go to their first job and they suddenly realise that they are really in the deep end."" Mr Retallick said the trainees would have working patterns that aimed to shed the image of antisocial hours and low pay that had traditionally been attached to hospitality jobs. He said: ""We are limiting hours, we are not putting people on weekend work or on double shifts, and we are paying above the minimum wage for 16 to 21 year olds. We are just making sure it as well-facilitated by the business as possible.""

Iraq claims capture of IS finance mastermindSami Jasim al-Jaburi was allegedly a deputy leader of the jihadist group under Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.Middle East,"The US had offered a $5m reward for information leading to Sami Jasim al-Jaburi's capture Iraq says it has captured the jihadist group Islamic State's financial chief in an operation outside its borders. Sami Jasim al-Jaburi was arrested in a ""complex external operation"" by the Iraqi National Intelligence Service, Prime Minister Mustafa al-Kadhimi tweeted, without specifying a location. He added that Mr Jasim, also known as Hajji Hamid, was a deputy leader of IS under the late Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. The US had offered a $5m (Â£3.7m) reward,externalfor information leading to his capture. Its Rewards for Justice website alleged that he was ""instrumental in managing finances for [IS] terrorist operations"" and had supervised the group's ""revenue-generating operations from illicit sales of oil, gas, antiquities, and minerals"" after it seized large swathes of Iraq and Syria in 2014. Iraqi officials are hailing the capture of Sami Jasim as a significant blow to IS. They say, cryptically, that he was captured in a foreign intelligence operation without immediately revealing where. The high-level IS operative is believed to have been not only in charge of the group's finances but also of its cross-border operations in Syria and Iraq where it continues to attack police and military bases. His value to the Iraqi security forces will be not so much his loss to IS - where he will be swiftly replaced - but in what information he yields to his captors about imminent attacks. Since the military defeat of IS and its self-declared caliphate it has reverted to being an insurgency, conducting hit-and-run attacks. It's estimated to have around 10,000 fighters at large in the Middle East. Further afield it remains a dangerous security threat in countries as far apart as Afghanistan and Mozambique. Iraq's Security Media Cell said the detainee was close to the new leader of IS, Amir Mohammed Said Abdul Rahman al-Mawla, who replaced Baghdadi afterhe killed himself during a US special forces raid on his hideout in Syria in 2019. Although Mr Kadhimi did not reveal where Mr Jasim had been captured, a senior Iraqi military source told AFP news agency it had happened in Turkey. There was no immediate response from Turkish authorities to the report. Earlier this year, the Iraqi government announced it had killed another alleged deputy IS leader, Jabir Salman Saleh al-Isawi, as well as the leader of IS in southern Iraq, Jabbar Ali Fayadh. This video can not be played Islamic State children in Syria face a lifetime in prison IS once controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from eastern Iraq to western Syria and imposed its brutal rule on almost eight million people. Despite the group's defeat on the battlefield in Iraq in 2017 and in Syria two years later, it is estimated that thousands of militants remain active in both countries.

"PM expected to back loans for gas price-hit firmsBoris Johnson is set to approve plans for emergency loans to energy-intensive firms, the BBC understands.Business","Firms hit by a sharp surge in energy prices are expected to get government help worth hundreds of millions of pounds, the BBC understands. Glass, ceramic and paper manufacturers have warned that rising prices may mean they have to charge customers more. On Monday, business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng submitted a formal proposal asking the Treasury to help such firms. The Department for Business expects the prime minister to back its proposals, which could involve state-backed loans. The government is reluctant to prop up companies which would normally be competitive, which is why support is likely to involve loans rather than grants. The Treasury is said to be still analysing the proposal. Number 10 has declined to comment. Businesses have said they hope for a ""swift response"" on the plans. High energy costs have been forcing manufacturers in energy-intensive industries such as steel and chemical manufacturing to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Other firms have said they may be forced to shut down their factories if the rising cost of gas and electricity makes it uneconomic for them to produce their goods. Why are gas prices so high? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? Dr Richard Leese, chair of the Energy Intensive Users Group (EIUG) - an umbrella group for several manufacturers including ceramics and paper, told the BBC's Today programme that a quick response from the Treasury to the proposals was ""crucial"". ""We need preventative action to stop the issue spreading further."" Dr Leese said firms in the sector faced higher tax and levies than European rivals. He said firms had put forward ""practical and sensible"" measures for help, and denied that government help would put any additional burden on taxpayers. Gareth Stace, the director general of the trade body UK Steel, said he had yet to see details of the proposals put forward. He warned that without adequate support, plants could close and jobs could be under threat as high energy costs bite. ""The key test in this proposal is are we now going to be on an equal footing with steelmakers in Germany?,"" Mr Stace said. ""If this package results in us still paying 80% more for energy than our competitors in continental Europe, then really this will really be a flimsy sticking plaster on what is really a major crisis that we are going through at the moment."" Phil Wild is the boss of paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC Kendal paper manufacturer James Cropper PLC has been in business since 1845 and is one of the biggest employers in the area. Today, it also makes home insulation and carbon paper, with energy bills working out at about Â£60,000 every single week. Its chief executive, Phil Wild, told BBC Breakfast: ""Any price increase is significant for a manufacturer like ours that consumes the energy that we do. ""As it happens, we're probably OK here because of some actions we've put in place, but I can see some of those businesses may not make it."" He added that the recent increase in gas prices had highlighted the need for energy intensive firms to start using more renewable forms of energy, rather than fossil fuels and gas. But in the short-term, paper, glass, steel and ceramics manufacturers ""are really looking to the government for help to get them over that hump"", he said. The proposals by Business Secretary Kwarteng follow days of conversations with leaders from affected industries, as well as a very public row with the Treasury about the status of talks between the government departments. Demands for support from energy-intensive industries have been growing louder, but not all companies are affected in the same way. Some have long-term contracts to buy energy at fixed prices, protecting them from short-term increases, but others do not. Businesses themselves have called for their energy costs to be capped, in the same way that households currently benefit from a price cap imposed by regulator Ofgem. But that would risk simply passing on the extra costs to energy suppliers, says our correspondent. Direct subsidies would add to the burden on taxpayers, at a time when Chancellor Rishi Sunak is expected to seek to curb public spending in his next Budget on 27 October. There are many reasons, both in the UK and around the world. There's been a shortage of gas and energy in many countries as they emerged from lockdown and industry reopened. A cold winter in Europe last year also put pressure on supplies and, as a result, less gas is being stored than normal. On top of that, the UK has fewer gas storage facilities than some countries - meaning it buys more on the wholesale market and is exposed to sharp price rises. There's also increased demand from Asia (which also suffered a cold winter) for liquefied natural gas. And there is a suspicion that Russia, a major gas supplier, is restricting output - an accusation it denies - which, following the law of supply and demand, has fuelled price rises.
