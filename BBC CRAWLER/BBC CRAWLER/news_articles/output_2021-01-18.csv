Sheku Bayoh witness contradicts police evidence,"This video can not be played Sheku Bayoh death: Eyewitness says stamping attack on officer 'never happened' Two police officers involved in the death of a black man they were restraining may have provided false statements, the BBC can reveal. They said Sheku Bayoh carried out a stamping attack on a female PC before he was brought to the ground and restrained by up to six officers. But now an eyewitness has spoken publicly for the first time about the 2015 incident. He told a Panorama investigation that the stamping attack ""never happened"". The Scottish Police Federation said its officers had cooperated truthfully with investigators. Mr Bayoh, a 31-year-old father of two, died in the incident in the Fife town of Kirkcaldy in 2015. A public inquiry into the circumstances surrounding his death has recently got under way. One of its tasks is to examine whether his race was a factor. Sheku Bayoh was restrained on the ground for five minutes before falling unconscious On the night of 2 May 2015, Sheku Bayoh had taken drugs, which friends said dramatically altered his behaviour. Police were called early the following morning after he was spotted behaving erratically with a knife in the streets of his home town. According to police statements, by the time the officers arrived at the scene Mr Bayoh no longer had the knife but he failed to obey instructions to get down on the ground. Each of the officers used force on Mr Bayoh within seconds of encountering him, including CS Spray and batons. He then punched PC Nicole Short, who went to the ground. Two officers, PCs Craig Walker and Ashley Tomlinson, would later tell investigators that Mr Bayoh then carried out a violent stamping attack on PC Short while she lay on the ground, a claim reported widely in the media. The stamping attack was widely reported in the newspapers PC Walker told investigators: ""I had a clear view of himâ¦ he had his arms raised up at right angles to his body and brought his right foot down in a full-force stamp on to her lower back."" PC Tomlinson said: ""I thought he had killed her. He stomped on her back again."" Now, evidence obtained by Panorama suggests these accounts may be false. 'Why did my brother die in police custody?' Mr Bayoh was restrained on the ground for five minutes before falling unconscious. He was pronounced dead at hospital a short time later. A post-mortem examination report revealed 23 separate injuries to Mr Bayoh's body, including a broken rib and gashes to his head. The cause of death was recorded as ""sudden death in a man intoxicated [with drugs] whilst under restraint"". In 2018, the Crown Office in Scotland decided there would be no prosecutions against any officers involved. Kevin Nelson gave evidence to investigators two days after the incident Kevin Nelson was in a nearby house and saw events unfold over a garden hedge. He gave his account to investigators from Pirc (Police Investigations and Review Commissioner), which investigates deaths in custody, two days after the incident. Speaking publicly for the first time, Mr Nelson told Panorama he saw Mr Bayoh attempt to walk away from the officers, ignoring their commands, before being sprayed with CS spray. He said Mr Bayoh retaliated and punched PC Short. Asked if there had been any further contact with PC Short, he said, ""No. He was running offâ¦ after the punch, there was no more attack on her at all."" Mr Nelson said Mr Bayoh ran off from where PC Short went down and was quickly intercepted by the other officers. Asked about PC Walker's claim that Mr Bayoh had ""his arms raised upâ¦ and brought his right foot down in a full force stamp"", Mr Nelson said: ""That never happened. I didn't see him stamping at all or, other than the punch, any raised arms. ""After the punch, that was it. There was no more attack on her at all. That's not right."" The officers provided their accounts to investigators 32 days after Mr Bayoh's death. Mr Nelson said no-one from Pirc returned to ask about the discrepancy between their account and his. A BBC investigation revealed footage of the Sheku Bayoh incident The eyewitness said he decided to speak out because it was unfair on Mr Bayoh's family that the officers had ""made the incident worse than it actually was to justify what had happened andâ¦ that's not right"". Mr Nelson's account is supported by CCTV footage of the incident, obtained by the BBC. It is poor quality but appears to show that once PC Short is knocked down by Mr Bayoh, the action moves away from her, and he is brought down within five seconds. PC Short did not mention in her statement she had been stamped on. Now retired, she later said she was unsure if she was conscious, and only learned about the alleged stamping attack when her colleagues told her about it afterwards. In the CCTV, PC Short appears to get to her feet a few seconds after Mr Bayoh is brought down. Mike Franklin says conflicts of evidence should have been resolved Mike Franklin, former commissioner for the body which investigated police complaints in England and Wales, looked at Panorama's evidence. He said: ""I think there's nothing more serious than a police officer who gives false information in an investigation where somebody has died. So without accusing them of lying, I simply say that there's a big conflict. ""Two officers who were there say that it did happen. The person to whom it happened didn't mention it. And an eyewitness says it didn't happen. ""I would've been reluctant to sign off the investigation as complete, without resolving thoseâ¦ conflicts of evidence."" Mr Bayoh's sister, Kadi Johnson, told Panorama the new allegations had made her ""really angry"". She said the way her brother was ""painted"" by the accounts given after his death was not who he was. Mr Bayoh's sister, Kadi Johnson, said the new allegations had made her really angry A spokesman for the Scottish Police Federation, which represents rank and file officers, said serving officers were unable to comment on matters ""to which they may be called upon to give sworn evidence"" but that they had ""co-operated fully and truthfully with the investigations that have taken place"". It added it had seen ""compelling material that Mr Bayoh did violently stamp on the back of a policewoman as she lay unconscious"". The BBC asked for this material to be produced but was told the inquiry was the ""proper forum"" for such matters. The Crown Office, which directed the Pirc Inquiry, told Panorama it had examined ""eye-witness accounts of police and civilian witnesses"" and instructed ""appropriate investigation"". It said after careful consideration it was decided there should be no prosecutions but reserved the right to prosecute should evidence become available. Pirc told Panorama its investigation was ""detailed and extensive"" but could not comment further because of the public inquiry. Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone expressed his condolences to the Bayoh family and said the force would ""participate fully"" in the inquiry. Kevin Clarke died after being restrained in London by up to nine officers Panorama's ""I Can't Breathe: Black and Dead in Custody"" also investigates the case of Kevin Clarke, 35, who died in 2018 after being restrained in London by up to nine officers. An inquest into his death resulted in a damning verdict on the police and ambulance services. Met Police apologises over restraint death Mr Clarke's sister Tellecia told the programme that if the officers ""hadn't used excessive force he would still be here todayâ¦ treat him like a human being, and not just see him as a big scary black man"". Metropolitan Police Commander Bas Javid apologised to Mr Clarke's family and accepted the restraint had not been appropriate.

World on brink of catastrophic moral failure - WHO,"Mass vaccination has already started in several countries, including Russia The world faces a ""catastrophic moral failure"" because of unequal Covid vaccine policies, the head of the World Health Organization (WHO) has warned. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said it was not fair for younger, healthy people in richer nations to get injections before vulnerable people in poorer states. He said over 39 million vaccine doses had been given in 49 richer states - but one poor nation had only 25 doses. Meanwhile, both the WHO and China were criticised for their Covid response. An independent panel commissioned by the WHO said the UN public health body should have declared an international emergency earlier, and also rapped China for not taking public health measures sooner. India begins world's biggest Covid vaccine drive Will countries be left behind in the vaccine race? So far, China, India, Russia, the UK and the US have all developed Covid vaccines, with others being made by multinational teams - like the American-German Pfizer vaccine. Almost all of these nations have prioritised distribution to their own populations. Speaking at a WHO executive board session on Monday, Dr Tedros said,external, ""I need to be blunt: the world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries."" Dr Tedros said a ""me-first"" approach would be self-defeating because it would push up prices and encourage hoarding. ""Ultimately, these actions will only prolong the pandemic, the restrictions needed to contain it, and human and economic suffering,"" he added. This video can not be played A 'bittersweet' moment for India's health workers And the WHO head called for a full commitment to the global vaccine-sharing scheme Covax, which is due to start rolling out next month. ""My challenge to all member states is to ensure that by the time World Health Day arrives on 7 April, Covid-19 vaccines are being administered in every country, as a symbol of hope for overcoming both the pandemic and the inequalities that lie at the root of so many global health challenges,"" Dr Tedros said. So far, more than 180 countries have signed up to the Covax initiative, which is supported by the WHO and a group of international vaccine advocacy groups. Its aim is to unite countries into one bloc so they have more power to negotiate with drug companies. Ninety-two countries - all of them low or middle-income - will have their vaccines paid for by a fund sponsored by donors. ""We have secured two billion doses from five producers, with options of more than one billion more doses, and we aim to start deliveries in February,"" Dr Tedros said. Reacting to Dr Tedros' warning, UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""The UK is the world's biggest supporter, financial supporter, of the global programme to ensure access to vaccines in all countries in the world."" Mr Hancock said the UK had ""put the most financial support in these international efforts to ensure everybody has access to vaccines"". The UK government has provided Â£548m ($734m) to the Covax programme. More thanfour million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures. People in their 70s and the clinically extremely vulnerable in England are now among those being offered the jab. Last month,the People's Vaccine Alliance coalition of campaigning bodies said that rich countries were hoarding doses of Covid vaccinesand people living in poor countries were set to miss out. It said that nearly 70 lower-income countries would only be able to vaccinate one in 10 people. Canada, in particular, came in for criticism, with the coalition saying the North American nation had ordered enough vaccine doses to protect each Canadian five times. In December, Karina Gould, Canada's minister of international development, denied allegations the country was hoarding vaccines, saying any discussion of a surplus was ""hypothetical"" as the doses had not been delivered. She said Canada was providing C$485 million ($380 million; Â£280 million) to help developing countries cope with Covid-19. In their interim report, the panel of independent experts said both China and the WHO should have acted faster during the early stages of the coronavirus outbreak. The document said that Beijing should have acted more forcefully to localise the initial outbreak in the city of Wuhan first detected in late 2019. The experts also criticised the WHO for only declaring a global emergency on 30 January 2020. ""The global pandemic alert system is not fit for purpose,"" the report said. ""The World Health Organization has been underpowered to do the job."" The panel of experts was led by former New Zealand Prime Minister Helen Clark and former Liberian President Ellen Johnson Sirleaf.

Army to set up 80 vaccine centres in Scotland,"The Royal Scots Dragoon Guard are helping set up a vaccination centre at the Ravenscraig Regional Sports Facility British Army soldiers are helping to establish 80 new Covid vaccine centres across Scotland. The Ministry of Defence (MoD) said 98 soldiers were being deployed to identify suitable sites and aid deliveries of the vaccine. More than 200,000 people in Scotland have already received their first dose. The UK's vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said the Army would be setting up the sites before conducting a ""smooth handover"" to NHS Scotland. The soldiers are from the Royal Army Medical Corps and Leuchars-based Royal Scots Dragoon Guards. The Scottish government has said it wanted to vaccinate the over-80s, care home residents and staff, front-line health workers and social care workers by the beginning of February - about 560,000 people. Has Scotland been slower to vaccinate over-80s? When will I be vaccinated against Covid? First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said people in the over-70 age group would start getting invitations for appointments ""literally over the coming days"". A total of 264,991 people have now been given a first dose of a coronavirus vaccine in Scotland. Ms Sturgeon said 80% of care home residents had now been vaccinated, with the programme for all those over 80 now ""picking up pace"". She said Scotland was working to the same targets as the rest of the UK nations, and was ""on track"" to hit them. At the weekend the British Medical Association said there had beenissues for some GPs receiving supplies of the vaccine in Scotland. The first minister said she had taken part in a call with manufacturer AstraZeneca last week, and said that while manufacturing and supply were ""a bit bumpy"" at the moment ""they expect them to level out and become much more sustainable at a certain level"". She said the aim was to get all adults vaccinated ""absolutely as quickly as we can"". Members of the Royal Scots Dragoon Guards have already been used to run mobile Covid testing centres in Scotland. The deployment of soldiers to help with the continued vaccine rollout is part of the ""largest peacetime resilience operation"" ever undertaken by the UK Armed Forces, the MoD said. Organised into 11 teams spread across Scotland, they will be supporting NHS Scotland for the next 28 days. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said it was the largest mass vaccination programme Scotland had ever undertaken and said she was very grateful for the support of the armed forces. ""This deployment will see 11, eight-person multi-disciplinary teams providing fast and assured site preparation over a four-week period, identifying and operationalising vaccine sites before handing them over to NHS Scotland staff,"" she said. ""Vaccination is a vital tool in our work to suppress the virus to the lowest possible level in Scotland, but other measures including testing remain absolutely vital, which it is why it is so essential people continue to follow the restrictions currently in place while vaccine delivery is rolled out across the country."" The MOD said the soldiers would be using their ""logistical, organisational and clinical expertise"" to establish the vaccine centres, before handing them over to NHS Scotland to deliver the vaccination programme. The military teams will organise car parking and traffic flow, as well as setting up patient recording methods. They will also help with vaccine delivery to each of the 80 sites as well as helping to prepare storage for medicine and equipment. Three vaccines have now been approved by UK regulators, developed by Pfizer-BioNTech, Oxford-AstraZeneca and Moderna. They have been purchased by the UK government, with Scotland being given a share based on its population size. Doses of the Pfizer and Oxford vaccines are currently being given, with supplies of the Moderna vaccine expected from early April. The soldiers helping with the vaccine effort will be controlled by Joint Military Command staff in Stirling. There are a further 32 UK military planners working in support of the Scottish government team in St Andrews House, Edinburgh, and across Scotland's 14 health boards. The military has already been used for medical evacuations of patients sick with Covid from Shetland, Orkney and Arran. Ms Sturgeon thanked the military for their help with logistical matters, noting they had also been involved in distributing PPE supplies and setting up the NHS Louisa Jordan hospital in Glasgow.

Coroner calls for smart motorway review over deaths,"Alexandru Murgeanu (l) and Jason Mercer were killed in the crash on the M1 in South Yorkshire A coroner has called for a review of smart motorways after an inquest heard the deaths of two men on a stretch of the M1 could have been avoided. Jason Mercer, 44, and Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, died when Prezemyslaw Szuba crashed his lorry into their vehicles near Sheffield on 7 June 2019. Coroner David Urpeth said smart motorways without a hard shoulder carry ""an ongoing risk of future deaths"". Highways England said it was ""addressing many of the points raised"". Mr Urpeth recorded a verdict of unlawful killing at Sheffield Town Hall. He added he would be writing to Highways England and the transport secretary asking for a review. The inquest heard the deaths of the two men may have been avoided had there had been a hard shoulder. More stories from around Yorkshire On the stretch of the M1 where the crash took place, the hard shoulder has been replaced by an active lane. Szuba, 40, from Hull, wasjailed last year after admitting causing their deaths by careless driving. He was speaking from prison to the inquest. Prezemyslaw Szuba was jailed over the deaths Answering questions over the phone, Szuba told the hearing he accepted he was driving without paying proper attention. ""I have already accepted that at my trial,"" he said, but added: ""If there had been a hard shoulder on this bit of motorway, the collision would have been avoidable. ""I would have driven past these two cars as it would be safer and they would have been able to come home safely and I would be able to come back home."" Szuba said he had only three to five seconds to react, and asked if he would have avoided the crash had he been paying attention, he said: ""It's difficult to say after everything now."" Sgt Mark Brady, who oversees major collision investigations for South Yorkshire Police, told the hearing: ""Had there been a hard shoulder, had Jason and Alexandru pulled on to the hard shoulder, my opinion is that Mr Szuba would have driven clean past them."" But he accepted the primary cause of the crash was Szuba's inattention to the road. The crash happened after a collision between a Ford Focus driven by Mr Mercer, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and a Ford Transit driven by Mr Murgeanu, who was living in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, but was originally from Romania. When Mr Mercer and Mr Murgeanu got out to exchange details they were hit by the lorry, and both died at the scene. Mr Mercer's wife Claire hascampaigned against smart motorwayssince her husband's death, and was at the hearing on Monday. Claire Mercer has campaigned against the use of smart motorways since her husband's death In a statement, Highways England said it was ""determined"" to do everything it could to make roads as safe as possible and was already addressing many of the points raised by the coroner ""as published in the Government's Smart Motorway Evidence Stocktake and Action Plan of March 2020"". ""We will carefully consider any further comments raised by the coroner once we receive the report,"" it added. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

MPs urge Johnson to keep Â£20 benefit 'lifeline',"MPs have urged Boris Johnson to extend benefit increases worth Â£20 a week. A non-binding Labour motion calling for the universal credit top-up to be kept in place beyond 31 March passed by 278 votes to none after a Commons debate. Six Tory MPs defied party orders to abstain and voted with Labour, adding to the pressure on the PM on the issue. The prime minister said the government had provided Â£280bn worth of support during the pandemic but all measures would be kept under ""constant review"". The motion, which will not automatically lead to a change in policy, was put forward by Labour as a way to put additional pressure on the government to continue the increase, worth Â£1,000 a year. This video can not be played Carl, a roofer, describes going from ""not having enough to barely having enough"" on universal credit. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb was among six Conservative MPs to rebel, along with Peter Aldous, Robert Halfon, Jason McCartney, Anne Marie Morris and Matthew Offord. Ahead of the vote, Mr Crabb told the BBC that although there were ""difficult pressures on the chancellor"" extending the increase for 12 months was ""the right thing to do"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there weredozens of Conservative MPswho were ""deeply uneasy"" about ending the Â£20 weekly increase to universal credit. She added that it was also understood the cabinet minister with responsibility for benefits, Therese Coffey, was arguing that the uplift should not be dropped in April. Benefit increase only 'temporary', says Raab Ministers urged to extend lockdown benefit 'boost' 'Money is tight' - Living on benefits in lockdown Charities and anti-poverty campaigners are pleading with the government to keep the support in place, describing it as a lifeline for more than 5.5 million families who receive the standard universal credit allowance. Food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe told the BBC that the Â£20 increase ""has been a lifeline"" for millions of people who have needed to top up their income or rely on universal credit payments in order to get by. Sir Keir said the increase was a vital safety net for those who had lost their jobs, seen their working hours slashed or who were not eligible for the government's wage subsidy furlough scheme. ""If we don't give a helping hand to families through this pandemic, then we are going to slow our economic recovery as we come out it. ""We urge Boris Johnson to change course and give families certainty today that their incomes will be protected."" Analysis by chief political correspondent Adam Fleming Six billion pounds of the benefits bill - the difference between poverty or not for 1.2 million families, according to a think tank. The Â£1,040 a year increase to universal credit is a very emotive issue. There's even a battle over what to call it. To the government, its introduction was a one-off boost to cope with a crisis. For Labour, taking it away is a cut. Ministers would prefer we looked at the overall level of support they've provided for workers and businesses during the pandemic. The opposition say the Â£20 a week boost is a powerful symbol of the state's willingness to help. Even the act of debating it today is disputed. Labour say they've got the right occasionally to set the agenda in Parliament. Boris Johnson said his MPs risk abuse from campaigners and protestors if they engage. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested about 16 million people will be directly affected if the Â£20 is rolled back. It says 500,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 200,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will find themselves in even worse hardship. However, free market think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs has argued that ""across-the-board benefit increases are a wasteful use of taxpayers' money"" at a time when the government is borrowing ""a hair-raising amount of money"". Universal credit is a single payment replacing old benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits. You can claim universal credit if you are on a low income or are out of work. The standard allowance varies from around Â£340 to just under Â£600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. You may be eligible to receive more money on top of the standard allowance if, for example, you have children or a health condition. Speaking on behalf of the Northern Research Group, Conservative MP John Stevenson said the Â£1,000 increase had been ""a real life-saver for people throughout this pandemic"". ""To end it now would be devastating for the 6 million individuals and families who are already struggling to stay afloat,"" he added. While the vote is not binding, and will not lead to a change in policy, it will increase pressure on the government to keep the increase or come up with an alternative. Labour said the Conservatives' decision to abstain created ""unnecessary uncertainty"" but minister Nadhim Zahawi described the vote as ""a political stunt"". The government says it has strengthened the welfare system with an extra Â£7bn of funding during the pandemic while families struggling with food and household bills can get help through the Â£170m Winter Grant Scheme. Ministers also point to extra support for housing costs, through an increase in local housing allowance for those on housing benefits and hardship payments worth Â£670m next year for those unable to pay their council tax bills.

Scots TV and theatre star Andy Gray dies aged 61,"Andy Gray as Pete Galloway in BBC soap River City Tributes have been paid to the actor Andy Gray who has died at the age of 61. The Perth-born star was a well known face on TV and the stage for more than 40 years. Among his best known on-screen roles were ""Chancer"" in the 1980s comedy City Lights and more recently ""Pete Galloway"" in BBC soap River City. His River City co-star Gayle Telfer Stevens said Gray was a ""national treasure"". She added: ""Not only was he an exceptional actor and entertainer who brought so much joy to so many people, he was an extraordinary man. ""When you were in his presence you could feel it was of greatness. The most kind, clever, funny beyond measure, beautiful man."" Andy Gray, second from the left in the back row, starred as ""Chancer"" in the hit 1980s comedy show ""City Lights"" Andy Gray performing at the Edinburgh Festival in 2013 Steve Carson, director of BBC Scotland, said: ""We are deeply saddened by the news that one of Scotland's much loved comedy actors and close friend to many at BBC Scotland, Andy Gray has passed away. ""On screen and in person he could always make you laugh and was one of the kindest people to have around on any production. Our thoughts are with his family at this difficult time."" Andy Gray, pictured with Grant Stott, had been one of the stars at Edinburgh's King's Theatre pantomime for years Martin McCardie, executive producer at BBC Scotland Studios, added: ""When Andy joined River City in 2016 he had an extremely successful stage, TV and film career behind him, but the character of Pete Galloway turned out to be one of the most popular ever to pass through Shieldinch. ""Andy took ill in 2018 and he had to leave the show and he had a difficult time. His ongoing recovery was borne with humour and gratitude for what he had. He had unfinished business on River City and we were looking forward to welcoming him back to film with us before the end of the current series."" Andy Gray was genuinely one of the nicest people in the world of showbusiness. Whether you were an actor, or a journalist, or just someone who'd seen him in panto, he was always ready to have a chat. When he dropped out of his Fringe show in 2018, after being diagnosed with a rare form of leukaemia, he was inundated with good wishes, but said he wanted privacy to deal with his illness. He retreated to his home in Perthshire and took the time to recover. When he returned to the stage of the Kings Theatre in Edinburgh for their 2019 panto, it was an emotional milestone. Wrapped in his Batman dressing gown backstage (he was a huge fan with a shed full of film paraphernalia) he admitted it could be overwhelming. Sometimes the whoops and cheers of the audience at his arrival in the midst of a glitzy song and dance routine would go on for several minutes. His co-stars Grant Stott and Allan Stewart watched from the wings and said it had restored the balance of their long established trio. The Kings is one of the only theatres to have a tradition of a pantette - where the cast sit in the auditorium and watch the front of house staff performing the show. Andy wasn't spared the merciless send up, nor would he have wanted to. Daughter Claire was also in the show - as one of the three bears - and her baby daughter was in Andy's arms for the curtain call. But whether his actual family, or his panto family, or the generations of people who've seen him onstage or screen, it was a moment of hope, as well as joy, that someone who'd brought so much laughter and entertainment to Scotland was back. That's why his sudden death at 61 is such a cruel blow. He had been campaigning to keep the Kings afloat, and was involved in online performances. He and Allan Stewart had hoped to appear in one of the few surviving pantomimes in Milton Keynes but that too was cancelled. Friends and colleagues knew he'd been admitted to hospital in the last few days, and feared the worst. Those who simply knew him as someone who made them laugh, on stage or screen, are no less bereft. Tonight the world of Scottish entertainment is in mourning for a gifted comic actor, writer and genuinely nice man.

MP 'lost most of cervix after delaying smear',"This video can not be played Ms Davies-Jones wanted to highlight how ""vitally important"" smear tests are"" An MP has described how she had to have most of her cervix removed after putting off a smear test for several months. Pontypridd MP Alex Davies-Jones, 31, said she was invited for her first routine screening in December 2015 and ""like so many others, I put it off"".

Alex Davies-Jones became the Labour MP for Pontypridd in the 2019 General Election She wrote: ""I used all of the usual excuses that you may have heard before. ""I was simply too busy, I couldn't get an appointment and I had no symptoms or abnormalities that were worrying me."" Ms Davies-Jones wrote she thought the routine screening would ""just be five minutes of awkward conversation with the nurse at my local GP whilst taking my knickers off"".

Capitol security scare ahead of Biden inauguration,"Security is tight in Washington DC The Capitol complex in Washington DC was briefly locked down after a security alert, two days before Joe Biden is inaugurated as US president. Police say they acted out of an abundance of caution after witnesses reported smoke rising nearby. The fire was several blocks away. It came amid preparations for a rehearsal for Mr Biden's inauguration. Five people died after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, which is home to the US Congress, on 6 January. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed at the Capitol and around central Washington DC. There was no threat to the public, officials said after Monday's lockdown. Congress is currently in recess. One in, one out: How the White House changes hands All 50 US states on alert for armed protests Security is tight after the rioters overran the Capitol earlier this month. The National Mall - the landscaped park around the complex - has been closed, along with many major roads. Fences have been put up around the White House. The inauguration rehearsal scheduled for Monday has already been postponed once on security grounds. All 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC) are on alert for possible violent protests. The FBI has warned of possible armed marches by pro-Trump supporters across state capitols. Once he is sworn in, Mr Biden will issue executive orders to reverse President Trump's travel bans and re-join the Paris climate accord. The president-elect is also expected to focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border, and to issue mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will take the oath of office in front of the Capitol building, overlooking the National Mall. Normally a crowd of hundreds of thousands would be there to witness a significant moment in American national life. Inauguration:Â What to expect as Biden is sworn in However, between the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns, the size of the crowd is being severely restricted this year. The rehearsal for Wednesday's inauguration was disrupted Once sworn in, Mr Biden will give an inaugural address, setting the agenda for his term in office. The ceremonies include a poetry reading,external, the Pledge of Allegiance and a benediction. Lady Gaga will sing the national anthem, and there will be a musical performance by Jennifer Lopez. One prominent figure will be conspicuous by his absence: Mr Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration. This video can not be played Lady Gaga joined Joe Biden on the eve of the US presidential election On Monday, outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others.

Fishing firms protest over post-Brexit disruption,"This video can not be played Lorry drivers have been holding up the traffic in Westminster. Boris Johnson has pledged Â£23m to help businesses affected by Brexit delays amid protests by fishing firms. Demonstrations took place outside government departments in central London by exporters who are warning their livelihoods are under threat. Exports of fresh fish and seafood have been severely disrupted by new border controls since the UK's transition period ended earlier this month. The PM said firms would be compensated for delays that were not their fault. Industry associations have complained that extra paperwork has made it difficult to deliver fresh produce to mainland Europe before it goes off. They have warned that if the situation continues, jobs could soon be at risk. 'My Â£50,000 shellfish lorry was delayed for a day' Ministers accused of fishing compensation U-turn What does the deal mean for fishing? Pressed on what he would do in response, Mr Johnson said the government would step in to support firms which ""through no fault of their own have experienced bureaucratic delays, difficulties getting their goods through, where there is a genuine willing buyer on the other side of the channel"". ""There's a Â£23m compensation fund we've set up and we'll make sure they get help,"" he said. Details of the scheme are expected later this week. After a day of protests in central London, which saw 20 lorries drive up Whitehall, the Metropolitan Police said 14 people had been reported for Covid-related offences, but no arrests were made. Mark Moore, manager of the Dartmouth Crab Company, said his business and others were protesting to ""raise awareness"" of the impact of new border checks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live his company had faced delays of up to eight and a half hours when delivering produce into the European Union. He added that the situation was ""especially difficult"" for the shellfish sector, where goods were at risk of going off before reaching customers. ""It's not about the increased documentation per se,"" he said. ""We have taken that on board, and we ourselves - and I know many others - have had no issues with producing the actual paperwork. ""It's the volume required and the timeframe in which to produce it, which doesn't lend itself to live shellfish and fish generally."" John McManus, BBC News There are 24 lorries in total, overwhelmingly from seafood exporters in Scotland. Businesses taking part say the Brexit trade deal has left their industry high and dry. And although one haulier from Aberdeenshire I spoke to was keen to stress that their coordinated protest was peaceful, it is clear that they all feel that direct action is now necessary to make the government sit up and take notice. Good natured though their action was, it did for a time cause serious traffic congestion along Whitehall and Parliament Square. However, low levels of traffic perhaps caused by the Covid lockdown meant the roads around Whitehall didn't grind to a complete halt. At stake, they believe, is an industry, but also thousands of livelihoods. Exporters say they are backed by fishermen who are struggling to land their catches. And although the rural Scottish communities which are sustained by fishing might seem like a long way from the streets of SW1, the hauliers certainly made their presence felt this morning. Having left the EU's customs union and the single market, UK exports are subject to new customs and veterinary checks which have caused problems at the border. Some Scottish fishermen have been landing their catch in Denmark to avoid the ""bureaucratic system"" involved in exporting to Europe, according to Scotland's rural economy secretary. Last week, Boris Johnson told a committee of MPs that fishing firms impacted by disruption would be compensated for ""temporary frustrations"". But the BBC was told that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not know about the promise of compensation before it was made by Mr Johnson. Speaking to reporters, the prime minister said he understood the ""frustrations"" of the fishing industry, noting its plight had been ""exacerbated by the Covid pandemic"". ""Unfortunately, the demand in restaurants on the continent for UK fish has not been what it was before the pandemic, just because the restaurants have been closed for so long,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused ministers of trying to ""blame fishing communities"" for problems ""rather than accepting it's their failure to prepare"". ""The government has known there would be a problem with fishing and particularly the sale of fish into the EU for years,"" he told reporters. By Martyn Oates, BBC South West Political Editor Much media attention has been focussed on Scotland as this export crisis has unfolded. But exactly the same problem is rearing its head in the UK's other great fishing stronghold - at the other end of the UK in Devon and Cornwall. A virtual Who's Who of South West fishing leaders wrote to the environment secretary back in November warning that the new post-Brexit export requirements would have a ""seriously detrimental effect"" on the industry, claiming this ""could be the final straw for many businesses"". Here, too, many fish exports have now ground to a halt and others have encountered obstacles and long delays. And exporters have reacted angrily to the government's repeated insistence that the issues they've been experiencing over the last two weeks are just ""teething problems"".

Health minister denies vaccines being held back,"This video can not be played Education Minister Kirsty Williams said vaccinators were working 'flat out' Wales' health minister has denied Covid-19 vaccines are being held back. Vaughan Gething was reacting to First Minister Mark Drakeford's comments the supplyÂ had to last until FebruaryÂ to prevent ""vaccinators standing around with nothing to do"". In alater tweet,external, Mr Drakeford said ""nobody is holding back vaccines"",  but the Conservative ex-Welsh secretary said his comments were ""astonishing"". Mr Gething insists vaccines are being rolled out ""as quickly as possible"". After Mr Drakeford's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Welsh Government had said the reason for spacing out vaccine supply was to avoid wastage. Asked about those comments, Mr Gething said: ""We're rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as possible. ""As the first minister's clarified tonight, we're not holding the vaccine back."" Public Health Wales said 151,737 people have been vaccinated, after at least 327,000 doses were delivered. Mr Gething told BBC Wales Today: ""It's as quickly as we build our infrastructure to deliver, as quick as we're able to get the vaccines out to be delivered."" But former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Mr Drakeford's comments had been ""astonishing"". The Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales: ""I just find some of the excuses that have been made for why we are so behind in terms of vaccinating the over 80s - it just doesn't wash with our constituents I'm afraid ""When people in my constituency watch the television and they hear the first minister say 'this is not a sprint' when so many countries around the world are treating it exactly as that. ""The faster you roll out the vaccinations to the most vulnerable, ie the over 80s, the more lives that will be saved."" Of the 327,000 delivered vaccines, 280,000 are the Pfizer-BioNTech type that has to be stored at -70C. A total of 4.8% of the population has been vaccinated in Wales, the same as in Scotland. This compares with 6.2% in England and 6.6% in Northern Ireland. At the weekend the chairwoman of Wales' vaccination board Dr Gill Richardson, said the NHS was being supplied withas many vaccines as it could cope with. On Monday, Mr Drakeford told the Today programme the supply of the Pfizer vaccine had to last until February and was not being used all at once. ""There will be no point, and certainly it will be logistically very damaging, to try to use all of that in the first week and then to have all our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do for another month,"" he said. ""The sensible thing to do is to use the vaccine you've got over the period that you've got it for so that your system can absorb it, they can go on working."" This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? In a video he later posted on Twitter he said: ""Let me be completely clear, nobody is holding back vaccines. ""All our health boards are receiving doses of Pfizer as quickly as they can use it."" The British Medical Association (BMA) Wales tweeted it was ""extremely concerned"" about ""spacing out the Pfizer vaccine to make it last until the next delivery"". ""If Pfizer vaccines are available, second dose must be given to HCWs [health care workers] within the maximum 42-day timeline and all remaining vaccinations for staff must be accelerated,"" it said.

The NHS is vaccinating people in order of clinical risk, largely based on age groups from old to young. As the roll-out ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, thefirst pharmacy gave the Covid jab. The Welsh Government said on Monday it was ""on course"" to complete 70% of vaccinations for over 80s and care home residents by the weekend. It also confirmed that all ambulance staff had been offered the vaccine, and the ambulance service said so far more than 60% had had it. NHS given 'as many vaccines as it can cope with' Ambulance service still 'under extreme pressure' Nurseries 'teetering on the edge' during pandemic In a statement, a government spokesman said: ""The Pfizer vaccine comes in large packs, which cannot be split and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures - at -70C. There are only two centres in Wales where we can keep them at this temperature. ""Once removed from storage, the vaccine lasts five days. Every dose wasted is a vaccine which cannot be given to someone in Wales. ""We want to ensure a consistent supply of the vaccine to minimise wastage."" At a coronavirus briefing on Monday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams also said ministers were not holding back on supplies. ""We are distributing Pfizer in a careful way to ensure there is infrastructure in Wales to deliver it safely and most efficiently, avoiding wastage because it is such a precious resource,"" she said. But Paul Davies, Conservative group leader in the Senedd, said his inbox had been ""bombarded by people who are very, very angry"" about the pace of the roll-out. ""Suggesting that holding back the vaccine for a period of time so vaccinators aren't standing around doing nothing is absolutely preposterous,"" he said. We've heard from two senior government ministers this morning - one of them the first minister - and received different explanations of what the strategy is for vaccine roll-out. The first minister talked about having to make the Pfizer vaccine last until February, otherwise vaccinators would be standing around with nothing to do. His education minister today denied that Welsh Government was doing anything to delay the use of the Pfizer vaccine - she talked about the need to go faster and to build up infrastructure and minimise wastage. People in vulnerable groups keen to know when they'll be receiving their jab won't be reassured by the lack of a coherent message. Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth MS said: ""Wales appears now to be dramatically behind England in terms of vaccine roll-out, so to see the first minister being relaxed about the slow pace of the vaccine roll-out here is very, very frustrating. Why are we rationing here?"" UK government vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, when asked about the strategy in Wales, said his view for England was to use up supply and ensure it ""doesn't sit on a shelf or in a fridge"". There are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca. A third vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna -but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. There will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated where they live,about 250 GP practices across the country,externalwill be able to administer the jab by the end of January. Ms Williams said that there would be 45 mass vaccination centres delivering the Pfizer jab by the end of the week. LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Resources and programmes on BBC iPlayer to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown BBC BITESIZE:Help is at hand for your homeschooling needs As of Monday, theCardiff and Valehealth board said it had vaccinated more than 24,000 people, including nearly 19,000 health, social care and care home staff, nearly 600 care home residents and nearly 3,000 other people aged over 80. Cwm Taf Morgannwghealth board in south Wales said it had vaccinated nearly 17,000 people as of Friday, and aimed to give all 100,000 people in the top priority groups at least a first dose by mid-February. TheHywel Ddahealth board serving west Wales said on Monday it had given more than 18,000 vaccinations, including jabs to 42% of healthcare workers, 38% of care home staff, 25% of care home residents and just under 9% of people over 80. Powys Teaching health boardsaid letters should arrive by Tuesday to everyone aged over 80 inviting them to get a vaccination, with more than 7,000 people in the priority groups having received their first dose. TheSwansea Bayboard said it was ""on target"" to vaccinate all care home residents with a first dose by the end of January and that all over-80s would be offered a vaccine ""over the coming weeks"" In north Wales, theBetsi Cadwaladrboard said it aimed to vaccinate 90% of the priority groups by the end of January. In south east Wales, theAneurin Bevanboard's most recent update from 11 January said that in its 94 care homes for elderly people all residents had been vaccinated in 34 homes and all staff in 63.

BBC apologises for Phil Spector death headline,"In 2009, Spector was convicted of the 2003 murder of Hollywood actress Lana Clarkson The BBC has apologised for the original headline in its reporting of the death of the convicted murderer Phil Spector. The former music producer died on Saturday at the age of 81, while serving a prison sentence for the murder of Lana Clarkson in 2003. The first version on the breaking news story on the BBC News website carried the headline: ""Talented but flawed producer Phil Spector dies aged 81"". The BBC said the headline ""did not meet our editorial standards"". The text was quickly changed to: ""Pop producer jailed for murder dies at 81."" ""This was changed within minutes and we also deleted a tweet that had gone out automatically with the original headline,""a statement issued by the BBC read. ""We apologise for this error."" Murderer and music producer Spector dies at 81 Obituary: Phil Spector ""Our coverage of the story across BBC News has been clear that Phil Spector was convicted of the murder of Lana Clarkson and had a long history of violence and abuse,"" it continued. Spector was convicted of murdering Clarkson, an actress, in 2009. His death was confirmed by the California Department of Corrections and Rehabilitation. Reacting to the original version of the BBC's story, pop starLily Allen tweeted,external: ""Rolling eyes at all the journos deliberately downplaying Phil Spector being a murderer in their headlines, so everyone points this out while linking to their articles resulting in lots of clicks."" ""He murdered Lana Clarkson""posted Labour MP Apsana Begum,external. ""Unforgivable reporting."" ""How about 'Murderer, Phil Spector dies aged 81'?"" offered author and historian Hallie Rubenhold. The headline was also discussed on TV and radio programmes on Monday, including Loose Women and Radio 4's Woman's Hour, and promptedan article in the Guardian,external. The phrasing of the BBC's article - and others like it -  were ""a reflection of how a man's 'genius' is often viewed as more important than a woman's humanity,"" said columnist Arwa Mahdawi. Spector, who transformed pop with his ""wall of sound"" recordings, worked with The Beatles, The Righteous Brothers and Tina Turner. But after the commercial failure of Tina Turner's River Deep, Mountain High, he largely withdrew from public life, and entered a long decline, marked by erratic behaviour, heavy drinking, and a fondness for guns. His turbulent marriage to Ronettes singer Veronica Bennett, known as Ronnie Spector, ended in divorce. ""Unfortunately Phil was not able to live and function outside of the recording studio,"" she wrote after his death was announced. ""Darkness set in, many lives were damaged."" Singer Darlene Love, who sang on several songs Spector produced, said he ""changed the sound of rock 'n' roll"" but likened their relationship to ""a bad marriage"". ""The problem I have with Phil is that he wanted to control Darlene Love's talent,"" she told Variety. ""If he couldn't do that, he was going to do everything in his power to keep my talent from shining."" Weeks before Lana Clarkson was shot dead, Spector gave a rare interview to British broadsheet The Telegraph. ""I would say I'm probably relatively insane, to an extent,"" he told the paper, adding that he had ""devils inside that fight me"". Follow us onFacebook,externalor on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

'I'm stranded at Madrid Airport',"Lisbet Stone is stranded at Madrid Airport due to having an out-of-date coronavirus test result Passenger Lisbet Stone says she is stuck in Madrid Airport after airline officials said her coronavirus test result was out of date. From Monday, travellers arriving in the UK, whether by boat, train or plane,have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. The test must be taken in the three days before travelling. For those with connecting flights, the test must be 72 hours before your final departure point to England. Anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500. Mrs Stone originally travelled to Cuba in February 2020 to see family. The British Cuban dual national was unable to fly home to the UK when Cuba closed its borders in March. What are the new UK travel rules? Covid: Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? 'Urgent' aviation support plea over travel curbs The family say she had several previous flights cancelled before finally being able to leave this weekend. She hasn't been able to see her four children or her husband Trevor in 11 months. The government are understood to be speaking to Air Europa to try to get Mrs Stone home. Carriers have been told that they should permit stranded passengers to board and will not be fined for doing so. While Mrs Stone has been caught out by the new restrictions for incoming travellers, the first day of the new regulations appeared to go smoothly. Mrs Stone left Jose Marti International Airport in Havana, Cuba, on Sunday night to fly back to the UK via Madrid. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) She took a Covid test on Thursday to be guaranteed a result by Saturday. It was negative and Mrs Stone was able to board the plane from Cuba. However, on arrival at Madrid-Barajas Airport, Mrs Stone says she was stopped from boarding the next leg of her journey to London Gatwick by Air Europa staff, because her test had been taken more than 72 hours before the final flight. ""She's crying her eyes out,"" says Trevor Stone, her husband. ""I feel absolutely helpless. She doesn't have any Euros as she wasn't meant to stay in Spain. The authorities have given her no help whatsoever, we are just trying to understand what to do. ""She took her test 72 hours before the start of her journey, but had to take a connecting flight onwards. There would be no other way to do it, it is not physically possible."" In the meantime, Mr Stone says he has been home-schooling their four children on his own through the pandemic. Trevor Stone (left) has been caring for the couple's four children on his own for 11 months since Lisbet Stone was unable to leave Cuba ""We are just desperate to get her home - I'm so worried about her and after 11 months, she really wants to see her children,"" he added. ""We haven't done anything wrong, I don't know what to do or who to turn to."" A Department for Transport spokesman said: ""Passengers travelling to the UK must provide proof of a negative coronavirus test which meets the performance standards set out by the governmentin the guidance published on gov.uk,external. ""The type of test could include a PCR test or antigen test, including a lateral flow test. Anyone who cannot provide the necessary documentation may not be allowed to board their flight.""

'We got a lot of grief when our photo became a meme',"The picture that started it all. Kevin, Alex, Jamie and Connor ""We were going to Birmingham on a train. I think we'd started drinking quite early to be fair."" Remember nights out? It's what people used to do with their weekends before the pandemic. Kevin Rooney, Alex Lacey, Jamie Phillips and Connor Humpage from Birmingham and Coventry, had no idea their night out would still be trending two years later. A picture, taken by a stranger, has become a hugely popular meme in the last twelve months. The lads came in for a lot of stick, mostly for wearing skinny jeans or trousers - and people making assumptions about what sort of people they are. But the picture's latest resurfacing, where it wasadded to a sea-shanty trend, has seen the tide turn and the boys receive more positive comments online. At first, when Connor, 28, uploaded the photo to his Instagram, nothing out of the ordinary happened, until a few days later someone made a meme out of the picture. ""Basically it was just mocking skinny jeans,"" Connor tells Radio 1 Newsbeat. ""At first it was funny, but then it all got a bit carried away. We started getting a lot of grief for it. ""We were just getting loads of stick just for our outfits and it was getting personal. It's a good job we're quite thick skinned because at first it did get to us."" Allow Twitter content?

"Coroner calls for smart motorway review over deathsDavid Urpeth says smart motorways without a hard shoulder carry ""an ongoing risk of future deaths.""Sheffield & South Yorkshire","Alexandru Murgeanu (l) and Jason Mercer were killed in the crash on the M1 in South Yorkshire A coroner has called for a review of smart motorways after an inquest heard the deaths of two men on a stretch of the M1 could have been avoided. Jason Mercer, 44, and Alexandru Murgeanu, 22, died when Prezemyslaw Szuba crashed his lorry into their vehicles near Sheffield on 7 June 2019. Coroner David Urpeth said smart motorways without a hard shoulder carry ""an ongoing risk of future deaths"". Highways England said it was ""addressing many of the points raised"". Mr Urpeth recorded a verdict of unlawful killing at Sheffield Town Hall. He added he would be writing to Highways England and the transport secretary asking for a review. The inquest heard the deaths of the two men may have been avoided had there had been a hard shoulder. More stories from around Yorkshire On the stretch of the M1 where the crash took place, the hard shoulder has been replaced by an active lane. Szuba, 40, from Hull, wasjailed last year after admitting causing their deaths by careless driving. He was speaking from prison to the inquest. Prezemyslaw Szuba was jailed over the deaths Answering questions over the phone, Szuba told the hearing he accepted he was driving without paying proper attention. ""I have already accepted that at my trial,"" he said, but added: ""If there had been a hard shoulder on this bit of motorway, the collision would have been avoidable. ""I would have driven past these two cars as it would be safer and they would have been able to come home safely and I would be able to come back home."" Szuba said he had only three to five seconds to react, and asked if he would have avoided the crash had he been paying attention, he said: ""It's difficult to say after everything now."" Sgt Mark Brady, who oversees major collision investigations for South Yorkshire Police, told the hearing: ""Had there been a hard shoulder, had Jason and Alexandru pulled on to the hard shoulder, my opinion is that Mr Szuba would have driven clean past them."" But he accepted the primary cause of the crash was Szuba's inattention to the road. The crash happened after a collision between a Ford Focus driven by Mr Mercer, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, and a Ford Transit driven by Mr Murgeanu, who was living in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, but was originally from Romania. When Mr Mercer and Mr Murgeanu got out to exchange details they were hit by the lorry, and both died at the scene. Mr Mercer's wife Claire hascampaigned against smart motorwayssince her husband's death, and was at the hearing on Monday. Claire Mercer has campaigned against the use of smart motorways since her husband's death In a statement, Highways England said it was ""determined"" to do everything it could to make roads as safe as possible and was already addressing many of the points raised by the coroner ""as published in the Government's Smart Motorway Evidence Stocktake and Action Plan of March 2020"". ""We will carefully consider any further comments raised by the coroner once we receive the report,"" it added. Follow BBC Yorkshire onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

"Health minister denies vaccines being held backEarlier the first minister said he did not want vaccinators ""standing around with nothing to do"".Wales politicsComments","This video can not be played Education Minister Kirsty Williams said vaccinators were working 'flat out' Wales' health minister has denied Covid-19 vaccines are being held back. Vaughan Gething was reacting to First Minister Mark Drakeford's comments the supplyÂ had to last until FebruaryÂ to prevent ""vaccinators standing around with nothing to do"". In alater tweet,external, Mr Drakeford said ""nobody is holding back vaccines"",  but the Conservative ex-Welsh secretary said his comments were ""astonishing"". Mr Gething insists vaccines are being rolled out ""as quickly as possible"". After Mr Drakeford's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Welsh Government had said the reason for spacing out vaccine supply was to avoid wastage. Asked about those comments, Mr Gething said: ""We're rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as possible. ""As the first minister's clarified tonight, we're not holding the vaccine back."" Public Health Wales said 151,737 people have been vaccinated, after at least 327,000 doses were delivered. Mr Gething told BBC Wales Today: ""It's as quickly as we build our infrastructure to deliver, as quick as we're able to get the vaccines out to be delivered."" But former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Mr Drakeford's comments had been ""astonishing"". The Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales: ""I just find some of the excuses that have been made for why we are so behind in terms of vaccinating the over 80s - it just doesn't wash with our constituents I'm afraid ""When people in my constituency watch the television and they hear the first minister say 'this is not a sprint' when so many countries around the world are treating it exactly as that. ""The faster you roll out the vaccinations to the most vulnerable, ie the over 80s, the more lives that will be saved."" Of the 327,000 delivered vaccines, 280,000 are the Pfizer-BioNTech type that has to be stored at -70C. A total of 4.8% of the population has been vaccinated in Wales, the same as in Scotland. This compares with 6.2% in England and 6.6% in Northern Ireland. At the weekend the chairwoman of Wales' vaccination board Dr Gill Richardson, said the NHS was being supplied withas many vaccines as it could cope with. On Monday, Mr Drakeford told the Today programme the supply of the Pfizer vaccine had to last until February and was not being used all at once. ""There will be no point, and certainly it will be logistically very damaging, to try to use all of that in the first week and then to have all our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do for another month,"" he said. ""The sensible thing to do is to use the vaccine you've got over the period that you've got it for so that your system can absorb it, they can go on working."" This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? In a video he later posted on Twitter he said: ""Let me be completely clear, nobody is holding back vaccines. ""All our health boards are receiving doses of Pfizer as quickly as they can use it."" The British Medical Association (BMA) Wales tweeted it was ""extremely concerned"" about ""spacing out the Pfizer vaccine to make it last until the next delivery"". ""If Pfizer vaccines are available, second dose must be given to HCWs [health care workers] within the maximum 42-day timeline and all remaining vaccinations for staff must be accelerated,"" it said. The Welsh Government'svaccine strategy,externalpledges everyone will be offered a jab by autumn. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The NHS is vaccinating people in order of clinical risk, largely based on age groups from old to young. As the roll-out ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, thefirst pharmacy gave the Covid jab. The Welsh Government said on Monday it was ""on course"" to complete 70% of vaccinations for over 80s and care home residents by the weekend. It also confirmed that all ambulance staff had been offered the vaccine, and the ambulance service said so far more than 60% had had it. NHS given 'as many vaccines as it can cope with' Ambulance service still 'under extreme pressure' Nurseries 'teetering on the edge' during pandemic In a statement, a government spokesman said: ""The Pfizer vaccine comes in large packs, which cannot be split and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures - at -70C. There are only two centres in Wales where we can keep them at this temperature. ""Once removed from storage, the vaccine lasts five days. Every dose wasted is a vaccine which cannot be given to someone in Wales. ""We want to ensure a consistent supply of the vaccine to minimise wastage."" At a coronavirus briefing on Monday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams also said ministers were not holding back on supplies. ""We are distributing Pfizer in a careful way to ensure there is infrastructure in Wales to deliver it safely and most efficiently, avoiding wastage because it is such a precious resource,"" she said. But Paul Davies, Conservative group leader in the Senedd, said his inbox had been ""bombarded by people who are very, very angry"" about the pace of the roll-out. ""Suggesting that holding back the vaccine for a period of time so vaccinators aren't standing around doing nothing is absolutely preposterous,"" he said. We've heard from two senior government ministers this morning - one of them the first minister - and received different explanations of what the strategy is for vaccine roll-out. The first minister talked about having to make the Pfizer vaccine last until February, otherwise vaccinators would be standing around with nothing to do. His education minister today denied that Welsh Government was doing anything to delay the use of the Pfizer vaccine - she talked about the need to go faster and to build up infrastructure and minimise wastage. People in vulnerable groups keen to know when they'll be receiving their jab won't be reassured by the lack of a coherent message. Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth MS said: ""Wales appears now to be dramatically behind England in terms of vaccine roll-out, so to see the first minister being relaxed about the slow pace of the vaccine roll-out here is very, very frustrating. Why are we rationing here?"" UK government vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, when asked about the strategy in Wales, said his view for England was to use up supply and ensure it ""doesn't sit on a shelf or in a fridge"". There are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca. A third vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna -but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. There will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated where they live,about 250 GP practices across the country,externalwill be able to administer the jab by the end of January. Ms Williams said that there would be 45 mass vaccination centres delivering the Pfizer jab by the end of the week. LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Resources and programmes on BBC iPlayer to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown BBC BITESIZE:Help is at hand for your homeschooling needs As of Monday, theCardiff and Valehealth board said it had vaccinated more than 24,000 people, including nearly 19,000 health, social care and care home staff, nearly 600 care home residents and nearly 3,000 other people aged over 80. Cwm Taf Morgannwghealth board in south Wales said it had vaccinated nearly 17,000 people as of Friday, and aimed to give all 100,000 people in the top priority groups at least a first dose by mid-February. TheHywel Ddahealth board serving west Wales said on Monday it had given more than 18,000 vaccinations, including jabs to 42% of healthcare workers, 38% of care home staff, 25% of care home residents and just under 9% of people over 80. Powys Teaching health boardsaid letters should arrive by Tuesday to everyone aged over 80 inviting them to get a vaccination, with more than 7,000 people in the priority groups having received their first dose.

Four guilty of murdering boy stabbed 40 times,"Keelan Wilson was 15 when he was stabbed more than 40 times Four men have been found guilty of murdering a boy stabbed more than 40 times in a ""well-planned execution"". Keelan Wilson, 15, was fatally injured on Langley Road in Merry Hill, Wolverhampton, on 29 May, 2018. The four murderers acted ""like a pack of animals"" amid rising gang violence in the city, police said. Keelan's mother Kelly Ellitts said the convictions meant justice for her son, but added ""nothing would bring Keelan back"". It emerged a few days after the murder that when an ambulance was called for the wounded boy, his final words included ""tell my mum I love her"". The trial at Wolverhampton Crown Court heard how the night time attack - carried out by Brian Sasa and Nehemie Tampwo, each aged 20, along with Tyrique King and Zenay Pennant-Phillips, both 19 - was ""not in any way spontaneous"". Det Sgt Nick Barnes from the West Midlands force said Keelan had the ""single worst set of injuries"" he had seen on a victim in more than six years investigating homicide. Clockwise from top left: Zenay Pennant-Phillips, Brian Sasa, Tyrique King and Nehemie Tampwo There had been increasing acts of violence between opposing gangs leading up to the murder, including disorder earlier that day, police said. That included weapons being brandished in Wolverhampton city centre, and in another incident, Keelan and two others being shot at by a group of youngsters on bikes. No one was hurt. But later on, the court heard, the group of four killers ran towards Keelan as he sat in a taxi close to his home, then pulled open the rear door and ""set about him with weapons"", inflicting more than 40 knife wounds. This video can not be played Keelan Wilson's mother Kelly Ellitts 'hit the floor' when she saw he had been stabbed Michael Duck QC, prosecuting, said the killing ""was not in any way a spontaneous act of violence"". He said: ""This was a well-planned, targeted group attack by a number of youths armed with knives, and that was with the plan to execute another young man."" During the 13-week trial, jurors heard there was evidence to suggest the victim had ""become embroiled in gang culture"", with his killers believing he had switched factions. Det Sgt Barnes said it was ""difficult"" to pinpoint a motive ""because Keelan wasn't on the police radar particularly for any such activity"". 'Tell mum I love her' News and updates from the West Midlands Keelan was wounded just metres from his home, receiving 43 stab wounds in total, according to police. He had been driving with a friend - with whom he met up after the shooting incident - when their car broke down, which led to a taxi being called. A spokesperson for the Crown Prosecution Service said while Keelan was attacked on boarding the vehicle, his friend was ""left unscathed"" and fled, making it ""evident"" to authorities that ""Keelan was the only target"". The taxi driver sustained a minor cut. Ms Ellitts said she lived with the shock of her son's death daily. ""This isn't something that you think of every now and again, this is a daily thing that you have to live with. ""It's terrible my daughters won't know who he is."" On the day of Keelan's death, CCTV captured a scene from the Wolverhampton city centre disorder that police said was linked to gang activity Sasa, of Long Ley, Heath Town, Wolverhampton; King, of Chelwood Gardens, Wolverhampton; Tampwo of Fern Grove in Bletchley, Milton Keynes; and Pennant-Phillips, whose address cannot be published for legal reasons, had all denied murder. ""Keelan was a child who had his whole life ahead of him,"" Det Sgt Barnes said. The convictions, he added, came after a ""very difficult and long investigation,"" with more than 2,000 lines of inquiry having to be examined. Some lines of investigation had been met with a ""wall of silence,"" he said. Judge Michael Chambers said: ""It is an utter tragedy that a 15-year-old child lost his life at the hands of others who are barely older than he.""

Putin critic Alexei Navalny to be kept in custody,"This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities Russia's leading opposition figure has been arrested and detained for 30 days, after returning to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year. Alexei Navalny said a court ruling held inside a police station was a mockery and called for street protests. Dozens of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow police station where he was being held and shouted ""disgrace"" and ""Putin resign"". Mr Navalny was held soon after his flight from Germany arrived on Sunday. Russian prosecutors say he violated the parole terms of a suspended sentence for embezzlement. He says the charges are politically motivated. Last August, Mr Navalny, 44, was almost killed in a nerve agent attack, which he blamed personally on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life On Sunday, big crowds gathered at Moscow's Vnukovo airport to greet Mr Navalny's flight from Berlin - but in a last-minute decision the authorities re-routed the plane to another airport in the capital. A makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night. Dozens of people gathered outside the Khimki police station in freezing weather, demanding for Mr Navalny to be released Mr Navalny (centre) was later seen led away by officers from the police station The judge ordered Mr Navalny's detention until 15 February for violating his parole. He will have another hearing on 29 January to determine whether his suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years should be replaced with a jail term. Mr Navalny said his treatment was beyond a ""mockery of justice"" and described the hearing as ""lawlessness of the highest grade"". ""Don't be afraid. Take to the streets, not for me, but for yourselves, for your future,""he said in a video address (in Russian) from the police station.,external A crowd of about 200 Navalny supporters gathered outside the police station in freezing weather, demanding his immediate release. Mr Navalny was later seen led away by police to one of Moscow's prisons. His lawyer, Vadim Kobzev, said they would appeal against the ""illegal"" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. Meanwhile, more than 70 Navalny supporters and journalists were detained across Russia on Monday, according to the Monitoring group OVD-Info. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner and the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race, but was barred because of an embezzlement conviction that he says was politically motivated An outspoken blogger, he has millions of Russian followers on social media and managed to get some supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020 The US and European Union led calls for Mr Navalny to be freed, but stopped short of threatening any punitive action. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russian authorities were trying to silence their critics, while incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Kremlin's ""attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard"". France, Italy, Germany and the president of the European Commission were also among those calling for his release. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described Mr Navalny's arrest as ""appalling"". ""Rather than persecuting Mr Navalny, Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil,"" he said. As Mr Navalny gradually recovered after emergency medical treatment in Germany, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday, he made good on that pledge, boarding a flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. Alexei Navalny travelled to Moscow with his wife Yulia The plane was packed with journalists, including from the BBC. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for ""technical reasons"", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport, where thousands of Navalny supporters had gathered, to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. A number of people were detained by riot police. Liza Shuvalova, BBC News There had always been a feeling Flight DP936 from Berlin to Moscow with Alexei Navalny on board would not go according to plan. So when the captain announced that the plane would be diverted to a different airport, Mr Navalny shouted his apology to everyone on board, many of whom were journalists. After a ride in a bus from the plane to the airport, he told us he was not afraid and was very happy to return home. As he approached passport control with his wife Yulia, he said to the border control officer with a smile: ""You must have been waiting for me for a long time!"" And it was probably true. A few moments later, he was asked by policemen to accompany them or they would have to use ""force"". Mr Navalny wanted his lawyer Olga Mikhailova - who was on the same flight - to go with him. But at that point, she had already crossed the border and was not allowed back airside as Mr Navalny was led away. Russia's prison service said the opposition leader ""had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period"" related to his suspended sentence for embezzlement. Separately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Mr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of targeting him with spurious cases. Mr Navalny collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The flight was diverted to the city of Omsk, where he was admitted to hospital. He was airlifted to Germany in an induced coma. European experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War. Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Last month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years. Mr Navalny later said he hadduped an FSB agent into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation,which he recorded and posted online. The FSB said the recording was ""fake"". President Putin hasdismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groupsthat have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as ""a trick"". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services.

PM pressed to keep Â£20 benefit increase 'lifeline',"MPs have urged Boris Johnson to extend benefit increases worth Â£20 a week. A non-binding Labour motion calling for the universal credit top-up to be kept in place beyond 31 March passed by 278 votes to none after a Commons debate. Six Tory MPs defied party orders to abstain and voted with Labour, adding to the pressure on the PM on the issue. The prime minister said the government had provided Â£280bn worth of support during the pandemic but all measures would be kept under ""constant review"". The motion, which will not automatically lead to a change in policy, was put forward by Labour as a way to put additional pressure on the government to continue the increase, worth Â£1,000 a year. This video can not be played Carl, a roofer, describes going from ""not having enough to barely having enough"" on universal credit. Former Work and Pensions Secretary Stephen Crabb was among six Conservative MPs to rebel, along with Peter Aldous, Robert Halfon, Jason McCartney, Anne Marie Morris and Matthew Offord. Ahead of the vote, Mr Crabb told the BBC that although there were ""difficult pressures on the chancellor"" extending the increase for 12 months was ""the right thing to do"". BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there weredozens of Conservative MPswho were ""deeply uneasy"" about ending the Â£20 weekly increase to universal credit. She added that it was also understood the cabinet minister with responsibility for benefits, Therese Coffey, was arguing that the uplift should not be dropped in April. Benefit increase only 'temporary', says Raab Ministers urged to extend lockdown benefit 'boost' 'Money is tight' - Living on benefits in lockdown Charities and anti-poverty campaigners are pleading with the government to keep the support in place, describing it as a lifeline for more than 5.5 million families who receive the standard universal credit allowance. Food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe told the BBC that the Â£20 increase ""has been a lifeline"" for millions of people who have needed to top up their income or rely on universal credit payments in order to get by. Sir Keir said the increase was a vital safety net for those who had lost their jobs, seen their working hours slashed or who were not eligible for the government's wage subsidy furlough scheme. ""If we don't give a helping hand to families through this pandemic, then we are going to slow our economic recovery as we come out it. ""We urge Boris Johnson to change course and give families certainty today that their incomes will be protected."" Analysis by chief political correspondent Adam Fleming Six billion pounds of the benefits bill - the difference between poverty or not for 1.2 million families, according to a think tank. The Â£1,040 a year increase to universal credit is a very emotive issue. There's even a battle over what to call it. To the government, its introduction was a one-off boost to cope with a crisis. For Labour, taking it away is a cut. Ministers would prefer we looked at the overall level of support they've provided for workers and businesses during the pandemic. The opposition say the Â£20 a week boost is a powerful symbol of the state's willingness to help. Even the act of debating it today is disputed. Labour say they've got the right occasionally to set the agenda in Parliament. Boris Johnson said his MPs risk abuse from campaigners and protestors if they engage. The Joseph Rowntree Foundation has suggested about 16 million people will be directly affected if the Â£20 is rolled back. It says 500,000 more people will be driven into poverty, including 200,000 children, while a further 500,000 of those already in poverty will find themselves in even worse hardship. However, free market think tank the Institute for Economic Affairs has argued that ""across-the-board benefit increases are a wasteful use of taxpayers' money"" at a time when the government is borrowing ""a hair-raising amount of money"". Universal credit is a single payment replacing old benefits such as housing benefit and child tax credits. You can claim universal credit if you are on a low income or are out of work. The standard allowance varies from around Â£340 to just under Â£600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. You may be eligible to receive more money on top of the standard allowance if, for example, you have children or a health condition. Speaking on behalf of the Northern Research Group, Conservative MP John Stevenson said the Â£1,000 increase had been ""a real life-saver for people throughout this pandemic"". ""To end it now would be devastating for the 6 million individuals and families who are already struggling to stay afloat,"" he added. While the vote is not binding, and will not lead to a change in policy, it will increase pressure on the government to keep the increase or come up with an alternative. Labour said the Conservatives' decision to abstain created ""unnecessary uncertainty"" but minister Nadhim Zahawi described the vote as ""a political stunt"". The government says it has strengthened the welfare system with an extra Â£7bn of funding during the pandemic while families struggling with food and household bills can get help through the Â£170m Winter Grant Scheme. Ministers also point to extra support for housing costs, through an increase in local housing allowance for those on housing benefits and hardship payments worth Â£670m next year for those unable to pay their council tax bills.

LiveLiveMore in hospital than any time in pandemic - Hancock4 minutes ago,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says 37,475 people are in UK hospitals with the virus - the highest total yet Someone is being admitted to hospital with coronavirus every 30 seconds, Hancock adds A further 599 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test Four million vaccine doses have been delivered, the health secretary says He urges people not to stop following social distancing and other basic measures, saying ""don't blow it now"" Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace, says more than 37,000 cases have been detected in recent weeks using lateral flow testing Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, says there is increasing pressure on the NHS with around 15,000 admitted since Christmas Eve The health secretary says he is ""inspired"" by the ways people are helping one another in this ""great national effort"" Asked if people should feel confident about booking holidays, Matt Hancock says he will be going to Cornwall in the summer The world is on the brink of a ""catastrophic moral failure"" in the distribution of vaccines, warns the World Health Organisation Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for today - thanks for following. Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison, Gavin Stamp, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Julian Joyce, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. We are pausing our coronavirus live page for now, but weâll
be back on Tuesday morning. Hereâs a recap of todayâs main stories: Doctors giving Covid vaccinations say it has been ""challenging"" when deliveries of the jab arrived with only a few hours' notice. The centre has been set up at the JCB factory in Rocester, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire by several GP practices in Cheadle. The medics say they can get through about 900 jabs a day but Dr David Yates told the BBC they often get about 12 hours' notice of new stocks arriving. ""Yesterday we suddenly got told we had 900 vaccines, which is a whole other batch of the Pfizer ones,"" he said. ""I think by last night we had 170 people booked in ready with people frantically on the phones all day."" MPs have voted to extend the temporary Â£20 a week increase to universal credit introduced at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and due to stop at the start of April. The Labour motion backing an extension passed by 278 votes to none, but it is not binding. The government - which dismissed the vote as a stunt - ordered its MPs to abstain. Labour says ministers have missed an opportunity to give families certainty and help the economy. Read more here Tougher lockdown rules across Europe, the closure of air corridors, and uncertainty about travel now the UK has left the EU, have piled more pressure on the airline industry at the start of 2021. But EasyJet says bookings for this summer with its holidays arm are up 250% on last season, fuelling the airline industry's hopes of pent up demand for when lockdown restrictions ease. Its chief executive Johan Lundgren tells the BBC it offers confidence for the travel market post-coronavirus. ""We know that people want to go on holiday as soon as they can,"" he says, adding that May is currently the most popular month for holiday bookings. Earlier Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked if people can plan their holidays yet. He replied that he will go to Cornwall for a summer break, saying ""we have got a lot of work to do by then"". Read more here  A health chief says Covid-19 deniers are ""ridiculous"". Dr Lisa McNally, director of public health for Sandwell in the West Midlands, has also criticised people who are sceptical about the vaccines being used to fight the coronavirus. She says despite social media abuse, she will continue to tell people the truth about the seriousness of the pandemic, and how jabs are a ""safe and effective reaction"" to it. This video can not be played Covid-19: Sandwell health boss says deniers 'ridiculous' Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although it has been common to hear and see the impact on care
homes internationally throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, one country where such insight has been rare is China. Private care homes have been growing in popularity in China in
recent years, but there are some stigmas associated with the industry. In China, many view nursing homes as going against the
cultural concept of âfilial pietyâ. This is the belief that the young should
respect for and care for their elders, and so many believe the elderly should
live with their children, and not live in care homes. However, as cases of the virus grow in the northeast of the
country, the official broadcaster CCTV has offered viewers a rare insight into how Chinaâs elderly in these facilities are being protected. A journalist today has visited the Shijiazhuang Nursing Home.
Shijiazhuang is the Chinese city that has beenhardest hit by the virus in recent weeks. In a 30-minute livestream in which he is clad in hazmat suit and
visor, journalist Gu Junling introduces viewers to how the facilities are kept
safe, and shows viewers inside the care homeâs stockrooms, packed with ample
provisions for its residents. Many of the residents seem happy to speak to the journalist and talk
about how they are healthy, and happy. Masks are mandatory for both residents
and staff, even in the areas outside on-site. However, far from being kept
under house arrest, residents are shown to have sufficient space to go outside,
use computers and games rooms. Many of us are desperately hoping coronavirus vaccines will soon transport us back to our pre-Covid lives. But many scientists are warning that their arrival probably won't mean throwing our face masks in the bin anytime soon. Take a lookat our explainer here, from our visual journalism team, for more on when we might be back to any kind of normality. As we've heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the latest coronavirus statistics at today's Downing Street press briefing. The number of people in hospital with the virus is at its highest level yet - at 37,435 - he says. It comes as the daily case numbers in the UK have begun to fall. There were another 37,535 positive cases reported and a further 599 people died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. However, figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Cases of coronavirus have fallen by almost a quarter across the UK in the last week, showing that the current lockdown is having an effect. But hospital admissions are still rising. Ten hospital trusts across England have reported having no spare critical care beds - despite extra capacity being added. The BBC's Clive Myrie has been to the Royal London Hospital and spent time with staff struggling to cope, as well as one family experiencing the grief this pandemic is causing. There are some upsetting scenes in his report. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Don't end up like us, please' The world is on the brink of a ""catastrophic moral failure"" in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned. Global health leaders say at least 49 richer countries have given 39 million doses of vaccine. But just 25 people have been vaccinated in one poorer country. The WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for equitable distribution of the vaccine. ""The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries,"" he told the WHO's executive board meeting. He says it's not right that younger, healthier adults in rich countries are vaccinated before health workers and older people in poorer countries. The UK has helped to raise one billion dollars, for global vaccine sharing fund Covax, through match-funding other donors, the government announced. This, combined with Â£548 million of UK aid, will help distribute one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year, officials said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press briefing: ""I absolutely agree with Dr Tedros on the importance of a global rollout and we in the UK can be proud of what we are doing to support that happening financially."" Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Remember at the start of the pandemic the prime minister and the chancellor said they would ""put their arms around"" everyone at a time of genuine emergency. Even then it was a political promise that seemed unlikely to be kept. But as the health nightmare of Covid-19 unfolded, the country's doors closed and the economy took a thumping, ministers presided over a massive and very expensive expansion of the state. That included raising the amount of universal credit, the benefit that's paid to about six million people on low incomes or out of work, by Â£20 a week. With the basic level of the benefit starting at about Â£340 a month for single people under 25, that money has made a real difference. As one recipient, Carl Hackshaw from Croydon, told me on Monday, that increase meant that he's gone from""having to go without to having barely enough"". The looming political problem for the government is that the Â£20 top-up is due to stop at the end of March. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'Don't blow it now, we're on the route out' As we've just heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the public: ""Don't blow it now. We are on the route out"". Watch his remarks at today's Downing Street press briefing above. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The
Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million
people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to
start with â the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have
now been vaccinated. In
some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in
England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s
in for vaccination. The
progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination
rates globally. Challenges
remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the
Pfizer-BioNTech will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have
an impact. While
the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UKâs
supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and it will
mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers
are confident the mid-February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine
will not be affected â there is already enough
vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is
such nervousness about supply chains.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock led this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. Here are some of the key points from the briefing.  It is difficult to know when schools can reopen, Dr Susan Hopkins says. ""We monitor data on a daily basis and review it looking at when and what we think might be able to happen next,"" says the NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser. ""We've always said schools should be the last to close and the first to open, but giving a defined date on that is very difficult until we see what happens over the next few weeks,"" she says. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said
that some areas have had a very high uptake in the vaccine for the over-80s and
care homes. This is why those areas are now
ready to offer vaccinations to over-70s. Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim
Zahawi pointed to some of those areas this morning - including 90% of over-80s
in Yateley receiving their first dose and 89% in Cheltenham. However, we canât give you a full
picture of which areas will see this expansion because the government has
not yet released localised data on vaccinations to the public, despite
ministers referring to the statistics throughout the day. There are certainly regional
variations for the vaccinations for the over-80s. The latest figures broken down by
age and region, up to 10 January, showed that 46% of the over-80s in the North
East and Yorkshire had been vaccinated. This is compared to 29% of people
in the East of England. Gareth Iacobucci from the British Medical Journal says doctors face making ""unimaginable decisions"" about who to treat, given the strain on hospitals which - he says - are basically full up. He asks the health secretary whether the law will be changed to prevent doctors and other NHS staff from being subject of legal actions and potentially being sued for unlawful killing if they are forced to prioritise some patients over others. Mr Hancock says this is a serious concern of his, and notes a letter he received on the issue on Sunday. But at the moment he says the NHS has not been overwhelmed yet and doctors do not have to make those kind of decisions, and he hopes they will not have to. Changing the law is not necessary at the moment, he says, while stressing the situation will be kept under review. Matt Hancock says he is going to Cornwall for his summer holidays and says: ""I think we are going to have a great British summer."" He adds: ""We have got a lot of work to do by then but we have got a line of sight to vaccinating everyone by September and anything beyond that would be a bonus."" Earlier, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that restrictions could gradually begin to be eased from March as immunity starts to take effect in the groups vaccinated by mid-February. Hugo Gye from the i asks why there are fewer vaccines delivered at weekends and asks what the government is doing to provide a seven day service. The health secretary says: ""The vaccination programme is absolutely delivering a full seven day service, and, as you well know, we are prepared to go 24/7."" He adds that he ""wouldn't read too much into an individual day's data...over a week you will see it going up and going up fast."" Supply is the rate limiting factor, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Capitol security scare ahead of Biden inaugurationThe city is on edge after the riots at the Congress building in which five people died.,"Security is tight in Washington DC The Capitol complex in Washington DC was briefly locked down after a security alert, two days before Joe Biden is inaugurated as US president. Police say they acted out of an abundance of caution after witnesses reported smoke rising nearby. The fire was several blocks away. It came amid preparations for a rehearsal for Mr Biden's inauguration. Five people died after a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol, which is home to the US Congress, on 6 January. Thousands of National Guard reserve soldiers have been deployed at the Capitol and around central Washington DC. There was no threat to the public, officials said after Monday's lockdown. Congress is currently in recess. One in, one out: How the White House changes hands All 50 US states on alert for armed protests Security is tight after the rioters overran the Capitol earlier this month. The National Mall - the landscaped park around the complex - has been closed, along with many major roads. Fences have been put up around the White House. The inauguration rehearsal scheduled for Monday has already been postponed once on security grounds. All 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC) are on alert for possible violent protests. The FBI has warned of possible armed marches by pro-Trump supporters across state capitols. Once he is sworn in, Mr Biden will issue executive orders to reverse President Trump's travel bans and re-join the Paris climate accord. The president-elect is also expected to focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border, and to issue mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. Mr Biden and Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris will take the oath of office in front of the Capitol building, overlooking the National Mall. Normally a crowd of hundreds of thousands would be there to witness a significant moment in American national life. Inauguration:Â What to expect as Biden is sworn in However, between the coronavirus pandemic and security concerns, the size of the crowd is being severely restricted this year. The rehearsal for Wednesday's inauguration was disrupted Once sworn in, Mr Biden will give an inaugural address, setting the agenda for his term in office. The ceremonies include a poetry reading,external, the Pledge of Allegiance and a benediction. Lady Gaga will sing the national anthem, and there will be a musical performance by Jennifer Lopez. One prominent figure will be conspicuous by his absence: Mr Trump has said he will not attend the inauguration. This video can not be played Lady Gaga joined Joe Biden on the eve of the US presidential election On Monday, outgoing First Lady Melania Trump released a farewell message asking Americans to ""lead by example"" in caring for others.

Fishing firms protest over post-Brexit disruptionBoris Johnson promises Â£23m in compensation for exporters which have lost orders due to delays.UK PoliticsComments,"This video can not be played Lorry drivers have been holding up the traffic in Westminster. Boris Johnson has pledged Â£23m to help businesses affected by Brexit delays amid protests by fishing firms. Demonstrations took place outside government departments in central London by exporters who are warning their livelihoods are under threat. Exports of fresh fish and seafood have been severely disrupted by new border controls since the UK's transition period ended earlier this month. The PM said firms would be compensated for delays that were not their fault. Industry associations have complained that extra paperwork has made it difficult to deliver fresh produce to mainland Europe before it goes off. They have warned that if the situation continues, jobs could soon be at risk. 'My Â£50,000 shellfish lorry was delayed for a day' Ministers accused of fishing compensation U-turn What does the deal mean for fishing? Pressed on what he would do in response, Mr Johnson said the government would step in to support firms which ""through no fault of their own have experienced bureaucratic delays, difficulties getting their goods through, where there is a genuine willing buyer on the other side of the channel"". ""There's a Â£23m compensation fund we've set up and we'll make sure they get help,"" he said. Details of the scheme are expected later this week. After a day of protests in central London, which saw 20 lorries drive up Whitehall, the Metropolitan Police said 14 people had been reported for Covid-related offences, but no arrests were made. Mark Moore, manager of the Dartmouth Crab Company, said his business and others were protesting to ""raise awareness"" of the impact of new border checks. He told BBC Radio 5 Live his company had faced delays of up to eight and a half hours when delivering produce into the European Union. He added that the situation was ""especially difficult"" for the shellfish sector, where goods were at risk of going off before reaching customers. ""It's not about the increased documentation per se,"" he said. ""We have taken that on board, and we ourselves - and I know many others - have had no issues with producing the actual paperwork. ""It's the volume required and the timeframe in which to produce it, which doesn't lend itself to live shellfish and fish generally."" John McManus, BBC News There are 24 lorries in total, overwhelmingly from seafood exporters in Scotland. Businesses taking part say the Brexit trade deal has left their industry high and dry. And although one haulier from Aberdeenshire I spoke to was keen to stress that their coordinated protest was peaceful, it is clear that they all feel that direct action is now necessary to make the government sit up and take notice. Good natured though their action was, it did for a time cause serious traffic congestion along Whitehall and Parliament Square. However, low levels of traffic perhaps caused by the Covid lockdown meant the roads around Whitehall didn't grind to a complete halt. At stake, they believe, is an industry, but also thousands of livelihoods. Exporters say they are backed by fishermen who are struggling to land their catches. And although the rural Scottish communities which are sustained by fishing might seem like a long way from the streets of SW1, the hauliers certainly made their presence felt this morning. Having left the EU's customs union and the single market, UK exports are subject to new customs and veterinary checks which have caused problems at the border. Some Scottish fishermen have been landing their catch in Denmark to avoid the ""bureaucratic system"" involved in exporting to Europe, according to Scotland's rural economy secretary. Last week, Boris Johnson told a committee of MPs that fishing firms impacted by disruption would be compensated for ""temporary frustrations"". But the BBC was told that the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) did not know about the promise of compensation before it was made by Mr Johnson. Speaking to reporters, the prime minister said he understood the ""frustrations"" of the fishing industry, noting its plight had been ""exacerbated by the Covid pandemic"". ""Unfortunately, the demand in restaurants on the continent for UK fish has not been what it was before the pandemic, just because the restaurants have been closed for so long,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused ministers of trying to ""blame fishing communities"" for problems ""rather than accepting it's their failure to prepare"". ""The government has known there would be a problem with fishing and particularly the sale of fish into the EU for years,"" he told reporters. By Martyn Oates, BBC South West Political Editor Much media attention has been focussed on Scotland as this export crisis has unfolded. But exactly the same problem is rearing its head in the UK's other great fishing stronghold - at the other end of the UK in Devon and Cornwall. A virtual Who's Who of South West fishing leaders wrote to the environment secretary back in November warning that the new post-Brexit export requirements would have a ""seriously detrimental effect"" on the industry, claiming this ""could be the final straw for many businesses"". Here, too, many fish exports have now ground to a halt and others have encountered obstacles and long delays. And exporters have reacted angrily to the government's repeated insistence that the issues they've been experiencing over the last two weeks are just ""teething problems"".

We are pausing our coronavirus live page for now, but weâll
be back on Tuesday morning. Hereâs a recap of todayâs main stories: Doctors giving Covid vaccinations say it has been ""challenging"" when deliveries of the jab arrived with only a few hours' notice. The centre has been set up at the JCB factory in Rocester, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire by several GP practices in Cheadle. The medics say they can get through about 900 jabs a day but Dr David Yates told the BBC they often get about 12 hours' notice of new stocks arriving. ""Yesterday we suddenly got told we had 900 vaccines, which is a whole other batch of the Pfizer ones,"" he said. ""I think by last night we had 170 people booked in ready with people frantically on the phones all day."" MPs have voted to extend the temporary Â£20 a week increase to universal credit introduced at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and due to stop at the start of April. The Labour motion backing an extension passed by 278 votes to none, but it is not binding. The government - which dismissed the vote as a stunt - ordered its MPs to abstain. Labour says ministers have missed an opportunity to give families certainty and help the economy. Read more here Tougher lockdown rules across Europe, the closure of air corridors, and uncertainty about travel now the UK has left the EU, have piled more pressure on the airline industry at the start of 2021. But EasyJet says bookings for this summer with its holidays arm are up 250% on last season, fuelling the airline industry's hopes of pent up demand for when lockdown restrictions ease. Its chief executive Johan Lundgren tells the BBC it offers confidence for the travel market post-coronavirus. ""We know that people want to go on holiday as soon as they can,"" he says, adding that May is currently the most popular month for holiday bookings. Earlier Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked if people can plan their holidays yet. He replied that he will go to Cornwall for a summer break, saying ""we have got a lot of work to do by then"". Read more here  A health chief says Covid-19 deniers are ""ridiculous"". Dr Lisa McNally, director of public health for Sandwell in the West Midlands, has also criticised people who are sceptical about the vaccines being used to fight the coronavirus. She says despite social media abuse, she will continue to tell people the truth about the seriousness of the pandemic, and how jabs are a ""safe and effective reaction"" to it. This video can not be played Covid-19: Sandwell health boss says deniers 'ridiculous' Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although it has been common to hear and see the impact on care
homes internationally throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, one country where such insight has been rare is China. Private care homes have been growing in popularity in China in
recent years, but there are some stigmas associated with the industry. In China, many view nursing homes as going against the
cultural concept of âfilial pietyâ. This is the belief that the young should
respect for and care for their elders, and so many believe the elderly should
live with their children, and not live in care homes. However, as cases of the virus grow in the northeast of the
country, the official broadcaster CCTV has offered viewers a rare insight into how Chinaâs elderly in these facilities are being protected. A journalist today has visited the Shijiazhuang Nursing Home.
Shijiazhuang is the Chinese city that has beenhardest hit by the virus in recent weeks. In a 30-minute livestream in which he is clad in hazmat suit and
visor, journalist Gu Junling introduces viewers to how the facilities are kept
safe, and shows viewers inside the care homeâs stockrooms, packed with ample
provisions for its residents. Many of the residents seem happy to speak to the journalist and talk
about how they are healthy, and happy. Masks are mandatory for both residents
and staff, even in the areas outside on-site. However, far from being kept
under house arrest, residents are shown to have sufficient space to go outside,
use computers and games rooms. Many of us are desperately hoping coronavirus vaccines will soon transport us back to our pre-Covid lives. But many scientists are warning that their arrival probably won't mean throwing our face masks in the bin anytime soon. Take a lookat our explainer here, from our visual journalism team, for more on when we might be back to any kind of normality. As we've heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the latest coronavirus statistics at today's Downing Street press briefing. The number of people in hospital with the virus is at its highest level yet - at 37,435 - he says. It comes as the daily case numbers in the UK have begun to fall. There were another 37,535 positive cases reported and a further 599 people died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. However, figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Cases of coronavirus have fallen by almost a quarter across the UK in the last week, showing that the current lockdown is having an effect. But hospital admissions are still rising. Ten hospital trusts across England have reported having no spare critical care beds - despite extra capacity being added. The BBC's Clive Myrie has been to the Royal London Hospital and spent time with staff struggling to cope, as well as one family experiencing the grief this pandemic is causing. There are some upsetting scenes in his report. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Don't end up like us, please' The world is on the brink of a ""catastrophic moral failure"" in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned. Global health leaders say at least 49 richer countries have given 39 million doses of vaccine. But just 25 people have been vaccinated in one poorer country. The WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for equitable distribution of the vaccine. ""The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries,"" he told the WHO's executive board meeting. He says it's not right that younger, healthier adults in rich countries are vaccinated before health workers and older people in poorer countries. The UK has helped to raise one billion dollars, for global vaccine sharing fund Covax, through match-funding other donors, the government announced. This, combined with Â£548 million of UK aid, will help distribute one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year, officials said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press briefing: ""I absolutely agree with Dr Tedros on the importance of a global rollout and we in the UK can be proud of what we are doing to support that happening financially."" Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Remember at the start of the pandemic the prime minister and the chancellor said they would ""put their arms around"" everyone at a time of genuine emergency. Even then it was a political promise that seemed unlikely to be kept. But as the health nightmare of Covid-19 unfolded, the country's doors closed and the economy took a thumping, ministers presided over a massive and very expensive expansion of the state. That included raising the amount of universal credit, the benefit that's paid to about six million people on low incomes or out of work, by Â£20 a week. With the basic level of the benefit starting at about Â£340 a month for single people under 25, that money has made a real difference. As one recipient, Carl Hackshaw from Croydon, told me on Monday, that increase meant that he's gone from""having to go without to having barely enough"". The looming political problem for the government is that the Â£20 top-up is due to stop at the end of March. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'Don't blow it now, we're on the route out' As we've just heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the public: ""Don't blow it now. We are on the route out"". Watch his remarks at today's Downing Street press briefing above. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The
Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million
people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to
start with â the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have
now been vaccinated. In
some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in
England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s
in for vaccination. The
progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination
rates globally. Challenges
remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the
Pfizer-BioNTech will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have
an impact. While
the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UKâs
supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and it will
mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers
are confident the mid-February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine
will not be affected â there is already enough
vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is
such nervousness about supply chains.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock led this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. Here are some of the key points from the briefing.  It is difficult to know when schools can reopen, Dr Susan Hopkins says. ""We monitor data on a daily basis and review it looking at when and what we think might be able to happen next,"" says the NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser. ""We've always said schools should be the last to close and the first to open, but giving a defined date on that is very difficult until we see what happens over the next few weeks,"" she says. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said
that some areas have had a very high uptake in the vaccine for the over-80s and
care homes. This is why those areas are now
ready to offer vaccinations to over-70s. Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim
Zahawi pointed to some of those areas this morning - including 90% of over-80s
in Yateley receiving their first dose and 89% in Cheltenham. However, we canât give you a full
picture of which areas will see this expansion because the government has
not yet released localised data on vaccinations to the public, despite
ministers referring to the statistics throughout the day. There are certainly regional
variations for the vaccinations for the over-80s. The latest figures broken down by
age and region, up to 10 January, showed that 46% of the over-80s in the North
East and Yorkshire had been vaccinated. This is compared to 29% of people
in the East of England. Gareth Iacobucci from the British Medical Journal says doctors face making ""unimaginable decisions"" about who to treat, given the strain on hospitals which - he says - are basically full up. He asks the health secretary whether the law will be changed to prevent doctors and other NHS staff from being subject of legal actions and potentially being sued for unlawful killing if they are forced to prioritise some patients over others. Mr Hancock says this is a serious concern of his, and notes a letter he received on the issue on Sunday. But at the moment he says the NHS has not been overwhelmed yet and doctors do not have to make those kind of decisions, and he hopes they will not have to. Changing the law is not necessary at the moment, he says, while stressing the situation will be kept under review. Matt Hancock says he is going to Cornwall for his summer holidays and says: ""I think we are going to have a great British summer."" He adds: ""We have got a lot of work to do by then but we have got a line of sight to vaccinating everyone by September and anything beyond that would be a bonus."" Earlier, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that restrictions could gradually begin to be eased from March as immunity starts to take effect in the groups vaccinated by mid-February. Hugo Gye from the i asks why there are fewer vaccines delivered at weekends and asks what the government is doing to provide a seven day service. The health secretary says: ""The vaccination programme is absolutely delivering a full seven day service, and, as you well know, we are prepared to go 24/7."" He adds that he ""wouldn't read too much into an individual day's data...over a week you will see it going up and going up fast."" Supply is the rate limiting factor, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Fishing firms protest over post-Brexit disruptionBoris Johnson promises Â£23m in compensation for exporters which have lost orders due to delays.,"This video can not be played Lorry drivers have been holding up the traffic in Westminster. Boris Johnson has pledged Â£23m to help businesses affected by Brexit delays amid protests by fishing firms. Demonstrations took place outside government departments in central London by exporters who are warning their livelihoods are under threat. Exports of fresh fish and seafood have been severely disrupted by new border controls since the UK's transition period ended earlier this month. The PM said firms would be compensated for delays that were not their fault. Industry associations have complained that extra paperwork has made it difficult to deliver fresh produce to mainland Europe before it goes off. They have warned that if the situation continues, jobs could soon be at risk. 'My Â£50,000 shellfish lorry was delayed for a day' Ministers accused of fishing compensation U-turn What does the deal mean for fishing?

The UK has helped to raise one billion dollars, for global vaccine sharing fund Covax, through match-funding other donors, the government announced. This, combined with Â£548 million of UK aid, will help distribute one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year, officials said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press briefing: ""I absolutely agree with Dr Tedros on the importance of a global rollout and we in the UK can be proud of what we are doing to support that happening financially."" Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Remember at the start of the pandemic the prime minister and the chancellor said they would ""put their arms around"" everyone at a time of genuine emergency. Even then it was a political promise that seemed unlikely to be kept. But as the health nightmare of Covid-19 unfolded, the country's doors closed and the economy took a thumping, ministers presided over a massive and very expensive expansion of the state. That included raising the amount of universal credit, the benefit that's paid to about six million people on low incomes or out of work, by Â£20 a week. With the basic level of the benefit starting at about Â£340 a month for single people under 25, that money has made a real difference. As one recipient, Carl Hackshaw from Croydon, told me on Monday, that increase meant that he's gone from""having to go without to having barely enough"". The looming political problem for the government is that the Â£20 top-up is due to stop at the end of March. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'Don't blow it now, we're on the route out' As we've just heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the public: ""Don't blow it now. We are on the route out"". Watch his remarks at today's Downing Street press briefing above. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The
Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million
people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to
start with â the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have
now been vaccinated. In
some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in
England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s
in for vaccination. The
progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination
rates globally. Challenges
remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the
Pfizer-BioNTech will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have
an impact. While
the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UKâs
supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and it will
mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers
are confident the mid-February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine
will not be affected â there is already enough
vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is
such nervousness about supply chains.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock led this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. Here are some of the key points from the briefing.  It is difficult to know when schools can reopen, Dr Susan Hopkins says. ""We monitor data on a daily basis and review it looking at when and what we think might be able to happen next,"" says the NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser. ""We've always said schools should be the last to close and the first to open, but giving a defined date on that is very difficult until we see what happens over the next few weeks,"" she says. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said
that some areas have had a very high uptake in the vaccine for the over-80s and
care homes. This is why those areas are now
ready to offer vaccinations to over-70s. Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim
Zahawi pointed to some of those areas this morning - including 90% of over-80s
in Yateley receiving their first dose and 89% in Cheltenham. However, we canât give you a full
picture of which areas will see this expansion because the government has
not yet released localised data on vaccinations to the public, despite
ministers referring to the statistics throughout the day. There are certainly regional
variations for the vaccinations for the over-80s. The latest figures broken down by
age and region, up to 10 January, showed that 46% of the over-80s in the North
East and Yorkshire had been vaccinated. This is compared to 29% of people
in the East of England. Gareth Iacobucci from the British Medical Journal says doctors face making ""unimaginable decisions"" about who to treat, given the strain on hospitals which - he says - are basically full up. He asks the health secretary whether the law will be changed to prevent doctors and other NHS staff from being subject of legal actions and potentially being sued for unlawful killing if they are forced to prioritise some patients over others. Mr Hancock says this is a serious concern of his, and notes a letter he received on the issue on Sunday. But at the moment he says the NHS has not been overwhelmed yet and doctors do not have to make those kind of decisions, and he hopes they will not have to. Changing the law is not necessary at the moment, he says, while stressing the situation will be kept under review. Matt Hancock says he is going to Cornwall for his summer holidays and says: ""I think we are going to have a great British summer."" He adds: ""We have got a lot of work to do by then but we have got a line of sight to vaccinating everyone by September and anything beyond that would be a bonus."" Earlier, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that restrictions could gradually begin to be eased from March as immunity starts to take effect in the groups vaccinated by mid-February. Hugo Gye from the i asks why there are fewer vaccines delivered at weekends and asks what the government is doing to provide a seven day service. The health secretary says: ""The vaccination programme is absolutely delivering a full seven day service, and, as you well know, we are prepared to go 24/7."" He adds that he ""wouldn't read too much into an individual day's data...over a week you will see it going up and going up fast."" Supply is the rate limiting factor, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Putin critic Alexei Navalny to be kept in custodyIt follows his dramatic return to Russia, five months after a nerve agent attack almost killed him.Europe","This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities Russia's leading opposition figure has been arrested and detained for 30 days, after returning to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year. Alexei Navalny said a court ruling held inside a police station was a mockery and called for street protests. Dozens of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow police station where he was being held and shouted ""disgrace"" and ""Putin resign"". Mr Navalny was held soon after his flight from Germany arrived on Sunday. Russian prosecutors say he violated the parole terms of a suspended sentence for embezzlement. He says the charges are politically motivated. Last August, Mr Navalny, 44, was almost killed in a nerve agent attack, which he blamed personally on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life On Sunday, big crowds gathered at Moscow's Vnukovo airport to greet Mr Navalny's flight from Berlin - but in a last-minute decision the authorities re-routed the plane to another airport in the capital. A makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night. Dozens of people gathered outside the Khimki police station in freezing weather, demanding for Mr Navalny to be released Mr Navalny (centre) was later seen led away by officers from the police station The judge ordered Mr Navalny's detention until 15 February for violating his parole. He will have another hearing on 29 January to determine whether his suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years should be replaced with a jail term. Mr Navalny said his treatment was beyond a ""mockery of justice"" and described the hearing as ""lawlessness of the highest grade"". ""Don't be afraid. Take to the streets, not for me, but for yourselves, for your future,""he said in a video address (in Russian) from the police station.,external A crowd of about 200 Navalny supporters gathered outside the police station in freezing weather, demanding his immediate release. Mr Navalny was later seen led away by police to one of Moscow's prisons. His lawyer, Vadim Kobzev, said they would appeal against the ""illegal"" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. Meanwhile, more than 70 Navalny supporters and journalists were detained across Russia on Monday, according to the Monitoring group OVD-Info. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner and the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race, but was barred because of an embezzlement conviction that he says was politically motivated An outspoken blogger, he has millions of Russian followers on social media and managed to get some supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020 The US and European Union led calls for Mr Navalny to be freed, but stopped short of threatening any punitive action. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russian authorities were trying to silence their critics, while incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Kremlin's ""attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard"". France, Italy, Germany and the president of the European Commission were also among those calling for his release. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described Mr Navalny's arrest as ""appalling"". ""Rather than persecuting Mr Navalny, Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil,"" he said. As Mr Navalny gradually recovered after emergency medical treatment in Germany, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday, he made good on that pledge, boarding a flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. Alexei Navalny travelled to Moscow with his wife Yulia The plane was packed with journalists, including from the BBC. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for ""technical reasons"", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport, where thousands of Navalny supporters had gathered, to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. A number of people were detained by riot police. Liza Shuvalova, BBC News There had always been a feeling Flight DP936 from Berlin to Moscow with Alexei Navalny on board would not go according to plan. So when the captain announced that the plane would be diverted to a different airport, Mr Navalny shouted his apology to everyone on board, many of whom were journalists. After a ride in a bus from the plane to the airport, he told us he was not afraid and was very happy to return home. As he approached passport control with his wife Yulia, he said to the border control officer with a smile: ""You must have been waiting for me for a long time!"" And it was probably true. A few moments later, he was asked by policemen to accompany them or they would have to use ""force"". Mr Navalny wanted his lawyer Olga Mikhailova - who was on the same flight - to go with him. But at that point, she had already crossed the border and was not allowed back airside as Mr Navalny was led away. Russia's prison service said the opposition leader ""had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period"" related to his suspended sentence for embezzlement. Separately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Mr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of targeting him with spurious cases. Mr Navalny collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The flight was diverted to the city of Omsk, where he was admitted to hospital. He was airlifted to Germany in an induced coma. European experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War. Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Last month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years. Mr Navalny later said he hadduped an FSB agent into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation,which he recorded and posted online. The FSB said the recording was ""fake"". President Putin hasdismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groupsthat have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as ""a trick"". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services.

"NÃ³ra's body 'placed in the jungle', mother says","This video can not be played NÃ³ra Quoirin's parents: ""The inquest is a battle we must continue in NÃ³ra's name"" The mother of a 15-year-old girl found dead in a Malaysian jungle says she believes her daughter's body was placed by somebody in the spot she was found. NÃ³ra Quoirin, from Balham in south London, vanished from her room at the Dusun rainforest resort in August 2019. Her body was found near the resort nine days after she went missing. A coroner recorded her death was by misadventure. Meabh Quoirin, who thinks Nora was abducted, said the family would ""never give up their fight for justice"". The girl who vanished into a Malaysian jungle Girl's jungle death was 'misadventure' - coroner Prayers for missing girl as search continues NÃ³ra was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder that affects brain development, and her parents have always believed that wandering off from the resort - which is about 40 miles from Kuala Lumpur - was not something their daughter would have done. A post-mortem examination found NÃ³ra had died three days before her body was found, due to gastrointestinal bleeding from hunger and stress endured over a prolonged period. But Mrs Quoirin points out that the junglehad been searched on four occasions in the seven daysleading up to her death, with police suggesting the teenager been ""alive and moving"" during the first stages of the search. ""The fact that search teams were there, along with many hundreds of volunteers in that particular area so close to her death, makes us feel that she was placed there at a later point,"" Mrs Quoirin told the BBC. NÃ³ra's parents Maebh and Sebastien Quoirin want there to be a revision of the inquest verdict The teenager's mother pointed out that the inquest had not explained how her daughter ended up in the jungle, where her unclothed body was eventually found by a group of volunteers. ""I suppose the easiest one to dwell on was the fact there was an open window [in the family's chalet],"" said Mrs Quoirin, who is originally from Belfast. ""Someone opened that window, it wasn't any of us. That is totally unexplained."" Malaysian police have always treated NÃ³ra's disappearance as a missing person case. They maintain there was no suggestion of abduction, kidnap or foul play. During the search for her daughter, Mrs Quoirin told emergency services that their work meant ""the world to us"" ""NÃ³ra always looked to someone else for reassurance on what she should do next so the idea that she would have climbed out a window - even found a window or seen a window in the pitch black - is in our view crazy,"" Mrs Quorin said. ""If she had somehow mistaken which door was for the bathroom and had gone out the front door for instance... she was barefoot, she would have instantly felt pain and she would have been absolutely petrified."" NÃ³ra's parents have asked for a revision of the inquest verdict as ""so many questions have been left unanswered"". NÃ³ra was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development ""I think it will be impossible to ever have all the answers to questions that inevitably we will agonise over for the rest of our lives,"" Mrs Quoirin said. ""We can do more justice by at least recognising who this child was and that she wouldn't have - couldn't have - done the things that have been ruled through this verdict of misadventure. ""It's our duty to Nora to stand up for that, to really recognise who she was and stand up in the name of all children with special needs, to recognise who these children are, what they represent in our society.""

Four million in UK get their first Covid vaccinePeople in their 70s and others who are clinically extremely vulnerable are now being offered the jab.UK,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""Don't blow it now, we're on the route out"" More than four million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures. People in their 70s and theclinically extremely vulnerable,externalin England are now among those being offered the vaccine. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said UK data showed more people were in hospital with Covid than ever - and urged people to follow lockdown rules. He said: ""Do not blow it now. We are on the route out. We have to stick at it."" Speaking during a Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said more than half of those over 80 and half of elderly care home residents had been vaccinated. He said that in some parts of the country the ""vast majority"" of people in their 80s had had their first dose - and specifically congratulated Slough for having already vaccinated every single elderly care home resident. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the new rules for travellers? How many cases are there in your area? Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey had said people in her constituency in the Suffolk Coastal area had told her some over-80s, and even over-90s, had not been invited for a vaccination while younger people had been. When Mr Hancock was asked why some areas of the UK were reporting not having enough vaccines, he said ""supply is the rate-limiting factor"". He said the government was now ""prioritising the supply"" to places that needed to vaccinate over-80s - but did not want to stop areas that had progressed well from pressing on with vaccinating their other priority groups. The Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to start with - the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have now been vaccinated. In some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s in for vaccination. The progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination rates globally. Challenges remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have an impact. While the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UK's supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and will mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers are confident the mid February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine will not be affected - there is already enough vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is such nervousness about supply chains. A further 599 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external.  Figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Another 37,535 positive cases were reported - down from a high of 68,053 reported on 8 January. It comes as 10 further massvaccination hubs opened across England, adding to seven already in place. Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Oxford, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""right"" to offer the jab to other priority groups from this week. ""I think actually the whole of the UK is going very well. And, overall, the pace of the rollout is very encouraging,"" he said. He warned there would be no ""Open Sesame"" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus. This video can not be played The prime minister warns that ""we're not out of the woods yet"" The number of people who have received their first dose of the vaccine is now 4,062,501 - which is more than have tested positive (3,433,494) in the UK since the pandemic began. The expansion of the vaccination programme means it now includespriority groups three and four- people in their 70s and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals. However, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said. Nadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said that although vaccine supply remained ""lumpy"", he was ""confident"" the government would meet its target to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. Visiting the NHS Covid Vaccine Centre in Wembley, north London, Prof Stephen Powis said there were signs in the capital that growth and infection rates were slowing Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said there was more pressure on the NHS than ever before. Speaking alongside Mr Hancock in the briefing, he said around 15,000 people had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Eve, adding: ""That is well over 20 hospitals worth of patients."" He said it would be ""some time"" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals. In Oxfordshire,hospitals have postponed routine operationsbecause of a high number of coronavirus patients. And the BBC's Clive Myriehas been to the Royal London Hospital to report on staff struggling to cope.

Dr Rupert Pearse, a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at a London hospital, said although it appeared that infection levels had peaked in the capital, cases were still rising elsewhere in England, including the North West and Yorkshire, adding there was ""still cause to be concerned"". He told BBC Radio 4's World At One that hospital admissions tended to ""lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections"", with intensive care admissions coming 48 hours after that. He said that hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of beds they can give to Covid patients were ""still very worried about what will happen in the coming days"". This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given Dr Sarah Burford, a GP in Wellington, Somerset, who has been helping lead the vaccine rollout in her region, said it was going ""terribly well"" but that ""a few"" patients had turned up out of the blue looking for a jab. She told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that her four vaccinators were each giving a jab every seven-and-a-half minutes. Dr Burford added the over-80s and frontline healthcare workers were being invited for jabs, and her team's ""priority"" for this week and next would be vaccinating care home residents and staff. She said that although most people were being patient, fielding calls or walk-in inquiries about when people could expect to be vaccinated was only delaying staff from administering jabs.

He told Today that Wales's supply of the Pfizer jab was not being used all at once as it has to last until a delivery in February. In Wales, 151,737 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Public Health Wales, and  in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that264,991 people have had a first dose of the jab, with 80% of care home residents having now been vaccinated.

As such, he announced on Friday that, from this week, all travel corridors are to be closed. That means that anyone arriving in the UK - with onlya small number of exceptions,external- will have to quarantine.

Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison, Gavin Stamp, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Julian Joyce, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. We are pausing our coronavirus live page for now, but weâll
be back on Tuesday morning. Hereâs a recap of todayâs main stories: Doctors giving Covid vaccinations say it has been ""challenging"" when deliveries of the jab arrived with only a few hours' notice. The centre has been set up at the JCB factory in Rocester, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire by several GP practices in Cheadle. The medics say they can get through about 900 jabs a day but Dr David Yates told the BBC they often get about 12 hours' notice of new stocks arriving. ""Yesterday we suddenly got told we had 900 vaccines, which is a whole other batch of the Pfizer ones,"" he said. ""I think by last night we had 170 people booked in ready with people frantically on the phones all day."" MPs have voted to extend the temporary Â£20 a week increase to universal credit introduced at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and due to stop at the start of April. The Labour motion backing an extension passed by 278 votes to none, but it is not binding. The government - which dismissed the vote as a stunt - ordered its MPs to abstain. Labour says ministers have missed an opportunity to give families certainty and help the economy.

homes internationally throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, one country where such insight has been rare is China. Private care homes have been growing in popularity in China in
recent years, but there are some stigmas associated with the industry. In China, many view nursing homes as going against the
cultural concept of âfilial pietyâ. This is the belief that the young should
respect for and care for their elders, and so many believe the elderly should
live with their children, and not live in care homes. However, as cases of the virus grow in the northeast of the
country, the official broadcaster CCTV has offered viewers a rare insight into how Chinaâs elderly in these facilities are being protected. A journalist today has visited the Shijiazhuang Nursing Home.
Shijiazhuang is the Chinese city that has beenhardest hit by the virus in recent weeks. In a 30-minute livestream in which he is clad in hazmat suit and
visor, journalist Gu Junling introduces viewers to how the facilities are kept
safe, and shows viewers inside the care homeâs stockrooms, packed with ample
provisions for its residents. Many of the residents seem happy to speak to the journalist and talk
about how they are healthy, and happy. Masks are mandatory for both residents
and staff, even in the areas outside on-site. However, far from being kept
under house arrest, residents are shown to have sufficient space to go outside,

As we've heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the latest coronavirus statistics at today's Downing Street press briefing. The number of people in hospital with the virus is at its highest level yet - at 37,435 - he says. It comes as the daily case numbers in the UK have begun to fall. There were another 37,535 positive cases reported and a further 599 people died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. However, figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Cases of coronavirus have fallen by almost a quarter across the UK in the last week, showing that the current lockdown is having an effect. But hospital admissions are still rising.

Global health leaders say at least 49 richer countries have given 39 million doses of vaccine. But just 25 people have been vaccinated in one poorer country. The WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for equitable distribution of the vaccine. ""The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries,"" he told the WHO's executive board meeting. He says it's not right that younger, healthier adults in rich countries are vaccinated before health workers and older people in poorer countries. The UK has helped to raise one billion dollars, for global vaccine sharing fund Covax, through match-funding other donors, the government announced. This, combined with Â£548 million of UK aid, will help distribute one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year, officials said.

Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million
people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to
start with â the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have
now been vaccinated. In
some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in
England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s
in for vaccination. The
progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination
rates globally. Challenges
remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the
Pfizer-BioNTech will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have
an impact. While
the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UKâs
supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and it will
mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers
are confident the mid-February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine
will not be affected â there is already enough
vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is
such nervousness about supply chains.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock led this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. Here are some of the key points from the briefing.  It is difficult to know when schools can reopen, Dr Susan Hopkins says. ""We monitor data on a daily basis and review it looking at when and what we think might be able to happen next,"" says the NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser. ""We've always said schools should be the last to close and the first to open, but giving a defined date on that is very difficult until we see what happens over the next few weeks,"" she says. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said
that some areas have had a very high uptake in the vaccine for the over-80s and
care homes. This is why those areas are now
ready to offer vaccinations to over-70s. Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim
Zahawi pointed to some of those areas this morning - including 90% of over-80s
in Yateley receiving their first dose and 89% in Cheltenham. However, we canât give you a full
picture of which areas will see this expansion because the government has
not yet released localised data on vaccinations to the public, despite
ministers referring to the statistics throughout the day. There are certainly regional
variations for the vaccinations for the over-80s. The latest figures broken down by
age and region, up to 10 January, showed that 46% of the over-80s in the North
East and Yorkshire had been vaccinated. This is compared to 29% of people
in the East of England. Gareth Iacobucci from the British Medical Journal says doctors face making ""unimaginable decisions"" about who to treat, given the strain on hospitals which - he says - are basically full up. He asks the health secretary whether the law will be changed to prevent doctors and other NHS staff from being subject of legal actions and potentially being sued for unlawful killing if they are forced to prioritise some patients over others. Mr Hancock says this is a serious concern of his, and notes a letter he received on the issue on Sunday. But at the moment he says the NHS has not been overwhelmed yet and doctors do not have to make those kind of decisions, and he hopes they will not have to. Changing the law is not necessary at the moment, he says, while stressing the situation will be kept under review. Matt Hancock says he is going to Cornwall for his summer holidays and says: ""I think we are going to have a great British summer."" He adds: ""We have got a lot of work to do by then but we have got a line of sight to vaccinating everyone by September and anything beyond that would be a bonus."" Earlier, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that restrictions could gradually begin to be eased from March as immunity starts to take effect in the groups vaccinated by mid-February. Hugo Gye from the i asks why there are fewer vaccines delivered at weekends and asks what the government is doing to provide a seven day service. The health secretary says: ""The vaccination programme is absolutely delivering a full seven day service, and, as you well know, we are prepared to go 24/7."" He adds that he ""wouldn't read too much into an individual day's data...over a week you will see it going up and going up fast."" Supply is the rate limiting factor, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Four million in UK get their first Covid vaccinePeople in their 70s and others who are clinically extremely vulnerable are now being offered the jab.,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""Don't blow it now, we're on the route out"" More than four million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures. People in their 70s and theclinically extremely vulnerable,externalin England are now among those being offered the vaccine. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said UK data showed more people were in hospital with Covid than ever - and urged people to follow lockdown rules. He said: ""Do not blow it now. We are on the route out. We have to stick at it."" Speaking during a Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said more than half of those over 80 and half of elderly care home residents had been vaccinated. He said that in some parts of the country the ""vast majority"" of people in their 80s had had their first dose - and specifically congratulated Slough for having already vaccinated every single elderly care home resident. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the new rules for travellers? How many cases are there in your area? Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey had said people in her constituency in the Suffolk Coastal area had told her some over-80s, and even over-90s, had not been invited for a vaccination while younger people had been. When Mr Hancock was asked why some areas of the UK were reporting not having enough vaccines, he said ""supply is the rate-limiting factor"". He said the government was now ""prioritising the supply"" to places that needed to vaccinate over-80s - but did not want to stop areas that had progressed well from pressing on with vaccinating their other priority groups. The Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to start with - the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have now been vaccinated. In some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s in for vaccination.

A further 599 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external.  Figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Another 37,535 positive cases were reported - down from a high of 68,053 reported on 8 January. It comes as 10 further massvaccination hubs opened across England, adding to seven already in place. Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Oxford, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""right"" to offer the jab to other priority groups from this week. ""I think actually the whole of the UK is going very well. And, overall, the pace of the rollout is very encouraging,"" he said. He warned there would be no ""Open Sesame"" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus. This video can not be played The prime minister warns that ""we're not out of the woods yet"" The number of people who have received their first dose of the vaccine is now 4,062,501 - which is more than have tested positive (3,433,494) in the UK since the pandemic began. The expansion of the vaccination programme means it now includespriority groups three and four- people in their 70s and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals. However, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said. Nadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said that although vaccine supply remained ""lumpy"", he was ""confident"" the government would meet its target to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. Visiting the NHS Covid Vaccine Centre in Wembley, north London, Prof Stephen Powis said there were signs in the capital that growth and infection rates were slowing Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said there was more pressure on the NHS than ever before. Speaking alongside Mr Hancock in the briefing, he said around 15,000 people had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Eve, adding: ""That is well over 20 hospitals worth of patients."" He said it would be ""some time"" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals. In Oxfordshire,hospitals have postponed routine operationsbecause of a high number of coronavirus patients. And the BBC's Clive Myriehas been to the Royal London Hospital to report on staff struggling to cope.

Dr Rupert Pearse, a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at a London hospital, said although it appeared that infection levels had peaked in the capital, cases were still rising elsewhere in England, including the North West and Yorkshire, adding there was ""still cause to be concerned"". He told BBC Radio 4's World At One that hospital admissions tended to ""lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections"", with intensive care admissions coming 48 hours after that. He said that hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of beds they can give to Covid patients were ""still very worried about what will happen in the coming days"". This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given Dr Sarah Burford, a GP in Wellington, Somerset, who has been helping lead the vaccine rollout in her region, said it was going ""terribly well"" but that ""a few"" patients had turned up out of the blue looking for a jab. She told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that her four vaccinators were each giving a jab every seven-and-a-half minutes. Dr Burford added the over-80s and frontline healthcare workers were being invited for jabs, and her team's ""priority"" for this week and next would be vaccinating care home residents and staff. She said that although most people were being patient, fielding calls or walk-in inquiries about when people could expect to be vaccinated was only delaying staff from administering jabs.

He told Today that Wales's supply of the Pfizer jab was not being used all at once as it has to last until a delivery in February. In Wales, 151,737 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Public Health Wales, and  in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that264,991 people have had a first dose of the jab, with 80% of care home residents having now been vaccinated.

As such, he announced on Friday that, from this week, all travel corridors are to be closed. That means that anyone arriving in the UK - with onlya small number of exceptions,external- will have to quarantine. Under current rules, anyone flying into the country from overseas also has to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off.

We are pausing our coronavirus live page for now, but weâll
be back on Tuesday morning. Hereâs a recap of todayâs main stories: Doctors giving Covid vaccinations say it has been ""challenging"" when deliveries of the jab arrived with only a few hours' notice. The centre has been set up at the JCB factory in Rocester, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire by several GP practices in Cheadle. The medics say they can get through about 900 jabs a day but Dr David Yates told the BBC they often get about 12 hours' notice of new stocks arriving. ""Yesterday we suddenly got told we had 900 vaccines, which is a whole other batch of the Pfizer ones,"" he said. ""I think by last night we had 170 people booked in ready with people frantically on the phones all day."" MPs have voted to extend the temporary Â£20 a week increase to universal credit introduced at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and due to stop at the start of April. The Labour motion backing an extension passed by 278 votes to none, but it is not binding. The government - which dismissed the vote as a stunt - ordered its MPs to abstain. Labour says ministers have missed an opportunity to give families certainty and help the economy.

Gareth Iacobucci from the British Medical Journal says doctors face making ""unimaginable decisions"" about who to treat, given the strain on hospitals which - he says - are basically full up. He asks the health secretary whether the law will be changed to prevent doctors and other NHS staff from being subject of legal actions and potentially being sued for unlawful killing if they are forced to prioritise some patients over others. Mr Hancock says this is a serious concern of his, and notes a letter he received on the issue on Sunday. But at the moment he says the NHS has not been overwhelmed yet and doctors do not have to make those kind of decisions, and he hopes they will not have to. Changing the law is not necessary at the moment, he says, while stressing the situation will be kept under review. Matt Hancock says he is going to Cornwall for his summer holidays and says: ""I think we are going to have a great British summer."" He adds: ""We have got a lot of work to do by then but we have got a line of sight to vaccinating everyone by September and anything beyond that would be a bonus."" Earlier, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that restrictions could gradually begin to be eased from March as immunity starts to take effect in the groups vaccinated by mid-February. Hugo Gye from the i asks why there are fewer vaccines delivered at weekends and asks what the government is doing to provide a seven day service. The health secretary says: ""The vaccination programme is absolutely delivering a full seven day service, and, as you well know, we are prepared to go 24/7."" He adds that he ""wouldn't read too much into an individual day's data...over a week you will see it going up and going up fast."" Supply is the rate limiting factor, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

'We take thousands of calls - it's hard to escape',"LAS received almost 200,000 calls in December - up 50,000 on November, when London was in the second national lockdown Last week London exceeded the grim milestone of 10,000 deaths linked to Covid-19. Thousands of people are critically ill in hospital, and as many as 5% of Londoners are thought to have the virus in some parts of the city. As coronavirus continues to circulate silently around the capital, staff at the London Ambulance Service (LAS) are under immense pressure. The service is currently taking up to 8,500 calls a day, compared with a pre-Covid figure of 5,000 to 6,000, according to its chief executive Garrett Emmerson. Lizzie Cooke is one of the workers at LAS's south London headquarters who are dealing with strangers at what is a distressing time. Calmly, the 30-year-old answers the phone and usually asks first if the patient is breathing. ""In the first wave we were getting a lot of calls of [people seeking] reassurance,"" Lizzie says. ""But now there are more and more who have symptoms, and family members are really frightened."" It is a fear that Lizzie knows all too well, having been hospitalised with Covid-19 in March. She spent a week receiving treatment for the virus. ""I was at work taking calls and struggling to concentrate,"" the call-handling supervisor says. ""At times I would just have my head on the desk in between calls. ""I started to develop chest pains five days later so my parents took me to Royal County Hospital, in Hampshire, and an X-ray showed a lot of fluid in my lungs. It was quite horrible. ""Luckily, I wasn't on a ventilator but I had the oxygen hood, and the nurses were so rushed off their feet. I didn't have my phone with me or know my parents' numbers off by heart so for that week I was quite alone and isolated. ""It was just a mixture of the unknown and not knowing when it was going to stop that was so daunting."" The unprecedented volume of calls means waiting times for patients are increasing Lizzie's personal battle with coronavirus has helped her to empathise with people who call up with breathing problems. It's something she says she's having to do more and more. ""Just before Christmas we were getting a lot of respiratory and cardiac arrest calls,"" she says. ""You could just hear colleagues counting to four [for chest compressions] and it was echoing around the room. It has been tough. ""We are getting calls from family members who are really frightened. I covered the London Bridge terror attacks and Grenfell but this is a different scale. ""I did get one call for toothache, but that's part of the job."" The hospital hit by a coronavirus 'tidal wave' of patients London's Covid death toll exceeds 10,000 Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan says Lizzie, who lives in Hampshire, says that because the coverage of coronavirus is everywhere, it is ""difficult to escape"". When she's not at work she binge-watches Line of Duty on Netflix, but she says winding down isn't easy. Lizzie sometimes thinks about the people who aren't following the rules aimed at helping stop the spread of the virus, and those who deny Covid-19 even exists. ""It's a kick in the teeth,"" she says. ""It is frustrating on the way to work when you see people not wearing masks or even posting stuff on social media not believing the virus is real. ""I just don't know where the disconnect is coming from; there are many people in hospital, many people dying, and I don't know what more needs to be said to make them realise how dangerous the illness is."" Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Sitting a few metres away from Lizzie is 24-year-old Louise Essam, who has been in the job for two years. ""Every call we take at the moment is coronavirus,"" she says. ""My record was 108 calls in a day back in March during the first wave. ""But easily in the last few weeks I've been taking around 100 a day at times,"" Louise adds. ""We are just doing the best we can,"" says emergency call co-ordinator Louise Essam ""Sometimes I'll come in for a shift and can just hear colleagues counting one, two, three, four, for the compressions, and you just know what kind of shift it is going to be. ""It has been tough and quite frustrating, really. We are trying to help people. We are under so much pressure as there are high waiting times, but we are just doing the best we can."" Help is at hand though from the LAS workers' fellow emergency services personnel. Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick visited Wembley Stadium on Wednesday, where her officers are being trained to drive ambulances Seventy-five Met Police officers are currently being trained at Wembley Stadium to drive ambulances. They will start work as drivers from 20 January, joining the 200 firefighters who are already helping LAS. ""It came as a huge relief when they announced it,"" says 37-year-old paramedic Ben West. Ben West has been with the London Ambulance Service for 13 years As is the case with many frontline workers, Ben says he is concerned about the dangers of exposure to coronavirus. He has lost four colleagues to Covid-19, including Ian Reynolds, a paramedic based in Croydon, and Melonie Mitchell, a member of the NHS 111 team. They both died during the first wave in April. ""I wouldn't be a normal person if I said I wasn't scared,"" he says. ""I am scared and I do worry but we take every day as it comes, take our precautions and we just see where we go with that. ""We know the virus is out there in the community and we are not immune.""

"Putin critic Alexei Navalny to be kept in custodyIt follows his dramatic return to Russia, five months after a nerve agent attack almost killed him.","This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities Russia's leading opposition figure has been arrested and detained for 30 days, after returning to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year. Alexei Navalny said a court ruling held inside a police station was a mockery and called for street protests. Dozens of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow police station where he was being held and shouted ""disgrace"" and ""Putin resign"". Mr Navalny was held soon after his flight from Germany arrived on Sunday. Russian prosecutors say he violated the parole terms of a suspended sentence for embezzlement. He says the charges are politically motivated. Last August, Mr Navalny, 44, was almost killed in a nerve agent attack, which he blamed personally on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life On Sunday, big crowds gathered at Moscow's Vnukovo airport to greet Mr Navalny's flight from Berlin - but in a last-minute decision the authorities re-routed the plane to another airport in the capital. A makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night. Dozens of people gathered outside the Khimki police station in freezing weather, demanding for Mr Navalny to be released Mr Navalny (centre) was later seen led away by officers from the police station The judge ordered Mr Navalny's detention until 15 February for violating his parole. He will have another hearing on 29 January to determine whether his suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years should be replaced with a jail term. Mr Navalny said his treatment was beyond a ""mockery of justice"" and described the hearing as ""lawlessness of the highest grade"". ""Don't be afraid. Take to the streets, not for me, but for yourselves, for your future,""he said in a video address (in Russian) from the police station.,external A crowd of about 200 Navalny supporters gathered outside the police station in freezing weather, demanding his immediate release. Mr Navalny was later seen led away by police to one of Moscow's prisons. His lawyer, Vadim Kobzev, said they would appeal against the ""illegal"" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. Meanwhile, more than 70 Navalny supporters and journalists were detained across Russia on Monday, according to the Monitoring group OVD-Info. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner and the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race, but was barred because of an embezzlement conviction that he says was politically motivated An outspoken blogger, he has millions of Russian followers on social media and managed to get some supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020 The US and European Union led calls for Mr Navalny to be freed, but stopped short of threatening any punitive action. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russian authorities were trying to silence their critics, while incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Kremlin's ""attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard"". France, Italy, Germany and the president of the European Commission were also among those calling for his release. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described Mr Navalny's arrest as ""appalling"". ""Rather than persecuting Mr Navalny, Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil,"" he said. As Mr Navalny gradually recovered after emergency medical treatment in Germany, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday, he made good on that pledge, boarding a flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. Alexei Navalny travelled to Moscow with his wife Yulia The plane was packed with journalists, including from the BBC. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for ""technical reasons"", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport, where thousands of Navalny supporters had gathered, to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. A number of people were detained by riot police. Liza Shuvalova, BBC News There had always been a feeling Flight DP936 from Berlin to Moscow with Alexei Navalny on board would not go according to plan. So when the captain announced that the plane would be diverted to a different airport, Mr Navalny shouted his apology to everyone on board, many of whom were journalists. After a ride in a bus from the plane to the airport, he told us he was not afraid and was very happy to return home. As he approached passport control with his wife Yulia, he said to the border control officer with a smile: ""You must have been waiting for me for a long time!"" And it was probably true. A few moments later, he was asked by policemen to accompany them or they would have to use ""force"". Mr Navalny wanted his lawyer Olga Mikhailova - who was on the same flight - to go with him. But at that point, she had already crossed the border and was not allowed back airside as Mr Navalny was led away. Russia's prison service said the opposition leader ""had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period"" related to his suspended sentence for embezzlement. Separately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Mr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of targeting him with spurious cases. Mr Navalny collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The flight was diverted to the city of Omsk, where he was admitted to hospital. He was airlifted to Germany in an induced coma. European experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War. Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Last month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years. Mr Navalny later said he hadduped an FSB agent into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation,which he recorded and posted online. The FSB said the recording was ""fake"". President Putin hasdismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groupsthat have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as ""a trick"". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services.

Chip-shortage 'crisis' halts car production,"Audi factories, like others, will make thousands fewer cars at the start of this year Audi is having to slow production because of a computer-chip shortage it is calling a ""crisis upon a crisis"". Boss Markus Duesmann said it was now aiming to make 10,000 fewer cars in the first quarter of the year and putting more than 10,000 workers on furlough. Its parent company, Volkswagen, announced its own go-slow due to a lack of chips last week, alongside rivals such as Honda. Mr Duesmann told the Financial Times,externalcarmakers had been caught by surprise. After a poor start to 2020 for new car sales, manufacturers cut their orders from the Chinese factories making computer chips. But then, at the end of the year, ""everybody was quite surprised by the strength of the market"", Mr Duesmann said. However, ordering new chips is not simple. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber said: ""Semiconductors have a broad range of applications but a very limited pool of companies capable of manufacturing the silicon. ""Demand is high, and supply is tight"" and any sudden needs ""can prove very difficult to accommodate"". Chinese drone and chip makers added to US blacklist US turns up heat on China's biggest chip-maker ""Modern cars are becoming computers on wheels, with an abundance of silicon required to control everything from the infotainment system to camera, radar and lidar,"" he said. The demand from carmakers ""competes for manufacturing capacity with smartphones, servers and a host of other segments"". And a boom in the market for devices such as PCs and new game consoles was making it doubly difficult to book manufacturing time. The shortages have seen Mercedes-maker Daimler, Fiat, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Subaru and  Toyota all reportedly suspend production for days or weeks at a time. And German car-parts company Continental described ""largescale supply shortages"", with lead times of six to nine months, adding bottlenecks were expected to continue ""well into 2021, causing major disruptions"".

Four million in UK get their first Covid vaccine,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""Don't blow it now, we're on the route out"" More than four million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures. People in their 70s and theclinically extremely vulnerable,externalin England are now among those being offered the vaccine. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said UK data showed more people were in hospital with Covid than ever - and urged people to follow lockdown rules. He said: ""Do not blow it now. We are on the route out. We have to stick at it."" Speaking during a Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said more than half of those over 80 and half of elderly care home residents had been vaccinated. He said that in some parts of the country the ""vast majority"" of people in their 80s had had their first dose - and specifically congratulated Slough for having already vaccinated every single elderly care home resident. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the new rules for travellers? How many cases are there in your area? Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey had said people in her constituency in the Suffolk Coastal area had told her some over-80s, and even over-90s, had not been invited for a vaccination while younger people had been. When Mr Hancock was asked why some areas of the UK were reporting not having enough vaccines, he said ""supply is the rate-limiting factor"". He said the government was now ""prioritising the supply"" to places that needed to vaccinate over-80s - but did not want to stop areas that had progressed well from pressing on with vaccinating their other priority groups. The Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to start with - the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have now been vaccinated. In some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s in for vaccination. The progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination rates globally. Challenges remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have an impact. While the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UK's supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and will mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers are confident the mid February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine will not be affected - there is already enough vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is such nervousness about supply chains. A further 599 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external.  Figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Another 37,535 positive cases were reported - down from a high of 68,053 reported on 8 January. It comes as 10 further massvaccination hubs opened across England, adding to seven already in place. Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Oxford, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""right"" to offer the jab to other priority groups from this week. ""I think actually the whole of the UK is going very well. And, overall, the pace of the rollout is very encouraging,"" he said. He warned there would be no ""Open Sesame"" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus. This video can not be played The prime minister warns that ""we're not out of the woods yet"" The number of people who have received their first dose of the vaccine is now 4,062,501 - which is more than have tested positive (3,433,494) in the UK since the pandemic began. The expansion of the vaccination programme means it now includespriority groups three and four- people in their 70s and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals. However, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said. Nadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, said that although vaccine supply remained ""lumpy"", he was ""confident"" the government would meet its target to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. Visiting the NHS Covid Vaccine Centre in Wembley, north London, Prof Stephen Powis said there were signs in the capital that growth and infection rates were slowing Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said there was more pressure on the NHS than ever before. Speaking alongside Mr Hancock in the briefing, he said around 15,000 people had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Eve, adding: ""That is well over 20 hospitals worth of patients."" He said it would be ""some time"" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals. In Oxfordshire,hospitals have postponed routine operationsbecause of a high number of coronavirus patients. And the BBC's Clive Myriehas been to the Royal London Hospital to report on staff struggling to cope.

Dr Rupert Pearse, a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at a London hospital, said although it appeared that infection levels had peaked in the capital, cases were still rising elsewhere in England, including the North West and Yorkshire, adding there was ""still cause to be concerned"". He told BBC Radio 4's World At One that hospital admissions tended to ""lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections"", with intensive care admissions coming 48 hours after that. He said that hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of beds they can give to Covid patients were ""still very worried about what will happen in the coming days"". This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given Dr Sarah Burford, a GP in Wellington, Somerset, who has been helping lead the vaccine rollout in her region, said it was going ""terribly well"" but that ""a few"" patients had turned up out of the blue looking for a jab. She told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that her four vaccinators were each giving a jab every seven-and-a-half minutes. Dr Burford added the over-80s and frontline healthcare workers were being invited for jabs, and her team's ""priority"" for this week and next would be vaccinating care home residents and staff. She said that although most people were being patient, fielding calls or walk-in inquiries about when people could expect to be vaccinated was only delaying staff from administering jabs.

In Wales, 151,737 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Public Health Wales, and  in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that264,991 people have had a first dose of the jab, with 80% of care home residents having now been vaccinated.

Anzac Day terror attack plotter 'can go free',"Now 20, he was jailed for life at Manchester Crown Court after admitting inciting terrorism overseas The youngest person convicted of a terrorism offence in the UK - who plotted to murder police in Australia on Anzac Day aged 14 - can be freed from jail, the Parole Board has ruled. The 20-year-old, from Blackburn, who can only be identified as RXG, sent encrypted messages inciting an Australian to launch attacks in 2015. He was jailed for life that year after admitting inciting terrorism overseas. But the Parole Board now says it is ""satisfied"" he is suitable for release. ""After considering the circumstances of his offending, the progress made while in detention, and the evidence presented at the hearings, the panel was satisfied that RXG was suitable for release,"" the board said in a document detailing the decision. The race to stop the teenage terrorist During his trial, the court heard how at the age of 14, the boy adopted an older persona in messages to alleged Australian jihadist Sevdet Besim, 18, instructing him to kill police officers at the remembrance parade. He sent thousands of messages suggesting Mr Besim get his ""first taste of beheading"" by attacking ""a proper lonely person"". Australian police were alerted to the plot after British officers discovered material on the teenager's phone. A written summary of the Parole Board decision reveals that two hearings took place to consider the decision - hearings that included evidence from RXG himself. The summary records that ""no-one at the hearing considered there to be a need for further time"" in custody and that ""all necessary work had been completed"". RXG, who became eligible for parole in October, is said to have ""undertaken extensive specialist work in detention to address his offending behaviour, his understanding of Islam and to develop his level of maturity"".

Paramedic questioned job after being spat at,"This video can not be played 'I was spat at working as an ambulance paramedic' After experiencing its most difficult period of the entire Covid-19 pandemic in December, the boss of Welsh Ambulance Service said it was still under ""extreme pressure"". At one stage, 400 staff - 12% of all workers - were sick or self-isolating. Jason Killens said this was exacerbated by high call numbers and ""significant delays"" handing patients to hospitals. One paramedic described questioning whether he was in the right job after being spat at during the pandemic. The chief executive said it meant ""patients with less serious conditions waited much longer than we would like"". Paramedic Stan Baxter was assaulted by someone who spat at him Paramedic Stan Baxter, describing the pressure he and colleagues were under, said at one point an incident caused him to question whether he wanted to continue working. ""During the peak of the pandemic last year, I was assaulted by a member of the public where I was spat at in the face,"" he said. ""And that's really the only time that I've stopped and gone: 'Is this for me?'"" However the ""vast majority of the public"" had been ""absolutely fantastic"", he stressed, adding: ""We've had people waving at us, buying us coffee."" Luke Robinson and Stan Baxter must wear more protective equipment when they help patients For his work partner, Luke Robinson, their job made it clear how coronavirus had made a resurgence across the country. ""I worked New Year's Eve and I responded to a number of incidents which involved just regular health complaints,"" he said. ""But next door or in the adjacent building there's people having parties and you can tell that there's large gatherings going on. And it's really frustrating because it really hammers home that some people aren't listening to the rules. ""And it's not surprising that we're seeing a second wave now."" Ambulance patient waits 19 hours outside hospital Army deployed to drive ambulances in Wales Welsh Ambulance Service declare 'critical incident' Mr Killens said the pressure was now ""palpably less"" compared to last month, but admitted difficult weeks lie ahead. ""December was probably the most pressurised period during the whole pandemic for a number of reasons,"" he said. ""Staff that were symptomatic or isolating, that's been at its peak in December. ""We've seen more work both in the 111 and 999 service, that is patients contacting us with Covid-related symptoms, and of course because of the pressure on the rest of the NHS, we've seen extended handover at some of our emergency departments and what that's meant regrettably is some less serious patients have waited a lot longer in the community than I would have expected."" Soldiers have been helping to relieve pressure on ambulance staff The ambulance service has been at its highest level of alert - described as ""extreme pressure"" - since early December. It was so bad at the beginning of the month, the service had to declare a ""critical incident"",because of severe problems in south east Walesin particular - andone man had to wait 19 hours in an ambulance outside a hospital. This strain has been partly blamed for deteriorating ambulance response times, with the situation exacerbated by the fact hospitals are struggling. Ambulances spent more than 11,661 hours outside emergency departments waiting to transfer patients in December - an equivalent to a total of more than 485 days. The average delay was one hour and eight minutes. The Ambulance Service has been hit by high numbers of staff sick or self-isolating ""We would usually see handover delays through winter - but what's unique this time is the overlay of the pandemic,"" Mr Killens added. ""There has to be additional distancing, this means less capacity in emergency departments. ""Testing also needs to be done before patients are admitted  - the additional complexities mean the process is slower and there's less space for patients to go into."" He said the impact of implementing Covid precautions is also affecting how quickly crews can respond. ""As a result of the virus, we're having to clean vehicles and equipment more frequently and thoroughly than before,"" Mr Killens said. This video can not be played Soldiers help ambulance service on Covid 'home straight' ""Also there are levels for personal protective equipment that staff have to wear to protect themselves and others. Level three - the highest in some cases. ""And it takes a number of minutes for crews to put that on before staff treat the patients."" To bolster staffing levels and speed up response times, about80 soldiers are assisting the Welsh Ambulance Servicefor the second time since the start of the pandemic - along with smaller number of staff from other services like the fire service. ""They are driving emergency ambulances for us... which means an emergency ambulance clinician can look after the patient,"" Mr Killens added. ""They'll drive the ambulance from the scene to hospital... it enables us to put more ambulances on the streets to respond to patients more quickly given the levels of absence that we've seen."" Paramedics now have to carry out a more rigorous and time-consuming cleaning regime After facing relentless pressure for close to a year, Mr Killens is worried about the impact on mental health and well-being of ambulance and control centre staff. The service is focused on ""what we can do to keep them fit and well"", he said. But he praised staff for ""stepping up to the plate"" - and insists some of the lessons learnt during the last year will benefit the service during the longer term. ""I've been in the ambulance sector for 25 years and this is like dealing with a very long incident,"" said Mr Killens. ""So, a major incident an emergency service routinely responds to generally will be over in a couple of hours. But the level of pressure has been sustained now for 12 months. ""All of our people have stepped up and done what was necessary and got on with providing the best care in really difficult circumstances.... we will come through it and at the end of the pandemic and will be a stronger organisation for it."" He believes the service is now ""on the home straight"" in dealing with the pandemic. ""We've had two waves of this virus and learnt much along the way, and with a vaccine rollout we have a real opportunity now to see an end to the disruption, the personal impact and the level of death and harm,"" Mr Killens said. ""By the time we get to the other side of the spring, probably we will be able to return to some kind of normality whatever that will be 18 months into a pandemic. ""There's a couple of difficult weeks to come, but if we can emerge through February and March, provided we all stick to the rules, because it's easy for the virus to grab hold again if we get complacent .... we'll be in a far better position as we come to the spring.""

Neglect 'left care home residents malnourished',"Evelyn Jones was one of the care home residents whose family raised concerns Six care home residents died after suffering dehydration and malnourishment because of alleged neglect, an inquest has been told. Stanley James, 89, June Hamer, 71, Stanley Bradford, 76, Edith Evans, 85, Evelyn Jones, 87, and William Hickman, 71 all died between 2003 and 2005. They were residents at Brithdir Nursing Home in New Tredegar, Caerphilly. The inquest in Newport followsOperation Jasmine, an Â£11.6m inquiry into alleged neglect at six homes. One of Wales' biggest inquiries, it was launched after the death of an 84-year-old patient at a nursing home in Newbridge, Caerphilly. Opening the inquest, Assistant Coroner for Gwent Geraint Williams said police started investigating in 2005 following the death of an 84-year-old ""mentally infirm"" woman at another care home in Newbridge. Mr Williams said it led to officers uncovering a ""pattern of concerns linked to other deaths in other care homes"". June Hamer went into Brithdir in 2003 In relation to the Brithdir inquiry, Mr Williams said: ""Operation Jasmine uncovered evidence suggesting poor care of residents, including allegations of poor pressure sore and peg [percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy] feed management, malnourishment, and general neglect of the residents' long-term needs, together with deficient standards of care and nursing practice."" Doctor charged with care home neglect dies Nurses struck off for care failings The inquest heard resident Mr James, who had dementia and was not mobile, developed several pressure sores in the 18 months before he died in August 2003. Mr Bradford, who had schizophrenia, was admitted to the Prince Charles Hospital in Merthyr Tydfil on several occasions for complaints of ""dehydration, chest and urine infections"". Before he died in August 2005 he was ""observed to be seriously malnourished"", by doctors. Dementia patient Mrs Evans was admitted to the same hospital in September 2005, where nurses found the site around her feeding tube ""infected"", while broken skin was found on her buttocks and she appeared ""unkempt and dirty, and her mouth and lips were dry and her tongue was thick"". The trial of the late Dr Prana Das for care home neglect collapsed after he suffered brain damage in an attack Dr Prana Das, who owned and ran the nursing home along with several other facilities in Wales, faced a string of charges relating to failings in care. He suffered a brain injury during a burglary at his home in 2012 and wasdeclared medically unfit to stand trial. Dr Das died in January 2020aged 73, but his widow and co-owner of the home, Dr Nishebita Das, who is said not to have taken part in running it, is expected to give evidence at the inquest. Mr Williams told the hearing that, even before the couple purchased the home in April 2002 under their company Puretruce Health Care Limited, ""serious concerns"" were raised by state agencies regarding the number of residents who had suffered pressure ulcers. ""Those issues continued, even after Dr Das assumed ownership of the home,"" he said. Mr Williams said the inquest will consider the actions of nurses and carers at the home, ""many of whom came to this country from abroad to work and have since returned there, and are now not available to participate in the inquest"". The inquest is set to last until March. A hearing into the death of a seventh resident, Matthew Higgins, 86, will be held following the conclusion of this inquest.

Vaccine rollout extended to over-70s in England,"This video can not be played The prime minister warns that ""we're not out of the woods yet"" People in England in their 70s, and those listed asclinically extremely vulnerable,external, will begin receiving offers of a coronavirus vaccine this week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the move was a ""significant milestone"" in the nation's vaccination programme. More than five million people - from priority groups three and four - will be invited from Monday to have the jab. It comes as 10 further massvaccination hubs open across England. Speaking from a vaccination centre in Oxford, Mr Johnson said about four million people had received a vaccine so far, adding it was now ""right"" to offer the jab to other priority groups. He said: ""We're getting it out as fast as we can, four million done so far, I think we've done more than half of the over-80s, half of the people in care homes, the elderly residents of care homes."" He warned there would be no ""Open Sesame"" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus. He said the pace of the rollout was ""very encouraging"" but cautioned that any easing of the rules would be ""gradual"", as the situation was ""still pretty precarious"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock will lead a Downing Street news briefing later, No 10 has said. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the new rules for travellers? How many cases are there in your area? The expansion of the vaccination programme comes after the number of people to receive a first dose rose to 3.8 million across the UK - more than have tested positive (3.4 million) since the pandemic began. However, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said. People in their 70s -some 5.6 million people- and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals make uppriority groups three and four. Nadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, defended the decision to offer Covid jabs to the over-70s and clinically vulnerable - before all those in the first two priority groups have had their vaccinations. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the over-80s ""need not worry"" if they had not yet been invited for a jab. He said as it was only areas where the majority of the over-80s had been vaccinated that people aged 70 and over were being invited for jabs. He added that, by today, 50% of care home residents should have been vaccinated. Although vaccine supply remained ""lumpy"", he said he was ""confident"" the government would meet its target to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. Visiting the NHS Covid Vaccine Centre in Wembley, north London, Prof Stephen Powis said there were signs in the capital that growth and infection rates were slowing Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said the NHS had never been under the level of pressure it is now, in any previous winter. Prof Powis told BBC Breakfast: ""I don't think the NHS has ever been under such pressure in any winter, but our staff are responding magnificently."" He added that there were ""signs"" in London that growth and infection rates were ""slowing"" but it would take ""several weeks"" before it had an impact in reducing the number of people in hospital, warning that it would be ""tough"" over the next couple of weeks. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area FOOD:Is it safe to have a takeaway or shopping delivery? QUARANTINE:What are the new UK travel rules? TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Dr Rupert Pearse, a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at a London Hospital, said although it appeared that infection levels had peaked in the capital, cases were still rising elsewhere in England, including the North West and Yorkshire, adding there was ""still cause to be concerned"". He told BBC Radio 4's World At One that hospital admissions tended to ""lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections"", with intensive care admissions coming 48 hours after that. He said that hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of beds they can give to Covid patients were ""still very worried about what will happen in the coming days"". This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given Dr Sarah Burford, a GP in Wellington, Somerset, who has been helping lead vaccine rollout in her region, said it was going ""terribly well"" but that ""a few"" patients had turned up out of the blue looking for a jab. She told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that her four vaccinators were each giving a jab every seven-and-a-half minutes. Dr Burford added the over-80s and frontline healthcare workers were being invited for jabs, and her team's ""priority"" for this week and next would be vaccinating care home residents and staff. She said although most people were being patient, fielding calls or walk-in inquiries about when people could expect to be vaccinated was only delaying staff from administering jabs.

Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford hasdefended the speed of the vaccine rollout in Wales, insisting the nation was ""on track"" to vaccinate all top four priority groups by mid-February. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Wales's supply of the Pfizer jab is not being used all at once as it has to last until a delivery in February. In Wales, 151,737 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Public Health Wales, and  in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that264,991 people have had a first dose of the jab, with 80% of care home residents having now been vaccinated.

As such, he announced on Friday that, from this week, all travel corridors are to be closed. That means that anyone arriving in the UK - with onlya small number of exceptions,external- will have to quarantine.

Four million get their first vaccine in UK,"This video can not be played Health Secretary Matt Hancock: ""Don't blow it now, we're on the route out"" More than four million people in the UK have received their first dose of a coronavirus vaccine, according to government figures. People in their 70s and theclinically extremely vulnerable,externalin England are now among those being offered the vaccine. However, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said UK data showed more people were in hospital with Covid than ever - and urged people to follow lockdown rules. He said: ""Do not blow it now. We are on the route out. We have to stick at it."" Speaking during a Downing Street briefing, Mr Hancock said more than half of those over 80 and half of elderly care home residents had been vaccinated. He said that in some parts of the country the ""vast majority"" of people in their 80s had had their first dose - and specifically congratulated Slough for having already vaccinated every single elderly care home resident. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the new rules for travellers? How many cases are there in your area? Earlier, Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey had said people in her constituency in the Suffolk Coastal area had told her some over-80s, and even over-90s, had not been invited for a vaccination while younger people had been. When Mr Hancock was asked why some areas of the UK were reporting not having enough vaccines, he said ""supply is the rate-limiting factor"". He said the government was now ""prioritising the supply"" to places that needed to vaccinate over-80s - but did not want to stop areas that had progressed well from pressing on with vaccinating their other priority groups. The Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to start with - the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have now been vaccinated. In some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s in for vaccination. The progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination rates globally. Challenges remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the Pfizer-BioNTech jab will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have an impact. While the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UK's supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and will mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers are confident the mid February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine will not be affected - there is already enough vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is such nervousness about supply chains. A further 599 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external.  Figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Another 37,535 positive cases were reported - down from a high of 68,053 reported on 8 January. It comes as 10 further massvaccination hubs opened across England, adding to seven already in place. Speaking during a visit to a vaccination centre in Oxford, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said it was ""right"" to offer the jab to other priority groups from this week. ""I think actually the whole of the UK is going very well. And, overall, the pace of the rollout is very encouraging,"" he said. He warned there would be no ""Open Sesame"" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus. This video can not be played The prime minister warns that ""we're not out of the woods yet"" The number of people who have received their first dose of the vaccine is now 4,062,501 - which is more than have tested positive (3,433,494) in the UK since the pandemic began. The expansion of the vaccination programme means it now includespriority groups three and four- people in their 70s and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals. However, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said.

Visiting the NHS Covid Vaccine Centre in Wembley, north London, Prof Stephen Powis said there were signs in the capital that growth and infection rates were slowing Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said there was more pressure on the NHS than ever before. Speaking alongside Mr Hancock in the briefing, he said around 15,000 people had been admitted to hospital since Christmas Eve, adding: ""That is well over 20 hospitals worth of patients."" He said it would be ""some time"" before the vaccination programme begins to reduce pressures on hospitals.

Drakeford faces 'go-slow' jab roll-out criticism,"This video can not be played Education Minister Kirsty Williams said vaccinators were working 'flat out' Wales' health minister has denied Covid-19 vaccines are being held back. Vaughan Gething was reacting to First Minister Mark Drakeford's comments the supplyÂ had to last until FebruaryÂ to prevent ""vaccinators standing around with nothing to do"". In alater tweet,external, Mr Drakeford said ""nobody is holding back vaccines"",  but the Conservative ex-Welsh secretary said his comments were ""astonishing"". Mr Gething insists vaccines are being rolled out ""as quickly as possible"". After Mr Drakeford's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Welsh Government had said the reason for spacing out vaccine supply was to avoid wastage. Asked about those comments, Mr Gething said: ""We're rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as possible. ""As the first minister's clarified tonight, we're not holding the vaccine back."" Public Health Wales said 151,737 people have been vaccinated, after at least 327,000 doses were delivered. Mr Gething told BBC Wales Today: ""It's as quickly as we build our infrastructure to deliver, as quick as we're able to get the vaccines out to be delivered."" But former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Mr Drakeford's comments had been ""astonishing"". The Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales: ""I just find some of the excuses that have been made for why we are so behind in terms of vaccinating the over 80s - it just doesn't wash with our constituents I'm afraid ""When people in my constituency watch the television and they hear the first minister say 'this is not a sprint' when so many countries around the world are treating it exactly as that. ""The faster you roll out the vaccinations to the most vulnerable, ie the over 80s, the more lives that will be saved."" Of the 327,000 delivered vaccines, 280,000 are the Pfizer-BioNTech type that has to be stored at -70C. A total of 4.8% of the population has been vaccinated in Wales, the same as in Scotland. This compares with 6.2% in England and 6.6% in Northern Ireland. At the weekend the chairwoman of Wales' vaccination board Dr Gill Richardson, said the NHS was being supplied withas many vaccines as it could cope with. On Monday, Mr Drakeford told the Today programme the supply of the Pfizer vaccine had to last until February and was not being used all at once. ""There will be no point, and certainly it will be logistically very damaging, to try to use all of that in the first week and then to have all our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do for another month,"" he said. ""The sensible thing to do is to use the vaccine you've got over the period that you've got it for so that your system can absorb it, they can go on working."" This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? In a video he later posted on Twitter he said: ""Let me be completely clear, nobody is holding back vaccines. ""All our health boards are receiving doses of Pfizer as quickly as they can use it."" The British Medical Association (BMA) Wales tweeted it was ""extremely concerned"" about ""spacing out the Pfizer vaccine to make it last until the next delivery"". ""If Pfizer vaccines are available, second dose must be given to HCWs [health care workers] within the maximum 42-day timeline and all remaining vaccinations for staff must be accelerated,"" it said. The Welsh Government'svaccine strategy,externalpledges everyone will be offered a jab by autumn. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The NHS is vaccinating people in order of clinical risk, largely based on age groups from old to young. As the roll-out ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, thefirst pharmacy gave the Covid jab. The Welsh Government said on Monday it was ""on course"" to complete 70% of vaccinations for over 80s and care home residents by the weekend. It also confirmed that all ambulance staff had been offered the vaccine, and the ambulance service said so far more than 60% had had it. NHS given 'as many vaccines as it can cope with' Ambulance service still 'under extreme pressure' Nurseries 'teetering on the edge' during pandemic In a statement, a government spokesman said: ""The Pfizer vaccine comes in large packs, which cannot be split and must be stored at ultra-low temperatures - at -70C. There are only two centres in Wales where we can keep them at this temperature. ""Once removed from storage, the vaccine lasts five days. Every dose wasted is a vaccine which cannot be given to someone in Wales. ""We want to ensure a consistent supply of the vaccine to minimise wastage."" At a coronavirus briefing on Monday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams also said ministers were not holding back on supplies. ""We are distributing Pfizer in a careful way to ensure there is infrastructure in Wales to deliver it safely and most efficiently, avoiding wastage because it is such a precious resource,"" she said. But Paul Davies, Conservative group leader in the Senedd, said his inbox had been ""bombarded by people who are very, very angry"" about the pace of the roll-out. ""Suggesting that holding back the vaccine for a period of time so vaccinators aren't standing around doing nothing is absolutely preposterous,"" he said. We've heard from two senior government ministers this morning - one of them the first minister - and received different explanations of what the strategy is for vaccine roll-out. The first minister talked about having to make the Pfizer vaccine last until February, otherwise vaccinators would be standing around with nothing to do. His education minister today denied that Welsh Government was doing anything to delay the use of the Pfizer vaccine - she talked about the need to go faster and to build up infrastructure and minimise wastage. People in vulnerable groups keen to know when they'll be receiving their jab won't be reassured by the lack of a coherent message. Plaid Cymru health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth MS said: ""Wales appears now to be dramatically behind England in terms of vaccine roll-out, so to see the first minister being relaxed about the slow pace of the vaccine roll-out here is very, very frustrating. Why are we rationing here?"" UK government vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, when asked about the strategy in Wales, said his view for England was to use up supply and ensure it ""doesn't sit on a shelf or in a fridge"". There are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca. A third vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna -but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. There will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated where they live,about 250 GP practices across the country,externalwill be able to administer the jab by the end of January. Ms Williams said that there would be 45 mass vaccination centres delivering the Pfizer jab by the end of the week. LOCKDOWN LEARNING:Resources and programmes on BBC iPlayer to support learners, teachers and parents during lockdown BBC BITESIZE:Help is at hand for your homeschooling needs As of Monday, theCardiff and Valehealth board said it had vaccinated more than 24,000 people, including nearly 19,000 health, social care and care home staff, nearly 600 care home residents and nearly 3,000 other people aged over 80. Cwm Taf Morgannwghealth board in south Wales said it had vaccinated nearly 17,000 people as of Friday, and aimed to give all 100,000 people in the top priority groups at least a first dose by mid-February. TheHywel Ddahealth board serving west Wales said on Monday it had given more than 18,000 vaccinations, including jabs to 42% of healthcare workers, 38% of care home staff, 25% of care home residents and just under 9% of people over 80. Powys Teaching health boardsaid letters should arrive by Tuesday to everyone aged over 80 inviting them to get a vaccination, with more than 7,000 people in the priority groups having received their first dose. TheSwansea Bayboard said it was ""on target"" to vaccinate all care home residents with a first dose by the end of January and that all over-80s would be offered a vaccine ""over the coming weeks"" In north Wales, theBetsi Cadwaladrboard said it aimed to vaccinate 90% of the priority groups by the end of January. In south east Wales, theAneurin Bevanboard's most recent update from 11 January said that in its 94 care homes for elderly people all residents had been vaccinated in 34 homes and all staff in 63.

Poisoned Putin critic Navalny to be kept in custody,"This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities Russia's leading opposition figure has been arrested and detained for 30 days, after returning to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year. Alexei Navalny said a court ruling held inside a police station was a mockery and called for street protests. Dozens of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow police station where he was being held and shouted ""disgrace"" and ""Putin resign"". Mr Navalny was held soon after his flight from Germany arrived on Sunday. Russian prosecutors say he violated the parole terms of a suspended sentence for embezzlement. He says the charges are politically motivated. Last August, Mr Navalny, 44, was almost killed in a nerve agent attack, which he blamed personally on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life On Sunday, big crowds gathered at Moscow's Vnukovo airport to greet Mr Navalny's flight from Berlin - but in a last-minute decision the authorities re-routed the plane to another airport in the capital. A makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night. Dozens of people gathered outside the Khimki police station in freezing weather, demanding for Mr Navalny to be released Mr Navalny (centre) was later seen led away by officers from the police station The judge ordered Mr Navalny's detention until 15 February for violating his parole. He will have another hearing on 29 January to determine whether his suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years should be replaced with a jail term. Mr Navalny said his treatment was beyond a ""mockery of justice"" and described the hearing as ""lawlessness of the highest grade"". ""Don't be afraid. Take to the streets, not for me, but for yourselves, for your future,""he said in a video address (in Russian) from the police station.,external A crowd of about 200 Navalny supporters gathered outside the police station in freezing weather, demanding his immediate release. Mr Navalny was later seen led away by police to one of Moscow's prisons. His lawyer, Vadim Kobzev, said they would appeal against the ""illegal"" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. Meanwhile, more than 70 Navalny supporters and journalists were detained across Russia on Monday, according to the Monitoring group OVD-Info. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner and the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race, but was barred because of an embezzlement conviction that he says was politically motivated An outspoken blogger, he has millions of Russian followers on social media and managed to get some supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020 The US and European Union led calls for Mr Navalny to be freed, but stopped short of threatening any punitive action. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russian authorities were trying to silence their critics, while incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Kremlin's ""attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard"". France, Italy, Germany and the president of the European Commission were also among those calling for his release. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described Mr Navalny's arrest as ""appalling"". ""Rather than persecuting Mr Navalny, Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil,"" he said. As Mr Navalny gradually recovered after emergency medical treatment in Germany, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday, he made good on that pledge, boarding a flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. Alexei Navalny travelled to Moscow with his wife Yulia The plane was packed with journalists, including from the BBC. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for ""technical reasons"", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport, where thousands of Navalny supporters had gathered, to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. A number of people were detained by riot police. Liza Shuvalova, BBC News There had always been a feeling Flight DP936 from Berlin to Moscow with Alexei Navalny on board would not go according to plan. So when the captain announced that the plane would be diverted to a different airport, Mr Navalny shouted his apology to everyone on board, many of whom were journalists. After a ride in a bus from the plane to the airport, he told us he was not afraid and was very happy to return home. As he approached passport control with his wife Yulia, he said to the border control officer with a smile: ""You must have been waiting for me for a long time!"" And it was probably true. A few moments later, he was asked by policemen to accompany them or they would have to use ""force"". Mr Navalny wanted his lawyer Olga Mikhailova - who was on the same flight - to go with him. But at that point, she had already crossed the border and was not allowed back airside as Mr Navalny was led away. Russia's prison service said the opposition leader ""had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period"" related to his suspended sentence for embezzlement. Separately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Mr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of targeting him with spurious cases. Mr Navalny collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The flight was diverted to the city of Omsk, where he was admitted to hospital. He was airlifted to Germany in an induced coma. European experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War. Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Last month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years. Mr Navalny later said he hadduped an FSB agent into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation,which he recorded and posted online. The FSB said the recording was ""fake"". President Putin hasdismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groupsthat have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as ""a trick"". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services.

Neville leaves role as England managerPhil Neville leaves his role as manager of England's women and is set to take over at Major League Soccer side Inter Miami.BBC Sport,"This video can not be played Highlights: England lose to Spain in Neville's last game in charge Phil Neville has left his role as manager of England's women and been appointed in charge of David Beckham's Major League Soccer side Inter Miami. The 43-year-old was appointed as England boss in January 2018 and his contract was set to end in July. The Football Association says it will ""shortly confirm"" an interim head coach until Sarina Wiegman's arrival. Netherlands manager Wiegman will take on the role after the delayed Tokyo Olympics in August. Former Manchester United and Everton defender Neville was the leading contender to manage Great Britain at the Games, but hismove to the United Stateshas left the FA needing another option. ""This is a very young club with a lot of promise and upside, and I am committed to challenging myself, my players and everyone around me to grow and build a competitive soccer culture we can all be proud of,"" Neville said of his American move. Beckham said of his former Manchester United team-mate: ""I have known Phil since we were both teenagers at the academy. ""We share a footballing DNA having been trained by some of the best leaders in the game, and it's those values that I have always wanted running through our club."" The MLS side had been managed by former Uruguay striker Diego Alonso before the 45-year-old left by mutual consent earlier this month. Beckham added: ""Anyone who has played or worked with Phil knows he is a natural leader, and I believe now is the right time for him to join."" Allow Twitter content?

England's struggles under Neville continued at the 2020 SheBelieves Cup, where a late defeat by Spain in the final match was their seventh loss in 11 games. The Lionesses have not played since that game last March because of the coronavirus pandemic.

Neville, who had no previous experience in the women's game before taking over, has made a ""significant contribution"" during his three-year spell, said Baroness Campbell, the FA's director of women's football.

""Given his status as a former Manchester United and England player, he did much to raise the profile of our team. ""He has used his platform to champion the women's game, worked tirelessly to support our effort to promote more female coaches and used his expertise to develop many of our younger players."" The FA is expected to name England's interim head coach in the next few days.

Neville leaves role as England manager,"This video can not be played Highlights: England lose to Spain in Neville's last game in charge Phil Neville has left his role as manager of England's women and been appointed in charge of David Beckham's Major League Soccer side Inter Miami. The 43-year-old was appointed as England boss in January 2018 and his contract was set to end in July. The Football Association says it will ""shortly confirm"" an interim head coach until Sarina Wiegman's arrival. Netherlands manager Wiegman will take on the role after the delayed Tokyo Olympics in August. Former Manchester United and Everton defender Neville was the leading contender to manage Great Britain at the Games, but hismove to the United Stateshas left the FA needing another option. ""This is a very young club with a lot of promise and upside, and I am committed to challenging myself, my players and everyone around me to grow and build a competitive soccer culture we can all be proud of,"" Neville said of his American move. Beckham said of his former Manchester United team-mate: ""I have known Phil since we were both teenagers at the academy. ""We share a footballing DNA having been trained by some of the best leaders in the game, and it's those values that I have always wanted running through our club."" The MLS side had been managed by former Uruguay striker Diego Alonso before the 45-year-old left by mutual consent earlier this month. Beckham added: ""Anyone who has played or worked with Phil knows he is a natural leader, and I believe now is the right time for him to join."" Allow Twitter content?

Neville led the Lionesses to their first SheBelieves Cup title in 2019and fourth place at the Women's World Cup later the same year, but results since that tournament have been poor. England's struggles under Neville continued at the 2020 SheBelieves Cup, where a late defeat by Spain in the final match was their seventh loss in 11 games. The Lionesses have not played since that game last March because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""It has been an honour to manage England and I have enjoyed three of the best years of my career,"" said Neville, who won 19 of his 35 games in charge.

""They have challenged me and improved me as a coach, and I am very grateful to them for the fantastic memories we have shared."" Neville, who had no previous experience in the women's game before taking over, has made a ""significant contribution"" during his three-year spell, said Baroness Campbell, the FA's director of women's football. ""The commitment, dedication and respect he has shown the position has been clear to see,"" she added. ""I will personally miss our many conversations about ways we can improve and progress."" 'We didn't see Neville's philosophy adapt' - Alex Scott column England are ranked sixth in the world, having been third when Neville succeeded Mark Sampson.

""Given his status as a former Manchester United and England player, he did much to raise the profile of our team. ""He has used his platform to champion the women's game, worked tirelessly to support our effort to promote more female coaches and used his expertise to develop many of our younger players."" The FA is expected to name England's interim head coach in the next few days.

"Poisoned Putin critic Navalny detained for 30 daysIt follows his dramatic return to Russia, five months after a nerve agent attack almost killed him.Europe","This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities Russia's leading opposition figure has been arrested and detained for 30 days, after returning to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year. Alexei Navalny said a court ruling held inside a police station was a mockery and called for street protests. Dozens of his supporters gathered outside the Moscow police station where he was being held and shouted ""disgrace"" and ""Putin resign"". Mr Navalny was held soon after his flight from Germany arrived on Sunday. Russian prosecutors say he violated the parole terms of a suspended sentence for embezzlement. He says the charges are politically motivated. Last August, Mr Navalny, 44, was almost killed in a nerve agent attack, which he blamed personally on Russian President Vladimir Putin. The Kremlin denies involvement. The opposition politician's allegations have, however, been backed up by reports from investigative journalists. 'Let him go!' - Navalny activists defy bitter cold Alexei Navalny: Russia's vociferous Putin critic Two hours that saved Alexei Navalny's life On Sunday, big crowds gathered at Moscow's Vnukovo airport to greet Mr Navalny's flight from Berlin - but in a last-minute decision the authorities re-routed the plane to another airport in the capital. A makeshift courtroom was organised on Monday at a police station in Khimki, on the outskirts of Moscow, where Mr Navalny had spent the night. Dozens of people gathered outside the Khimki police station in freezing weather, demanding for Mr Navalny to be released Mr Navalny (centre) was later seen led away by officers from the police station The judge ordered Mr Navalny's detention until 15 February for violating his parole. He will have another hearing on 29 January to determine whether his suspended sentence of three-and-a-half years should be replaced with a jail term. Mr Navalny said his treatment was beyond a ""mockery of justice"" and described the hearing as ""lawlessness of the highest grade"". ""Don't be afraid. Take to the streets, not for me, but for yourselves, for your future,""he said in a video address (in Russian) from the police station.,external A crowd of about 200 Navalny supporters gathered outside the police station in freezing weather, demanding his immediate release. Mr Navalny was later seen led away by police to one of Moscow's prisons. His lawyer, Vadim Kobzev, said they would appeal against the ""illegal"" court decision, according to Russia's Interfax news agency. Meanwhile, more than 70 Navalny supporters and journalists were detained across Russia on Monday, according to the Monitoring group OVD-Info. Mr Navalny is an anti-corruption campaigner and the most prominent face of Russian opposition to President Vladimir Putin He attempted to stand in the 2018 presidential race, but was barred because of an embezzlement conviction that he says was politically motivated An outspoken blogger, he has millions of Russian followers on social media and managed to get some supporters elected to local councils in Siberia in 2020 The US and European Union led calls for Mr Navalny to be freed, but stopped short of threatening any punitive action. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said Russian authorities were trying to silence their critics, while incoming national security adviser Jake Sullivan said the Kremlin's ""attacks on Mr Navalny are not just a violation of human rights, but an affront to the Russian people who want their voices heard"". France, Italy, Germany and the president of the European Commission were also among those calling for his release. UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab described Mr Navalny's arrest as ""appalling"". ""Rather than persecuting Mr Navalny, Russia should explain how a chemical weapon came to be used on Russian soil,"" he said. As Mr Navalny gradually recovered after emergency medical treatment in Germany, he said he intended to return to Russia. On Sunday, he made good on that pledge, boarding a flight despite warnings he would face arrest on landing. Alexei Navalny travelled to Moscow with his wife Yulia The plane was packed with journalists, including from the BBC. Shortly before landing, the pilot announced that for ""technical reasons"", the plane was being diverted from Vnukovo airport, where thousands of Navalny supporters had gathered, to Sheremetyevo airport, causing a stir among the passengers. A number of people were detained by riot police. Liza Shuvalova, BBC News There had always been a feeling Flight DP936 from Berlin to Moscow with Alexei Navalny on board would not go according to plan. So when the captain announced that the plane would be diverted to a different airport, Mr Navalny shouted his apology to everyone on board, many of whom were journalists. After a ride in a bus from the plane to the airport, he told us he was not afraid and was very happy to return home. As he approached passport control with his wife Yulia, he said to the border control officer with a smile: ""You must have been waiting for me for a long time!"" And it was probably true. A few moments later, he was asked by policemen to accompany them or they would have to use ""force"". Mr Navalny wanted his lawyer Olga Mikhailova - who was on the same flight - to go with him. But at that point, she had already crossed the border and was not allowed back airside as Mr Navalny was led away. Russia's prison service said the opposition leader ""had been wanted since 29 December 2020 for repeated violations of the probation period"" related to his suspended sentence for embezzlement. Separately, Russian prosecutors have launched a new criminal case against Mr Navalny on fraud charges related to transfers of money to various charities, including his Anti-Corruption Foundation. Mr Navalny accuses Mr Putin of targeting him with spurious cases. Mr Navalny collapsed on a plane flying from Tomsk in Siberia to Moscow. The flight was diverted to the city of Omsk, where he was admitted to hospital. He was airlifted to Germany in an induced coma. European experts later said he had been poisoned with the extremely toxic chemical weapon Novichok, developed by Soviet scientists in the Cold War. Report names 'Russian agents' in Navalny poisoning Last month, investigative reporters named three agents of Russia's FSB security service who had travelled to Tomsk at the time Mr Navalny was there, and said the specialist unit had tailed him for years. Mr Navalny later said he hadduped an FSB agent into revealing details of the operation against him in a phone conversation,which he recorded and posted online. The FSB said the recording was ""fake"". President Putin hasdismissed investigations by the Bellingcat website and other groupsthat have blamed Russian intelligence agents for the attack as ""a trick"". He has alleged his rival is backed by US intelligence services.

Chip-shortage 'crisis' halts car productionA shortage of computer chips is leading to car factories shutting down for days at a time.,"Audi factories, like others, will make thousands fewer cars at the start of this year Audi is having to slow production because of a computer-chip shortage it is calling a ""crisis upon a crisis"". Boss Markus Duesmann said it was now aiming to make 10,000 fewer cars in the first quarter of the year and putting more than 10,000 workers on furlough. Its parent company, Volkswagen, announced its own go-slow due to a lack of chips last week, alongside rivals such as Honda. Mr Duesmann told the Financial Times,externalcarmakers had been caught by surprise. After a poor start to 2020 for new car sales, manufacturers cut their orders from the Chinese factories making computer chips. But then, at the end of the year, ""everybody was quite surprised by the strength of the market"", Mr Duesmann said. However, ordering new chips is not simple. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber said: ""Semiconductors have a broad range of applications but a very limited pool of companies capable of manufacturing the silicon. ""Demand is high, and supply is tight"" and any sudden needs ""can prove very difficult to accommodate"". Chinese drone and chip makers added to US blacklist US turns up heat on China's biggest chip-maker ""Modern cars are becoming computers on wheels, with an abundance of silicon required to control everything from the infotainment system to camera, radar and lidar,"" he said. The demand from carmakers ""competes for manufacturing capacity with smartphones, servers and a host of other segments"". And a boom in the market for devices such as PCs and new game consoles was making it doubly difficult to book manufacturing time. The shortages have seen Mercedes-maker Daimler, Fiat, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Subaru and  Toyota all reportedly suspend production for days or weeks at a time. And German car-parts company Continental described ""largescale supply shortages"", with lead times of six to nine months, adding bottlenecks were expected to continue ""well into 2021, causing major disruptions"".

Chip-shortage 'crisis' halts car productionA shortage of computer chips is leading to car factories shutting down for days at a time.TechnologyComments,"Audi factories, like others, will make thousands fewer cars at the start of this year Audi is having to slow production because of a computer-chip shortage it is calling a ""crisis upon a crisis"". Boss Markus Duesmann said it was now aiming to make 10,000 fewer cars in the first quarter of the year and putting more than 10,000 workers on furlough. Its parent company, Volkswagen, announced its own go-slow due to a lack of chips last week, alongside rivals such as Honda. Mr Duesmann told the Financial Times,externalcarmakers had been caught by surprise. After a poor start to 2020 for new car sales, manufacturers cut their orders from the Chinese factories making computer chips. But then, at the end of the year, ""everybody was quite surprised by the strength of the market"", Mr Duesmann said. However, ordering new chips is not simple. CCS Insight analyst Geoff Blaber said: ""Semiconductors have a broad range of applications but a very limited pool of companies capable of manufacturing the silicon. ""Demand is high, and supply is tight"" and any sudden needs ""can prove very difficult to accommodate"". Chinese drone and chip makers added to US blacklist US turns up heat on China's biggest chip-maker ""Modern cars are becoming computers on wheels, with an abundance of silicon required to control everything from the infotainment system to camera, radar and lidar,"" he said. The demand from carmakers ""competes for manufacturing capacity with smartphones, servers and a host of other segments"". And a boom in the market for devices such as PCs and new game consoles was making it doubly difficult to book manufacturing time. The shortages have seen Mercedes-maker Daimler, Fiat, Ford, Honda, Nissan, Subaru and  Toyota all reportedly suspend production for days or weeks at a time. And German car-parts company Continental described ""largescale supply shortages"", with lead times of six to nine months, adding bottlenecks were expected to continue ""well into 2021, causing major disruptions"".

Some critical care wards full across England,"Staff are in ""the eye of the storm"" amid the coronavirus pandemic, the NHS says Ten hospital trusts across England consistently reported having no spare adult critical care beds in the most recent figures. It comes as hospital waiting times, coronavirus admissions and patients requiring intensive care are rising. England's 140 acute trusts had 5,503 adult critical care beds on 10 January, with 4,632 in use. NHS bosses have warned hospitals could ""hit the limit"" of their capacity this week. ""I think, this next week, we will be at the limit of what we probably have the physical space and the people to safely do,"" Danny Mortimer, the chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said. ""And, of course, this is the week when we expect also the highest rate of admissions, the highest demand for the care that we're providing."" The latest figures from NHS England show the number of trusts that were, on average, at full capacity in adult critical care across an entire week rose from four to 10 in the week to 10 January. This was the highest number in the last 10 weeks for which data was available. The increase comes despite trusts adding an additional 50% ""surge"" capacity across the summer and autumn to cope with winter pressures, according to NHS England. Overall, 30 acute hospital trusts in England had no spare adult critical care beds on 10 January alone. But daily admissions figures can vary from day-to-day as patients move in and out of intensive care. Speaking on the Andrew Marr Show on Sunday, NHS England chief executive Sir Simon Stevens said nine critical care patients had recently been transferred to other parts of the country because of no beds being available in their local area. Speaking about all admissions, Sir Simon said hospitals in England had seen an increase of 15,000 inpatients since Christmas Day. ""That's the equivalent of filling 30 hospitals full of coronavirus patients and staggeringly every 30 seconds across England another patient is being admitted to hospital with coronavirus,"" he added. Helen Buckingham, from Health think-tank The Nuffield Trust, said the NHS was facing a winter ""like no other"" and, on top of rising coronavirus hospital admissions, critical care beds were also required for non-Covid patients. ""The NHS has pulled out all the stops to create more beds this year, and hospitals are working together so that patients who need critical care can be moved to other hospitals as necessary - but without more fully trained critical care staff there isn't much further the service can go,"" she said. The figures only tell part of the story. The creation of extra beds to cope with rising numbers of Covid patients has come at a price. Critical care beds have been set up in overspill areas including departments usually reserved for operations. What is more, there is no extra staff to look after these extra patients - so specialist intensive care nurses have been stretched across more patients than normal. Instead of providing one-to-one care for the most sick, some areas are seeing  nurses looking after three or four patients. Staff from other areas have had to be redeployed into critical care departments too. That of course comes at a cost to non-Covid services and is part of the reason we have seen planned surgery and even cancer care being cut back on. A leaked email recently revealedabout 200 doctors would be redeployedto Queen Elizabeth Hospital in Birmingham amid fears its intensive care unit could be ""overwhelmed"". University Hospitals Birmingham NHS Trust said it had ""significantly"" more patients in hospital with Covid-19 than in April last year. The trust had 147 critical care beds available across its hospitals as of 10 January, all of which were full as of the latest figures. This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? A spokesman said the trust would continue to extend its intensive care teams ""so they are able to treat the rising number of Covid-19 patients and those who require time-critical surgery, including cancer operations"". Airedale NHS Foundation Trust, despite having nine critical care beds overall, said it did not normally experience full occupancy at this time in the year and the ward had both Covid and non-Covid patients. ""We are experiencing normal winter pressures across the trust, combined with an increasing number of Covid-19 patients, particularly over the last week,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Every bed in ICU that is occupied by a Covid-19 patient is one less available for people who need that level of care for other reasons."" Covid patients moved from London to Newcastle Early signs of Covid restrictions working How many coronavirus cases are there in your area? Sir Simon said the current number of patients in critical care was a ""clear indication of the huge pressure on the NHS"", including ambulance and mental health services as well as hospitals. ""The likelihood is, even with a stabilising of infections in some parts of the country, we're still seeing increases in infections among the over-60s in many parts of the country,"" he added. ""The forecasts are the pressure on hospitals will only get more intense over the next several weeks."" NHS England said critical care services were under ""unprecedented pressure"". A spokeswoman added that hospitals had ""tried and tested plans in place"" to manage pressure from increased Covid-19 and non-Covid patients, including mutual aid practices where hospitals work together to manage admissions.

Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison, Gavin Stamp, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Julian Joyce, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. We are pausing our coronavirus live page for now, but weâll
be back on Tuesday morning. Hereâs a recap of todayâs main stories: Doctors giving Covid vaccinations say it has been ""challenging"" when deliveries of the jab arrived with only a few hours' notice. The centre has been set up at the JCB factory in Rocester, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire by several GP practices in Cheadle. The medics say they can get through about 900 jabs a day but Dr David Yates told the BBC they often get about 12 hours' notice of new stocks arriving. ""Yesterday we suddenly got told we had 900 vaccines, which is a whole other batch of the Pfizer ones,"" he said. ""I think by last night we had 170 people booked in ready with people frantically on the phones all day."" MPs have voted to extend the temporary Â£20 a week increase to universal credit introduced at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and due to stop at the start of April. The Labour motion backing an extension passed by 278 votes to none, but it is not binding. The government - which dismissed the vote as a stunt - ordered its MPs to abstain. Labour says ministers have missed an opportunity to give families certainty and help the economy. Read more here Tougher lockdown rules across Europe, the closure of air corridors, and uncertainty about travel now the UK has left the EU, have piled more pressure on the airline industry at the start of 2021. But EasyJet says bookings for this summer with its holidays arm are up 250% on last season, fuelling the airline industry's hopes of pent up demand for when lockdown restrictions ease. Its chief executive Johan Lundgren tells the BBC it offers confidence for the travel market post-coronavirus. ""We know that people want to go on holiday as soon as they can,"" he says, adding that May is currently the most popular month for holiday bookings. Earlier Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked if people can plan their holidays yet. He replied that he will go to Cornwall for a summer break, saying ""we have got a lot of work to do by then"". Read more here  A health chief says Covid-19 deniers are ""ridiculous"". Dr Lisa McNally, director of public health for Sandwell in the West Midlands, has also criticised people who are sceptical about the vaccines being used to fight the coronavirus. She says despite social media abuse, she will continue to tell people the truth about the seriousness of the pandemic, and how jabs are a ""safe and effective reaction"" to it. This video can not be played Covid-19: Sandwell health boss says deniers 'ridiculous' Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although it has been common to hear and see the impact on care
homes internationally throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, one country where such insight has been rare is China. Private care homes have been growing in popularity in China in
recent years, but there are some stigmas associated with the industry. In China, many view nursing homes as going against the
cultural concept of âfilial pietyâ. This is the belief that the young should
respect for and care for their elders, and so many believe the elderly should
live with their children, and not live in care homes. However, as cases of the virus grow in the northeast of the
country, the official broadcaster CCTV has offered viewers a rare insight into how Chinaâs elderly in these facilities are being protected. A journalist today has visited the Shijiazhuang Nursing Home.
Shijiazhuang is the Chinese city that has beenhardest hit by the virus in recent weeks. In a 30-minute livestream in which he is clad in hazmat suit and
visor, journalist Gu Junling introduces viewers to how the facilities are kept
safe, and shows viewers inside the care homeâs stockrooms, packed with ample
provisions for its residents. Many of the residents seem happy to speak to the journalist and talk
about how they are healthy, and happy. Masks are mandatory for both residents
and staff, even in the areas outside on-site. However, far from being kept
under house arrest, residents are shown to have sufficient space to go outside,
use computers and games rooms. Many of us are desperately hoping coronavirus vaccines will soon transport us back to our pre-Covid lives. But many scientists are warning that their arrival probably won't mean throwing our face masks in the bin anytime soon. Take a lookat our explainer here, from our visual journalism team, for more on when we might be back to any kind of normality. As we've heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the latest coronavirus statistics at today's Downing Street press briefing. The number of people in hospital with the virus is at its highest level yet - at 37,435 - he says. It comes as the daily case numbers in the UK have begun to fall. There were another 37,535 positive cases reported and a further 599 people died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. However, figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Cases of coronavirus have fallen by almost a quarter across the UK in the last week, showing that the current lockdown is having an effect. But hospital admissions are still rising. Ten hospital trusts across England have reported having no spare critical care beds - despite extra capacity being added. The BBC's Clive Myrie has been to the Royal London Hospital and spent time with staff struggling to cope, as well as one family experiencing the grief this pandemic is causing. There are some upsetting scenes in his report. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Don't end up like us, please' The world is on the brink of a ""catastrophic moral failure"" in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned. Global health leaders say at least 49 richer countries have given 39 million doses of vaccine. But just 25 people have been vaccinated in one poorer country. The WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for equitable distribution of the vaccine. ""The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries,"" he told the WHO's executive board meeting. He says it's not right that younger, healthier adults in rich countries are vaccinated before health workers and older people in poorer countries. The UK has helped to raise one billion dollars, for global vaccine sharing fund Covax, through match-funding other donors, the government announced. This, combined with Â£548 million of UK aid, will help distribute one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year, officials said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press briefing: ""I absolutely agree with Dr Tedros on the importance of a global rollout and we in the UK can be proud of what we are doing to support that happening financially."" Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Remember at the start of the pandemic the prime minister and the chancellor said they would ""put their arms around"" everyone at a time of genuine emergency. Even then it was a political promise that seemed unlikely to be kept. But as the health nightmare of Covid-19 unfolded, the country's doors closed and the economy took a thumping, ministers presided over a massive and very expensive expansion of the state. That included raising the amount of universal credit, the benefit that's paid to about six million people on low incomes or out of work, by Â£20 a week. With the basic level of the benefit starting at about Â£340 a month for single people under 25, that money has made a real difference. As one recipient, Carl Hackshaw from Croydon, told me on Monday, that increase meant that he's gone from""having to go without to having barely enough"". The looming political problem for the government is that the Â£20 top-up is due to stop at the end of March.

We are on the route out"". Watch his remarks at today's Downing Street press briefing above. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The
Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million
people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to
start with â the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have
now been vaccinated. In
some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in
England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s
in for vaccination. The
progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination
rates globally. Challenges
remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the
Pfizer-BioNTech will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have
an impact. While
the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UKâs
supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and it will
mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers
are confident the mid-February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine
will not be affected â there is already enough
vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is
such nervousness about supply chains.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock led this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. Here are some of the key points from the briefing.  It is difficult to know when schools can reopen, Dr Susan Hopkins says. ""We monitor data on a daily basis and review it looking at when and what we think might be able to happen next,"" says the NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser. ""We've always said schools should be the last to close and the first to open, but giving a defined date on that is very difficult until we see what happens over the next few weeks,"" she says. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said
that some areas have had a very high uptake in the vaccine for the over-80s and
care homes. This is why those areas are now
ready to offer vaccinations to over-70s. Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim
Zahawi pointed to some of those areas this morning - including 90% of over-80s
in Yateley receiving their first dose and 89% in Cheltenham. However, we canât give you a full
picture of which areas will see this expansion because the government has
not yet released localised data on vaccinations to the public, despite
ministers referring to the statistics throughout the day. There are certainly regional
variations for the vaccinations for the over-80s. The latest figures broken down by
age and region, up to 10 January, showed that 46% of the over-80s in the North
East and Yorkshire had been vaccinated. This is compared to 29% of people
in the East of England. Gareth Iacobucci from the British Medical Journal says doctors face making ""unimaginable decisions"" about who to treat, given the strain on hospitals which - he says - are basically full up. He asks the health secretary whether the law will be changed to prevent doctors and other NHS staff from being subject of legal actions and potentially being sued for unlawful killing if they are forced to prioritise some patients over others. Mr Hancock says this is a serious concern of his, and notes a letter he received on the issue on Sunday. But at the moment he says the NHS has not been overwhelmed yet and doctors do not have to make those kind of decisions, and he hopes they will not have to. Changing the law is not necessary at the moment, he says, while stressing the situation will be kept under review. Matt Hancock says he is going to Cornwall for his summer holidays and says: ""I think we are going to have a great British summer."" He adds: ""We have got a lot of work to do by then but we have got a line of sight to vaccinating everyone by September and anything beyond that would be a bonus."" Earlier, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that restrictions could gradually begin to be eased from March as immunity starts to take effect in the groups vaccinated by mid-February. Hugo Gye from the i asks why there are fewer vaccines delivered at weekends and asks what the government is doing to provide a seven day service. The health secretary says: ""The vaccination programme is absolutely delivering a full seven day service, and, as you well know, we are prepared to go 24/7."" He adds that he ""wouldn't read too much into an individual day's data...over a week you will see it going up and going up fast."" Supply is the rate limiting factor, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Poisoned Putin critic Navalny jailed in Russia,"This video can not be played Alexei Navalny was filmed by the BBC saying goodbye to his wife and then being led away by authorities Russia's leading opposition figure has been arrested and detained for 30 days, after returning to Moscow for the first time since he was poisoned last year.

Man found 'living in airport for three months',"Aditya Singh lived undetected in a secure area of Chicago's international airport A man too afraid to fly due to the pandemic lived undetected in a secure area of Chicago's international airport for three months, US prosecutors say. Aditya Singh, 36, was arrested on Saturday after airline staff asked him to produce his identification. He pointed to a badge, but it allegedly belonged to an operations manager who reported it missing in October. Police say Mr Singh arrived on a flight from Los Angeles to O'Hare International Airport on 19 October. He reportedly found the staff badge in the airport and was ""scared to go home due to Covid"", Assistant State Attorney Kathleen Hagerty said,according to the Chicago Tribune.,external He managed to live on handouts from other passengers, she told the judge in the case. Cook County Judge Susana Ortiz expressed surprise at the circumstances of the case. ""So if I understand you correctly, you're telling me that an unauthorised, non-employee individual was allegedly living within a secure part of the O'Hare airport terminal from 19 October 2020 to 16 January 2021, and was not detected? I want to understand you correctly,"" she said to the prosecutor who outlined the allegations on Sunday. Mr Singh lives in a suburb of Los Angeles and does not have a criminal background, according to Assistant Public Defender Courtney Smallwood. It is not clear why he was in Chicago. He has been charged with felony criminal trespass to a restricted area of an airport and misdemeanour theft. He has been barred from entering the airport if he is able to post the $1,000 (Â£738) for bail. ""The court finds these facts and circumstances quite shocking for the alleged period of time that this occurred,"" Judge Ortiz said. ""Based upon the need for airports to be absolutely secure so that people feel safe to travel, I do find those alleged actions do make him a danger to the community."" The Chicago Department of Aviation, which oversees the city's airports, said in a statement: ""While this incident remains under investigation, we have been able to determine that this gentleman did not pose a security risk to the airport or to the travelling public.""

'Relentless' dog attack prompts deer park warningA red deer had to be put down after being savaged by a red setter in London's Richmond Park.London,"This video can not be played The deer had to be put down by a gamekeeper after the attack A warning has been issued by royal parks police after a dog carried out a ""relentless"" attack on a deer that had to be put down. Footage shows the dog savaging the red deer in London's Richmond Park. Cases of pets worrying deer in London'seight royal parks,externalhave shot up during lockdown, police say. They are urging owners to keep dogs on leads. Separately, on Sunday, a 10-year-old child was injured by a herd of deer being chased by a dog in Bushy Park. Police said the incident in the park in Richmond-upon-Thames, which left the child needing hospital treatment, underlined the need for people to keep their dogs on a lead if they are unsure how they will react to deer. On Friday, Franck Hiribarne, 44, from Kingston in south-west London, admitted causing or permitting an animal he was in charge of to injure another animal, in relation to the Richmond Park attack. Wimbledon magistrates heard the doe suffered deep wounds, then received a broken leg when it was hit by a car as it tried to flee from the dog. Witnesses described the attack as ""relentless"". The deer had to be put down by a gamekeeper after the attack in October. Mr Hiribarne, who reported the matter himself to the Royal Parks Office, said he usually walked his red setter Alfie on a lead until he was well away from any grazing deer, and that the dog had been responding well to ""off-lead"" commands. The dog owner, who was fined Â£600, said in a statement: ""I was genuinely shocked and sorry for what had happened and since then I have refrained completely from letting Alfie off the leash in any park. ""I have also taken a special dog trainer specialised in gundogs to control more accurately any of his hunting instincts. He has made great progress."" Four deer have died from dog attacks in the royal parks since March 2020, while there have been 58 incidents of dogs chasing the herds - a big increase on previous years - according to the manager of Richmond Park. Part of the increase is thought to be down to new dog owners who are unfamiliar with the best conduct around wildlife.

'Relentless' dog attack prompts deer park warning,"This video can not be played The deer had to be put down by a gamekeeper after the attack A warning has been issued by royal parks police after a dog carried out a ""relentless"" attack on a deer that had to be put down. Footage shows the dog savaging the red deer in London's Richmond Park. Cases of pets worrying deer in London'seight royal parks,externalhave shot up during lockdown, police say. They are urging owners to keep dogs on leads. Separately, on Sunday, a 10-year-old child was injured by a herd of deer being chased by a dog in Bushy Park. Police said the incident in the park in Richmond-upon-Thames, which left the child needing hospital treatment, underlined the need for people to keep their dogs on a lead if they are unsure how they will react to deer. On Friday, Franck Hiribarne, 44, from Kingston in south-west London, admitted causing or permitting an animal he was in charge of to injure another animal, in relation to the Richmond Park attack. Wimbledon magistrates heard the doe suffered deep wounds, then received a broken leg when it was hit by a car as it tried to flee from the dog. Witnesses described the attack as ""relentless"". The deer had to be put down by a gamekeeper after the attack in October. Mr Hiribarne, who reported the matter himself to the Royal Parks Office, said he usually walked his red setter Alfie on a lead until he was well away from any grazing deer, and that the dog had been responding well to ""off-lead"" commands. The dog owner, who was fined Â£600, said in a statement: ""I was genuinely shocked and sorry for what had happened and since then I have refrained completely from letting Alfie off the leash in any park. ""I have also taken a special dog trainer specialised in gundogs to control more accurately any of his hunting instincts. He has made great progress."" Four deer have died from dog attacks in the royal parks since March 2020, while there have been 58 incidents of dogs chasing the herds - a big increase on previous years - according to the manager of Richmond Park. Part of the increase is thought to be down to new dog owners who are unfamiliar with the best conduct around wildlife.

Github sorry for firing worker over 'Nazi' warning,"Software giant Github has apologised for firing a Jewish employee who warned co-workers to be careful about Nazis. The employee was fired two days after using the word to describe participants in the US Capitol riots. But Github now says that decision was a mistake, and its head of HR has resigned over the scandal. The company says it has offered the fired employee his job back, and clarified that ""employees are free to express concerns about Nazis"". Microsoft-owned Github is one of the most popular software development tools in the world, with more than 50 million users. News of the internal row was first reported by Business Insider. People associated with a range of extreme and far-right groups and supporters of fringe online conspiracy theoriesstormed Congress. As it happened, the Jewish employee posted to an internal Github Slack channel: ""Stay safe homies, Nazis are about."" But the comment sparked criticism from a co-worker about the use of the word ""Nazi"" to describe the rioters, calling it ""untasteful conduct"" for the workplace. Man holding Confederate flag in Capitol arrested What are far-right Trump supporters saying? The Jewish employee, who wished to remain anonymous,told Techcrunch he had been,external""genuinely concerned about his co-workers in the area, in addition to his Jewish family members"". Two days later, he was fired for his ""patterns of behaviour"". But the firing led to an outcry from many more co-workers, with hundreds signing an internal letter calling on Github to explain the decision - and to publicly denounce Nazis. Amid the outcry, the company opened an investigation with an external investigator. ""The investigation revealed significant errors of judgment and procedure,""chief executive Erica Brescia wrote in a blogpost.,external""Our head of HR has taken personal accountability and resigned from GitHub."" This video can not be played Joe Biden: ""Yesterday, in my view, was one of the darkest days in the history of our nation."" She said the firm had ""reversed the decision to separate with the employee"", and had contacted him - but it is not clear if the employee wishes to return after the treatment he received.

Trampoline prices 'to soar 50% on shipping costs',"Soaring shipping costs are likely to cause a bounce in the cost of trampolines in the UK this summer, according to one games retailer. James Owen, owner of Outdoor Toys, says high transport costs and port congestion may mean larger toys such as swings, trampolines and climbing frames will be more expensive. Trampoline prices could soar by 40-50%, he told BBC 5 Live's Wake Up to Money. ""The port congestion just keeps snowballing,"" he said. ""More and more issues keep arising,"" Mr Owen added. ""We can't get space out of China, there's a container shortage. ""Hauliers are really stretched, rates keep climbing."" His firm makes some products in the UK already and rising shipping costs will mean it will become economical to make more. ""For the first time ever, the ocean freight outweighs the cost of the item,"" in some cases, he said. Hauliers 'bypassing Welsh ports because of Brexit' 'Putting UK, not GB, delayed my fish for 24 hours' Demand for Chinese goods has soared around the world in recent months, placing a strain on existing shipping capacity. The price of shipping a 40-foot container on major world trade routes has almost tripled since a year ago,according to research firm Drewry,external. Hauliers in the UK are also charging more. It used to cost about Â£650 to haul a container from the port of Felixstowe to the company's site in mid-Wales, Mr Owen says. The cost is now up to Â£1,800 per container ""if you can get the haulier to take it,"" he says. Whether people will pay the premium for a new outdoor toy is ""a good question,"" he said. It emerged over the weekend thatIrish hauliers are bypassing Welsh ports to avoid Brexit bureaucracy. So-called ""teething problems"" with new export rules are causing ""enormous strain on staff"", according to one haulage company. But others warn of a longer-term shift by truck firms from using Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke Dock.

Trapped Chinese miners send note after seven days,"The miners are thought to be trapped about 600m (2,000ft) from the entrance Twelve miners trapped underground after an explosion in a Chinese gold mine a week ago are still alive. They sent back a note saying ""don't stop trying to reach us"" when rescuers seeking signs of life lowered down food rations taped to wire cable. A telephone connection has now been set up. The fate of another 10 men missing after the blast remains unclear. Mining accidents in China are not uncommon and are often due to poorly enforced safety regulations. The 22 were trapped at the Hushan mine near Yantai in eastern Shandong province on 10 January after an explosion damaged the exit and the communications system of the mine, which was still under construction. Most of the trapped miners are still alive, the handwritten note said Rescuers have spent days tapping and waiting for signs of survivors - until finally they felt pulling on ropes they had lowered into the mine. According to state media, rescuers managed to make contact with some of the miners through a long, thin communication shaft they had drilled from the surface. They later sent food, medicine, paper and pencils into the hole. According to the handwritten note they retrieved back from the shaft, 12 people are alive in the middle section of the mine. ""There are 11 others - one is injured, and the status of the remaining 10 is unclear,"" said the note-writer. In it he asks for pain killers and says they hope for a rescue, before ending with thanks to the rescue team. Later on Monday, Chen Fei, the deputy secretary of Shandong's Yantai city, said phone contact had also now been made with the trapped miners, who he said are ""currently very weak"". ""After we opened up the third shaft, it had a really excitable effect on the people connected. They were very confident and very hopeful that they would soon be able to get out of the mine,"" he told a news conference. ""We established they needed emergency medicines and equipment."" Rescue teams have been working round the clock to get the men out Two batches of provisions and one of medicine had been sent down the mine, which Mr Chen said were enough to last those trapped two days. As well as pain killers, the 12 miners had reportedly asked for anti-inflammatory drugs and medical tape for the injured. They also said there were high levels of underground water. One of the rescue workers said they were now racing to get the miners out. ""Next step, we'll continue to use life detectors and other equipment to contact those trapped underground. At the same time, we're speeding the clearing of the main shaft and drilling additional rescue holes."" Chinese media report there are also several other rescue shafts being drilled in the hope the workers - thought to be about 600m (2,000ft) from the entrance - can be evacuated. Initially, it took more than a day for the accident to be reported, meaning rescue teams lost precious time to start their attempt to reach the miners. Both the local Communist Party secretary and mayor have been sacked because of this 30-hour delay. The 29 miners who never came home Life after a devastating mining disaster Dozens feared dead as DR Congo gold mine caves in Mining accidents in China are often linked to poorly-enforced safety regulations. In December last year,23 miners died after a carbon monoxide leak at a coal mine. In September, 16 workers were killed at another mine on the outskirts of Chongqing when a conveyor belt caught fire, producing high levels of carbon monoxide. In December 2019,an explosion at a coal mine in Guizhou province, south-west China, killed at least 14 people.

US-bound migrant caravan beaten back in Guatemala,"This video can not be played WATCH: On Sunday security forces blocked the migrants' path, beating them back with truncheons and tear gas A group of US-bound Central American migrants has been met with truncheons and tear gas in Guatemala, where security forces blocked their path. Thousands of people were intercepted on a road near the border with Honduras on Sunday. The government said it would not accept ""illegal mass movements"". An estimated 7,000 migrants, mostly from Honduras, have entered in recent days, fleeing poverty and violence. They hope to travel on to Mexico, and then the US border. Every year, tens of thousands of Central American migrants attempt this perilous journey to try and reach the US, often on foot, in groups known as ""caravans"". President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, has vowed to end the strict immigration policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump, a Republican. Hurricanes leave Hondurans homeless and destitute Biden plans decree blitz to dump Trump policies Did Trump stop more people coming to the US? But the Biden administration, which will take office on Wednesday, has warned migrants not to make the journey, as immigration policies will not change overnight. As the migrants trekked across Guatemala towards its border with Mexico, they were slowed down by security forces near the south-eastern village of Vado Hondo. A group of soldiers and police officers blockaded a road, stopping many of them from advancing. Some people still attempted to force their way through, prompting security forces to push them back. Several people were injured. About 7,000 migrants, mostly from Honduras, are estimated to have arrived in Guatemala since Friday Many migrants retreated, with some waiting nearby to make a new attempt later. Others fled into nearby mountains. ""Fortunately the security forces established a contingency plan... and contained this battle,"" said Guillermo DÃ­az, head of Guatemala's migration agency. A statement from the Guatemalan president's office said: ""Guatemala's message is loud and clear: These types of illegal mass movements will not be accepted, that's why we are working together with the neighbouring nations to address this as a regional issue."" The government later said 21 migrants who had sought medical assistance tested positive for Covid-19. The migrants say persecution, violence and poverty are a daily reality in their home countries. Conditions have been made worse by the devastation wrought by two huge hurricanes that battered Central America last November. ""There is still mud everywhere there, everything got knocked down, we lost everything,"" Ismael Eliazar told the Associated Press news agency. The migrants are fleeing poverty and violence in their home countries So, in search of a better life, they want to reach the US in the hope of finding work and safety. Dania Hinestrosa, a 23-year-old travelling with her daughter, told the AFP news agency: ""We have no work, nor food, so I decided to go to the United States."" The promise of new immigration policies under Mr Biden's administration is also thought to have spurred some migrants to make an attempt to reach the US border. Members of Mr Biden's team have warned Central American migrants not to make dangerous journeys to the border. Speaking to NBC News,external, an unnamed senior Biden administration official said migrants attempting to claim asylum in the US ""need to understand they're not going to be able to come into the United States immediately"". The Biden administration will prioritise undocumented immigrants already living in the US, not those heading to the country now, the official said. ""Processing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off,"" Susan Rice, one of Mr Biden's policy advisers,told the Spanish language news agency Efe,externalin December. ""Migrants and asylum seekers should absolutely not believe those in the region selling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on day one. It will not."" Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, last week urged would-be migrants at the southern border not to ""waste your time and money"". The US commitment to the ""rule of law and public health"" is not affected by the change in administration, he said in a statement. More than a dozen of similar groups, some with thousands of migrants, have set off from Central America in recent years. One of the largest came from Honduras in October 2018, provoking President Trump to brand it ""an invasion"". But all have run up against resistance under Mr Trump, who put pressure on Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to crack down on illegal north-bound migration.

Extra Â£40m to help students amid Covid rent outcry,"Some students said they were paying Â£9,000 a year for ""anxiety, stress and isolation"" An extra Â£40m to help students struggling in the coronavirus pandemic will be given to Welsh universities amid outcry over rent and tuition fees. Hundreds of students threatened to withhold payments after beingunable to return to campus due to Covid rules. Universities had offered rebates to those affected ,but some students claimed they were not being treated fairly or getting enough support. The Welsh Government said it recognised the difficulties students had faced. Face-to-face teachinghas, in the main, been suspended and many students have remained at home following the Christmas break as coronavirus cases across Wales continued to rise. Staggered returns are being introduced in order to ""help stop the spread of the virus in student accommodation"", but a return to face-to-face learning has been delayed for most students amidWales' strict lockdown. Hundreds of Wales' students threaten rent strikes Â£9,000 for 'anxiety and stress' university degree University students 'selling clothes to pay rent' There are about 130,000 students at Wales' universities and some had called for support, saying it was unfair they were having to pay rent for rooms they could not live in and facilities they could not use. All universities have offered rebates or rent holidays to students living in university-run halls unable to return to campus. However, campaigners had said the offers were inadequate as only certain students were eligible - and many were struggling due to being unable to work part-time in bars and pubs to cover living costs. Some had spoken of having to sell clothes topay for food and rent after being unable to work alongside their studies. This video can not be played ""How am I going to afford to do my food shop... if I can't go to work?"" Emily Evans, a second year theatre and drama student at the University of South Wales in Cardiff, said she would use the money to pay off debts. ""I haven't really had the full experience of uni, especially as we're in a pandemic I can't really spend it anywhere else,"" she toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. ""It's kind of all up in the air at the moment, we're waiting for information as it comes through. We're kind of being told very last minute at the moment."" Drama student Emily Evans said students were not getting the full experience of university As a drama student, she said it was very difficult to study online, without face-to-face teaching. ""It's such a practical course and I signed up to be face-to-face, so I get it's unpredictable times but it's difficult because we have to act online and things are kind of different to what you think it would be,"" she said. ""That's not what I thought I would get out of the degree. I feel like we can't show our full potential and get what we need out of it because we're kind of stuck. ""It's such an unpredictable time we're in so I can't really be overly disappointed, but it's a lot to deal with because we're paying so much money to be there for it. ""It's Â£9,000 we're going to have to pay back one day for something we're not having the full experience of, so there is slight resentment because we're kind of on the back foot right now."" Wrexham students' union president Ebony Banks said the money was a ""huge relief"" to students Ebony Banks, president of Wrexham Glyndwr Students' Union, said: ""Obviously the Â£40m is a huge relief to not only institutions but students' unions as well."" She said as soon as more details on the money allocation were announced, the union would be ""working very closely with the institution to make sure that it goes into the best possible pockets and to ensure that the money goes where the students need it"". ""I think it's enough. It's definitely advantageous to students,"" she added. The National Union of Students welcomed the refunds for tens of thousands of students but added it was ""vital"" funding reached those living in private accommodation. ""The pandemic has exposed the fragility of the private rental market for students,"" NUS Wales president Becky Ricketts said. ""I will keep the pressure on the Welsh Government to strengthen protections for student renters longer term, such as more flexible notice periods."" Speaking at the Welsh Government's coronavirus briefing, Education Minister Kirsty Williams said students had suffered a huge amount of disruption this year ""especially as the effects of the pandemic has increased as we've moved into the winter months"". ""Despite the tremendous work of our universities, their staff, students, and volunteers, with additional testing and plans in place to make learning as safe as possible, the new Covid strain has unfortunately made it necessary to ask the majority of students to study at home for the time being,"" she said. ""This means that tens of thousands of students are now helping to keep Wales safe by staying away from campus. ""Many of our students have needed to pay for their term-time accommodation, while, for very important public health reasons, not being able to actually live there."" She added ""a large proportion of students are also unable to access the part-time jobs that they would normally rely on"" and so the new funding should be used to support ""students facing financial hardship, helping the students most affected by the pandemic"". The funding comes on top of Â£10m already allocated to help students facing financial hardship or needing mental health support during the pandemic. Also during the briefing, Ms Williams said she was ""deeply disappointed"" by the UK Government's decision to withdraw access to the EU's Erasmus university scheme, which helps students study in other countries. She said the UK alternative Turing scheme was a ""poor replacement"" and she would work with counterparts in the other devolved administrations to see if there was a way to rejoin Erasmus. She added Wales had provided ""the most generous student support package in Europe"" during the pandemic This video can not be played Cardiff University student Rowan Maddock describes her financial struggles Six of the seven universities in Wales have broadly welcomed the announcement, though were awaiting further information from Welsh Government. Cardiff University said the details of the funding were still being worked through and it would be able to update students once it received further information. Universities Wales, the group that represents Wales' universities, said lecturers and university staff had worked ""tirelessly to deliver a rewarding learning experience while also providing important pastoral and well-being support for students"". ""This additional funding will further support this work and make a real difference to students across Wales,"" chairwoman Prof Julie Lydon said. ''LILY: A TRANSGENDER STORY':We follow Lily as she transitions from male to female IN NEED OF SOME NEW SERIES TO BINGE IN LOCKDOWN?:Amazing worlds and spectacular stories, all filmed in Wales Bethan Sayed, Plaid Cymru spokeswoman for post-16 education, who had previously called for rent rebates, welcomed the extra funding. She said: ""I would expect some clarity from the Welsh Government, however, on the small print of this support, and who is eligible to receive funds, and ensure that those who are in private rented accommodation can be supported also."" Tory education spokeswoman Suzy Davies welcomed the funding but said it should be ""ringfenced"" for those in hardship. She added: ""Online learning cannot replace in-person teaching, with students unable to use the full resources that a university offers. ""The Welsh Government needs to ensure that universities can offer a partial refund for the current academic year, as well as ensuring that students can afford to continue to afford their courses in September."" There have been concerns for students isolated during the pandemic The Welsh Government said universities and student unions would be able to provide students with information about how to access support during the pandemic.

University tells students not to return to campus,"Aberystwyth University's vice chancellor told students not to attend lectures unless ""absolutely necessary"" Aberystwyth University has told its students not to return to campus following new advice from the Welsh Government. A phased return had been plannedfrom 11 January, but this has now been postponed. Vice-chancellor Prof Elizabeth Treasure said students should not attend the university, in Ceredigion, unless ""absolutely necessary."" On Friday the Welsh Government told learners""study from home if you can"",external. Ms Treasure said: ""We are reviewing our plans for in-person teaching and will inform you as soon as we can. Whilst we are reviewing those plans, we don't want students travelling to the university unnecessarily."" Calls for clarity for university students in Wales on return Â£9,000 for 'anxiety and stress' university degree She said there were certain exceptions, including students without internet access and those for whom laboratory access was essential. Wales' Education Minister, Kirsty Williams, said universities were reviewing their plans based on their individual circumstances. ""On return, students are also expected to take two asymptomatic tests and comply with rules as they re-join their term time household,"" she said. Despite the announcement, Bangor University said on Facebook on Friday that it ""falls under the rules of the Welsh Government which allow for a staggered return to blended learning"". Cardiff University said earlier this week that most students would not return to face-to-face teaching until 22 February. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""Our message to students, staff and universities in general is the same as the rest of the population: Stay home, work or study from home if you can. ""Only attend your place of work or study if you can't work from home."" The new announcement cameafter calls for clarity were madebecause of differences with the rules in England. At that point, the Welsh Government and Universities Wales said the plans agreed before Christmas would remain in place.

"Â£9,000 for 'anxiety and stress' university degree","Morgan Le-Riche and other students have questioned if they should be paying full tuition fees ""I am paying Â£9,000 for a university degree that is causing me nothing but anxiety and stress."" For Morgan Le-Riche, the university experience since the coronavirus pandemic hit has not been worth the fee. Some students are calling for reduced tuition fees and more support. The Welsh Government said it provided the most generous student support package in the UK and has appointed a dedicated minister for mental health. In announcing a lockdown earlier this week, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said students in England would not return to the classroom until mid February, withcalls for clarity over what will happenin Wales. Calls for clarity for university students in Wales on return Wales' school closures has 'grave consequences for children' Morgan, who is studying criminology and criminal justice at the University of South Wales, said ""something needs to be done to help us students"". Her Facebook post calling for more help was shared 3,000 times in three days - something that surprised her but also highlighted the depth of feeling. Students face an uncertain time with with restrictions currently in place The second year student said: ""I don't think the government is understanding students, instead they are only recognising primary and secondary schools - there's no recognition for university students."" Morgan was given assignments to complete over Christmas, but said her lecturers had turned off their emails so she could not seek guidance when she was finding work difficult. ""I feel like the amount of stress I've had has meant I'm not doing a high enough standard of work, that I would normally do, due to the lack of assistance,"" she said. She said more time with tutors and spaces for students to come together to discuss mental health would be beneficial. The University of South Wales said their course teams are committed to providing ""comprehensive support"" and are ""readily available to offer help and guidance for students"". Students in England have been told to work online and remain where they are A petition calling for the UK government to reduce university student tuition fees from Â£9,250 to Â£3,000 has gained more than 400,000 signatures online. Morgan thinks she has been ""massively let down"" and there needs to be a ""heavy reduction"" on the amount students are paying for their courses. A Welsh Government spokesman said: ""We are the only country in the whole of Europe that provides equivalent up front living costs grants and loans for full and part-time undergraduates, and for post-graduates. ""This already covers campus-based and distance learners and will continue throughout the academic year."" Danielle Herbert believes university students need more focus from government Journalism student Danielle Herbert, who also studies at the University of South Wales, said online learning has helped her mental health because otherwise a lot of her face-to-face interactions would be limited. Despite ""lecturers trying their best"", students' experiences since March last year have not been ""adequate for a Â£9,000 fee"". The third-year student from Swindon said the prime minister's announcement of an England-wide lockdown was stressful ""because there was no mention of universities"". She said: ""I was left very unclear and confused as to where I stood on travelling back to Wales. As someone who suffers from anxiety, I rely on concrete facts and that wasn't provided. We have been ignored by the prime minister. ""I had just paid my rent for this term - which was Â£2,300 - and I looked at my mum and dad and said: 'Am I even going to be able to go back to my student flat'?"" Danielle has called for more help for students in dealing with mental health issues during the pandemic She does not believe students have had the same level of support as secondary school pupils, adding: ""We're still expected to produce the same standard of work without protection whilst there's a pandemic going on - it's really unrealistic."" Danielle said having a ""no detriment,external"" policy in place would help to relieve students' stress. ""I think there's a real issue amongst students and students' mental health and it's only grown because of coronavirus. I think we will see the consequences of that if nothing is done."" The Welsh Government said: ""To support mental health services, we have made an additional Â£9.9m available, as part of efforts to ensure people can access the right support when they need it. ""In October we announced an additional Â£10m to support mental health services for higher education students in Wales to increase capacity in students' unions and universities to provide support services. ""This is in addition to the Â£27m Higher Education Investment and Recovery Fund announced in the summer."" The University of South Wales said the safety and wellbeing of students is its priority and students have access to a ""wide range of comprehensive support for their health, mental health and wellbeing"". ""Recognising that a number of staff would be on leave over the Christmas and New Year holidays, the course team let students know they were available for help and support right up until the end of term and students were encouraged to ask for support if they needed it,"" said a spokesperson. ""We are providing a full and interactive blended learning offer this term, in line with Welsh Government guidance, so that students can receive good experiences and a high-quality education, enabling them to progress and complete their studies on time.""

Drakeford faces 'go-slow' jab roll-out criticismThe First Minister of Wales says he was trying to prevent staff 'standing around with nothing to do'.,"This video can not be played Education Minister Kirsty Williams said vaccinators were working 'flat out' Wales' health minister has denied Covid-19 vaccines are being held back. Vaughan Gething was reacting to First Minister Mark Drakeford's comments the supplyÂ had to last until FebruaryÂ to prevent ""vaccinators standing around with nothing to do"". In alater tweet,external, Mr Drakeford said ""nobody is holding back vaccines"",  but the Conservative ex-Welsh secretary said his comments were ""astonishing"". Mr Gething insists vaccines are being rolled out ""as quickly as possible"". After Mr Drakeford's comments on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, the Welsh Government had said the reason for spacing out vaccine supply was to avoid wastage. Asked about those comments, Mr Gething said: ""We're rolling out the vaccination programme as quickly as possible. ""As the first minister's clarified tonight, we're not holding the vaccine back."" Public Health Wales said 151,737 people have been vaccinated, after at least 327,000 doses were delivered. Mr Gething told BBC Wales Today: ""It's as quickly as we build our infrastructure to deliver, as quick as we're able to get the vaccines out to be delivered."" But former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb said Mr Drakeford's comments had been ""astonishing"". The Conservative MP for Preseli Pembrokeshire told Gareth Lewis on BBC Radio Wales: ""I just find some of the excuses that have been made for why we are so behind in terms of vaccinating the over 80s - it just doesn't wash with our constituents I'm afraid ""When people in my constituency watch the television and they hear the first minister say 'this is not a sprint' when so many countries around the world are treating it exactly as that. ""The faster you roll out the vaccinations to the most vulnerable, ie the over 80s, the more lives that will be saved."" Of the 327,000 delivered vaccines, 280,000 are the Pfizer-BioNTech type that has to be stored at -70C. A total of 4.8% of the population has been vaccinated in Wales, the same as in Scotland. This compares with 6.2% in England and 6.6% in Northern Ireland. At the weekend the chairwoman of Wales' vaccination board Dr Gill Richardson, said the NHS was being supplied withas many vaccines as it could cope with. On Monday, Mr Drakeford told the Today programme the supply of the Pfizer vaccine had to last until February and was not being used all at once. ""There will be no point, and certainly it will be logistically very damaging, to try to use all of that in the first week and then to have all our vaccinators standing around with nothing to do for another month,"" he said. ""The sensible thing to do is to use the vaccine you've got over the period that you've got it for so that your system can absorb it, they can go on working.""

As the roll-out ramps up, vaccines in Wales will be given in mass vaccination centres, GP surgeries, mobile units - and on Friday, thefirst pharmacy gave the Covid jab. The Welsh Government said on Monday it was ""on course"" to complete 70% of vaccinations for over 80s and care home residents by the weekend. It also confirmed that all ambulance staff had been offered the vaccine, and the ambulance service said so far more than 60% had had it.

There are only two centres in Wales where we can keep them at this temperature. ""Once removed from storage, the vaccine lasts five days. Every dose wasted is a vaccine which cannot be given to someone in Wales. ""We want to ensure a consistent supply of the vaccine to minimise wastage."" At a coronavirus briefing on Monday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams also said ministers were not holding back on supplies. ""We are distributing Pfizer in a careful way to ensure there is infrastructure in Wales to deliver it safely and most efficiently, avoiding wastage because it is such a precious resource,"" she said. But Paul Davies, Conservative group leader in the Senedd, said his inbox had been ""bombarded by people who are very, very angry"" about the pace of the roll-out. ""Suggesting that holding back the vaccine for a period of time so vaccinators aren't standing around doing nothing is absolutely preposterous,"" he said. We've heard from two senior government ministers this morning - one of them the first minister - and received different explanations of what the strategy is for vaccine roll-out. The first minister talked about having to make the Pfizer vaccine last until February, otherwise vaccinators would be standing around with nothing to do. His education minister today denied that Welsh Government was doing anything to delay the use of the Pfizer vaccine - she talked about the need to go faster and to build up infrastructure and minimise wastage.

UK government vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi, when asked about the strategy in Wales, said his view for England was to use up supply and ensure it ""doesn't sit on a shelf or in a fridge"". There are currently two approved vaccines being administered in Wales - Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca. A third vaccine has been approved for use in the UK - made by US company Moderna -but supplies are not expected to arrive until spring. There will be 35 mass vaccination centres across Wales but to ensure people - especially the elderly and those with mobility issues - can be inoculated where they live,about 250 GP practices across the country,externalwill be able to administer the jab by the end of January.

"Australia 'unlikely to fully open border in 2021'The border closure is likely to remain even with widespread vaccinations, a top official says.Australia","Anyone entering Australia has to undergo a mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine Australia is unlikely to fully open its borders in 2021 even if most of its population gets vaccinated this year as planned, says a senior health official. The comments dampen hopes raised by airlines that travel to and from the country could resume as early as July. Department of Health Secretary Brendan Murphy made the prediction after being asked about the coronavirus' escalation in other nations. Dr Murphy spearheaded Australia's early action to close its borders last March. ""I think that we'll go most of this year with still substantial border restrictions,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday. ""Even if we have a lot of the population vaccinated, we don't know whether that will prevent transmission of the virus,"" he said, adding that he believed quarantine requirements for travellers would continue ""for some time"". Citizens, permanent residents and those with exemptions are allowed to enter Australia if they complete a 14-day hotel quarantine at their own expense. Dr Brendan Murphy (left) was Australia's chief medical officer and now leads the Department of Health Qantas - Australia's national carrier - reopened bookings earlier this month, after saying it expected international travel to ""begin to restart from July 2021."" The Australians who are trapped in the UK Vaccination will be required to fly - Qantas boss However, it added this depended on the Australian government's deciding to reopen borders. The country opened a travel bubble with neighbouring New Zealand late last year, but currently it only operates one-way with inbound flights to Australia. Australia has also discussed the option of travel bubbleswith other low-risk places such as Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. A passenger from New Zealand arriving at Sydney Airport last October A vaccination scheme is due to begin in Australia in late February. Local authorities have resisted calls to speed up the process, giving more time for regulatory approvals. Australia has so far reported 909 deaths and about 22,000 cases, far fewer than many nations. It reported zero locally transmitted infections on Monday. Experts have attributed much of Australia's success to its swift border lockdown - which affected travellers from China as early as February - and a hotel quarantine system for people entering the country. Local outbreaks have been caused by hotel quarantine breaches, including a second wave in Melbourne.The city's residents endured a stringent four-month lockdown last year to successfully suppress the virus. 'Crushed' on Melbourne's path to Covid success Other outbreaks - including one in Sydney which has infected about 200 people - prompted internal border closures between states, and other restrictions around Christmas time. The state of Victoria said on Monday it would again allow entry to Sydney residents outside of designated ""hotspots"", following a decline in cases. This video can not be played Travel abroad UK: How to fly during a global pandemic While the measures have been praised, many have also criticised them for separating families across state borders and damaging businesses. Dr Murphy said overall Australia's virus response had been ""pretty good"" but he believed the nation could have introduced face masks earlier and improved itsprotections in aged care homes. In recent days, Australia has granted entry to about 1,200 tennis players, staff and officials for the Australian Open.The contingent - which has recorded at least nine infections - is under quarantine.

Australia 'unlikely to fully open border in 2021',"Anyone entering Australia has to undergo a mandatory 14-day hotel quarantine Australia is unlikely to fully open its borders in 2021 even if most of its population gets vaccinated this year as planned, says a senior health official. The comments dampen hopes raised by airlines that travel to and from the country could resume as early as July. Department of Health Secretary Brendan Murphy made the prediction after being asked about the coronavirus' escalation in other nations. Dr Murphy spearheaded Australia's early action to close its borders last March. ""I think that we'll go most of this year with still substantial border restrictions,"" he told the Australian Broadcasting Corporation on Monday. ""Even if we have a lot of the population vaccinated, we don't know whether that will prevent transmission of the virus,"" he said, adding that he believed quarantine requirements for travellers would continue ""for some time"". Citizens, permanent residents and those with exemptions are allowed to enter Australia if they complete a 14-day hotel quarantine at their own expense. Dr Brendan Murphy (left) was Australia's chief medical officer and now leads the Department of Health Qantas - Australia's national carrier - reopened bookings earlier this month, after saying it expected international travel to ""begin to restart from July 2021."" The Australians who are trapped in the UK Vaccination will be required to fly - Qantas boss However, it added this depended on the Australian government's deciding to reopen borders. The country opened a travel bubble with neighbouring New Zealand late last year, but currently it only operates one-way with inbound flights to Australia. Australia has also discussed the option of travel bubbleswith other low-risk places such as Taiwan, Japan and Singapore. A passenger from New Zealand arriving at Sydney Airport last October A vaccination scheme is due to begin in Australia in late February. Local authorities have resisted calls to speed up the process, giving more time for regulatory approvals. Australia has so far reported 909 deaths and about 22,000 cases, far fewer than many nations. It reported zero locally transmitted infections on Monday. Experts have attributed much of Australia's success to its swift border lockdown - which affected travellers from China as early as February - and a hotel quarantine system for people entering the country. Local outbreaks have been caused by hotel quarantine breaches, including a second wave in Melbourne.The city's residents endured a stringent four-month lockdown last year to successfully suppress the virus. 'Crushed' on Melbourne's path to Covid success Other outbreaks - including one in Sydney which has infected about 200 people - prompted internal border closures between states, and other restrictions around Christmas time. The state of Victoria said on Monday it would again allow entry to Sydney residents outside of designated ""hotspots"", following a decline in cases.

Dr Murphy said overall Australia's virus response had been ""pretty good"" but he believed the nation could have introduced face masks earlier and improved itsprotections in aged care homes. In recent days, Australia has granted entry to about 1,200 tennis players, staff and officials for the Australian Open.The contingent - which has recorded at least nine infections - is under quarantine.

"Nora's body 'placed in the jungle', mother says","This video can not be played NÃ³ra Quoirin's parents: ""The inquest is a battle we must continue in NÃ³ra's name"" The mother of a 15-year-old girl found dead in a Malaysian jungle says she believes her daughter's body was placed by somebody in the spot she was found. NÃ³ra Quoirin, from Balham in south London, vanished from her room at the Dusun rainforest resort in August 2019. Her body was found near the resort nine days after she went missing. A coroner recorded her death was by misadventure. Meabh Quoirin, who thinks Nora was abducted, said the family would ""never give up their fight for justice"". The girl who vanished into a Malaysian jungle Girl's jungle death was 'misadventure' - coroner Prayers for missing girl as search continues NÃ³ra was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder that affects brain development, and her parents have always believed that wandering off from the resort - which is about 40 miles from Kuala Lumpur - was not something their daughter would have done. A post-mortem examination found NÃ³ra had died three days before her body was found, due to gastrointestinal bleeding from hunger and stress endured over a prolonged period. But Mrs Quoirin points out that the junglehad been searched on four occasions in the seven daysleading up to her death, with police suggesting the teenager been ""alive and moving"" during the first stages of the search. ""The fact that search teams were there, along with many hundreds of volunteers in that particular area so close to her death, makes us feel that she was placed there at a later point,"" Mrs Quoirin told the BBC. NÃ³ra's parents Maebh and Sebastien Quoirin want there to be a revision of the inquest verdict The teenager's mother pointed out that the inquest had not explained how her daughter ended up in the jungle, where her unclothed body was eventually found by a group of volunteers. ""I suppose the easiest one to dwell on was the fact there was an open window [in the family's chalet],"" said Mrs Quoirin, who is originally from Belfast. ""Someone opened that window, it wasn't any of us. That is totally unexplained."" Malaysian police have always treated NÃ³ra's disappearance as a missing person case. They maintain there was no suggestion of abduction, kidnap or foul play. During the search for her daughter, Mrs Quoirin told emergency services that their work meant ""the world to us"" ""NÃ³ra always looked to someone else for reassurance on what she should do next so the idea that she would have climbed out a window - even found a window or seen a window in the pitch black - is in our view crazy,"" Mrs Quorin said. ""If she had somehow mistaken which door was for the bathroom and had gone out the front door for instance... she was barefoot, she would have instantly felt pain and she would have been absolutely petrified."" NÃ³ra's parents have asked for a revision of the inquest verdict as ""so many questions have been left unanswered"". NÃ³ra was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development ""I think it will be impossible to ever have all the answers to questions that inevitably we will agonise over for the rest of our lives,"" Mrs Quoirin said. ""We can do more justice by at least recognising who this child was and that she wouldn't have - couldn't have - done the things that have been ruled through this verdict of misadventure. ""It's our duty to Nora to stand up for that, to really recognise who she was and stand up in the name of all children with special needs, to recognise who these children are, what they represent in our society.""

BT faces lawsuit over landline 'overcharging',"BT is facing a class action lawsuit over claims it failed to compensate elderly customers who were overcharged for landlines for years. In 2017,Ofcom said people who only had a landline telephone,externalwere ""getting poor value for money in a market that is not serving them well enough"". As a result,BT reduced the price of its landlines by Â£7 a month,external. But campaigners are unhappy that ""loyal customers"" have still not been compensated for previous overcharging. ""Ofcom made it very clear that BT had spent years overcharging landline customers, but did not order it to repay the money it made from this,"" said Justin Le Patourel, founder of consumer group Collective Action on Landlines (CALL) and a telecoms consultant who worked for Ofcom for 13 years. ""We think millions of BT's most loyal landline customers could be entitled to compensation of up to Â£500 each, and the filing of this claim starts that process."" Government denies 'snubbing' BT wi-fi pupil offer Openreach creating 5,300 jobs to aid fibre rollout BT said it ""strongly disagrees"" with the claim that it had engaged in anti-competitive behaviour and intends to defend itself ""vigorously"" in court. A spokesman for BT said: ""We take our responsibilities to older and more vulnerable customers very seriously and will defend ourselves against any claim that suggests otherwise. ""For many years we've offered discounted landline and broadband packages in what is a competitive market with competing options available, and we take pride in our work with elderly and vulnerable groups, as well as our work on the Customer Fairness agenda."" Law firm Mishcon de Reya has filed a claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) worth Â£600m. The claim could result in payments of up to Â£500 each for 2.3 million BT customers, should it be successful. The case represents customers who purchased a BT landline contract, but did not also take BT broadband or pay TV packages. Since 2009, the wholesale costs of providing landlines to consumers have been falling by at least 25%. But in October 2017, Ofcom found that all major landline providers in the UK had increased the line rental charges by 28-41%. Ofcom strongly criticised market leader BT for raising prices, saying that customers were being given ""poor value"" for money. It added that many of the affected customers had ""been with BT for decades"" and were more likely to be old, on low incomes and vulnerable. BT announced that it would slash its landline prices by Â£84 a year. BT's argument is that Ofcom's final statement did not explicitly accuse it of engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. But independent telecoms analyst Ian Grant says that the telecoms giant ""has a history of abusing its position"". ""Earlier in 2017, Ofcom fined BT Â£42m because it was late providing high-speed Ethernet lines, and forced BT to make good the losses of firms like Vodafone and TalkTalk,"" he told the BBC. ""Ofcom, which has a statutory duty to stop consumer abuses, could have done the same for these customers. Instead, it allowed BT to get away with a 37% price cut, at a time when the difference between its costs and what it charged customers had risen between 50-74%."" Mr Grant added: ""It is especially poor that BT was overcharging customers who were mostly over 65, more than three-quarters of whom had never used a different provider, and for whom the telephone was their only communications link.""

UK-bound travellers now need negative test for entry,"All travellers arriving in the UK will need to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test All UK travel corridors, which allow arrivals from some countries to avoid having to quarantine, have now closed. Travellers arriving in the UK, whether by boat, train or plane, also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. The test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500. All passengers will still be required to quarantine for up to 10 days. The isolation period can be cut short with a negative test after five days in England, but it does not apply in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The government has said the travel corridor closure will be in force until at least 15 February. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) Underthe new rules,external, travellers arriving from the Falklands, St Helena and Ascension Islands are exempt. Those arriving from some Caribbean islands are exempt until 04:00 GMT on Thursday 21 January. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC'S Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Public Health England would be stepping up checks on travellers who must self-isolate. He said enforcement checks at borders would also be ""ramped up"" and added that asking all arrivals to self-isolate in hotels was a ""potential measure"" the government was keeping under review. Passengers arriving into London's Heathrow airport on Monday said they had been met with ""substantial"" queues at passport control and one couple complained they had ""felt unsafe"" due to what they described as poor social distancing. Passengers speak to staff at the entrance to the Covid-19 Testing Centre at Heathrow Andy Hart, from London, who had arrived into the UK from Nairobi, said: ""We felt that even though everyone was masked they were far too close together. ""It took an hour and 10 minutes. I've been flying 30 times a year for 20 years. I mean, once or twice have I ever seen it [airport queues] like this. How can this happen during Covid times?"" Meanwhile on Sunday, the government announced that afinancial support scheme for airports in England would open this monthin response to the new travel curbs. Aviation minister Robert Courts said the aim was to provide grants of up to Â£8m per applicant by the end of this financial year. The scheme was first announced in November but without a start date. Industry groups have warned there wasonly so long airports could ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? Airline industry 'needs $80bn more government aid' EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the closure of the travel corridors will not have a ""significant impact"" on his airline in the short term as flight numbers were already limited due to the pandemic. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the minimum number of days arrivals must wait to take a negative test releasing them from quarantine could be reduced from five days to three days. Karen Dee, chief executive of trade body the Airport Operators Association, said she supported the decision to close the travel corridors but stressed the need for ""a clear pathway out"". Aban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verdealso came into force on Friday, having been imposed over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Scientists fear the variants seen in South Africa and Brazil mayinterfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system. The travel industry has said closing the travel corridors was understandable due to the health emergency, but warned it would deepen the crisis for the sector. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the system had been ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". He said he assumed the government would remove the latest restrictions as soon as it was safe. ""We've had no revenue now effectively for 12 months, give or take a few months in the summer last year. If we're going to have an aviation sector coming out of this we need to open up in the summer,"" he told the BBC. The Department for Transport has said it is supporting the travel industry with an extension to the furlough scheme until the end of April, business rates relief and tax deferrals. With all parts of the UK under strict virus rules amid high levels of infection, only essential travel is permitted.

"NI hospitals prepare for peak of latest virus surgeNorthern Health Trust chief says system is under ""huge pressure"" with patients waiting for beds.Northern Ireland","Hospitals are preparing for the expected peak of the latest Covid-19 surge this week, the Northern Trust's chief executive has said. Jennifer Welsh said there was ""huge pressure across the (healthcare) system"" with more intensive care admissions expected. Thirty patients were awaiting admission to Antrim Area Hospital on Sunday morning, she said. There were 25 more deaths linked to Covid-19 reported in NI on Sunday. The total number of deaths recorded by the Department of Health since the start of the pandemic is now 1,606. It was also reported that there had been 822 more positive cases, with 67 people in intensive care and 50 people on ventilators. There are 840 patients being treated for Covid- 19 across Northern Ireland, according to the latest available figures with hospitals working at 93% capacity. Meanwhile, Northern Ireland has been continuing its vaccination programme having distributed 140,559 first doses and 20,174 second doses. The total number of jabs administered in the UK, including both first and second doses, is 4,307,002 according to government data. In the Republic of Ireland on Sunday, there were 13 further deaths related to Covid-19, bringing the total number to 2,608 since the start of the pandemic. There was also a further 2,944 positive cases, bringing the total number of cases in the state to 172,726. The Republic of Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan said the situation in the country's hospitals was ""stark"" and that people of all ages were being admitted and taken into intensive care. At the beginning of January,Health Minister Robin Swann saidthat modelling indicated the ""peak of the third surge"" would hit in the third week of January. Frontline health staff have spoken to BBC News NIabout their ""exhaustion"" and stress, as the pressure on the system continues to increase amid the surging number of cases. Northern Ireland is currently in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with ministers scheduled to review measures next week. However, health officials have warned that an extension of the restrictions could be required to reduce pressure on the health service. Northern Trust chief executive Jennifer Welsh said hospitals were ""coping but at great cost"" Ms Welsh told BBC NI's Sunday Politics programme that the ""ICU surge is yet to come"" and that the Northern Trust - where two major hospitals, Antrim Area and Causeway, are located - has had to redeploy staff to prepare for the coming days. She said both hospitals had been ""under significant pressure and have been for some time"". She said 30 patients in Antrim Area's Emergency Department are waiting on a bed after a decision was made to admit them - 24 of those patients have been waiting longer than 12 hours. Ms Welsh added that almost half of all patients in Antrim Area Hospital have tested positive for Covid-19. ""At the peak of the first wave in Antrim and Causeway the highest number of Covid positive patients was 73. ""In November, the highest number was 102 and we peaked on Thursday at 202. We have now dropped below that slightly."" The chief executive said the hospitals were ""coping but at great cost"", with many urgent surgeries cancelled.

Mental health patients in crisis 'waited eight hours'Nearly 20% of Emergency Department mental health assessment waiting time targets have been breached since 2017.Northern Ireland,"More than a third of patients waited longer than two hours for a mental health assessment in Belfast Trust emergency departments between 2017 and 2020 Mental health targets have been missed thousands of times at Northern Ireland's emergency departments (ED) - with some people in crisis waiting more than eight hours for an assessment. Health trusts aim to assess such patients at ED within two hours, but miss that target 20% of the time. Health officials said access to mental health services is a key priority. But they accepted availability of those services has been hit by extra pressures caused by the pandemic. ""Covid-19 has undoubtedly impacted on the availability of services and led to pressures across the HSC, including mental health,"" said NI's Director of Social Care and Children, Marie Roulston. The two-hour waiting time was set by the Health and Social Care Board to try to ensure that those who were in need of an urgent mental health assessment did not have lengthy waits in emergency departments. While the number of people using emergency departments dropped in 2020 because of the coronavirus pandemic, the percentage of those waiting more than two hours for mental health assessment remained largely the same. People were identified as needing a referral for a specialist mental health assessment at Northern Ireland emergency departments more than 42,000 times between January 2017 and September 2020. On more than 8,000 of these occasions, the patients had to wait for more than two hours before being seen. The findings were obtained by BBC News NI through a series of Freedom of Information requests to health trusts. The figures were obtained through a series of FOI requests The Belfast Trust had the highest percentage of those not seen within two hours, with more than a third of patients waiting longer than two hours for a mental health assessment. More than 70 of those patients waited for longer than eight hours, while some had to wait as long as 12 hours. The Belfast Trust said it aimed to see individuals presenting to ED ""within the target timescale, however, at times demand outstrips our capacity to meet this"". This video can not be played BBC News NI speaks to one Belfast teenager who waited eight hours in an emergency department while having a mental health crisis Aidan McMeekin is 18 and lives in Belfast. His mental health suffered after he was expelled from school. He said: ""It got to the point where I was actually begging to my mum: 'I don't want to be here anymore, please just let me go.'"" Soon after, Aidan was taken to the emergency department of Belfast's Mater Hospital, where, he said, he waited for eight hours before receiving a mental health assessment. An investigation by BBC News NI has also found that mental health targets have been missed thousands of times at Northern Ireland's emergency departments (ED) - with people like Aidan waiting eight hours and over for for an assessment. After losing one of his close friends to suicide, Aidan's attitude changed. ""I saw first-hand how it has destroyed their families and I want to make sure that me or no-one I know goes down that route."" He added: ""I could have been just a statistic. People say you're forever young, but you're also forever dead."" If you have been affected by any of the issues in this article, there area  list of organisations that may be able to help at BBC Action Line. Aidan has been working with Quakers NI to share his story and raise awareness of mental health issues among young people in Northern Ireland. Although the Belfast and Western Trust had the highest percentage of patients waiting for at least two hours, both these trusts also had smaller number of patients attending ED for mental health assessments. In recent years, new pilot community crisis intervention services have been rolled out in Londonderry and Belfast, which can be used by patients within these trust catchment areas. All five trusts told BBC News NI that while they were working hard to meet targets, this was not always possible. A spokesperson for the South Eastern Trust said: ""This can be challenging at times due to the overall growth in demand for mental health assessments, including an increase in referrals from our emergency departments. ""In addition, the region's long-standing workforce pressures impact on our capacity to respond to referrals within target, although we are continuously working with commissioners to further develop our mental health early liaison provision."" In recent years, some emergency departments have appointed mental health liaison officials, whilethe department of health has also approved funding for a new perinatal mental health service. Health officials say delays to ED mental health assessments can be caused by a number of factors, including: The person may need medical treatment before being assessed They may be intoxicated due to the effect of alcohol or drugs Staff shortages In December 2020, Health Minister Robin Swann launched a public consultation on a 10-year Mental Health Strategy for Northern Ireland. It called for investment in a regional mental health crisis service to help reduce waiting times at emergency departments for mental health patients. Prof Siobhan O'Neill says behind the statistics are 'real people' While Northern Ireland's suicide rate may be lower than previously thought aftera review found some drug-related deaths, originally recorded as suicide, were accidental, the region's mental health champion said that behind the statistics were individuals ""in their darkest hours, facing devastating waits"". Siobhan O'Neill said: ""Emergency departments can be chaotic and staff are doing their best, but it's far from the ideal environment for someone in a mental health crisis. ""There are some excellent specialist mental health crisis services that have been piloted in Derry and Belfast, but the reality is A&E is still going to be the point of access for many people in crisis."" Depression 'more common' among NI children NI suicide rate expected to fall following review New mental health champion to 'challenge Stormont' She added: ""When people face lengthy waits they can be made feel like a burden, so we need to find a longer-term solution to ensure those with suicidal thoughts are not waiting hours for help."" A regional review of mental health crisis services in Northern Ireland is due to conclude in April. It is expected to call for a regionally-consistent response to people suffering a mental health crisis. The Health and Social Care Board said: ""We will continue to work on improving services in mental health to ensure that those who experience a mental health crisis will receive the help and support they need in the setting which is most conducive to recovery.""

US-bound migrant caravan beaten back in GuatemalaSecurity forces block a group of thousands that could pose an early test for the Biden White House.Latin America & Caribbean,"This video can not be played WATCH: On Sunday security forces blocked the migrants' path, beating them back with truncheons and tear gas A group of US-bound Central American migrants has been met with truncheons and tear gas in Guatemala, where security forces blocked their path. Thousands of people were intercepted on a road near the border with Honduras on Sunday. The government said it would not accept ""illegal mass movements"". An estimated 7,000 migrants, mostly from Honduras, have entered in recent days, fleeing poverty and violence. They hope to travel on to Mexico, and then the US border. Every year, tens of thousands of Central American migrants attempt this perilous journey to try and reach the US, often on foot, in groups known as ""caravans"". President-elect Joe Biden, a Democrat, has vowed to end the strict immigration policies of his predecessor, Donald Trump, a Republican. Hurricanes leave Hondurans homeless and destitute Biden plans decree blitz to dump Trump policies Did Trump stop more people coming to the US? But the Biden administration, which will take office on Wednesday, has warned migrants not to make the journey, as immigration policies will not change overnight. As the migrants trekked across Guatemala towards its border with Mexico, they were slowed down by security forces near the south-eastern village of Vado Hondo. A group of soldiers and police officers blockaded a road, stopping many of them from advancing. Some people still attempted to force their way through, prompting security forces to push them back. Several people were injured. About 7,000 migrants, mostly from Honduras, are estimated to have arrived in Guatemala since Friday Many migrants retreated, with some waiting nearby to make a new attempt later. Others fled into nearby mountains. ""Fortunately the security forces established a contingency plan... and contained this battle,"" said Guillermo DÃ­az, head of Guatemala's migration agency. A statement from the Guatemalan president's office said: ""Guatemala's message is loud and clear: These types of illegal mass movements will not be accepted, that's why we are working together with the neighbouring nations to address this as a regional issue."" The government later said 21 migrants who had sought medical assistance tested positive for Covid-19. The migrants say persecution, violence and poverty are a daily reality in their home countries. Conditions have been made worse by the devastation wrought by two huge hurricanes that battered Central America last November. ""There is still mud everywhere there, everything got knocked down, we lost everything,"" Ismael Eliazar told the Associated Press news agency. The migrants are fleeing poverty and violence in their home countries So, in search of a better life, they want to reach the US in the hope of finding work and safety. Dania Hinestrosa, a 23-year-old travelling with her daughter, told the AFP news agency: ""We have no work, nor food, so I decided to go to the United States."" The promise of new immigration policies under Mr Biden's administration is also thought to have spurred some migrants to make an attempt to reach the US border. Members of Mr Biden's team have warned Central American migrants not to make dangerous journeys to the border. Speaking to NBC News,external, an unnamed senior Biden administration official said migrants attempting to claim asylum in the US ""need to understand they're not going to be able to come into the United States immediately"". The Biden administration will prioritise undocumented immigrants already living in the US, not those heading to the country now, the official said. ""Processing capacity at the border is not like a light that you can just switch on and off,"" Susan Rice, one of Mr Biden's policy advisers,told the Spanish language news agency Efe,externalin December. ""Migrants and asylum seekers should absolutely not believe those in the region selling the idea that the border will suddenly be fully open to process everyone on day one. It will not."" Mark Morgan, acting commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, last week urged would-be migrants at the southern border not to ""waste your time and money"". The US commitment to the ""rule of law and public health"" is not affected by the change in administration, he said in a statement. More than a dozen of similar groups, some with thousands of migrants, have set off from Central America in recent years. One of the largest came from Honduras in October 2018, provoking President Trump to brand it ""an invasion"". But all have run up against resistance under Mr Trump, who put pressure on Mexico, Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador to crack down on illegal north-bound migration.

LiveLiveNew mass vaccination hubs open across England5 minutes ago,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says 37,475 people are in UK hospitals with the virus - the highest total yet Someone is being admitted to hospital with coronavirus every 30 seconds, Hancock adds A further 599 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test Four million vaccine doses have been delivered, the health secretary says He urges people not to stop following social distancing and other basic measures, saying ""don't blow it now"" Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace, says more than 37,000 cases have been detected in recent weeks using lateral flow testing Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, says there is increasing pressure on the NHS with around 15,000 admitted since Christmas Eve The health secretary says he is ""inspired"" by the ways people are helping one another in this ""great national effort"" Asked if people should feel confident about booking holidays, Matt Hancock says he will be going to Cornwall in the summer The world is on the brink of a ""catastrophic moral failure"" in the distribution of vaccines, warns the World Health Organisation Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for today - thanks for following. Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison, Gavin Stamp, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Julian Joyce, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. We are pausing our coronavirus live page for now, but weâll
be back on Tuesday morning. Hereâs a recap of todayâs main stories: Doctors giving Covid vaccinations say it has been ""challenging"" when deliveries of the jab arrived with only a few hours' notice. The centre has been set up at the JCB factory in Rocester, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire by several GP practices in Cheadle. The medics say they can get through about 900 jabs a day but Dr David Yates told the BBC they often get about 12 hours' notice of new stocks arriving. ""Yesterday we suddenly got told we had 900 vaccines, which is a whole other batch of the Pfizer ones,"" he said. ""I think by last night we had 170 people booked in ready with people frantically on the phones all day."" MPs have voted to extend the temporary Â£20 a week increase to universal credit introduced at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and due to stop at the start of April. The Labour motion backing an extension passed by 278 votes to none, but it is not binding. The government - which dismissed the vote as a stunt - ordered its MPs to abstain. Labour says ministers have missed an opportunity to give families certainty and help the economy. Read more here Tougher lockdown rules across Europe, the closure of air corridors, and uncertainty about travel now the UK has left the EU, have piled more pressure on the airline industry at the start of 2021. But EasyJet says bookings for this summer with its holidays arm are up 250% on last season, fuelling the airline industry's hopes of pent up demand for when lockdown restrictions ease. Its chief executive Johan Lundgren tells the BBC it offers confidence for the travel market post-coronavirus. ""We know that people want to go on holiday as soon as they can,"" he says, adding that May is currently the most popular month for holiday bookings. Earlier Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked if people can plan their holidays yet. He replied that he will go to Cornwall for a summer break, saying ""we have got a lot of work to do by then"". Read more here  A health chief says Covid-19 deniers are ""ridiculous"". Dr Lisa McNally, director of public health for Sandwell in the West Midlands, has also criticised people who are sceptical about the vaccines being used to fight the coronavirus. She says despite social media abuse, she will continue to tell people the truth about the seriousness of the pandemic, and how jabs are a ""safe and effective reaction"" to it. This video can not be played Covid-19: Sandwell health boss says deniers 'ridiculous' Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although it has been common to hear and see the impact on care
homes internationally throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, one country where such insight has been rare is China. Private care homes have been growing in popularity in China in
recent years, but there are some stigmas associated with the industry. In China, many view nursing homes as going against the
cultural concept of âfilial pietyâ. This is the belief that the young should
respect for and care for their elders, and so many believe the elderly should
live with their children, and not live in care homes. However, as cases of the virus grow in the northeast of the
country, the official broadcaster CCTV has offered viewers a rare insight into how Chinaâs elderly in these facilities are being protected. A journalist today has visited the Shijiazhuang Nursing Home.
Shijiazhuang is the Chinese city that has beenhardest hit by the virus in recent weeks. In a 30-minute livestream in which he is clad in hazmat suit and
visor, journalist Gu Junling introduces viewers to how the facilities are kept
safe, and shows viewers inside the care homeâs stockrooms, packed with ample
provisions for its residents. Many of the residents seem happy to speak to the journalist and talk
about how they are healthy, and happy. Masks are mandatory for both residents
and staff, even in the areas outside on-site. However, far from being kept
under house arrest, residents are shown to have sufficient space to go outside,
use computers and games rooms. Many of us are desperately hoping coronavirus vaccines will soon transport us back to our pre-Covid lives. But many scientists are warning that their arrival probably won't mean throwing our face masks in the bin anytime soon. Take a lookat our explainer here, from our visual journalism team, for more on when we might be back to any kind of normality. As we've heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the latest coronavirus statistics at today's Downing Street press briefing. The number of people in hospital with the virus is at its highest level yet - at 37,435 - he says. It comes as the daily case numbers in the UK have begun to fall. There were another 37,535 positive cases reported and a further 599 people died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. However, figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Cases of coronavirus have fallen by almost a quarter across the UK in the last week, showing that the current lockdown is having an effect. But hospital admissions are still rising. Ten hospital trusts across England have reported having no spare critical care beds - despite extra capacity being added. The BBC's Clive Myrie has been to the Royal London Hospital and spent time with staff struggling to cope, as well as one family experiencing the grief this pandemic is causing. There are some upsetting scenes in his report. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Don't end up like us, please' The world is on the brink of a ""catastrophic moral failure"" in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned. Global health leaders say at least 49 richer countries have given 39 million doses of vaccine. But just 25 people have been vaccinated in one poorer country. The WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for equitable distribution of the vaccine. ""The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries,"" he told the WHO's executive board meeting. He says it's not right that younger, healthier adults in rich countries are vaccinated before health workers and older people in poorer countries. The UK has helped to raise one billion dollars, for global vaccine sharing fund Covax, through match-funding other donors, the government announced. This, combined with Â£548 million of UK aid, will help distribute one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year, officials said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press briefing: ""I absolutely agree with Dr Tedros on the importance of a global rollout and we in the UK can be proud of what we are doing to support that happening financially."" Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Remember at the start of the pandemic the prime minister and the chancellor said they would ""put their arms around"" everyone at a time of genuine emergency. Even then it was a political promise that seemed unlikely to be kept. But as the health nightmare of Covid-19 unfolded, the country's doors closed and the economy took a thumping, ministers presided over a massive and very expensive expansion of the state. That included raising the amount of universal credit, the benefit that's paid to about six million people on low incomes or out of work, by Â£20 a week. With the basic level of the benefit starting at about Â£340 a month for single people under 25, that money has made a real difference. As one recipient, Carl Hackshaw from Croydon, told me on Monday, that increase meant that he's gone from""having to go without to having barely enough"". The looming political problem for the government is that the Â£20 top-up is due to stop at the end of March. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'Don't blow it now, we're on the route out' As we've just heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the public: ""Don't blow it now. We are on the route out"". Watch his remarks at today's Downing Street press briefing above. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The
Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million
people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to
start with â the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have
now been vaccinated. In
some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in
England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s
in for vaccination. The
progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination
rates globally. Challenges
remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the
Pfizer-BioNTech will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have
an impact. While
the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UKâs
supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and it will
mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers
are confident the mid-February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine
will not be affected â there is already enough
vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is
such nervousness about supply chains.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock led this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. Here are some of the key points from the briefing.  It is difficult to know when schools can reopen, Dr Susan Hopkins says. ""We monitor data on a daily basis and review it looking at when and what we think might be able to happen next,"" says the NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser. ""We've always said schools should be the last to close and the first to open, but giving a defined date on that is very difficult until we see what happens over the next few weeks,"" she says. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said
that some areas have had a very high uptake in the vaccine for the over-80s and
care homes. This is why those areas are now
ready to offer vaccinations to over-70s. Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim
Zahawi pointed to some of those areas this morning - including 90% of over-80s
in Yateley receiving their first dose and 89% in Cheltenham. However, we canât give you a full
picture of which areas will see this expansion because the government has
not yet released localised data on vaccinations to the public, despite
ministers referring to the statistics throughout the day. There are certainly regional
variations for the vaccinations for the over-80s. The latest figures broken down by
age and region, up to 10 January, showed that 46% of the over-80s in the North
East and Yorkshire had been vaccinated. This is compared to 29% of people
in the East of England. Gareth Iacobucci from the British Medical Journal says doctors face making ""unimaginable decisions"" about who to treat, given the strain on hospitals which - he says - are basically full up. He asks the health secretary whether the law will be changed to prevent doctors and other NHS staff from being subject of legal actions and potentially being sued for unlawful killing if they are forced to prioritise some patients over others. Mr Hancock says this is a serious concern of his, and notes a letter he received on the issue on Sunday. But at the moment he says the NHS has not been overwhelmed yet and doctors do not have to make those kind of decisions, and he hopes they will not have to. Changing the law is not necessary at the moment, he says, while stressing the situation will be kept under review. Matt Hancock says he is going to Cornwall for his summer holidays and says: ""I think we are going to have a great British summer."" He adds: ""We have got a lot of work to do by then but we have got a line of sight to vaccinating everyone by September and anything beyond that would be a bonus."" Earlier, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that restrictions could gradually begin to be eased from March as immunity starts to take effect in the groups vaccinated by mid-February. Hugo Gye from the i asks why there are fewer vaccines delivered at weekends and asks what the government is doing to provide a seven day service. The health secretary says: ""The vaccination programme is absolutely delivering a full seven day service, and, as you well know, we are prepared to go 24/7."" He adds that he ""wouldn't read too much into an individual day's data...over a week you will see it going up and going up fast."" Supply is the rate limiting factor, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Youngest Manchester victim 'could have survived'A report commissioned by the family of Saffie-Rose Roussos says she received inadequate first aid.,"This video can not be played Expertâs report finds eight-year-old Saffie âcould have been savedâ if treated properly for her injuries The youngest victim of the Manchester Arena attack might have survived if she had received better first aid, a report commissioned by her family suggests. Eight-year-old Saffie-Rose Roussos died as a result of losing too much blood from injuries to her legs. It has emerged that no-one used simple tourniquets or splints to apply pressure and reduce the bleeding. Previously, experts commissioned by the Manchester Arena Inquiry found that Saffie's injuries were not survivable. This new information has come to light because lawyers representing the Roussos family commissioned different experts to look into the circumstances of her death. They believe that Saffie might have survived. For the past three years, Saffie's parents have believed that she was killed instantly in the explosion. They say they drew comfort from thinking that she had not suffered. Now they have been told that their daughter lived for over an hour, and that opportunities were missed to help her. Manchester attack: The victims The road to the Manchester Arena bombing The family has also discovered that Saffie asked a paramedic, ""am I going to die?"" as she was being taken to hospital by ambulance. Saffie's father, Andrew Roussos, told the BBC: ""She could have been saved."" He added: ""How do we carry on living with this information? How can we carry on breathing with this information? ""I can't look at Saffie's picture. Since I've read this report, I can't look at her."" Lisa and Andrew Roussos have launched a charity to help families affected by terror attacks The new report is based on evidence that includes witness statements, as well as CCTV footage and body-worn cameras from the emergency services. Previously, the family thought that Saffie died on the floor of the Manchester Arena foyer, where the bomb exploded on 22 May 2017. Now they have learned that she was not knocked unconscious. The report has found that, moments after the blast, Saffie lifted her head and tried to push herself up with her arms. She is said to have been given water, and to have asked for her mum. Several people tried to help Saffie but though she was bleeding heavily from serious leg injuries, nobody used a tourniquet, or splint to apply pressure and reduce the bleeding. Saffie was lifted on to an advertising hoarding and some railings, which were used as a makeshift stretcher. She was the first person to be carried out of the foyer, but there was no ambulance outside, and one had to be flagged down. The report commends the actions of the people who tried to get her to hospital as quickly as possible. But it has found that the ambulance did not have all the necessary equipment on board. Distressing detail has emerged about Saffie's time inside the ambulance. She is said to have been agitated, and pulling at her oxygen mask. She was able to speak and asked whether she was going to die. Mr Roussos says: ""Medically trained people were with her. And she was asking for help. She knew what was happening. And she bled to death. ""Eight year olds don't ask those questions. Doesn't matter how hurt they are, they want their mum. They want to be treated, they want to be out of pain.  Not to be in the sound mind to ask the paramedic whether she's going to die."" The report has found that the ambulance crew did not use tourniquets or splints on Saffie's injuries, and neither did the medical team at hospital, when Saffie arrived at A&E. It also says that it is unclear why the trauma team at the hospital didn't begin a surgical procedure called a ""thoracotomy"" to stop the bleeding. Saffie's idol was Ariana Grande Saffie was pronounced dead at the hospital at 11.40pm, more than an hour after the attack. The report says that because the bleeding was left unchecked, it resulted in a critical level of blood loss to the point at which the heart was no longer able to beat, and it could not be restarted. Mr Roussos says: ""Our medical experts have suggested that there were procedures that Saffie could have had and she didn't. She was losing that much blood. And there wasn't a successful procedure in place to get that blood into Saffie - even in A&E. Why?"" The Roussos family say that they cannot understand why two sets of experts have reached different opinions about Saffie's survivability. The Manchester Arena Inquiry is about to begin its phase of hearing evidence about the emergency response to the attack, in which 22 people died when a suicide bomb exploded. In the months ahead, Saffie's parents will hear evidence from the people who were with their daughter in her last moments. They have told the BBC that they want the public inquiry to get to the full truth about what happened to their little girl. Manchester bomber's brother jailed for 55 years What is the Manchester Arena Inquiry? Saffie, from Leyland, Lancashire, was at an Ariana Grande concert with her mother, Lisa, and sister, Ashlee Bromwich, when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb in a large foyer filling with people after it ended on 22 May 2017. The inquiry is looking at whether the attack could have been prevented, what happened on that night, the security arrangements around the arena, the emergency response to the bombing and the radicalisation of bomber Abedi. Last year the inquiry, which began in September, heard how each of the 22 individual victims died as well as personal evidence about them from their families.

Fortified US statehouses see scattered protests,"A small group of armed protesters held a rally in front of the capitol building in Texas Small groups of protesters - some of them armed - gathered on Sunday at statehouses in the US, where tensions are high after the deadly riots at the Capitol in Washington. Protests were held outside capitol buildings in Texas, Oregon, Michigan, Ohio and elsewhere. But many other statehouses were quiet, amid a ramping up of security across US legislatures. No clashes were reported. The FBI has warned of armed protests ahead of Wednesday's inauguration. President-elect Joe Biden will take office two weeks after pro-Trump protesters stormed the US Capitol in Washington DC on 6 January, leaving five dead, including a police officer. More than 25,000 National Guard troops are being deployed to secure Washington. In a sign of just how worried officials are about potential unrest,Army Secretary Ryan McCarthy told the Associated Press on Sunday that all Guard members were being vetted,externalbecause of fears of an insider threat. Also on Sunday, a county official from New Mexico was arrested in Washington in connection with the riots at the US Capitol on 6 January. Couy Griffin, the founder of a group called Cowboys for Trump, had vowed to return on inauguration day with firearms to ""embrace my Second Amendment"". One in, one out: How the White House changes hands Tracking the rise of US militia groups What are far-right Trump supporters saying? Many cities had prepared for potentially violent protests over the weekend, erecting barriers and deploying thousands of National Guard troops. Posts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks had called for armed demonstrations on Sunday in particular, but some militias told their followers not to attend, citing heavy security or claiming the planned events were police traps. Small crowds of protesters numbering in the dozens gathered in only some cities, leaving the streets surrounding many statehouses largely empty. Members of the the Boogaloo Bois were seen outside the Michigan State Capitol in Lansing The New York Times reported,externalabout 25 members of the Boogaloo Bois movement were among heavily-armed protesters who gathered at the statehouse in Columbus, Ohio. But the men - who are part of a loosely organised extremist group that wants to overthrow the US government - said they were there for a long-planned gun rights rally. Meanwhile in Michigan, about two dozen people - some carrying rifles - protested outside the statehouse in Lansing, as police watched on. ""I am not here to be violent and I hope no one shows up to be violent,"" one protester told Reuters news agency. Who has the FBI arrested so far? Who are Boogaloo Bois, antifa and Proud Boys? At the Capitol: Trump's Christian supporters A similarly small group of about a dozen protesters, a few armed with rifles, stood outside the Texas Capitol in Austin. Outside Pennsylvania's capitol in Harrisburg, one Trump supporter noted the poor turn-out, telling Reuters: ""There's nothing going on."" More protests are expected on Wednesday, when Mr Biden will officially be sworn into office, replacing Mr Trump as president. Armed National Guard members protected the Pennsylvania State Capitol Mr Biden will issue executive orders to reverse President Trump's travel bansand re-join the Paris climate accord on his first day in the White House. The president-elect is also expected to focus on reuniting families separated at the US-Mexico border, and to issue mandates on Covid-19 and mask-wearing. This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration Much of Washington DC has been locked down ahead of the inauguration. The National Mall, which is usually thronged with thousands of people for inaugurations, has been shut at the request of the Secret Service. The Biden team had already asked Americans to avoid travelling to the nation's capital for the inauguration because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Local officials said people should watch the event remotely. All 50 US states on alert for armed protests Biden plans decree blitz to dump Trump policies What are far-right Trump supporters saying?

Samsung heir gets prison term for bribery scandal,"JY Lee stepping out of a car Samsung heir Lee Jae Yong has been sentenced to two years and six months in prison by a high court in South Korea. The bribery case is a retrial of an earlier one involving the country's former President Park Geun-hye, who was also jailed for bribery and corruption. Lee has been the de facto head of Samsung Electronics since 2014. The ruling is likely to have ramifications for the future of his role at the tech giant. News of the sentence sent Samsung electronics shares more than 4% lower before they began to claw back some ground. Samsung Group titan Lee Kun-hee dies aged 78 Samsung heir faces fresh charges over 2015 merger Samsung sees sales surge from rival Huawei's ban Lee's jail term will at least temporarily side-line him from decision making at the conglomerate. Experts say the sentence could create a leadership vacuum and hamper Samsung's decision-making on future large-scale investments. ""It's really a huge blow and a big crisis for Samsung,"" Kim Dae-jong, a business professor at Sejong University, told news agency AFP. Lee assumed leadership of the company when his father Lee Kun-hee was hospitalised following a heart attack in 2014. The elder Lee died last year, leading to speculation that there would be a shake-up at Samsung as his heirs could be forced into asset sales or dividend payments to cover a massive inheritance tax bill. According to the court's verdict, Lee ""actively provided bribes and implicitly asked the president to use her power to help his smooth succession"" at the head of Samsung. ""It is very unfortunate that Samsung, the country's top company and proud global innovator, is repeatedly involved in crimes whenever there is a change in political power."" The court found Lee guilty of bribery, embezzlement and concealment of criminal proceeds worth about 8.6 billion won ($7.8m; Â£5.75m), and said the independent compliance committee Samsung set up early last year has yet to become fully effective. Lee's defence team expressed disappointment with the decision. ""The nature of this case is the former president's abuse of power violating corporate freedom and property rights. Given that nature, the court's decision is regrettable,"" Lee's lawyer, Lee In-jae, told reporters. Lee has already served time in detention which is expected to count toward the sentence - leaving 18 months to be served. Lee faced legal troubles even as he stood on the cusp of becoming the leader of the global tech giant. He was first arrested in February 2017 over his alleged role in a political and corporate scandal linked to South Korea's then-president, Park Geun-hye. Samsung was accused of paying 43bn won ($37.7m; Â£26.7m) to two non-profit foundations operated by Choi Soon-sil, a friend of Park's, in exchange for political support - alleged to include backing for a controversial Samsung merger which paved the way for Lee to become eventual head of the conglomerate. The deal neededsupport from the government-run national pension fund. Charges against Lee included bribery, embezzlement, hiding assets overseas and perjury - all of which he denied, saying Samsung did not want anything in return. This video can not be played Samsung protester Kim-Yong-hee lives on a traffic tower 20m high and only 150cm wide But in August 2017 a court convicted him of the charges and sent him to prison for five years. In February 2018, that sentence was halved, and the Seoul High Court decided to suspend the jail term, meaning he was free to go. The Supreme Court then sent the case back to the Seoul High Court, which issued Monday's ruling.

LiveLiveNew mass vaccination hubs open across EnglandLess than a minute ago,"Health Secretary Matt Hancock says 37,475 people are in UK hospitals with the virus - the highest total yet Someone is being admitted to hospital with coronavirus every 30 seconds, Hancock adds A further 599 people have died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test Four million vaccine doses have been delivered, the health secretary says He urges people not to stop following social distancing and other basic measures, saying ""don't blow it now"" Dr Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace, says more than 37,000 cases have been detected in recent weeks using lateral flow testing Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, says there is increasing pressure on the NHS with around 15,000 admitted since Christmas Eve The health secretary says he is ""inspired"" by the ways people are helping one another in this ""great national effort"" Asked if people should feel confident about booking holidays, Matt Hancock says he will be going to Cornwall in the summer The world is on the brink of a ""catastrophic moral failure"" in the distribution of vaccines, warns the World Health Organisation Edited by Julian Joyce That's all for today - thanks for following. Updates were brought to you by Doug Faulkner, Emma Harrison, Gavin Stamp, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Julian Joyce, Jennifer Meierhans, Lauren Turner and Sophie Williams. We are pausing our coronavirus live page for now, but weâll
be back on Tuesday morning. Hereâs a recap of todayâs main stories: Doctors giving Covid vaccinations say it has been ""challenging"" when deliveries of the jab arrived with only a few hours' notice. The centre has been set up at the JCB factory in Rocester, near Uttoxeter, Staffordshire by several GP practices in Cheadle. The medics say they can get through about 900 jabs a day but Dr David Yates told the BBC they often get about 12 hours' notice of new stocks arriving. ""Yesterday we suddenly got told we had 900 vaccines, which is a whole other batch of the Pfizer ones,"" he said. ""I think by last night we had 170 people booked in ready with people frantically on the phones all day."" MPs have voted to extend the temporary Â£20 a week increase to universal credit introduced at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, and due to stop at the start of April. The Labour motion backing an extension passed by 278 votes to none, but it is not binding. The government - which dismissed the vote as a stunt - ordered its MPs to abstain. Labour says ministers have missed an opportunity to give families certainty and help the economy. Read more here Tougher lockdown rules across Europe, the closure of air corridors, and uncertainty about travel now the UK has left the EU, have piled more pressure on the airline industry at the start of 2021. But EasyJet says bookings for this summer with its holidays arm are up 250% on last season, fuelling the airline industry's hopes of pent up demand for when lockdown restrictions ease. Its chief executive Johan Lundgren tells the BBC it offers confidence for the travel market post-coronavirus. ""We know that people want to go on holiday as soon as they can,"" he says, adding that May is currently the most popular month for holiday bookings. Earlier Health Secretary Matt Hancock was asked if people can plan their holidays yet. He replied that he will go to Cornwall for a summer break, saying ""we have got a lot of work to do by then"". Read more here  A health chief says Covid-19 deniers are ""ridiculous"". Dr Lisa McNally, director of public health for Sandwell in the West Midlands, has also criticised people who are sceptical about the vaccines being used to fight the coronavirus. She says despite social media abuse, she will continue to tell people the truth about the seriousness of the pandemic, and how jabs are a ""safe and effective reaction"" to it. This video can not be played Covid-19: Sandwell health boss says deniers 'ridiculous' Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Although it has been common to hear and see the impact on care
homes internationally throughout the Covid-19 pandemic, one country where such insight has been rare is China. Private care homes have been growing in popularity in China in
recent years, but there are some stigmas associated with the industry. In China, many view nursing homes as going against the
cultural concept of âfilial pietyâ. This is the belief that the young should
respect for and care for their elders, and so many believe the elderly should
live with their children, and not live in care homes. However, as cases of the virus grow in the northeast of the
country, the official broadcaster CCTV has offered viewers a rare insight into how Chinaâs elderly in these facilities are being protected. A journalist today has visited the Shijiazhuang Nursing Home.
Shijiazhuang is the Chinese city that has beenhardest hit by the virus in recent weeks. In a 30-minute livestream in which he is clad in hazmat suit and
visor, journalist Gu Junling introduces viewers to how the facilities are kept
safe, and shows viewers inside the care homeâs stockrooms, packed with ample
provisions for its residents. Many of the residents seem happy to speak to the journalist and talk
about how they are healthy, and happy. Masks are mandatory for both residents
and staff, even in the areas outside on-site. However, far from being kept
under house arrest, residents are shown to have sufficient space to go outside,
use computers and games rooms. Many of us are desperately hoping coronavirus vaccines will soon transport us back to our pre-Covid lives. But many scientists are warning that their arrival probably won't mean throwing our face masks in the bin anytime soon. Take a lookat our explainer here, from our visual journalism team, for more on when we might be back to any kind of normality. As we've heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock confirmed the latest coronavirus statistics at today's Downing Street press briefing. The number of people in hospital with the virus is at its highest level yet - at 37,435 - he says. It comes as the daily case numbers in the UK have begun to fall. There were another 37,535 positive cases reported and a further 599 people died within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. However, figures are often lower on a Monday because of lags in reporting data over the weekend. Cases of coronavirus have fallen by almost a quarter across the UK in the last week, showing that the current lockdown is having an effect. But hospital admissions are still rising. Ten hospital trusts across England have reported having no spare critical care beds - despite extra capacity being added. The BBC's Clive Myrie has been to the Royal London Hospital and spent time with staff struggling to cope, as well as one family experiencing the grief this pandemic is causing. There are some upsetting scenes in his report. This video can not be played Covid-19: 'Don't end up like us, please' The world is on the brink of a ""catastrophic moral failure"" in the distribution of Covid-19 vaccines, the World Health Organisation (WHO) has warned. Global health leaders say at least 49 richer countries have given 39 million doses of vaccine. But just 25 people have been vaccinated in one poorer country. The WHO's director general, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, called for equitable distribution of the vaccine. ""The world is on the brink of a catastrophic moral failure - and the price of this failure will be paid with lives and livelihoods in the world's poorest countries,"" he told the WHO's executive board meeting. He says it's not right that younger, healthier adults in rich countries are vaccinated before health workers and older people in poorer countries. The UK has helped to raise one billion dollars, for global vaccine sharing fund Covax, through match-funding other donors, the government announced. This, combined with Â£548 million of UK aid, will help distribute one billion doses of coronavirus vaccines to 92 developing countries this year, officials said. Health Secretary Matt Hancock told a Downing Street press briefing: ""I absolutely agree with Dr Tedros on the importance of a global rollout and we in the UK can be proud of what we are doing to support that happening financially."" Laura KuenssbergPolitical editor Remember at the start of the pandemic the prime minister and the chancellor said they would ""put their arms around"" everyone at a time of genuine emergency. Even then it was a political promise that seemed unlikely to be kept. But as the health nightmare of Covid-19 unfolded, the country's doors closed and the economy took a thumping, ministers presided over a massive and very expensive expansion of the state. That included raising the amount of universal credit, the benefit that's paid to about six million people on low incomes or out of work, by Â£20 a week. With the basic level of the benefit starting at about Â£340 a month for single people under 25, that money has made a real difference. As one recipient, Carl Hackshaw from Croydon, told me on Monday, that increase meant that he's gone from""having to go without to having barely enough"". The looming political problem for the government is that the Â£20 top-up is due to stop at the end of March. Read more from Laura This video can not be played Matt Hancock: 'Don't blow it now, we're on the route out' As we've just heard, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has urged the public: ""Don't blow it now. We are on the route out"". Watch his remarks at today's Downing Street press briefing above. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent The
Covid vaccination programme continues to gather pace. More than four million
people have now received their first dose, meaning half of those targeted to
start with â the over 80s, care home residents and health and care staff have
now been vaccinated. In
some areas the figures are close to nine in 10, which is why ministers in
England have given the NHS the green light to start inviting those in their 70s
in for vaccination. The
progress means the UK continues to be among the countries with the highest vaccination
rates globally. Challenges
remain though. The announcement last week that the supply of the
Pfizer-BioNTech will be slower than anticipated in the coming weeks will have
an impact. While
the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now taking up a greater share of the UKâs
supply, the Pfizer-BioNTech is still a crucial part of the programme and it will
mean the pace of rollout will be slower than it would have been otherwise. Ministers
are confident the mid-February target to offer 15 million high-risk people a vaccine
will not be affected â there is already enough
vaccine in the country for them - but it again illustrates why there is
such nervousness about supply chains.  Health Secretary Matt Hancock led this afternoon's Downing Street press conference. Here are some of the key points from the briefing.  It is difficult to know when schools can reopen, Dr Susan Hopkins says. ""We monitor data on a daily basis and review it looking at when and what we think might be able to happen next,"" says the NHS Test and Trace chief medical adviser. ""We've always said schools should be the last to close and the first to open, but giving a defined date on that is very difficult until we see what happens over the next few weeks,"" she says. Reality Check Health Secretary Matt Hancock said
that some areas have had a very high uptake in the vaccine for the over-80s and
care homes. This is why those areas are now
ready to offer vaccinations to over-70s. Vaccine Deployment Minister Nadhim
Zahawi pointed to some of those areas this morning - including 90% of over-80s
in Yateley receiving their first dose and 89% in Cheltenham. However, we canât give you a full
picture of which areas will see this expansion because the government has
not yet released localised data on vaccinations to the public, despite
ministers referring to the statistics throughout the day. There are certainly regional
variations for the vaccinations for the over-80s. The latest figures broken down by
age and region, up to 10 January, showed that 46% of the over-80s in the North
East and Yorkshire had been vaccinated. This is compared to 29% of people
in the East of England. Gareth Iacobucci from the British Medical Journal says doctors face making ""unimaginable decisions"" about who to treat, given the strain on hospitals which - he says - are basically full up. He asks the health secretary whether the law will be changed to prevent doctors and other NHS staff from being subject of legal actions and potentially being sued for unlawful killing if they are forced to prioritise some patients over others. Mr Hancock says this is a serious concern of his, and notes a letter he received on the issue on Sunday. But at the moment he says the NHS has not been overwhelmed yet and doctors do not have to make those kind of decisions, and he hopes they will not have to. Changing the law is not necessary at the moment, he says, while stressing the situation will be kept under review. Matt Hancock says he is going to Cornwall for his summer holidays and says: ""I think we are going to have a great British summer."" He adds: ""We have got a lot of work to do by then but we have got a line of sight to vaccinating everyone by September and anything beyond that would be a bonus."" Earlier, Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi said that restrictions could gradually begin to be eased from March as immunity starts to take effect in the groups vaccinated by mid-February. Hugo Gye from the i asks why there are fewer vaccines delivered at weekends and asks what the government is doing to provide a seven day service. The health secretary says: ""The vaccination programme is absolutely delivering a full seven day service, and, as you well know, we are prepared to go 24/7."" He adds that he ""wouldn't read too much into an individual day's data...over a week you will see it going up and going up fast."" Supply is the rate limiting factor, he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Ambulance service still 'under extreme pressure',"This video can not be played 'I was spat at working as an ambulance paramedic' After experiencing its most difficult period of the entire Covid-19 pandemic in December, the boss of Welsh Ambulance Service said it was still under ""extreme pressure"". At one stage, 400 staff - 12% of all workers - were sick or self-isolating. Jason Killens said this was exacerbated by high call numbers and ""significant delays"" handing patients to hospitals. One paramedic described questioning whether he was in the right job after being spat at during the pandemic. The chief executive said it meant ""patients with less serious conditions waited much longer than we would like"". Paramedic Stan Baxter was assaulted by someone who spat at him Paramedic Stan Baxter, describing the pressure he and colleagues were under, said at one point an incident caused him to question whether he wanted to continue working. ""During the peak of the pandemic last year, I was assaulted by a member of the public where I was spat at in the face,"" he said. ""And that's really the only time that I've stopped and gone: 'Is this for me?'"" However the ""vast majority of the public"" had been ""absolutely fantastic"", he stressed, adding: ""We've had people waving at us, buying us coffee."" Luke Robinson and Stan Baxter must wear more protective equipment when they help patients For his work partner, Luke Robinson, their job made it clear how coronavirus had made a resurgence across the country. ""I worked New Year's Eve and I responded to a number of incidents which involved just regular health complaints,"" he said. ""But next door or in the adjacent building there's people having parties and you can tell that there's large gatherings going on. And it's really frustrating because it really hammers home that some people aren't listening to the rules. ""And it's not surprising that we're seeing a second wave now."" Ambulance patient waits 19 hours outside hospital Army deployed to drive ambulances in Wales Welsh Ambulance Service declare 'critical incident' Mr Killens said the pressure was now ""palpably less"" compared to last month, but admitted difficult weeks lie ahead. ""December was probably the most pressurised period during the whole pandemic for a number of reasons,"" he said. ""Staff that were symptomatic or isolating, that's been at its peak in December. ""We've seen more work both in the 111 and 999 service, that is patients contacting us with Covid-related symptoms, and of course because of the pressure on the rest of the NHS, we've seen extended handover at some of our emergency departments and what that's meant regrettably is some less serious patients have waited a lot longer in the community than I would have expected."" Soldiers have been helping to relieve pressure on ambulance staff The ambulance service has been at its highest level of alert - described as ""extreme pressure"" - since early December. It was so bad at the beginning of the month, the service had to declare a ""critical incident"",because of severe problems in south east Walesin particular - andone man had to wait 19 hours in an ambulance outside a hospital. This strain has been partly blamed for deteriorating ambulance response times, with the situation exacerbated by the fact hospitals are struggling. Ambulances spent more than 11,661 hours outside emergency departments waiting to transfer patients in December - an equivalent to a total of more than 485 days. The average delay was one hour and eight minutes. The Ambulance Service has been hit by high numbers of staff sick or self-isolating ""We would usually see handover delays through winter - but what's unique this time is the overlay of the pandemic,"" Mr Killens added. ""There has to be additional distancing, this means less capacity in emergency departments. ""Testing also needs to be done before patients are admitted  - the additional complexities mean the process is slower and there's less space for patients to go into."" He said the impact of implementing Covid precautions is also affecting how quickly crews can respond. ""As a result of the virus, we're having to clean vehicles and equipment more frequently and thoroughly than before,"" Mr Killens said. This video can not be played Soldiers help ambulance service on Covid 'home straight' ""Also there are levels for personal protective equipment that staff have to wear to protect themselves and others. Level three - the highest in some cases. ""And it takes a number of minutes for crews to put that on before staff treat the patients."" To bolster staffing levels and speed up response times, about80 soldiers are assisting the Welsh Ambulance Servicefor the second time since the start of the pandemic - along with smaller number of staff from other services like the fire service. ""They are driving emergency ambulances for us... which means an emergency ambulance clinician can look after the patient,"" Mr Killens added. ""They'll drive the ambulance from the scene to hospital... it enables us to put more ambulances on the streets to respond to patients more quickly given the levels of absence that we've seen."" Paramedics now have to carry out a more rigorous and time-consuming cleaning regime After facing relentless pressure for close to a year, Mr Killens is worried about the impact on mental health and well-being of ambulance and control centre staff. The service is focused on ""what we can do to keep them fit and well"", he said. But he praised staff for ""stepping up to the plate"" - and insists some of the lessons learnt during the last year will benefit the service during the longer term. ""I've been in the ambulance sector for 25 years and this is like dealing with a very long incident,"" said Mr Killens. ""So, a major incident an emergency service routinely responds to generally will be over in a couple of hours. But the level of pressure has been sustained now for 12 months. ""All of our people have stepped up and done what was necessary and got on with providing the best care in really difficult circumstances.... we will come through it and at the end of the pandemic and will be a stronger organisation for it."" He believes the service is now ""on the home straight"" in dealing with the pandemic. ""We've had two waves of this virus and learnt much along the way, and with a vaccine rollout we have a real opportunity now to see an end to the disruption, the personal impact and the level of death and harm,"" Mr Killens said. ""By the time we get to the other side of the spring, probably we will be able to return to some kind of normality whatever that will be 18 months into a pandemic. ""There's a couple of difficult weeks to come, but if we can emerge through February and March, provided we all stick to the rules, because it's easy for the virus to grab hold again if we get complacent .... we'll be in a far better position as we come to the spring.""

UK travel corridors close and negative test needed,"All travellers arriving in the UK will need to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test All UK travel corridors, which allow arrivals from some countries to avoid having to quarantine, have now closed. Travellers arriving in the UK, whether by boat, train or plane, also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. The test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500. All passengers will still be required to quarantine for up to 10 days. The isolation period can be cut short with a negative test after five days in England, but it does not apply in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The government has said the travel corridor closure will be in force until at least 15 February. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) Underthe new rules,external, travellers arriving from the Falklands, St Helena and Ascension Islands are exempt. Those arriving from some Caribbean islands are exempt until 04:00 GMT on Thursday 21 January. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC'S Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Public Health England would be stepping up checks on travellers who must self-isolate. He said enforcement checks at borders would also be ""ramped up"" and added that asking all arrivals to self-isolate in hotels was a ""potential measure"" the government was keeping under review. Passengers arriving into London's Heathrow airport on Monday said they had been met with ""substantial"" queues at passport control and one couple complained they had ""felt unsafe"" due to what they described as poor social distancing. Passengers speak to staff at the entrance to the Covid-19 Testing Centre at Heathrow Andy Hart, from London, who had arrived into the UK from Nairobi, said: ""We felt that even though everyone was masked they were far too close together. ""It took an hour and 10 minutes. I've been flying 30 times a year for 20 years. I mean, once or twice have I ever seen it [airport queues] like this. How can this happen during Covid times?"" Meanwhile on Sunday, the government announced that afinancial support scheme for airports in England would open this monthin response to the new travel curbs. Aviation minister Robert Courts said the aim was to provide grants of up to Â£8m per applicant by the end of this financial year. The scheme was first announced in November but without a start date. Industry groups have warned there wasonly so long airports could ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? Airline industry 'needs $80bn more government aid' EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the closure of the travel corridors will not have a ""significant impact"" on his airline in the short term as flight numbers were already limited due to the pandemic. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the minimum number of days arrivals must wait to take a negative test releasing them from quarantine could be reduced from five days to three days. Karen Dee, chief executive of trade body the Airport Operators Association, said she supported the decision to close the travel corridors but stressed the need for ""a clear pathway out"". Aban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verdealso came into force on Friday, having been imposed over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Scientists fear the variants seen in South Africa and Brazil mayinterfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system. The travel industry has said closing the travel corridors was understandable due to the health emergency, but warned it would deepen the crisis for the sector. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the system had been ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". He said he assumed the government would remove the latest restrictions as soon as it was safe. ""We've had no revenue now effectively for 12 months, give or take a few months in the summer last year. If we're going to have an aviation sector coming out of this we need to open up in the summer,"" he told the BBC. The Department for Transport has said it is supporting the travel industry with an extension to the furlough scheme until the end of April, business rates relief and tax deferrals. With all parts of the UK under strict virus rules amid high levels of infection, only essential travel is permitted. On Sunday, another 671 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported in the UK, and a further 38,598 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus.

Covid tracked - and how it embedded in rural Wales,"Llangollen, Denbighshire is among many local areas showing up with higher than expected mortality rates over a long period in the first wave Analysis of Covid-19 deaths in the first wave of the pandemic in Wales has showed how the virus took a grip at very local levels of the country. Experts found not all deaths could be explained by factors such as economic deprivation, age and ethnicity. Clusters in some parts of rural Wales persisted, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS) research, It suggests more work is needed to look at factors like travel and high risk occupations. The research tracked nearly 2,000 deaths from the virus in Wales, broken down across more than 400 local areas up to the end of August. Because there was little testing on-demand in the early weeks of the pandemic, hospital figures and deaths are the only real measure of the infection's spread up to the autumn of 2020. Forty eight more deaths with Covid in Wales Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales How Wales is coping with Covid - in six charts This study looked to isolate known risk factors - such as poverty, age and ethnic background - and found ""substantial variation remains unexplained"". While there was higher mortality in historically more deprived areas like the south Wales valleys, consistently higher mortality was also found in smaller, rural areas within Powys, Gwynedd and Anglesey. Although not large in numbers, they were higher rates than might expect to be found. ONS have produced a map showing the clusters, with the high rates, high persistent areas in the darkest blue ""We ended up with these areas where there were more deaths than we would have expected, even after taking into account factors such as economic deprivation, age, ethnicity,"" said Myer Glickman, one of the study's authors. Analysis suggests some of the factors at play are around travel, occupations, living and working in working in different areas and movement patterns between urban and rural areas. The research found some rural parts of Wales, deaths from Covid carried on over a longer period, beyond spikes in the first wave. Clusters identified later in the pandemic - up to early June - included communities in north Wales. ""We found mainly low rates in the rural clusters throughout the bulk of the first wave,"" added study co-author Jordan Parker. ""Deaths were not much higher than expected but were still around for a longer time from March and into May and June. Just the fact they were there, was slightly surprising."" The study looked at the very start of the pandemic in Wales, where we know already there were concerning hotspots aroundCaerphilly, Newport and the Gwent valleys. But by the peak of the first wave in mid April, these ""unexpected"" local areas of Wales with higher Covid deaths were more widespread - and included communities in Powys, as well as urban centres like Cardiff and Swansea. ONS has produced an interactive map to show where the clusters are - most of Wales was in a cluster of higher mortality at least once TheONS has produced an interactive map,external- which shows each community, such as Llandyrnog and Llanarmon-yn-Ial in Denbighshire or Abergwili, Llanegwad and Carmel in Carmarthenshire, among those which have ""high persistence and rates"". Other areas like Tywyn and Llangelynnin had in Gwynedd have higher rates but only showing at fewer times during the pandemic. High persistence and rates:The local area is part of a cluster of higher rates for most of the first wave and had repeatedly high Covid mortality rates itself. Low persistence, high rates:Part of a cluster of higher rates once or a few times. High persistence, low rates:The community was part of a cluster of higher rates for most of the time but did not have notably high mortality itself for most of the time. Low persistence and rates:In a cluster of higher rates once or a few times but did not have notably high mortality rates itself. Not in a cluster:Mortality rates were equal to or lower than the rest of the country and never part of a higher rates cluster. Bobby Feeley, a Denbighshire councillor in Ruthin, said compared with the first wave people had more knowledge about Covid - and it was not just about numbers but ""real people"" and very few had not been touched by it in some way. ""In the first wave, I think we were all in shock, we didn't really know what had hit us,"" she said. Will mass Covid testing be offered across Wales? Why are we looking at the 'R number' in Wales? Did we see a Christmas coronavirus spike? ""People are now probably looking into finer details of what's gone on and things will come to light. Wherever it happens, whether rural or urban, it's everywhere, so we all need to take care."" Ruthin was identified as being close to a cluster of higher rate communities but not having higher mortality itself most of the time. ""In rural areas, houses and people are more spaced apart, in many rural areas there are few shops and the pubs are shut, you would think they would have less chance of picking up Covid,"" added Ms Feeley. ""If they have done, have people travelled somewhere, formed bubbles with friends and family? I would've assumed rural areas would have less Covid."" The study recommends more research - including into the routes of infection in and around the country but also into specific groups of occupations or types of household associated with high infection risk. Larger scale testing of people with symptoms since the autumn means that Public Health Wales - and statisticians - can track far more easily how infection is spreading and where hotspots of positive tests show up in local communities. Wrexham communities have been reporting Wales' high infection rates in recent weeks, while the local hospital has reporteda ""rapid increase"" in seriously ill people in the last few days.and the health board has more people in critical care with Covid than at any time in the pandemic. The ONS said it will be analysing closely local mortality data to see how it correlates with case figures during this second wave.

BT faces Â£600m lawsuit over 'historic overcharging',"BT is facing a class action lawsuit over claims it failed to compensate elderly customers who were overcharged for landlines for years. In 2017,Ofcom said people who only had a landline telephone,externalwere ""getting poor value for money in a market that is not serving them well enough"". As a result,BT reduced the price of its landlines by Â£7 a month,external. But campaigners are unhappy that ""loyal customers"" have still not been compensated for previous overcharging. ""Ofcom made it very clear that BT had spent years overcharging landline customers, but did not order it to repay the money it made from this,"" said Justin Le Patourel, founder of consumer group Collective Action on Landlines (CALL) and a telecoms consultant who worked for Ofcom for 13 years. ""We think millions of BT's most loyal landline customers could be entitled to compensation of up to Â£500 each, and the filing of this claim starts that process."" Government denies 'snubbing' BT wi-fi pupil offer Openreach creating 5,300 jobs to aid fibre rollout BT said it ""strongly disagrees"" with the claim that it had engaged in anti-competitive behaviour and intends to defend itself ""vigorously"" in court. A spokesman for BT said: ""We take our responsibilities to older and more vulnerable customers very seriously and will defend ourselves against any claim that suggests otherwise. ""For many years we've offered discounted landline and broadband packages in what is a competitive market with competing options available, and we take pride in our work with elderly and vulnerable groups, as well as our work on the Customer Fairness agenda."" Law firm Mishcon de Reya has filed a claim with the Competition Appeal Tribunal (CAT) worth Â£600m. The claim could result in payments of up to Â£500 each for 2.3 million BT customers, should it be successful. The case represents customers who purchased a BT landline contract, but did not also take BT broadband or pay TV packages. Since 2009, the wholesale costs of providing landlines to consumers have been falling by at least 25%. But in October 2017, Ofcom found that all major landline providers in the UK had increased the line rental charges by 28-41%. Ofcom strongly criticised market leader BT for raising prices, saying that customers were being given ""poor value"" for money. It added that many of the affected customers had ""been with BT for decades"" and were more likely to be old, on low incomes and vulnerable. BT announced that it would slash its landline prices by Â£84 a year. BT's argument is that Ofcom's final statement did not explicitly accuse it of engaging in anti-competitive behaviour. But independent telecoms analyst Ian Grant says that the telecoms giant ""has a history of abusing its position"". ""Earlier in 2017, Ofcom fined BT Â£42m because it was late providing high-speed Ethernet lines, and forced BT to make good the losses of firms like Vodafone and TalkTalk,"" he told the BBC. ""Ofcom, which has a statutory duty to stop consumer abuses, could have done the same for these customers. Instead, it allowed BT to get away with a 37% price cut, at a time when the difference between its costs and what it charged customers had risen between 50-74%."" Mr Grant added: ""It is especially poor that BT was overcharging customers who were mostly over 65, more than three-quarters of whom had never used a different provider, and for whom the telephone was their only communications link.""

"China's growth accelerates, bucking global trend","China's economy grew at the slowest pace in more than four decades last year, official figures show, but remains on course to be the only major economy to have expanded in 2020. The economy grew 2.3% last year, despite Covid-19 shutdowns causing output to slump in early 2020. Strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses helped the economy recover. Growth in the final three months of the year picked up to 6.5%. Chinese economy 'to overtake US by 2028' 'China is a hard rock. It won't be beaten by virus' China continues to bounce back from virus slump ""The GDP data shows the economy has almost normalised. This momentum will continue, although the current Covid-19 outbreak in a couple of provinces in northern China might temporarily cause fluctuation,"" said Yue Su, principal economist for the Economist Intelligence Unit. China's mainland share markets as well as Hong Kong's Hang Seng posted modest gains on the latest figures, which exceeded economists' expectations, according to a Reuters poll. However, Covid-19 was still a major drain on growth in 2020, with nationwide shutdowns of factories and manufacturing plants forcing economic growth down to its slowest rate for four decades. China's manufacturing sector appears to have recovered, with Monday's data showing a 7.3% increase in industrial output. Exports have also led the way. Data last week showed Chinese exports grew by more than expected in December, as coronavirus disruptions around the world fuelled demand for Chinese goods. That is despite a stronger yuan, which makes Chinese exports more expensive for overseas buyers. China's economy has seen a strong rebound, while the rest of the world struggles with anaemic demand, millions of job losses, and businesses shutting down. China's economic engine roared back to life after a brutal lockdown that saw the Chinese economy contract by a historic 6.8% in the first quarter of 2020. We should always be circumspect about Chinese data - with the usual caveat that the trajectory of the data rather than the figures themselves are a useful guide to how China's economy is growing. What these numbers show is that China's strategy of locking down cities hard and quickly has worked. A combination of government-led investment and global demand for Chinese goods also helped to power a rapid recovery, and boost exports. Still - this is the lowest rate of annual growth in more than 40 years for the economic giant. Worries over a resurgence of the virus are also clouding China's growth outlook, with consumer demand still weak. And Beijing is trying to navigate a prickly trade relationship with the US, with the incoming administration unlikely to be softer on China than President Donald Trump. All of these challenges will no doubt weigh on Chinese growth in 2021 - but they seem to be in a better place than the rest of the world's major economies. It was not all good news from the latest figures. Li Wei, a senior economist at Standard Chartered Bank, said pandemic-related exports and credit-fuelled car and housing sales accounted for much of the growth, while domestic demand lagged behind. ""Domestic household consumption of food, clothing, furniture and utilities remains below pre-pandemic levels, while the hospitality and transportation sectors continue to face capacity and travel restrictions,"" he told Reuters. This video can not be played Why does Chinaâs economy matter to you? Although retail sales grew by 4.6% in the fourth quarter of 2020, they fell by 3.9% for the year. Many analysts are tipping growth to accelerate in 2021, but the China Bureau of Statistics has warned of a ""grave and complex environment both at home and abroad"", with the pandemic having a ""huge impact"". China still faces many challenges, including continuing trade tensions with the US and how they might play out under the administration of President-elect Joe Biden, who takes office later this week.

'Patchy supply' hampering vaccine rollout,"This video can not be played The BMA Scotland GP chief says doctors ""can't plan"" for vaccines Doctors leaders say the ""patchy supply"" of vaccine to GP surgeries across Scotland is hampering the speed of delivery to patients. Ministers have pledged a first dose of the vaccine to1.4 million of the most vulnerableScots by mid-February. But the British Medical Association in Scotland said inconsistencies in supply made it difficult to plan patient appointments to receive the vaccine. They also said some GP surgeries had yet to receive any vaccine at all. The Scottish government said it was working with health boards to resolve the issues. Currently, about 16,000 vaccinations a day are being carried out in Scotland. However, that is expected to rise significantly as efforts to deliver the vaccine are scaled up. On Sunday, 1,341 new cases of Covid-19 were reported - the lowest daily figure since 28 December. However, the numbers being admitted to hospital have continued to rise, reaching 1,918. No new deaths were registered. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? When will I be vaccinated against the virus? Has Scotland been slower to vaccinate the over-80s? Health Secretary Jeane Freeman has pledged that the workforce and infrastructure will be in place to vaccinate 400,000 people each week by the end of February. The government has already announced plans for large vaccination centres in Aberdeen, Glasgow and Edinburgh. It comes after more than 5,000 front-line health and carestaff were vaccinated at the NHS Louisa Jordan in Glasgow on Saturday. GP practices across Scotland are currently providing vaccination services to those aged over 80. About 16,000 vaccinations are currently being carried out a day in Scotland Speaking on the BBC's Politics Scotland programme, Dr Andrew Buist, who chairs the British Medical Association's (BMA) GP committee in Scotland, said there was inconsistencies across the GP network. He said the vaccine deployment plan was ""ambitious"" and so far ""good progress"" had been made in giving it to priority groups such as care homes residents and front-line health staff. However, he told the programme: ""The current problem lies with the next priority group, which is the 80-plus group, which GPs in Scotland are set to vaccinate because the supply of the vaccine so far has been quite patchy. ""Some practices have a good supply, some have had none so far."" He said his practice had received 100 doses of the vaccine for 600 patients over the age of 80, who all needed to be vaccinated by 5 February. He added: ""I then have to do another 1,200 patients in the 70-plus group and the extremely clinically vulnerable by the middle of February, so we need to do 1,700 vaccines in the next four weeks. ""Now we can do that. We are used to providing large number of flu vaccinations and it is possible, we have our workforce in place, but we need the vaccine, otherwise we can't do it."" When asked if his practice was running out of vaccine at the end of each day, Dr Buist said: ""Yes - we can't plan, that's the key thing. We can't send out appointments to patients until we're sure we have the vaccine in our fridge. ""We were given 100 doses on Monday. We used that all up by Friday. We don't want to send out appointments to patients until we know that we can definitively vaccinate them otherwise patients get very upset."" Vaccinators have reported being able to extract one additional dose from vaccine vials Dr Buist said vaccinators were regularly managing to extract higher numbers of doses from vaccine vials despite claims that some doses were being wasted. He said there was widespread experience of six doses being extracted from Pfizer vaccine vials, which were marketed as having five doses, while 11 doses were regularly being taken from AstraZeneca vials. But Dr Buist criticised issues around the red tape some retired health professional had faced when volunteering to become vaccinators. ""I have reports that arrangement to get doctors and nurses back into the system have been quite bureaucratic and I think it's something we need to look at."" The Scottish government acknowledged that there had been delays in vaccine supplies reaching some GP surgeries. A spokeswoman said: ""GPs have a significant role to play in delivering the vaccine - and we thank them for their hard work and patience as we roll out more vaccines to those in the communities. ""We know there have been some initial delays in supply reaching some practices and are working with health boards to resolve this. Vaccines are being manufactured as quickly as possible and we will continue to explore all options available to increase supply."" The government said health boards were providing order information for their GP practices to National Procurement who in turn advised the distribution partner. The spokeswoman added: ""Once stock is released for ordering, the distribution partner inputs the GP orders on to their ordering system. Once the order has been placed, GP practices will receive an automated email providing an indication of the delivery day. ""We too want to vaccinate as many people as quickly as possible and are continually working hard to see if distribution can be made faster in any respect.""

"Vaccinations to begin for over-70s in EnglandOver five million more people will be offered a jab, as 10 new mass vaccination hubs open in England.UK","This video can not be played The prime minister warns that ""we're not out of the woods yet"" People in England in their 70s, and those listed asclinically extremely vulnerable,external, will begin receiving offers of a coronavirus vaccine this week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the move was a ""significant milestone"" in the nation's vaccination programme. More than five million people - from priority groups three and four - will be invited from Monday to have the jab. It comes as 10 further massvaccination hubs open across England. Speaking from a vaccination centre in Oxford, Mr Johnson said about four million people had received a vaccine so far, adding it was now ""right"" to offer the jab to other priority groups. He said: ""We're getting it out as fast as we can, four million done so far, I think we've done more than half of the over-80s, half of the people in care homes, the elderly residents of care homes."" He warned there would be no ""Open Sesame"" relaxation of Covid restrictions, adding that any easing was reliant on the vaccine rollout being a success and there being no further concerning variants of the virus. He said the pace of the rollout was ""very encouraging"" but cautioned that any easing of the rules would be ""gradual"", as the situation was ""still pretty precarious"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock will lead a Downing Street news briefing later, No 10 has said. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? What are the new rules for travellers? How many cases are there in your area? The expansion of the vaccination programme comes after the number of people to receive a first dose rose to 3.8 million across the UK - more than have tested positive (3.4 million) since the pandemic began. However, people in the top two groups - care home residents, those aged 80 and over, and front-line healthcare workers - should still be prioritised for vaccinations, the Department for Health and Social Care said. People in their 70s -some 5.6 million people- and clinically extremely vulnerable individuals make uppriority groups three and four. Nadhim Zahawi, the minister responsible for the vaccine rollout, defended the decision to offer Covid jabs to the over-70s and clinically vulnerable - before all those in the first two priority groups have had their vaccinations. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the over-80s ""need not worry"" if they had not yet been invited for a jab. He said as it was only areas where the majority of the over-80s had been vaccinated that people aged 70 and over were being invited for jabs. He added that, by today, 50% of care home residents should have been vaccinated. Although vaccine supply remained ""lumpy"", he said he was ""confident"" the government would meet its target to vaccinate all 15 million people in the top four priority groups by 15 February. Visiting the NHS Covid Vaccine Centre in Wembley, north London, Prof Stephen Powis said there were signs in the capital that growth and infection rates were slowing Meanwhile, Prof Stephen Powis, national medical director for NHS England, said the NHS had never been under the level of pressure it is now, in any previous winter. Prof Powis told BBC Breakfast: ""I don't think the NHS has ever been under such pressure in any winter, but our staff are responding magnificently."" He added that there were ""signs"" in London that growth and infection rates were ""slowing"" but it would take ""several weeks"" before it had an impact in reducing the number of people in hospital, warning that it would be ""tough"" over the next couple of weeks. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area FOOD:Is it safe to have a takeaway or shopping delivery? QUARANTINE:What are the new UK travel rules? TREATMENT:How close are we to helping people? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? Dr Rupert Pearse, a consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at a London Hospital, said although it appeared that infection levels had peaked in the capital, cases were still rising elsewhere in England, including the North West and Yorkshire, adding there was ""still cause to be concerned"". He told BBC Radio 4's World At One that hospital admissions tended to ""lag seven to 10 days behind the peak in infections"", with intensive care admissions coming 48 hours after that. He said that hospitals that are very close to the maximum number of beds they can give to Covid patients were ""still very worried about what will happen in the coming days"". This video can not be played BBC's Laura Foster explains the order in which the Covid vaccine will be given Dr Sarah Burford, a GP in Wellington, Somerset, who has been helping lead vaccine rollout in her region, said it was going ""terribly well"" but that ""a few"" patients had turned up out of the blue looking for a jab. She told BBC Radio 4's World At One programme that her four vaccinators were each giving a jab every seven-and-a-half minutes. Dr Burford added the over-80s and frontline healthcare workers were being invited for jabs, and her team's ""priority"" for this week and next would be vaccinating care home residents and staff. She said although most people were being patient, fielding calls or walk-in inquiries about when people could expect to be vaccinated was only delaying staff from administering jabs.

Meanwhile, Welsh First Minister Mark Drakeford hasdefended the speed of the vaccine rollout in Wales, insisting the nation was ""on track"" to vaccinate all top four priority groups by mid-February. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Wales's supply of the Pfizer jab is not being used all at once as it has to last until a delivery in February. In Wales, 151,737 people have received a first dose of a Covid vaccine, according to Public Health Wales, and  in Scotland, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced that264,991 people have had a first dose of the jab, with 80% of care home residents having now been vaccinated.

As such, he announced on Friday that, from this week, all travel corridors are to be closed. That means that anyone arriving in the UK - with onlya small number of exceptions,external- will have to quarantine. Under current rules, anyone flying into the country from overseas also has to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off.

Badly-hit Brazil begins Covid vaccine roll-out,"Monica Calazans, a 54-year-old nurse in SÃ£o Paulo, was given a Chinese-developed vaccine A nurse has received Brazil's first Covid-19 vaccine dose after regulators gave emergency approval to two jabs. Regulator Anvisa gave the green light to vaccines from Oxford-AstraZeneca and China's Sinovac, doses of which will be distributed among all 27 states. Brazil has the world's second-highest death toll from Covid-19 and cases are rising again across the country. President Jair Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for his handling of the pandemic. The far-right leader has played down the pandemic from the beginning,promoted an unproven treatment for the diseaseandgone against measures including mask-wearing and social distancing. The president, who caught Covid-19 last year and recovered, has said he will not take a vaccine. Authorities reported 551 new fatalities on Sunday, the first time in six days that it had fallen short of 1,000 although this could reflect a delay in the reporting of numbers over the weekend. In all, more than 209,000 Covid-related deaths have been recorded in Brazil, a raw total figure only exceeded by the US. Over 8.4 million infections have been confirmed since the start of the pandemic - the third-highest tally in the world. Brazil hospitals 'run out of oxygen' for virus patients Brazil virus variant already in UK Health Minister Eduardo Pazuello told reporters that the national vaccination programme in the country of 211 million people would begin in earnest in the coming days. Two Brazilian biomedical centres which have been given approval to produce the jabs will be heavily involved. About six million doses of the Sinovac-developed CoronaVac have already been produced in Brazil, while the government is waiting for shipments of the AstraZeneca vaccine from a laboratory in India. Shortly after Anvisa's board gave emergency approval, Monica Calazans, a 54-year-old nurse in SÃ£o Paulo, became the first person to be inoculated with CoronaVac. Her vaccination was organised by the SÃ£o Paulo state government, which is led by Mr Bolsonaro's main political rival, JoÃ£o Doria. This has been a rare piece of good news today for Brazilians who are grappling with a devastating second wave. From where I am, the city of Manaus, the vaccine does not feel real. People here are trying to recover a collapsed health system and doing what they can to keep their sick relatives alive. The pandemic has become deeply political in Brazil. President Bolsonaro continues to present himself as a vaccine sceptic and he was notably absent as the vaccines were approved. Instead, Monday's newspapers will no doubt have SÃ£o Paulo Governor Doria slapped on their front pages. He is expected to run in next year's presidential elections and has backed the Sinovac vaccine from the very start. He was once a Bolsonaro ally and is now his nemesis - but there is no doubt who is leading the way in trying to get the population vaccinated. Earlier this weekresearchers said the Chinese vaccine had been found to be 50.4% effective in Brazilian clinical trials. This, results showed, was significantly less effective than previous data suggested - barely over the 50% needed for regulatory approval. CoronaVac is also being used in China, Indonesia and Turkey. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains why the Oxford vaccine matters The news comes after revelations that a new coronavirus variant has emerged in Brazil. Several cases were traced back to the Amazonas state, where a state of emergency is in place. Manaus, the state capital, has been hit especially hard, with beds and life-saving oxygen running low. Refrigerated containers have also been brought to hospitals to help store bodies. Neighbouring Venezuela said it had sent a convoy of trucks with oxygen supplies to help Amazonas. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? President Bolsonaro has faced mounting criticism for his handling of Brazil's outbreak, and several anti-government protests were held last week. An opponent of lockdowns, he has previously blamed state governors and mayors for the Covid crisis, saying the federal government has provided all the resources needed to tackle the virus.

UK travel corridors closure to come into force,"All travellers arriving in the UK will need to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test All UK travel corridors, which allow arrivals from some countries to avoid having to quarantine, have now closed. Travellers arriving in the UK, whether by boat, train or plane, also have to show proof of a negative Covid-19 test to be allowed entry. The test must be taken in the 72 hours before travelling and anyone arriving without one faces a fine of up to Â£500. All passengers will still be required to quarantine for up to 10 days. The isolation period can be cut short with a negative test after five days in England, but it does not apply in Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. The government has said the travel corridor closure will be in force until at least 15 February. This video can not be played Coronavirus: How to fly during a global pandemic (this video reflects the rules before the hotel quarantine was introduced in the UK) Underthe new rules,external, travellers arriving from the Falklands, St Helena and Ascension Islands are exempt. Those arriving from some Caribbean islands are exempt until 04:00 GMT on Thursday 21 January. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC'S Andrew Marr Show on Sunday that Public Health England would be stepping up checks on travellers who must self-isolate. He said enforcement checks at borders would also be ""ramped up"" and added that asking all arrivals to self-isolate in hotels was a ""potential measure"" the government was keeping under review. Passengers arriving into London's Heathrow airport on Monday said they had been met with ""substantial"" queues at passport control and one couple complained they had ""felt unsafe"" due to what they described as poor social distancing. Passengers speak to staff at the entrance to the Covid-19 Testing Centre at Heathrow Andy Hart, from London, who had arrived into the UK from Nairobi, said: ""We felt that even though everyone was masked they were far too close together. ""It took an hour and 10 minutes. I've been flying 30 times a year for 20 years. I mean, once or twice have I ever seen it [airport queues] like this. How can this happen during Covid times?"" Meanwhile on Sunday, the government announced that afinancial support scheme for airports in England would open this monthin response to the new travel curbs. Aviation minister Robert Courts said the aim was to provide grants of up to Â£8m per applicant by the end of this financial year. The scheme was first announced in November but without a start date. Industry groups have warned there wasonly so long airports could ""run on fumes"", following the announcement of the new quarantine rules. What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? Airline industry 'needs $80bn more government aid' EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the closure of the travel corridors will not have a ""significant impact"" on his airline in the short term as flight numbers were already limited due to the pandemic. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the minimum number of days arrivals must wait to take a negative test releasing them from quarantine could be reduced from five days to three days. Karen Dee, chief executive of trade body the Airport Operators Association, said she supported the decision to close the travel corridors but stressed the need for ""a clear pathway out"". Aban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verdealso came into force on Friday, having been imposed over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Scientists fear the variants seen in South Africa and Brazil mayinterfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system. The travel industry has said closing the travel corridors was understandable due to the health emergency, but warned it would deepen the crisis for the sector. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the system had been ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". He said he assumed the government would remove the latest restrictions as soon as it was safe. ""We've had no revenue now effectively for 12 months, give or take a few months in the summer last year. If we're going to have an aviation sector coming out of this we need to open up in the summer,"" he told the BBC. The Department for Transport has said it is supporting the travel industry with an extension to the furlough scheme until the end of April, business rates relief and tax deferrals. With all parts of the UK under strict virus rules amid high levels of infection, only essential travel is permitted. On Sunday, another 671 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were reported in the UK, and a further 38,598 lab-confirmed cases of coronavirus.
