Tory MP Charlie Elphicke suspended,"MP Charlie Elphicke has been suspended by the Conservatives after ""serious allegations"" that have been referred to the police, the party has said. Mr Elphicke, a former party whip who has been the MP for Dover since 2010, has denied any wrongdoing. In a post on Twitter, the married 46-year-old wrote: ""The party tipped off the press before telling me of my suspension. ""I am not aware of what the alleged claims are and deny any wrongdoing."" Two days into his job as the party's new chief whip, Julian Smith issued a statement announcing Mr Elphicke's suspension. According to the BBC's political correspondent, Chris Mason, in practice this means Mr Elphicke remains in the Commons, but for the time being at least, is not a Tory MP. The party has not provided any further detail about the nature of the allegations, and did not reveal who had made a complaint about him. The Dover and Deal Conservative Association has backed their MP in a statement, saying that Mr Elphicke is ""professional and dedicated"" and innocent until proven guilty. What counts as inappropriate behaviour? Harassment in Westminster: the allegations and denials Tories publish new code of conduct However, it comes amid growing concern in Westminster over the conduct of politicians following a string of allegations of serious sexual abuse in Parliament. Sir Michael Fallon resignedas defence secretary earlier this week following allegations about his conduct. LabourMPs Clive Lewis and Kelvin Hopkins are being investigatedby the party over allegations about their behaviour. Mr Hopkins has ""absolutely and categorically"" denied inappropriate conduct, while Mr Lewis has said: ""I don't, as a rule, grope people's bottoms"". 'Favours and bullying' Sir Roger Gale, Conservative MP for North Thanet, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be wrong to ""rush to judgement"" before there is proof of wrongdoing, warning against a ""witch hunt"". He said: ""We're in danger of getting into a situation where nobody half bright, half sensible, half decent, will want to go into the House of Commons - and that will not be good for democracy. ""We should look at the facts...by all means throw book at them, but don't throw the book at them until the case is proven."" This video can not be played Labour MP Rupa Huq says Westminster needs to ""get into line"". But Rupa Huq, Labour MP for Ealing Central and Acton, told BBC Breakfast that the House of Commons has ""no real structure"" for complaints. She said it is ""the most unusual workplace"" where the rules around sexual harassment are ""lax if not non-existent"". ""In this sense it needs to get into line, other big companies have a sexual harassment policy, they have a staff handbook. All those things do not exist for MPs"", she said. On top of that, she added, ""you've got a whole political culture which has thrived on favours and bullying"" as well as partisan ""one-upmanship"" where people are ""incredibly loyal to their parties"". The Conservatives havepublished a new code of conduct,externalfor MPs and other elected representatives, while Labour has introduced a new complaints procedure. A spokesman for the Liberal Democrats said the party has a ""robust and effective"" complaints procedure which was strengthened in 2014 and is constantly under review. The Conservative party is immediately adopting a new complaints procedure with a hotline for reporting potential breaches and a more detailed investigatory process. For the first time, there will be an independent figure on the body looking into grievances, the party said. Prime Minister Theresa May is due to meet opposition party leaders, including Labour's Jeremy Corbyn and the Liberal Democrat's Vince Cable, on Monday to discuss proposals to bring forward a new grievance system for Westminster staff and MPs. Mrs May said Parliament must do its bit as well as the individual parties - as it was not fair to expect potentially vulnerable people to ""navigate different grievance procedures according to political party"". Lord Bew, chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, told the Today programme that the ""burning issue"" at stake is the reputation of parliament. He said it was vital that cases were not dealt with internally by the parties, but by those outside parliament who could ""give some reassurance to the public that this is not just another cover-up"".

Harman joke 'staggering judgement error',"Harriet Harman has been urged to apologise for repeating an offensive joke about the Holocaust on BBC TV. The Labour MP read out the joke as an example of one she had complained about some years ago. The Jewish Leadership Council said it was a ""staggering error of judgement"" to repeat it ""irrespective of the point she was trying to make"". Ms Harman later tweeted that it was ""no laughing matter"" and such jokes ""perpetuate discrimination & hatred"". The former Labour deputy leaderappeared on BBC One's This Week programmeand repeated the joke in a segment about humour which offends people. Referring to a story she recounts in her memoir A Woman's Work, she said: ""I've long been accused of being humourless, and a humourless feminist, and I'll give you two examples that I protested about, because they were offensive and hurtful."" She annoyed host Andrew Neil by saying: ""People like Andrew say that things like this are perfectly all right."" She was cut short by Mr Neil after telling the first joke - which she said was ""not funny"" - and the presenter reprimanded her for suggesting he would think it was OK. He later told the Labour MP to ""be quiet"". The chief executive of the Jewish Leadership Council Simon Johnson said:  ""I cannot recall being so disappointed in a politician. Harriet Harman must surely know better than to repeat a vile Holocaust joke, irrespective of the point she was trying to make. She must apologise and do so quickly. It is a staggering error of judgment."" Mr Neil later tweeted that he was ""appalled and even a little bit upset by what she said"". He said: ""What was wrong was 1) Even to tell that so called joke on live TV. 2) Claim I would like the joke. Appalling on both counts."" Ms Harman has not apologised but on Twitter she said that anti-Semitic jokes were ""no laughing matter"". She tweeted a page from her book, in which she recounts two offensive jokes that appeared in a Guy's Hospital rag magazine years ago, which she went on to refer to the Director of Public Prosecutions. In her book, she wrote that she had been condemned ""for overreacting and being humourless"". But, she added, ""the Jewish community and local black and Asian organisations were deeply appreciative when the hospital apologised"". Ms Harman was offered support by Labour shadow minister Chi Onwurah, who said: ""I remember those kind of jokes in 1980s Imperial College rag mag. Very isolating for minority/female students like me. Good on you, Harriet.""

Puppy leads sheep into farmer's house,"This video can not be played The sheep left muck over the house before leaving through the front porch (from Fortitude Press) Imagine coming home to find a flock of sheep in your kitchen? That is what happened to farmer Rosalyn Edwards. Her overzealous sheepdog pup Rocky guided a flock of sheep from their pen right into her kitchen. The seven-month-old border collie took advantage of an open gate to lead nine sheep directly through the back door of his owners' home. Mrs Edwards said: ""It was funny at the time, but then there was quite a lot of wee, poo and mud everywhere."" She posted a video filmed by her children to Facebook, showing the sheep in the kitchen of her smallholding in Devon. The sheep caused havoc in the house before leaving through the front porch She said: ""I was in the kitchen and heard a noise. I turned around and the sheep were just standing there. There were about nine of them. ""I took the children into another room and then tried to guide the sheep out. They went right around from the kitchen and left again through the porch."" Mrs Edwards says the flock took a good look around the house before finally leaving at the front of the house. Rocky guided a flock from the pen into the kitchen Despite the mess she said it was funny, in part because of the eager little sheepdog's efforts. She said: ""Rocky did look quite pleased with himself, but he's going to need more training. ""He brought a whole new meaning to 'bringing the sheep home'.""

The most dramatic ways to quit your job,"Some workers are probably guilty of fantasising about making a spectacular exit from their day job or pulling a Bridget Jones and telling their boss what they really think of them. But one (now former) Twitter employee actually did it, and made their departure known around the world on Thursday bydeleting US President Donald Trump's Twitter account. The social media platform said his account was ""inadvertently deactivated due to human error"" and restored it after 11 minutes. But what are other famous examples of unconventional resignations and frosty workplace goodbyes? In 2010 a disgruntled air steward, Steven Slater, lost patience with passengers' behaviour andended his flying career with a spectacular exit from a Pittsburgh to New York flight. He had reportedly been drawn into an altercation between passengers over overhead luggage space during the flight. After a woman then ignored his requests to stay seated as the plane landed, he took to the plane's intercom system. Reports said he went on a foul-mouthed rebuke of the passenger and said: ""To those who have shown dignity and respect these last 20 years, thanks for the great ride"", before grabbing a beer from the in-flight trolley, activating the JetBlue plane's inflatable slide and departing. He told the New York Times the flamboyant exit had been a long-held fantasy. But it proved to be an expensive one, after a judge eventually ordered him to pay the company $10,000 (Â£7,700) for a replacement slide and sentenced him to a year's probation. He faced felony charges of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief, as well as criminal trespass. In 2013 Chris Holmes, a former airport border force worker,baked his resignation letter and gave it to his employerswhen he opted for a change in career. Four years on he is still baking and running his own business full-time, and told the BBC he had absolutely no regrets about his decision. He said he found his old job at Stansted Airport quite boring and wanted to ""inject a bit of a fun in a final flourish"". ""At the time everyone asked me if I thought everyone should quit their job for something they love,"" he said. ""If you have a plan in place, why not?"" Both animator Marina Schifrin and games developer Jarrad Woods turned their crafts into creative resignations online. In 2009 Mr Woods, who is also known by his nickname Farbs, made a customised level of video game Mario to reveal his resignation from a Australian game developer in order to go freelance. In a blog post he said he spent the night making the game, and then sent it off around his office -you can still play it on his website,external. In 2013 Ms Schifrin was working at the time as an animator in Taiwan when she posted a video of herself quitting by dancing around an empty office on YouTube set to the Kanye West song Gone. The description for ""An Interpretive Dance For My Boss"" said: ""My boss only cares about quantity and how many views each video gets. So I figured I'd make ONE video of my own."" Itgot almost 20 million views online,external(but it has now been removed for copyright infringement on the song). Her old company and manager tried to have the last laugh byposting their own version of her video,externalin response. A Rhode Island hotel-worker staged a spectacular resignation in 2011 when he brought his marching band friends along with him to tell his boss he quit after three and a half years. Joey DeFrancesco posted the video online and it soon went viral (warning: expletives),external. The band are seen sneaking into the hotel and begin playing a celebratory song after the worker hands his manager a letter of resignation. The disagreement was reportedly part of a long-running battle between employees and management over union membership. ""We'd joked about doing it for a really long time, at someone's engagement or them coming out to their parents or something,"" Mr DeFrancesco told the BBC. But he said to quit alongside the band came out of the blue after a ""particularly awful day at work"". His video was watched almost six million times and saw the band invited on US television shows.He still plays music, recently with his new band. A typesetter at an Australian magazinedrew a naked cartoon of himself and put it on the cover of his final edition,external(don't worry - nothing in this link is explicit), replacing British band the Kaiser Chiefs, back in 2012. Luke Benge hijacked the edition by swapping out the image with a crude drawing, complete with genitals, avoiding the pre-print checks. According to Australian media, no one at the magazine knew about the cover until 35,000 copies had been distributed across Melbourne. Beat magazine took it well, and apologised to faint-hearted locals who might have been offended. One of the best-known resignations is that of an Alaskan television news anchor, Charlo Greene, who quit in 2014 while live on-air. She was presenting a story about a group lobbying for legalisation of cannabis - she walked off set because, it surprisingly turned out, she ran the group Another example from 2013 was of a Brazilian priest quitting during Mass,externalby announcing he going to be a father David Powell-Cameron told the BBC how he and a fellow window-dresser in a department store in Pennsylvania in 1983 sabotaged the main window display to become a macabre gorilla wedding scene - complete with animal costumes in wedding gowns in front of a firing squad. ""Our revenge was realized when we watched frantic employees enter the window, with rush-hour foot traffic watching, and wrestle with the grotesque scene to dismantle it,"" he said. You told us that creative notes are also a popular method, including making elaborate designs. Tina told the BBC she had a difficult boss in a bank that refused to directly talk to her so she hid her resignation letter in his letter pile and watched him open it then just walked out. Although we don't recommend violence, Jim McCarthy told the BBC that he resigned from a job as a carpenter when he was 18 with a punch to a boss he described as a ""bully"" .""When he was coming to, I told him, I guess you know today is my last day,"" he said.

The time when America stopped being great,"A year ago Donald Trump produced the biggest political upset in modern-day America, but were there historical clues that pointed to his unexpected victory? Flying into Los Angeles, a descent that takes you from the desert, over the mountains, to the outer suburbs dotted with swimming pools shaped like kidneys, always brings on a near narcotic surge of nostalgia. This was the flight path I followed more than 30 years ago, as I fulfilled a boyhood dream to make my first trip to the United States. America had always fired my imagination, both as a place and as an idea. So as I entered the immigration hall, under the winsome smile of America's movie star president, it was hardly a case of love at first sight. My infatuation had started long before, with Westerns, cop shows, superhero comic strips, and movies such as West Side Story and Grease. Gotham exerted more of a pull than London. My 16-year-old self could quote more presidents than prime ministers. Like so many new arrivals, like so many of my compatriots, I felt an instant sense of belonging, a fealty borne of familiarity. Eighties America lived up to its billing, from the multi-lane freeways to the cavernous fridges, from the drive-in movie theatres to the drive-through burger joints. I loved the bigness, the boldness, the brashness. Coming from a country where too many people were reconciled to their fate from too early an age, the animating force of the American Dream was not just seductive but unshackling. Upward mobility was not a given amongst my schoolmates. The absence of resentment was also striking: the belief success was something to emulate rather than envy. The sight of a Cadillac induced different feelings than the sight of a Rolls Royce. It was 1984. Los Angeles was hosting the Olympics. The Soviet boycott meant US athletes dominated the medals table more so than usual. McDonald's had a scratch-card promotion, planned presumably before Eastern bloc countries decided to keep their distance, offering Big Macs, Cokes and fries if Americans won gold, silver or bronze in selected events. So for weeks I feasted on free fast food, a calorific accompaniment to chants of ""USA! USA!"" This was the summertime of American resurgence. After the long national nightmare of Vietnam, Watergate and the Iranian hostage crisis, the country demonstrated its capacity for renewal. 1984, far from being the dystopian hell presaged by George Orwell, was a time of celebration and optimism. Uncle Sam - back then, nobody gave much thought to the country being given a male personification - seemed happy again in his own skin. For millions, it really was ""Morning Again in America"", the slogan of Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign. In that year's presidential election, he buried his Democratic opponent Walter Mondale in a landslide, winning 49 out of 50 states and 58.8% of the popular vote. The United States could hardly be described as politically harmonious. There was the usual divided government. Republicans retained control of the Senate, but the Democrats kept their stranglehold on the House of Representatives. Reagan's sunniness was sullied by the launch of his 1980 campaign with a call for ""states' rights"", which sounded to many like a dog-whistle for denial of civil rights. Ronald Reagan on the campaign trail in 1979 His chosen venue was Philadelphia, but not the city of brotherly love, the cradle of the Declaration of Independence, but rather Philadelphia, Mississippi, a rural backwater close to where three civil rights workers had been murdered by white supremacists in 1964. Reagan, like Nixon, pursued the southern strategy, which exploited white fears about black advance. Still, the anthem of the hour was Lee Greenwood's God Bless the USA and politics was not nearly as polarised as it is today. Even though the Democratic House Speaker Tip O'Neill reviled Reagan's trickle-down economics - he called him a ""cheerleader for selfishness"" and ""Herbert Hoover with a smile"" - these two Irish-Americans found common ground as they sought to act in the national interest. Both understood the Founding Fathers had hard-wired compromise into the governmental system, and that Washington, with its checks and balances, was unworkable without give and take. They worked together on tax reform and safeguarding Social Security. The country was in the ascendant. Not so paranoid as it was in the 1950s, not so restive as it was in the 1960s, and nowhere near as demoralised as it had been in the 1970s. History is never neat or linear. Decades do not automatically have personalities, but it is possible to divide the period since 1984 into two distinct phases. The final 16 years of the 20th Century was a time of American hegemony. The first 16 years of the 21st Century has proven to be a period of dysfunction, discontent, disillusionment and decline. The America of today in many ways reflects the dissonance between the two. In those twilight years of the last millennium, America enjoyed something akin to the dominance achieved at the Los Angeles Olympics. Just two years after Reagan demanded that Gorbachev tear down the Berlin Wall, that concrete and ideological barricade was gone. The United States won the Cold War. In the New World Order that emerged afterwards, it became the sole superpower in a unipolar world. A Berliner celebrates in front of the Berlin wall on 15 November 1989 The speed at which US-led forces won the first Gulf War in 1991 helped slay the ghosts of Vietnam. With a reformist leader, Boris Yeltsin, installed in the Kremlin, there was an expectation Russia would embrace democratic reform. Even after Tiananmen Square, there was a hope that China might follow suit, as it moved towards a more market-based economy. This was the thrust of Francis Fukuyama's thesis in his landmark 1989 essay, The End of History, which spoke of ""the universalisation of Western liberal democracy as the final form of human government"". For all the forecasts Japan would become the world's largest economy, America refused to cede its financial and commercial dominance. Instead of Sony ruling the corporate world, Silicon Valley became the new high-tech workshop of business. Bill Clinton's boast of building a bridge to the 21st Century rang true, although it was emergent tech giants such as Microsoft, Apple and Google that were the true architects and engineers. Thirty years after planting the Stars and Stripes on the Sea of Tranquillity, America not only dominated outer space but cyberspace too. This phase of US dominance could never be described as untroubled. The Los Angeles riots in 1992, sparked by the beating of Rodney King and the acquittal of the police officers charged with his assault, highlighted deep racial divisions. Police officer acquittals fuelled the Los Angeles riots in 1992 In Washington, Bill Clinton's impeachment exhibited the hyper-partisanship that was changing the tenor of Washington life. In the age of 24/7 cable news, politics was starting to double as soap opera. Yet as we approached 31 December 1999, the assertion that the 20th Century had been The American Century was an axiom. I was in the capital as Bill Clinton presided over the midnight celebrations on the National Mall, and as the fireworks skipped from the Lincoln Memorial down the Reflecting Pool to illuminate the Washington monument, the mighty obelisk looked like a giant exclamation mark or a massive number one. The national story changed dramatically and unexpectedly soon after. While doomsday predictions of a Y2K bug failed to materialise, it nonetheless felt as if the United States had been infected with a virus. 2000 saw the dot-com bubble explode. In November, the disputed presidential election between George W Bush and Al Gore badly damaged the reputation of US democracy. Why, a Zimbabwean diplomat even suggested Africa send international observers to oversee the Florida recount. Beyond America's borders came harbingers of trouble. In Russia, 31 December 1999, as those fireworks were being primed, Vladimir Putin took over from Boris Yeltsin. The year 2001 brought the horror of September 11th, an event more traumatic than Pearl Harbor. Post-9/11 America became less welcoming and more suspicious. The Bush administration's ""war on terror"" - open-ended conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq - drained the country of blood and treasure. The collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, and the Great Recession that followed, arguably had a more lasting impact on the American psyche than the destruction of the Twin Towers. Just as 9/11 had undermined confidence in the country's national security, the financial collapse shattered confidence in its economic security. With parents no longer certain their children would come to enjoy more abundant lives than they did, the American Dream felt like a chimera. The American compact, the bargain that if you worked hard and played by the rules your family would succeed, was no longer assumed.  Between 2000 and 2011, the overall net wealth of US households fell. By 2014, the richest 1% of Americans had accrued more wealth than the bottom 90%. To many in the watching world, and most of the 69 million Americans who voted for him, the election of the country's first black president again demonstrated America's capacity for regeneration. ""Yes we can."" ""The audacity of hope"". Barack Hussein Obama. His improbable success story seemed uniquely American. Although his presidency did much to rescue the economy, he couldn't repair a fractured country. The creation of a post-partisan nation, which Obama outlined in his breakthrough speech at the 2004 Democratic convention, proved just as illusory as the emergence of a post-racial society, which he always knew was beyond him. Obama in October 2008 During the Obama years, Washington descended into a level of dysfunction unprecedented in post-war America. ""My number one priority is making sure President Obama's a one-term president,"" declared then-Senate Minority leader Mitch McConnell, summing up the obstructionist mood of his Republican colleagues. It led to a crisis of governance, including the shutdown of 2013 and the repeated battles over raising the debt ceiling. The political map of America, rather than taking on a more purple hue, came to be rendered in deeper shades of red and blue. Beyond Capitol Hill, there was a whitelash to the first black president, seen in the rise of the Birther movement and in elements of the Tea Party movement. On the right, movement conservatives challenged establishment Republicans. On the left, identity politics displaced a more class-oriented politics as union influence waned. Both parties seemed to vacate the middle ground, relying instead on maximising support from their respective bases - African-Americans, evangelicals, the LGBT community, gun-owners - to win elections. Throughout his presidency, Barack Obama continued to talk about moving towards a more perfect union. But reality made a mockery of these lofty words. Sandy Hook. Orlando. The spate of police shootings. The gang-related mayhem in his adopted home of Chicago. The mess in Washington. The opioid crisis. The health indices even pointed to a sick nation, in which the death rate was rising. By 2016, life expectancy fell for the first time since 1993. This video can not be played US election: Relive the wild ride in 170 seconds This was the backdrop against which the 2016 election was fought, one of the most dispiriting campaigns in US political history. A battle between the two most unpopular major party candidates since polling began, ended with a victor who had higher negative ratings than his opponent and in the end, three million fewer votes. Just as I had been on the National Mall to ring in the new millennium in 2000, I was there again on 20 January 2017, for Donald Trump's inaugural celebrations. They included some Reagan-era flourishes. At the eve of the inauguration concert, Lee Greenwood reprised his Reaganite anthem God Bless the USA, albeit with a frailer voice. There were chants of ""USA, USA,"" a staple of the billionaire's campaign rallies - usually triggered by his riff on building a wall along the Mexican border. There was also an 80s vibe about the telegenic first family, who looked fresh from a set of a primetime soap, like Dynasty or Falcon Crest. The spectacle brought to mind what Norman Mailer once said of Reagan, that the 40th president understood ""the President of the United States was the leading soap opera figure in the great American drama, and one had better possess star value"". Trump understood this, and it explained much of his success, even if his star power came from reality TV rather than Hollywood B-movies. This video can not be played Michael Cockerell: The parallels between Ronald Reagan and Donald Trump Yet Trump is not Reagan. His politics of grievance, and the fist-shaking anger it fed off, struck a different tone than the Gipper's more positive pitch. It played on a shared sense of personal and national victimhood that would have been alien to Reagan. In the space of just three decades, then, the United States had gone from ""It's morning in America again"" to something much darker: ""American Carnage"", the most memorable phrase from Trump's inaugural address. It is tempting to see Trump's victory this time last year as an aberration. A historical mishap. The election all came down, after all, to just 77,744 votes in three key states: Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin. But when you consider the boom-to-bust cycle of the period between 1984 and 2016, the Trump phenomenon doesn't look so accidental. In many ways Trump's unexpected victory marked the culmination of a large number of trends in US politics, society and culture, many of which are rooted in that end-of-century period of American dominion. Consider how the fall of the Berlin Wall changed Washington, and how it ushered in an era of destructive and negative politics. In the post-war years, bipartisanship was routine, partly because of a shared determination to defeat communism. America's two-party system, adversarial though it was, benefited from the existence of a shared enemy. To pass laws, President Eisenhower regularly worked with Democratic chieftains such as House Speaker Sam Rayburn and Senate Majority Leader Lyndon Johnson. Reforms such as the 1958 National Defense Education Act, which improved science teaching in response to the launch of Sputnik, were framed precisely with defeating communism in mind. Much of the impetus to pass landmark civil rights legislation in the mid-1960s came from the propaganda gift Jim Crow laws handed to the Soviet Union, especially as Moscow sought to expand its sphere of influence among newly decolonised African nations. Patriotic bipartisanship frayed and ripped after the end of the Cold War. It was in the 1990s the then-Senate Minority Leader Bob Dole started to use the filibuster more aggressively as a blocking device. Government shutdowns became politically weaponised. In the 1994 congressional mid-terms, the Republican revolution brought a wave of fierce partisans to Washington, with an ideological aversion to government and thus little investment in making it work. House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the first Republican to occupy the post in 40 years, personified the kind of abrasive partisan that came to the fore on Capitol Hill. Grudging bipartisanship was still possible, as Clinton and Gingrich demonstrated over welfare and criminal justice reform in the mid-1990s. But this period witnessed the acidification of DC politics. The gerrymandering of the House of Representatives encouraged strict partisanship, because the threat to most lawmakers came from within their own parties. Moderates or pragmatists who strayed from the partisan path were punished with a primary challenge from more doctrinaire rivals. By the 112th Congress in 2011-2012, there was no Democrat in the House more conservative than a Republican and no Republican more liberal than a Democrat. This was new. In the post-war years, there had been considerable ideological overlap between liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats. In this more polarised climate, bipartisanship became a dirty word. One leading conservative thinker and anti-tax campaigner, Grover Norquist, likened it to date rape. Would Congress have impeached Bill Clinton, ostensibly for having an affair with an intern, had America still been waging the Cold War? I sense not -  it would have been seen, in those more serious times, as a frivolous distraction. When Congress moved towards impeaching Richard Nixon it did so because Watergate and its cover-up truly rose to the level of high crimes and misdemeanours. 50 Trump fans explain why they love him Why US right-wing groups are on the rise Clinton's impeachment signalled the emergence of another new political trend: the delegitimisation of sitting presidents. And both parties played the  game. The Democrats cast George W Bush as illegitimate because Al Gore won the popular vote and the Supreme Court controversially ruled in the Republican's favour during the Florida recount. The Birther movement, led by Donald Trump, tried to delegitimise Barack Obama with specious and racist claims that he was not born in Hawaii. Most recently, the Democrats have cast aspersions on Trump's victory, partly because he lost the popular vote and partly because they allege he achieved a Kremlin-assisted victory. Over this period, the political discourse also became shriller. Rush Limbaugh, after getting his first radio show in 1984, rose to become the king of the right-wing shock jocks. Fox News was launched in 1996, the same year as MSNBC, which became its progressive counterpoint. The internet quickened the metabolism of the news industry and became the home for the kind of hateful commentary traditional news outlets rarely published. Home foreclosures skyrocketed at the end of the last decade Maybe the Jerry Springerisation of political news coverage  can be traced to the moment the Drudge Report first published the name Monica Lewinsky, ""scooping"" Newsweek which hesitated before publishing such an explosive story. The success of the Drudge Report demonstrated how new outlets, which didn't share the same news values as the mainstream media, could establish brands literally overnight. This lesson was doubtless learnt by Andrew Breitbart, an editor at Drudge who founded the right-wing website Breitbart News. The internet and social media, trumpeted initially as the ultimate tool for bringing people together, actually became a forum for cynicism, division and various outlandish conspiracy theories. America became more atomised. As Robert D Putnam identified in his 1995 seminal essay, Bowling Alone, lower participation rates in organisations such as unions, parent teacher associations, the Boy Scouts and women's clubs had reduced person to person contacts and civil interaction. Economically, this period saw the continuation of what's been called the ""Great Divergence"" which produced stark inequalities in wealth and income. Between 1979 and 2007, household income  in the top 1% grew by 275% compared to just 18% growth in  the bottom fifth of households. This video can not be played The heroin-ravaged city fighting back The Clinton-era was a period of financial deregulation, including the repeal of the Glass-Steagall Act, the landmark reform passed during the depression, as well as legislation exempting credit default swaps from regulation. Disruptive technologies changed the workplace and upended the labour market. Automation, more so than globalisation, was the big jobs killer during this phase. Between 1990 and 2007, machines killed off up to 670,000 US manufacturing jobs alone. The Rust Belt rebellion that propelled Trump to the White House has been described as a revolt against robots, not that his supporters viewed it that way. Encouraged by the billionaire, many blamed increased foreign competition and the influx of foreign workers. The opioid crisis can be traced back to the early 1990s with the over-prescription of powerful painkillers. Between 1991 and 2011, painkiller prescriptions tripled. America seemed intoxicated by its own post-Cold War success. Then came the hangover of the past 16 years. Over the past few months, I've followed that same westward flight path to California on a number of occasions, and found myself asking what would an impressionable 16-year-old make of America now. Would she share my adolescent sense of wonder, or would she peer out over the Pacific at twilight and wonder if the sun was setting on America itself? What would she make of the gun violence, brought into grotesque relief again by the Las Vegas massacre? Multiple shootings are not new, of course. Just days before I arrived in the States in 1984, a gunman had walked into a McDonalds in a suburb of San Diego and shot dead 21 people. It was then the deadliest mass shooting in modern US history. What's different between now and then, however, is the regularity of these massacres, and how the repetitiveness of the killings has normalised them. What was striking about Las Vegas was the muted nationwide response to a gunman killing 58 people and injuring hundreds more. Mourners at a vigil for Las Vegas shooting victims Once-shocking massacres no longer arouse intense emotions for those unconnected to the killings. A month on, and it is almost as if it didn't happen. What would she make of race relations? Back in 1984, black athletes such as Carl Lewis, Edwin Moses and Michael Jordan were unifying figures as they helped reap that Olympic golden harvest. Now some of America's leading black athletes are vilified by their president for taking a knee to protest, a right enshrined in the First Amendment. These athletes now find themselves combatants in the country's endless culture wars. What would she make of the confluence of gun violence and race, evident in the spate of police shootings of unarmed black men and in the online auction where the weapon that killed Trayvon Martin fetched more than $100,000? Charlottesville, with its torch-wielding and hate-spewing neo-Nazis, was another low point. So, too, were the president's remarks afterwards, when he described the crowd as including some ""very fine people"" and implied a moral equivalence between white supremacists and anti-racist protesters. This video can not be played What Trump said versus what I saw - by the BBC's Joel Gunter I was at the news conference in Trump Tower that day. An African-American cameraman next to me yelled out ""What message does this send to our children?"" The question went unanswered, but concerned parents ask it everyday about Donald Trump's behaviour. What about the monuments debate? The last civil war veteran died in 1959, but the conflict rumbles on in various guises and upon various proxy battlefields, as America continues to grapple with the original sin of slavery. But what if she landed in the American heartland, rather than flying over it? Coastal separateness can sometimes be exaggerated, but it would be a very different experience than Los Angeles. In the Rust Belt, stretches of riverway are crowded again with coal barges, and local business leaders believe in the Trump Bump because they see it in their order books and balance sheets. In the Coal Belt, there's been delight at the rescinding of Obama's Clean Power Plan. In the Bible Belt, evangelicals behold Trump as a fellow victim of sneering liberal elites. In the Sun Belt, close to the Mexican border, there's wide support for his crackdown on illegal immigration. This video can not be played Can coal make a comeback under Trump? In many football stadiums, she would hear the chorus of boos from fans who agree with the president that the take-the-knee protests denigrate the flag. In bars, union branches and American Legion halls, you'll find many who applaud Donald Trump for ""telling like it is"", refusing to be bound by norms of presidential behaviour or political correctness. There are pointers of national success elsewhere. The New York Stock Exchange is still reaching record highs. Business confidence is on the up. Unemployment is at a 16-year low. Of the 62 million people who voted for Trump, a large number continue to regard him more as a national saviour than a national embarrassment. In many red states, ""Make America Great Again"" echoes just as strongly as it did 12 months ago.  Trump has a historically low approval rating of just 35%, but it's 78% among Republicans. In the international realm, it's plausible foreign adversaries fear the United States more under Trump than Obama, and foreign allies no longer take the country for granted. The so-called Islamic State has been driven from Raqqa. Twenty-five Nato allies have pledged to increase defence spending. Beijing, under pressure from Washington, appears to be exerting more economic leverage over Pyongyang. What is 2017's word of the year? Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The two faces of Trump's America However, America First increasingly means America alone, most notably on the Paris climate change accord and the Iranian nuclear deal. Trump has also Twitter-shamed longstanding allies, such as Germany and Australia, and infuriated its closest friend Britain, with rash tweets about crime rates and terror attacks. His labelling of foes such as Kim Jong Un as Little Rocket Man seems juvenile and self-diminishing. It hardly reaches the Reagan standard of ""tear down this wall"". Indeed, with North Korea, there's the widespread fear that Trump's tweet tirades could spark a nuclear confrontation. Few countries look anymore to Trump's America as a global exemplar, the ""city upon a hill"" Reagan spoke of in his farewell address to the nation. The German Chancellor Angela Merkel is routinely described as the leader of the free world, the moniker bestowed on the US president since the days of FDR. The Economist, which trolls Trump almost weekly, has described Chinese President Xi Jinping as the most powerful man in the world. American exceptionalism is now commonly viewed as a negative construct. ""Only in America"" is a term of derision. Ronald Reagan used to talk of the 11th commandment - No Republican should speak ill of another Republican. So it is worth noting that some of Trump's most caustic and thoughtful critics have come from within his own party. Senator Jeff Flake called him ""a danger to democracy"". Bob Corker described the White House as an ""adult day care centre"". John McCain, a frequent critic, has railed against ""spurious, half-baked nationalism"". George W Bush sounded the alarm about bigotry being emboldened and of how politics ""seems more vulnerable to conspiracy theories and outright fabrication"", without specifically naming the current president. Trump's determination to be an anti-president has arguably had a vandalising effect on the office of the presidency, and to civil society more broadly. Artists have boycotted the White House reception held ahead of the annual Kennedy Center Awards, a red letter night in the country's cultural calendar. The Golden State Warriors were disinvited from appearing at the White House after their championship win because of the take-the-knee protest. It's new for these kinds of commemorations to become contested. Trump has even politicised one of the commander-in-chief's most solemn acts, offering condolences to the families of the fallen. It led to an indecorous row with a war widow. Small wonder long time Washington watchers, on both the right and left, consider this the nastiest and most graceless presidency of the modern era. The corollary is the historical stock of his predecessors is rising. When the five living former presidents appeared together in Texas earlier this month they were greeted like a group of superheroes donning their capes for one final mission. It speaks of these unreal times that George W Bush is spoken of fondly, even wistfully, by long-time liberal foes. Trump's claim he could be just as presidential as Abraham Lincoln is one of the more comical boasts to come from the White House. Then there are the falsehoods, the ""alternative facts"" and attacks on the ""fake media"" -  his label for news organisations such as the New York Times and Washington Post, whose reporting has rarely been better. Recently he has even threatened to revoke the licences of networks whose news divisions have published critical stories. To some it has shades of 1984, but Orwell's version. As for Morning in America, it has a new connotation - checking Trump's Twitter for pre-dawn tweets. The president commonly starts the day by lashing out at opponents or mercilessly mocking them. The new normal, it is often called. But it seems more apt to call it the new abnormal. There is an extent to which America is politics-proof and president-proof. However bad things got in Washington, my sense has long been that the US would be rescued by its other vital centres of power. New York, its financial and cultural capital. San Francisco, its tech hub. Boston, its academic first city. Hollywood, its entertainment centre. Adrienne Mccallister, director of Virtual Reality/Augmented Reality business development at Google, speaks during a launch event But Los Angeles is reeling from the Harvey Weinstein revelations, the Uber scandal has shone a harsh light on corporate ethics in the tech sector and the Wells Fargo affair has once again shown Wall Street in a dismal light. US universities dominate global rankings, but its top colleges could hardly be described as engines of intergenerational mobility. A study by the New York Times of 38 colleges, including Yale, Princeton and Dartmouth, showed that students from the top 1% income bracket occupied more places than the students from the bottom 60%. Of this year's intake at Harvard, almost a third were the sons and daughters of alumni. Automation will also continue to be a jobs killer. One study this year predicted that nearly 40% of US jobs will be lost to computers and machines over the next 15 years. Spending time in the Rust Belt valleys around Pittsburgh last year I was struck by how many taxi and Uber drivers used to work in the steel industry. Now America's one-time Steel City is a centre of excellence for robotics and where Uber is road testing its driverless cars. There's still truth in the adage that America is always going to hell, but it never quite gets there. But how that is being tested. Presently, it feels more like a continent than a country, with shared land occupied by warring tribes. Not a failing state but not a united states. As I've travelled this country, I struggle to identify where  Americans will find common political ground. Not in the guns debate. Not in the abortion debate. Not in the healthcare debate. Not even in the singing of the national anthem at American football games. Even a cataclysmic event on the scale of 9/11 failed to unify the country. If anything it sowed the seeds of further division, especially over immigration. Some Americans agree with Donald Trump that arrivals from mainly Muslim countries need to be blocked. Others see that as an American anathema. When I made my first journey to the US all those years ago I witnessed a coming together. Those Olympic celebrations were in some ways an orgy of nationalism, but there was also a commonality of spirit and purpose. From Gershwin's Rhapsody in Blue performed on 84 grand pianos to a polyglot team of athletes bedecked with medals. From the pilot who flew around the LA Coliseum in a jet pack to the customers who left McDonald's with free Big Macs. There was reason for rejoicing. The present was golden. America felt like America again. . Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Surrogate mum of 'twins' finds one is hers,"A surrogate mother from California, who gave birth to two babies, found out one of the children was biologically hers. Jessica Allen became pregnant with her own biological child while she was carrying another baby as a surrogate for a Chinese couple. Mrs Allen said doctors first thought the second was an identical twin. As a result, both babies were given to the other woman after delivery and the Allens had to fight to get back their biological son. Mrs Allen had already given birth to two healthy children, but had decided to become a surrogate mother. She toldNewsday on the BBC World Serviceshe had ovulated despite being pregnant. ""I was pregnant through IVF already and at about six, seven weeks they found another embryo and they labelled it that the one embryo that they transferred split and turned into twins. ""My body naturally still ovulated while I was already pregnant - that's very rare - no one really knows about it but obviously, with my situation, more people are learning about it. ""It's called superfetation - it has a medical term to it, so why this process is not explained to surrogates, I don't know. They don't give this as a possibility."" Mrs Allen said she did not see the babies when they were born last December, but the other mother then texted her pictures of the babies when they were a few weeks old. The intended mother also said she was waiting for Mrs Allen to feel well before revealing that she had doubts about the origin of one of the babies. ""I immediately freaked out and I asked my case worker, 'what's going on, how can this be, what's happened, how did this happen?' and she didn't have any answers for me,"" Mrs Allen told Newsday. ""So she [the case worker] said the next thing we need to do is to get me to have a DNA test."" The intended mother also took the baby for a DNA test and within a fortnight asked Mrs Allen for a Skype call. ""That's when she announced that the results indicated that I was his genetic mother,"" Mrs Allen said. ""During the Skype call she did suggest that we could give him up for adoption and they already had a couple thinking about adopting him. ""At this point we had no idea what to do, so by the end of the call we told her we were going to talk about it, because we needed to figure out how we're going to get ready for a baby literally overnight."" However, the next day Mrs Allen told the woman: ""We definitely want our son."" But Mrs Allen and her husband ran into difficulties because - legally - they were not the parents. They were told that because the intended mother signed the baby's birth certificate, she was his legal mother and then if she wanted to give him up for adoption, she could ""I'm not on his birth certificate but I am his genetic mother, my husband is his genetic father and we have that proof through DNA,"" said Mrs Allen, who added she and her husband were also asked to pay back part of the fee to the couple because they had paid her to carry more than one child. They had also incurred fees for a lawyer they had hired to help them get custody of their son. The Allens were finally reunited with their baby boy, who is now 10 months old. When she met her son, Mrs Allen said she was a nervous wreck. ""When she [the case worker] pulled him out of her car and walked towards me, I just snatched him from her and said 'give me my baby' and I was just kissing him and trying to look at his face for the first time. ""I sat in the back seat with him so I could see him and talk to him and stuff.""

Spain issues warrant for Catalan ex-leader,"Mr Puigdemont has called for his colleagues to be released A Spanish judge has issued European Arrest Warrants (EAW) for sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four of his allies who went to Belgium. The five failed to attend a high court hearing in Madrid on Thursday when nine other ex-members of the regional government were taken into custody. One of those detained has been freed on bail of â¬50,000 (Â£44,000; $58,000). They all face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds for pursuing Catalan independence. Mr Puigdemont has said he will not return to Spain unless he receives guarantees of a fair trial. Belgium will ""study"" the warrant, a spokesman for the state prosecutor told AFP news agency. The man who wants to break up Spain Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? The regional parliament in Catalonia voted to proclaim an independent republic a week ago, following an illegal referendum on independence organised by the Catalan government on 1 October No other country recognised the move and the Spanish central government moved swiftly to impose control, using emergency powers under the constitution. Mr Puigdemont was the president of the autonomous region of Catalonia until the proclamation of independence and continues to regard himself as the president of the newly proclaimed ""Republic of Catalonia"". Mr Puigdemont and his colleagues travelled to Belgium to raise their case for statehood at the EU institutions and he insists he is not trying to evade ""real justice"". He said in a Belgian TV interview aired earlier on Friday that he would co-operate with Belgian judicial authorities. He also said that he was ready to run in snap regional elections in Catalonia next month. The other four warrants are for: Meritxell Serret, former agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, former health minister LluÃ­s Puig, former culture minister Clara PonsatÃ­, former education minister The warrants were sent to Belgian prosecutors, who have 24 hours to decide whether the paperwork is correct. If they do, they will forward them on to a judge who will decide whether Mr Puigdemont and the four others should be arrested. Protesters have taken to the streets again in Barcelona over the detentions of Catalan ex-officials Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the suspects to Spain after arrest. But if the suspects do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen much sooner. A country can reject an EU arrest warrant if it fears that extradition would violate the suspect's human rights. Discrimination based on politics, religion or race is grounds for refusal. So are fears that the suspect would not get a fair trial. There is an agreedEU list of 32 offences,external- in Article Two of the EAW law - for which there is no requirement for the offence to be a crime in both countries. In other words, any of those offences can be a justification for extradition, provided the penalty is at least three years in jail. However, neither ""sedition"" nor ""rebellion"" - two of the Spanish accusations against the Catalan leaders - are on that list. Thousands of protesters have gathered in Barcelona and other Catalan cities for the second night running to call for the release of the former officials detained on Thursday. Santi Vila, the Catalan former business minister, was granted bail at the request of prosecutors after spending a night in prison. ""My colleagues and I are fine, we are calm,"" he said upon leaving jail in Madrid, but called the detentions ""disproportionate"", Spain's El PaÃ­s newspaper reports. He had resigned from the cabinet before the Catalan parliament voted for independence. Seven of the eight ex-ministers were pictured turning up to court together on Thursday Those who remain in custody are: Oriol Junqueras, former deputy vice-president Joaquim Forn, former interior minister RaÃ¼l Romeva, former external relations secretary Carles MundÃ³, former justice minister Dolors Bassa, former labour minister Jordi Turull, former government presidency councillor Josep Rull, former sustainable development minister Meritxell Borras, former culture minister Protesters are also calling for the release of two grassroots separatist leaders, Jordi SÃ¡nchez and Jordi Cuixart, who were taken into custody last month.They lost an appeal for release on Friday. Five senior members of the Catalan parliament, as well as Speaker Carme Forcadell, are facing the same charges but, because of their parliamentary immunity, their cases are being handled by the Supreme Court.

MP Hopkins denies sexual harassment,"This video can not be played Westminster has been rocked by a series of sexual harassment claims Suspended Labour MP Kelvin Hopkins has said he ""absolutely and categorically"" denies claims of sexual harassment. Labour activist Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, earlier told the BBC that Mr Hopkins had hugged her inappropriately after a student event in 2014. Denying the claims, Mr Hopkins said he had only ""put an arm around her"" and did not hold her tight. Meanwhile, Labour MP Clive Lewis has denied groping a woman at the party's annual conference this year. Corbyn 'warned over harassment claim MP' Labour suspends MP over harassment claim Sargeant removed from Welsh Government A party member told the Independent newspaper,externalhow Norwich South MP Mr Lewis allegedly groped her at the party conference last month. Kelvin Hopkins, 76, has denied sexual harassment allegations Labour said it was investigating a formal complaint against Mr Lewis. However, in a statement, the former shadow minister said: ""I know how I roll. I don't squeeze women's buttocks."" He told BBC News he was ""vigorously"" disputing the allegation, adding: ""I'm feeling pretty taken aback by it all."" ""I'm a friendly person, I'm someone who enjoys the company of people and it saddens me that I will now have to think about standing back, about being more formal,"" he said. A Labour statement said the party was investigating a formal complaint made against Clive Lewis The claims against Mr Lewis come after Luton North MP Mr Hopkins was suspended by the party on Thursday while an investigation takes place. Ms Etemadzadeh alleges that Mr Hopkins said during a conversation in Parliament: ""Let's not talk about politics, do you have a boyfriend?"" ""He also said that if nobody was in his office he would've taken me there,"" she added. ""I was absolutely shocked and I wasn't really expecting that."" After refusing to respond to his phone calls, she claimed he sent her a message saying ""that I'm an attractive, lovely young woman and a man would be lucky to have me as a lover and if he was young... but he's not"". Mr Hopkins did not initially respond to the allegations. However, in a statement issued by his solicitors, the 76-year-old denied claims he had acted inappropriately at the student event in 2014. He said: ""I simply put an arm around her shoulder to give her a brief, slight hug just before getting into my car. ""I did not hold her tight. I did not rub any part of my body, let alone my crotch, against Ava. ""She waved me off as I drove away and did not say anything whatsoever to suggest that anything had occurred that upset her, let alone revolted her."" Mr Hopkins said he did not recall asking her about her personal life, but said he did send a text message saying she was ""charming and sweet-natured"". He admitted sending a message that said ""a nice young man would be lucky to have you as a girlfriend and lover... Were I to be young... but I am not..."". He said she replied to the message. Labour MP for Luton North since 1997 Spent most of 20-year political career on backbenches Briefly promoted to front bench from July to October 2016 Long history of involvement with trade union movement One of 36 MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn for his 2015 leadership bid One of the few Labour MPs to campaign for Leave in the EU referendum Married to Patricia. The couple have two grown up children Ms Etemadzadeh said she raised her concerns about Mr Hopkins' conduct with another Labour MP, saying her complaint was passed to the party's former chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton, who responded to it. But Ms Etemadzadeh said she was told she would have to waive her anonymity for action to be taken and the prospect of that ""scared"" her. It is understood Mr Hopkins was verbally reprimanded about his alleged behaviour. He went on to be promoted, albeit briefly, to Labour's front bench in June 2016 - shortly after leader Jeremy Corbyn faced mass resignations following the EU referendum. It has emerged that Dame Rosie rang the Labour leader's office to ask why Mr Hopkins had been appointed to the shadow cabinet in July 2016. A Labour source said she reminded them that Mr Hopkins had been reprimanded for harassing a young activist. The Labour Party has not commented on the claim. Labour activist 'warned' about pursuing rape claim On Friday, it was announced that Labour will appoint an independent specialist organisation to offer advice and support to individuals affected by sexual harassment in the party. A statement said the party will announce the organisation will take on the role ""as soon as possible"". It also said that independent legal expert, Karon Monaghan QC, will investigate Labour activist Bex Bailey's allegations. Ms Bailey has said she was raped at a party event and a senior Labour official discouraged her from reporting the attack. She said she was told reporting the alleged 2011 incident could ""damage"" her and that she was given no advice on what she should do next.

Non-medics changing lives of knife victims,"This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Symonds met the charity Redthread, that works with gang violence victims Can young people who've been injured in knife and gun crime be steered towards a safer future at the moment they're at their most vulnerable? The idea has been pioneered in four London hospitals by the charity Redthread, which places youth workers an the heart of accident and emergency alongside trauma medics. It is early evening in ""resus"", part of accident and emergency at King's College Hospital in south London. One of the city's four major trauma centres, if you are in a serious accident, or you are stabbed or shot, this is where you may end up. It is an extraordinary place. Green-overalled ambulance crews constantly arrive to be met by teams of medical staff in coloured scrubs. Sometimes there are wails of pain from patients. The public address system blares urgent announcements. A nurse at King's College Hospital takes details of an incoming patient The ring of the ""red phone"" cuts through it all - warning the medics of an incoming patient. Tonight it's a ""paediatric, code red"". A child, with life-threatening injuries. He arrives, dressings marked with blood, on a trolley surrounded by paramedics and is handed over to a 10-strong team of waiting trauma specialists. Senior consultant Dr Emer Sutherland marshals her team. The patient is 16. He has been slashed four times with a large knife. A trauma team attends a patient in the resus unit at King's College Hospital In the course of the next few hours, the resus team will ensure he lives. They're good at what they do. Only three young stabbing victims have died in the hospital this year. But there's another specialist alongside them. Lucy Knell-Taylor is 29, dressed in a T-shirt and leggings. She's not a doctor, but a youth worker with the charity Redthread. She is there not to save a life, but to change one. Dr Emer Sutherland (L) considers Redthread's Lucy Knell-Taylor a vital part of the team We spent four days at King's, during which time we saw a steady flow of patients with stab wounds - almost all of them under 18. The peak time for admission was not late at night, but at school going-home time. After a decade of falling levels of violent crime, they are now increasing again. Reported knife crime rose 26% in the last year. In London, 21 teenagers have been murdered, 15 stabbed to death. On a knife edge: The rise of violence on London's streets 'You have to keep a knife with you' Redthread is trying to help young people escape what for many is a life riven by violence. To achieve that, youth worker Lucy has to wait for the right time. When victims are able to talk, she moves in among the medical team and begins the task of building a relationship with someone she's never met, who may be traumatised and hostile, while they are having emergency treatment. Some respond well. One gestured to his wounds and said to Lucy: ""I want you to look at it and tell me what they are doing."" Others are more difficult. Many young men involved in criminal gangs who won't even tell her their ""government"" or real name.  She's been called a ""pagan"", meaning ""you're not one of us"". She is often told: ""I slipped on glass."" In resus, they know that's usually code for ""I was stabbed."" She responds with reassurance, practical help and personal warmth. Forging a relationship is everything. Redthread calls this ""the teachable moment"". When someone is critically injured, they are suddenly removed from the streets. They are dependent on doctors for their survival. They may be in pain. The aim is to teach them that this is a moment they should grasp. A junction in their lives where a choice can be made. To go back, or to move on. Lucy Knell-Taylor says she seeks to form a bond with patients ""Getting to them now when they are here in the hospital,"" Lucy Knell-Taylor says, ""is my opportunity to say every single thing which has happened before this second, kind of doesn't matter. ""Right now you're in pain, you're away from your natural environment, your friends may or may not be here. This is an opportunity to think - does something need to be different? ""It's live, it's the moment it's most real to them. It's the perfect moment."" A mother's fight against knife crime Stab victim mum in Trafalgar Square sculpture plea When it works, a bond is formed between Ms Knell-Taylor and the victim. It means she can later say ""You can trust me.  I've seen your pain face!"" But it can be traumatic work. Ms Knell-Taylor describes one incident when, called to resus, she was confronted with a large group of ""road men"" - gang members.  One turned, and a kitchen knife was sticking out of his eye. She has seen patients die. This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime Dr Emer Sutherland helped set up the project 13 years ago. ""I am a middle-aged mum,"" she says. ""I don't have the same experiences young people have. ""I can keep them alive, I can resuscitate them, but then my expert colleagues - the youth workers - come in to offer them what they want for the future."" The teachable moment is designed to open the door to potentially years of work aimed at extracting victims from a violent life. Ms Knell-Taylor has argued for ""her people"" in court, fought battles with probation officers, sorted housing, and even organised transport for one patient who couldn't go to a certain hospital because he might be stabbed passing through a rival group's territory. Jane - not her real name - is one of Redthread's successes. ""Jane"" (L) has had the support of Redthread's Becky Calnan for several years Now in her 20s, when she was a teenager, she became involved in a drugs gang and was forced to carry guns and knives around London. ""I saw a man get both of his legs broken,"" she tells me. She was sexually abused and sent to be raped by rival gangs, as part of a bizarre arrangement used when her gang had done something which might otherwise result in its rivals retaliating violently. ""If your girl had to sleep with a guy from another gang, it was like they had one up on you. The girls were used as pawns,"" she says. Unwell, Jane came to King's. Hospital staff opened the door to the teachable moment by tipping off Redthread that she would be at a clinic the next morning. ""It was probably one of the lowest points in my life,"" she says. ""I wasn't feeling great, and in that moment Becky was there to help me."" Becky Calnan has recently stopped working directly with Jane, a mark of her progress Becky is Becky Calnan, an experienced Redthread worker who has now been with Jane for years. ""I just felt an automatic connection that actually this was someone who - regardless of what I was involved in - was going to help me,"" Jane says. ""Since then, I've probably spoken to her every other day for years. She's helped me rebuild relationships with my family, get me back into a community."" ""Ideally I'd like her to be in my life forâ¦ well, forever."" But in fact their work connection recently came to an end. Jane accepts that as ""a mark of how far I've come"". The Redthread team is expanding its work into hospitals outside London Lucy Knell-Taylor says success is measured by her services no longer being needed. ""I try and work on this Nanny McPhee principle of when you need me but don't want me I'll be there, but when you want me but no longer need me, I won't,"" she says. A recent report on the charity's work at St Mary's hospital suggested it had led to a 60% reduction in the number of young people coming back to the emergency department as victims of violent crime. However, it has proven tricky for Redthread to show wider evidence of its success, because of a lack of funding for studies of what happens to the young people it contacts. Now the project's being expanded to three hospitals in Birmingham and Nottingham which will provide an opportunity to measure the effect of the ""teachable moment"" both before and after Redthread gets to work. The intensive one-to-one relationships with young people that Redthread believes can divert them from violent lifestyles don't come cheap. Scaling up the project could get very expensive. But every case arriving in resus results in a bill to the NHS for hugely expensive specialist care. Policymakers will also have to consider the real cost of not cutting youth violence.

How Neneh's girl wrote song to kill time - and hit big chart,"A couple of months ago, R&B singer Mabel was trying to kill time while she waited to go to the gym. ""I'd booked some dumb exercise class at eight o'clock and it was six - so my brother was like, 'Just get on the piano and see what happens.'"" Forty-five minutes later, the 21-year-old had writtenFinders Keepers,external, a song that's now firmly lodged in the Top 10. ""It's amazing,"" she tells the BBC. ""I just wanted to make something fun for me and my friends."" Mabel has been making waves since 2015, when she released the slinky, sensualKnow Me Better,external, with its seductive refrain: ""I could go all day wearing nothing but your kiss"". But she's been around music all her life. Her parents are hip-hop legend Neneh Cherry and Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey. BBC Music - Sounds Like Friday Night Born in the mountains of Malaga, she was raised between Spain, London and Stockholm, learning piano at the age of five and choreographing routines to Destiny's Child with her sister. Mabel said she was initially intimidated by her mother's musical success She's no stranger to the recording studio either, accompanying McVey when he produced the Sugababes' debut album, One Touch, in 2000. At the tender age of four, she managed to sleep through the whole thing. ""Do you know what? It's still a problem!"" she laughs. ""The vibrations of the bass make me so cosy. The other day I had a blanket in the studio and my brother was like, 'You need to move. You're not writing, you're napping!'"" The habit has earned her the nickname Lil' Bassy - and it's not just confined to the studio. ""It's concerts as well!"" she says. ""If I put earplugs in, the muffled sound of a gig gets me. ""Not at my own shows though,"" she clarifies. ""[There's] no sleeping if I'm on stage."" Mabel is currently working on her debut album Given her background, Mabel's success might seem like a fait accompli. But for a long time, she avoided making music. ""I felt quite embarrassed by being my mum and dad's daughter,""she once said,external. ""I thought, 'People will never take me seriously.'"" She eventually overcame that fear and enrolled to study production and music theory in Stockholm. After graduating she moved to London. There she was cast for a photo shoot in i-D magazine. That caught the attention of Skepta, who put her in his video forShutdown,external. Mabel's hip-hop tinged debut,Know Me Better,external, went viral soon afterwards, propelling Mabel onto theBBC's Sound of 2016list. But she's purposefully taken her time, touring with Years & Years and crafting an impressive catalogue of singles. ""These things take time,"" she says, noting that new artists need longer to nurture an audience in the slow-burn streaming era. ""It's more like America, where sometimes it takes years to break a record."" This is especially true of Finders Keepers, which first came out in March and later featured on Mabel'sBedroom EP,external- a 21st take on the '90s R&B of Brandy and Aaliyah. Lyrically, the EP discusses control within relationships - ""how one minute you can be in the driving seat, then that flips and you're very much out of control."" It's also about balancing out the male-dominated narrative of R&B - which is where Finders Keepers comes in. ""There's so many R&B songs where guys are talking about a clingy girl, like: 'I don't want a girlfriend and this girl's so clingy and blah blah blah.' ""But I'm a woman and I've been in situations that have been the reverse of that, so I wanted to tell that story."" Mabel has toured with pop group Years & Years and Skepta's grime collective Boy Better Know Finders Keepers stands out even more because it's Mabel's first uptempo track. ""I really struggled with it before,"" she says. ""I'm really good at the '90s slow jams. I've got that down. But I love to dance, so why wouldn't I make something I could dance to?"" The song's success, she says, ""surpassed everyone's expectations and every other song I've ever done"" - and it spurred her to write more in the same vein. ""I have like Finders Keepers fever now!"" the singer says. ""Sometimes I go in the studio and I'm like, 'That worked so well, and I wrote it in 45 minutes so if I try wearing the same outfit and playing on the same piano it'll happen again.' ""But you know what? That's why I love music - because I'm such a control freak and it's the only thing that I can't really control. ""It's like magic.""

Interest rates: Your questions answered,"Are you ready for an interest rate rise? The Bank of England has raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. The official bank ratehas been lifted from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first increase since July 2007. While the move was widely expected, it will affect millions of households on mortgages and savings. We asked our BBC Personal Finance Correspondent Simon Gompertz to answer your questions. Yes, variable rate loans will rise, but fixed rate mortgages, for instance, will stay the same. We are still waiting to hear what the big banks will do with their savings rates, but some players have already said they will put some of their rates up, including Nationwide, TSB and Yorkshire Building Society. What happens to the pound will depend on further interest rate rises and how quickly people in the financial markets believe they will arrive. This video can not be played We challenged some ten year olds to explain a system that baffles many adultsâ¦ Higher interest rates lead to higher mortgage costs for some people in the short run and most people in the long run. And in the past that has had the effect of holding back house prices. But this base rate increase is comparatively small, so it's not clear whether it will have much impact. What will the rate rise mean for you? Kamal Ahmed: Are more rate rises ahead? Five things we have learnt from the Bank That's a good point, especially if you include the cost of mortgages in your measure of inflation - though mortgages are not part of the Consumer Prices Index or CPI. What central banks tend to think is that inflation happens when an economy is growing too fast, because firms can put up prices for their goods and people still buy them. The theory is that by raising interest rates you leave people and businesses with less money to spend. Current tuition fee interest is inflation (the RPI measure) +3%, so it's not affected by base rate changes. You may also like: A-level agony? We answer your questions Reality Check: Your Brexit citizens questions answered Panama Papers: What happened next? The pound fell, partly because of hints from the Bank of England that further increases in base rate might be pretty slow in coming. The suggestion was the rate might reach 1% in 2020. The pound's value tends to be affected by investors' judgements on whether they'll receive a good return if they keep their assets in sterling investments. You will struggle to find many people expecting a 6% base rate any time soon. But it's not impossible. Ten years ago you might have been laughed at for saying a 0.5% rate was on the way. The biggest factor is what happens to inflation. High inflation tends to mean high interest rates. Interest rate expectations are always priced into fixed rate deals. The lenders tend to cover themselves against the risk of rates going up or down by doing their own deals in the wholesale money markets - and the prices there depend on dealers' predictions (or bets) on what will happen. The signs are that rates will go up more, but the Bank of England seems to be steering us away from expecting big increases. Tracker mortgages move in line with Bank base rate but not Standard Variable Rates, or not necessarily. Some SVRs are over 5%. It's something borrowers need to watch like hawks.

How Japan's youth see the kamikaze pilots of WW2,"This video can not be played A kamikaze mission during World War Two During World War Two, thousands of Japanese pilots volunteered to be kamikaze, suicidally crashing their planes in the name of their emperor. More than 70 years on, the BBC's Mariko Oi asks what these once revered men mean to Japan's youth. Irrational, heroic and stupid: this was what three young people in Tokyo said when I asked them about their views on the kamikaze. ""Heroic?"" queried Takumi, of his younger brother Shunpei's choice of word. ""I didn't realise you were so right wing?"" It is difficult to verify the figures but it is believed that 3-4,000 Japanese pilots crashed their planes into an enemy target on purpose. Only 10% of missions were believed to be successful but they sank some 50 Allied vessels. Kamikaze survivor Osamu Yamada with his colleagues, most of whom died crashing into an enemy target during WW2 Decades after the war, opinions on the kamikaze pilots remain divided, partly because their legacy has been used repeatedly as a political tool. ""During the seven years of the Allied occupation of Japan, the kamikaze reputation was one of the first things that they went after,"" Prof MG Sheftall from Shizuoka University explained. The suicidal tactic was portrayed as ""insanity"". ""But when the Allies left in 1952, the right wing nationalists came out strongly and they have carried out multi-generational efforts to seize back control of the narrative,"" he says. ""Even in the 1970s and 80s, the vast majority of Japanese people thought of the kamikaze as something shameful, a crime committed by the state against their family members. ""But in the 1990s, the nationalists started testing the water, seeing whether they could get away with calling the kamikaze pilots heroes. When they didn't get much push back, they got bolder and bolder,"" he added. A survey of several countries in 2015 by Win/Gallup found that 11% of Japanese people would be prepared to fight for their country. Pakistan: 89% India: 75% Turkey: 73% China: 71% Russia: 59% US: 44% UK: 27% Japan: 11% In the 2000s, films such as For Those We Love and The Eternal Zero were released, portraying the kamikaze as just that - heroes. But even Shunpei, the teenager who said they were heroic, admitted that his views had been affected by films and said that if Japan went to war tomorrow, he wouldn't be prepared to die for his country. ""It's because I cannot do it, "" he said. ""I find them heroic and courageous."" In recent years, several movies have been released to celebrate the bravery of kamikaze pilots In fact, only 11% of Japanese nationals would be willing to fight for the country at all, according to a global survey by WIN/Gallup International. That places Japan at the bottom of the list. The result is hardly surprising given that Japan's post-war generation was brought up under a pacifist constitution which banned the nation from having a military. But is it true that all kamikaze pilots, who were mostly aged between 17 and 24, were wholly willing to die for their country? When I spoke to two rare survivors, now in their 90s, the answer appeared to be no. ""I would say 60-70% of us were eager to sacrifice ourselves for the emperor, but the rest probably questioned why they had to go,"" 94-year-old Osamu Yamada told me at his home in Nagoya. Before he carried out his mission, the war ended. ""I was single at that time and had nothing holding me back so I had one genuine thought in mind and that is I must give myself up to defend Japan. But for those who had families, they must have thought very differently."" Keiichi Kuwahara, 91, was one of those who couldn't stop thinking about his family. He told me about the moment he was told to be part of the kamikaze unit. ""I felt myself going pale."" He was only 17. ""I was scared. I didn't want to die."" ""I lost my father the year before, so it was only my mother and my older sister working to support the family. I was sending money to them from my salary. I thought, what will happen if I die? How will my family eat?"" So when his engines malfunctioned and he was forced to come back, he was relieved. But on paper, Mr Kuwahara was considered to have volunteered. ""Was I forced or did I volunteer? It is a difficult question to answer if you don't understand the essence of the military,"" he said. Prof Sheftall says the pilots were asked to put their hand up in a big group if they didn't want to volunteer. Amid peer pressure, hardly anyone was able to say no to the mission. Keiichi Kuwahara was 17 and remembers ""going pale"" when he was told to be part of the kamikaze unit The kamikaze are often compared in modern time to terrorists who carry out suicide missions, but Mr Kuwahara said that's not accurate. ""I think the two are completely different,"" said Mr Kuwahara. ""Kamikaze actions were taken only because it was wartime. With the so-called Islamic State the attacks are unpredictable."" Mr Yamada thinks the word kamikaze, which means ""divine wind"" in Japanese, is misunderstood and used inappropriately in English without understanding the historical context of what Japan was facing at the time. ""It hurts me because kamikaze was my youth. It was an innocent thing. It really was something pure. It was much more sublime. But now it is being discussed as if we were induced,"" he said. After the war Mr Kuwahara, who had been reluctant about his mission, said he felt liberated and that he needed to think about how to rebuild the country. But Mr Yamada took a while to adjust. ""I was disoriented, I felt powerless, I lost my sense of self, as if my soul was pulled out of me,"" he recalled. ""As kamikaze pilots, we were all prepared to die, so when I heard that we were defeated, I felt like the bottom had fallen out of my world."" It was the necessity to work, get food and survive in post-war Japan that kept him going. And the very man he had been willing to die for, Emperor Hirohito, ultimately played a role in him moving on from the war because he set an example by shaking hands with the Americans. Emperor Hirohito in 1942 ""The emperor, his majesty, was the heart of Japan. I think the presence of Emperor Hirohito helped the Japanese to recover from the war,"" he said. For Japan's post-war generation, the experiences of former kamikaze pilots are unimaginable, even to their own family members. ""But when I think about his life, I notice that my life isn't mine alone,"" Mr Yamada's granddaughter Yoshiko Hasegawa told me. ""I am obliged to live for those who could have been born as the children and grandchildren of the soldiers who died during the war."" Mr Kuwahara's grandson, meanwhile, is unaware of exactly what he went through as a 17-year-old trainee pilot. ""But that's the peaceful Japan I wanted to create,"" he said, smiling. To him, his grandson's ignorance is proof that the country has moved on from its painful past. You can hear Mariko's documentary ""The Last Kamikazes"" on theBBC World Serviceon Tuesday 7 November.

Why plague caught Madagascar unaware,"Madagascar is facing the worst outbreak of plague in 50 years. There have been more than 1,800 cases and 127 deaths since the start of August, according to newfigures,external. The island off the south-east coast of Africa is used to seeing about 400 cases of mostly bubonic plague in the same rural areas every year. But this year it has developed into the deadlier pneumonic version and spread to much more populated areas, including the capital. Madagascar plague: WHO in huge release of antibiotics Madagascar country profile The WHO describes the plague as ""one of the oldest - and most feared - of all diseases"". Historically, plague has been responsible for widespread pandemics with extremely high numbers of deaths. It was known as the Black Death during the 14th Century, killing more than 50 million people across Europe. Bubonic plague is spread to humans by the bites of infected fleas that live on small mammals such as rats Without treatment, it kills up to two-thirds of those infected About one in 10 cases will develop into pneumonic plague, which is almost always fatal if not treated quickly Unlike bubonic plague, it spreads much more easily through droplets in the air. So if a sick person coughs very close to you, you could pick it up The good news is that a simple short course of antibiotics can cure the plague, providing it is given early. The current outbreak in Madagascar is also slowing down, with the number of cases falling in the past couple of weeks. But the World Health Organization is warning further spikes could be on the way. It says ""despite the relative ease of treatment, plague's association with the Black Death weighs heavily on the popular conscience - and is regularly cited in media reports and tabloid headlines about outbreaks"". So how did this outbreak become the worst in recent times? ""An outbreak of plague no longer unfolds in the manner portrayed by our history books,"" said Dr Sylvie Briand, director of WHO's Infectious Hazard Management Department. ""Plague is an old disease, but the challenges it poses today are contemporary and fundamentally different from what we had even 40 years ago."" The medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres has been responding to the outbreak in one of the worst hit areas of Tamatave. Dr Tim Jagatic told BBC News the outbreak had spread to populated areas when a man infected with bubonic plague had travelled from the highlands to the capital and then on to the coastal city of Tamatave by bus. Treatment centres have been set up ""He had the bubonic form of the plague and entered into one of the major cities, where the bubonic version of the disease had the potential of turning into the pneumonic form without treatment. ""He was in a closed environment with many people when he started to develop severe symptoms, and he started to transmit the pneumonic form of the disease to others."" Dr Jagatic said this had happened in late August, which is outside the normal plague season of September to April, in an area that never usually saw pneumonic plague. It meant people weren't expecting the plague - and certainly not the type that could spread from person to person. ""So it wasn't recognised until later,"" he said, allowing the disease to ""proliferate over a period of time unabated"". This index case infected 31 other people, according to the WHO, four of whom died. It wasn't until a couple of weeks later that an outbreak of the plague was detected and officially confirmed. Since then, the country's Ministry of Health and other health agencies have swung into action, and cases have started to decline since mid-October. The risk of this outbreak spreading globally is considered low, and the WHO has advised against any travel restrictions. Nine plague treatment centres have been set up More than 2,000 community health workers are actively trying to find new cases 1.2 million doses of antibiotics have been provided by the WHO Large campaigns are under way to inform people how to stay safe The Madagascan prime minister is chairing the strategic response group ""Most people haven't experienced plague on this scale beforeâ¦ so it's putting a lot of anxiety and strain on the health system,"" said Olivier Le Polain, an epidemiologist from the UK's Rapid Support Team, which is helping the Madagascan government with its response. ""There's also fear in the population. ""There's an on-going risk going forward because the plague endemic season doesn't end until the end of April so, knowing it's in areas such as the capital, we need heightened vigilance."" The WHO describes the overall risk for the island as ""very high"". There are also serious concerns about the potential spread of the disease beyond Madagascar. Frequent travel by air and sea to and from neighbouring countries means the risk of the disease spreading to places including Mozambique, the Seychelles, South Africa, and Tanzania is considered ""moderate"". The WHO says it is helping those countries to step up surveillance and prepare for a potential outbreak. However, it says, the overall risk of the plague spreading globally is low. WHO official Tarik Jasarevic told BBC News the organisation ""advises against any restriction on travel or trade to Madagascar based on the current information available"". ""The evidence tells us that the risks associated with shutting borders are higher than keeping them open."" Back at the MSF treatment centre in Tamatave, Dr Jagatic said the country was now much better prepared as the plague season continued. ""Outbreaks are always difficult to predict. Right now we're seeing a decrease in cases, but that doesn't mean this is over,"" he said. ""We're prepared for a spike, and want to make absolutely sure we won't be caught off guard again.""

How I threw away a work of modern art,"A work by French street artist Invader on display at an exhibition in Los Angeles To me, it looked like a child's crude attempt at a mosaic. About a dozen small square tiles of different colours. Glued to the wall in a geometric design vaguely resembling a face with two square eyes. It stood out in the otherwise empty and dingy Paris flat. Once my home, I was moving back in, after nearly 20 years away. My tenants, three young single men, were showing me round before they left. ""What's that?"" I asked, pointing at the cluster of tiles. ""That's by Invader,"" my tenant replied. ""He's a street artist. He's like a French Banksy."" I quite liked Banksy, but the young man must have seen that I didn't appear overly impressed by his French counterpart. ""You must leave this,"" he said earnestly. ""One day it will be worth a lot of money."" The tiled pieces such as this one in London are inspired by the 1978 video game Space Invaders Being British, I nodded politely - but inwardly I chortled at the notion that a few tiles stuck on a bedroom wall could ever be considered a work of art. Trying to prove I wasn't too old to get it, I said: ""It reminds me of something."" After struggling for a few seconds to recall exactly what, I exclaimed triumphantly: ""Tetris!"" Now it was his turn to look dubious, so I explained: ""You know, the video game from the 80s."" ""Not Tetris,"" he said, mock-patiently. ""Space Invaders. The mother of modern video games."" He added: ""The artist came to one of our parties and ended up staying a few months. It was his way of saying thank you. Now we're leaving it for you."" Read more about Invader Paris Space Invaders street art stolen Space Invaders keeps on blasting My neighbours had complained over the years - with varying degrees of indignation and perhaps envy - that the three young men had thrown raucous parties nearly every weekend. The flat was such a wreck that my tenant admitted that, when he was working during the week as an up-and-coming executive, he stayed at his girlfriend's. Now he was getting married, while I was about to transform the bachelor party pad back into a respectable bourgeois home. I duly promised the young men that I would look after the artwork and thanked them for leaving it. But then the builders came to replaster and repaint the room. ""I might leave that,"" I told them. They looked at me sceptically. ""Why do you want to keep it? It will look strange,"" the painter said. I hesitated, but only for a moment. The wall was stripped, replastered and painted a tasteful shade ofblanc cassÃ©- off-white, far more aesthetically pleasing than a bunch of multicoloured tiles. That was nine years ago, when I was moving back to France. From Our Own Correspondenthas insight and analysis from BBC journalists, correspondents and writers from around the world Listen on iPlayer, getthe podcastor listen on the BBC World Service, or on Radio 4 on Thursdays at 11:00 and Saturdays at 11:30 BST As the years passed, I noticed more of the Space Invaders mosaics on buildings around Paris. Never did I feel a twinge of regret for destroying the one in my flat. Then, two years ago, it began to dawn on me what I'd done. I reported on how one of the distinctive mosaics of the French street artist known as Invader was about to be displayed - on board the International Space Station. The European Space Agency said it would - in their words - highlight the bridges between art and space. It was bigger, but otherwise similar to the one I'd unceremoniously stripped out of my flat. Artwork by Invader has turned up on the International Space Station and European Space Agency ground installations Invader was a global phenomenon, famous in New York, Hong Kong, London, and of course Paris. Then came the real blow. To my horror, I learned that one of his works had sold for more than â¬200,000 (Â£178,000; $233,000). The mosaics I'd once scoffed at are now so sought-after that thieves posing as municipal workers in high-visibility vests went around Paris this summer carefully removing them. Theft and vandalism have always been problems for Invader, a graduate of the Paris School of Fine Arts who was born in 1969, the year man landed on the Moon. But there's a fightback: fans known as ""reactivators"" photograph his works and reconstruct those that get damaged or disappear. Had I taken a picture of the one in my flat, I could have called in the reactivators. Now, I'll just have to live with the fact that I tossed out a valuable work of art because I preferred a smooth, blank, white wall. Perhaps I could try to market a piece of that as a work of art.

The drag wrestler who broke the mould,"The wrestling industry isn't known for LGBT representation, but drag wrestler Rick Cataldo is hoping to change that. Rick has been a professional wrestler since 2004 but his career took off in 2014 when he formed The Fella Twins. As part of the duo, he says he was able to pay tribute to the female wrestlers who inspired him as a child. ""At an early age I was attracted because even in such a violent atmosphere there could be beauty and colour,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""Plus, the big boobs and the blonde hair? That wasn't so bad either."" Growing up idolising WWE Divas such as Sable, Terry Runnels and Dawn Marie, Rick started wrestling at 14 but struggled to find a place in the industry. He never wanted to be like other male wrestlers and instead worked with female wrestlers. ""I was always the joke and the comedy relief,"" he says. ""I was trying to find my place and what would get me bookings."" Watch Rick Cataldo in action.,external Warning: Third party videos may contain adverts He says male wrestlers had pretended to be gay, but found that being open about his sexuality outside the ring proved to be a major hurdle. ""They'd throw my bags out of the locker room because they found out I was gay and it wasn't just a character [I was playing],"" he explains. ""To this day, independent companies won't book me because of a fear of what families might say."" In 2014 he started wrestling in drag, reinventing his act and finding the success he craved once he proved doubters wrong. ""I wanted to turn up at every show looking just as beautiful as the girl wrestlers on TV,"" he says. ""I've stuck with it for three years because it's working and finally people are like, 'OK, Rick is doing something here.'"" Rick says other LGBT wrestlers have told him they are now compared to him Rick, who lives in Los Angeles in the US, found more success and bookings with The Fella Twins and inspired other LGBT people to enter the industry. ""Over the last three years there have been a lot of LGBT wrestlers,"" he explains. ""A lot of them reached out to me and said how much I'd inspired them. I reach back to a lot of them because there was no-one before me to do that."" However, after three years as part of The Fella Twins, Rick's next goal is to help promote LGBT wrestling helping others find a place in the mainstream. ""My main goal, overall, was to look back and have left a dent in the world of professional wrestling,"" he says.

How Neneh's girl wrote song to kill time - and hit the charts,"A couple of months ago, R&B singer Mabel was trying to kill time while she waited to go to the gym. ""I'd booked some dumb exercise class at eight o'clock and it was six - so my brother was like, 'Just get on the piano and see what happens.'"" Forty-five minutes later, the 21-year-old had writtenFinders Keepers,external, a song that's now firmly lodged in the Top 10. ""It's amazing,"" she tells the BBC. ""I just wanted to make something fun for me and my friends."" Mabel has been making waves since 2015, when she released the slinky, sensualKnow Me Better,external, with its seductive refrain: ""I could go all day wearing nothing but your kiss"". But she's been around music all her life. Her parents are hip-hop legend Neneh Cherry and Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey. BBC Music - Sounds Like Friday Night Born in the mountains of Malaga, she was raised between Spain, London and Stockholm, learning piano at the age of five and choreographing routines to Destiny's Child with her sister. Mabel said she was initially intimidated by her mother's musical success She's no stranger to the recording studio either, accompanying McVey when he produced the Sugababes' debut album, One Touch, in 2000. At the tender age of four, she managed to sleep through the whole thing. ""Do you know what? It's still a problem!"" she laughs. ""The vibrations of the bass make me so cosy. The other day I had a blanket in the studio and my brother was like, 'You need to move. You're not writing, you're napping!'"" The habit has earned her the nickname Lil' Bassy - and it's not just confined to the studio. ""It's concerts as well!"" she says. ""If I put earplugs in, the muffled sound of a gig gets me. ""Not at my own shows though,"" she clarifies. ""[There's] no sleeping if I'm on stage."" Mabel is currently working on her debut album Given her background, Mabel's success might seem like a fait accompli. But for a long time, she avoided making music. ""I felt quite embarrassed by being my mum and dad's daughter,""she once said,external. ""I thought, 'People will never take me seriously.'"" She eventually overcame that fear and enrolled to study production and music theory in Stockholm. After graduating she moved to London. There she was cast for a photo shoot in i-D magazine. That caught the attention of Skepta, who put her in his video forShutdown,external. Mabel's hip-hop tinged debut,Know Me Better,external, went viral soon afterwards, propelling Mabel onto theBBC's Sound of 2016list. But she's purposefully taken her time, touring with Years & Years and crafting an impressive catalogue of singles. ""These things take time,"" she says, noting that new artists need longer to nurture an audience in the slow-burn streaming era. ""It's more like America, where sometimes it takes years to break a record."" This is especially true of Finders Keepers, which first came out in March and later featured on Mabel'sBedroom EP,external- a 21st take on the '90s R&B of Brandy and Aaliyah. Lyrically, the EP discusses control within relationships - ""how one minute you can be in the driving seat, then that flips and you're very much out of control."" It's also about balancing out the male-dominated narrative of R&B - which is where Finders Keepers comes in. ""There's so many R&B songs where guys are talking about a clingy girl, like: 'I don't want a girlfriend and this girl's so clingy and blah blah blah.' ""But I'm a woman and I've been in situations that have been the reverse of that, so I wanted to tell that story."" Mabel has toured with pop group Years & Years and Skepta's grime collective Boy Better Know Finders Keepers stands out even more because it's Mabel's first uptempo track. ""I really struggled with it before,"" she says. ""I'm really good at the '90s slow jams. I've got that down. But I love to dance, so why wouldn't I make something I could dance to?"" The song's success, she says, ""surpassed everyone's expectations and every other song I've ever done"" - and it spurred her to write more in the same vein. ""I have like Finders Keepers fever now!"" the singer says. ""Sometimes I go in the studio and I'm like, 'That worked so well, and I wrote it in 45 minutes so if I try wearing the same outfit and playing on the same piano it'll happen again.' ""But you know what? That's why I love music - because I'm such a control freak and it's the only thing that I can't really control. ""It's like magic.""

'Why I had my Nazi tattoos removed',"A former neo-Nazi had his swastika tattoos removed after forging an unlikely friendship with his black probation officer. Michael Kenttells the Victoria Derbyshire programme about the relationship that changed his life. For 20 years, Michael was involved in a violent white supremacist movement in Arizona, committing hate crimes and recruiting young people. During that time he acquired two swastika tattoos on his chest and a large tattoo of ""white pride"", a motto used by white supremacists, on his back. ""Every letter I had of the white pride, I had to go on a mission and I had to hurt somebody to gain each letter of that,"" he says. Michael says his neo-Nazi views evolved from racial encounters while growing up in a mostly black neighbourhood, where they had to ""fight to survive as a family"". When he was 12, an African-American man broke into his house and tried to rape his mother, and on another occasion, the mother of a black friend said she didn't want ""that blue-eyed devil in this house"". ""That just fuelled my hate as they didn't like me so you know what, I'm going all out, and I started hating them more than anything,"" he explains. ""Just on how one person treated me, I thought everyone was like that. I became more and more hateful as time went on."" Swastikas and Confederate flags were previously hung in Michael's home His outlook started to change when he met Tiffany Whittier, who took over his case a year after he completed a prison term for drugs and weapons charges. She was the first probation officer who had visited him alone, previously they had always come in pairs due to his violent record. She had seen photos of the tattoos in his file, so knew what she was letting herself in for. Michael was impressed. ""That day it sparked something. She had the audacity, the balls, the strength to come to me. From that day on, little by little, she just started transforming my life,"" he says. On the next occasion Tiffany went inside his home where she found swastikas, Confederate flags and pictures of Hitler on display. Despite this, she strongly felt she wasn't there to judge him. ""I wanted to get to know him on face value. I just began to speak to Michael, find out where he's from, where his hate stemmed from,"" she explains. ""I just worked with him, wanted him to be successful on probation and slowly but surely he started to do that on his own. I didn't realise the impact I was having on his own life."" Michael had to ""earn"" each letter of his tattoo by committing a violent act She suggested he took down his Nazi paraphernalia, joking that he could replace it with positive influences like smiley faces - but he took it seriously. Little by little, he got rid of his Nazi stuff and says he started feeling better, less aggressive. Meanwhile, his rapport with Tiffany grew as she supported him, meeting his colleagues and family. ""More and more she became involved in my life and the hate started drifting away and the love started building in my heart,"" he says. They used to call me ""cranky pants"" at work, but I began going to work happy and not aggressive,"" he says. ""As we got to know each other I showed her pictures of what I was like before and she said, 'Oh my God Michael, if I had known what you were like I would never have walked through your gate that day.'"" To complete his transformation, Michael approached an organisation called Redemption Ink, a not-for-profit organisation in the US which removes hate-related tattoos. They referred him to a company in Colorado, where he now lives, which is covering the old pictures with new designs. ""They are turning all this ugliness into something beautiful. I am almost in tears every time,"" he says. Michael says having his tattoos removed has been an emotional process Michael now lives in the mountains, working on a chicken farm where he is the only white person. He has had to move far away from his children because of fear of reprisals from gang members. The pair now hope to use their story to encourage others to engage with each other more to combat racism. They hope to write a book and will soon be launching a Facebook group ""so we can talk about race issues and unite all cultures together to become one"". ""I hurt a lot of people, I hurt children by recruiting them when they were young. I went from being a trailer trash racist to a good person,"" Michael says. ""She's a very courageous woman and I am so glad and very thankful that she's in my life.""

Kevin Spacey investigated by UK police,"Kevin Spacey is facing a number of sexual assault allegations Kevin Spacey is being investigated by UK police over an alleged sexual assault. The Sun newspaper said a man, aged 23 at the time, made a complaint,externalon Tuesday about the alleged incident in the London borough of Lambeth. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that they are investigating an alleged assault on a man from 2008. They would not confirm the allegation was made against House of Cards actor and double Oscar winner Spacey. Spacey said on Thursday that he is seeking treatment after facing allegations of sexual misconduct from a string of men. The Sun reported that a British actor claimed he woke up to find Spacey performing a sex act on him in 2008. The man is said to have run from the property after Spacey allegedly said: ""Don't tell anyone about this."" A spokesman for the Met said it had no record of any arrests having been made in connection with the investigation and police declined to comment on The Sun's report, which says the complainant had been interviewed by police. It has been claimed Kevin Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors while he was artistic director at the Old Vic It comes after a number of allegations, includingCNN reporting that Spacey made the set of Netflix's House of Cards into a ""toxic"" work environment through a pattern of sexual harassment,external. It said allegations were made by eight people who currently work on the show, or worked on it in the past, with one former employee alleging the actor sexually assaulted him. Netflix suspended production on House of Cardson 31 October followingallegations by Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp,external, who claimed Spacey tried to ""seduce"" him when he was 14. Spacey said he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear of the incident, which he does not remember. US filmmaker Tony Montana also claimed he was gropedby the actor in a Los Angeles bar in 2003. Montana said he was left with PTSD for six months after he claims Spacey ""forcefully"" grabbed his crotch. Incidents regarding Spacey are also alleged to have taken place in the UK while he was the artistic director at the Old Vic in London between 2004 and 2015. Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the theatre, claimed the star ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors. Earlier this week,the Old Vic set up a confidential complaints processfor anyone connected to the theatre to come forward. It said in a statement: ""We aim to foster a safe and supportive environment without prejudice, harassment or bullying of any sort, at any level.""

Parachute husband 'hid money problems',"Emile Cilliers was questioned by defence barrister Elizabeth Marsh QC An Army sergeant accused of sabotaging his wife's parachute in a bid to kill her hid his financial woes from her, a court has heard. Emile Cilliers, 37, denies attempting to murder Victoria Cilliers, who survived a 4,000ft fall. At Winchester Crown Court, South African Mr Cilliers said he secretively took out ""loans to cover other loans"" out of fear his wife would leave him. ""I was hiding from Victoria the financial situation I was in,"" he said. ""I was living above my means, taking out loans to cover other loans - all my money would go on repaying loans and I would get another loan to try and hide it. ""I would be embarrassed [if Victoria found out]. ""I was afraid she would be disappointed in me, I was just scared."" When asked by Elizabeth Marsh QC, defending, what he thought would happen if his wife had found found out he replied: ""Leave me."" Mr Cilliers took the stand at Winchester Crown Court for the first time on Friday The jury heard that Mrs Cilliers later discovered her husband was struggling with money, and agreed to bail him out. ""I kept on blaming various things for money being missing or not appearing. ""I never told her the truth about the debt I was in or who I owed the money to and I think it came to the point where she had enough,"" he said. The jury had previously been told about financial arrangements, including wills, a life insurance policy and a post-nuptial agreement between the couple. While giving her evidence,Mrs Cilliers told the court these arrangements would not have benefitted her husbandin the event of her death. Emile Cilliers is wearing a dark navy blue suit, a pale blue shirt, a yellow tie, a small poppy pin badge and polished shoes. He answers questions in a calm voice, with a faint South African accent. When asked by defence barrister Elizabeth Marsh QC where he lived when he first came to England, he says he tried Scotland but only lasted a few weeks. He also told the court how he had planned on proposing on top of Table Mountain in South Africa after he and Victoria had climbed up. But the proposal didn't happen then, he told the court, as "" Victoria had a meltdown half way through"". Mrs Cilliers broke her vertebrae, ribs and pelvis in the fall at Netheravon Airfield in 2015. Prosecutors allege Mr Cilliers, a sergeant with the Aldershot-based Royal Army Physical Training Corps, twisted the lines of his wife's main parachute and sabotaged a reserve chute the day before her jump. Mr Cilliers also denies a second attempted murder charge and a third charge of tampering with a gas fitting at their home in Amesbury, Wiltshire. He will continue to give evidence when the trial continues on Monday. Parachute husband 'would never harm' wife Parachute husband 'worse off if wife dead' Parachute wife 'shouldn't have survived' Wife 'blacked out' as parachute failed Parachute trial accused 'caused gas leak' Parachute sabotage accused 'texted lover' Parachute fail wife 'among UK's best' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Man sought by police after convenience store incident Fire breaks out at secondary school Secondary school confirms it will be closed after fire Photographs show snow fall in New Forest amid yellow weather warning The Cotswolds named as one of best places to live in country New chairman takes on role at charity after day out with Bobby Van At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

Spain issues warrant for Catalan leader,"Mr Puigdemont has called for his colleagues to be released A Spanish judge has issued European Arrest Warrants (EAW) for sacked Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont and four of his allies who went to Belgium. The five failed to attend a high court hearing in Madrid on Thursday when nine other ex-members of the regional government were taken into custody. One of those detained has been freed on bail of â¬50,000 (Â£44,000; $58,000). They all face charges of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds for pursuing Catalan independence. Mr Puigdemont has said he will not return to Spain unless he receives guarantees of a fair trial. Belgium will ""study"" the warrant, a spokesman for the state prosecutor told AFP news agency. The man who wants to break up Spain Catalonia crisis: What next for Spain? The regional parliament in Catalonia voted to proclaim an independent republic a week ago, following an illegal referendum on independence organised by the Catalan government on 1 October No other country recognised the move and the Spanish central government moved swiftly to impose control, using emergency powers under the constitution. Mr Puigdemont was the president of the autonomous region of Catalonia until the proclamation of independence and continues to regard himself as the president of the newly proclaimed ""Republic of Catalonia"". Mr Puigdemont and his colleagues travelled to Belgium to raise their case for statehood at the EU institutions and he insists he is not trying to evade ""real justice"". He said in a Belgian TV interview aired earlier on Friday that he would co-operate with Belgian judicial authorities. He also said that he was ready to run in snap regional elections in Catalonia next month. The other four warrants are for: Meritxell Serret, former agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, former health minister LluÃ­s Puig, former culture minister Clara PonsatÃ­, former education minister The warrants were sent to Belgian prosecutors, who have 24 hours to decide whether the paperwork is correct. If they do, they will forward them on to a judge who will decide whether Mr Puigdemont and the four others should be arrested. Protesters have taken to the streets again in Barcelona over the detentions of Catalan ex-officials Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the suspects to Spain after arrest. But if the suspects do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen much sooner. A country can reject an EU arrest warrant if it fears that extradition would violate the suspect's human rights. Discrimination based on politics, religion or race is grounds for refusal. So are fears that the suspect would not get a fair trial. There is an agreedEU list of 32 offences,external- in Article Two of the EAW law - for which there is no requirement for the offence to be a crime in both countries. In other words, any of those offences can be a justification for extradition, provided the penalty is at least three years in jail. However, neither ""sedition"" nor ""rebellion"" - two of the Spanish accusations against the Catalan leaders - are on that list. Thousands of protesters have gathered in Barcelona and other Catalan cities for the second night running to call for the release of the former officials detained on Thursday. Santi Vila, the Catalan former business minister, was granted bail at the request of prosecutors after spending a night in prison. ""My colleagues and I are fine, we are calm,"" he said upon leaving jail in Madrid, but called the detentions ""disproportionate"", Spain's El PaÃ­s newspaper reports. He had resigned from the cabinet before the Catalan parliament voted for independence. Seven of the eight ex-ministers were pictured turning up to court together on Thursday Those who remain in custody are: Oriol Junqueras, former deputy vice-president Joaquim Forn, former interior minister RaÃ¼l Romeva, former external relations secretary Carles MundÃ³, former justice minister Dolors Bassa, former labour minister Jordi Turull, former government presidency councillor Josep Rull, former sustainable development minister Meritxell Borras, former culture minister Protesters are also calling for the release of two grassroots separatist leaders, Jordi SÃ¡nchez and Jordi Cuixart, who were taken into custody last month.They lost an appeal for release on Friday. Five senior members of the Catalan parliament, as well as Speaker Carme Forcadell, are facing the same charges but, because of their parliamentary immunity, their cases are being handled by the Supreme Court. Their hearings have been postponed until 9 November. Catalonia sings for its exiled leaders What next for Spain?

"Boy, 14, held over driver acid attack","One of the victims was attacked in Walthamstow by two men who were trying to steal his moped A 14-year-old has been arrested over an acid attack which left a delivery driver ""fighting for his life"". The 32-year-old could lose his sight after a substance was repeatedly thrown in his face in Walthamstow on Thursday evening, police said. In a separate attack in Tottenham about 30 minutes later, another delivery driver, also 32, had a corrosive substance thrown at him. Police ""strongly suspect"" the attacks are linked, the BBC's Danny Shaw said.

The first attack happened in Walpole Road, Walthamstow The Met said the teenager has been arrested over the Walthamstow attack and is being held on suspicion of committing grievous bodily harm. Detectives said the victim was likely to lose sight in both eyes. ""This attack has left a man fighting for his life and with terrible eye injuries,"" Det Ch Insp Gordon Henderson said. ""This was an innocent man going about his work as a delivery driver, who may never see again."" Forensic teams are carrying out investigations in Walthamstow In the second attack, two males approached the victim on Yarmouth Crescent, Tottenham, in a bid to steal his moped.

US deserter Bergdahl spared prison time,"Bergdahl was facing up to life in prison after he pleaded guilty last month to desertion US Army soldier Bowe Bergdahl will be spared prison time after he was found guilty of deserting his Afghan outpost in 2009, a military judge has ruled. Under the sentence in his court martial, the 31-year-old sergeant will be dishonourably discharged, reduced to private in rank and lose pay. Prosecutors had argued Bergdahl should spend 14 years behind bars for endangering US troops in Afghanistan. He spent five years in Taliban captivity after abandoning his post. US President Donald Trump tweeted that the sentence was a ""total disgrace"". He has repeatedly called Bergdahl ""a traitor"" and criticised the Obama-era prisoner exchange with the Taliban that led to the American soldier's release. The judge, Army Col Jeffery R Nance, considered the president's attacks as a mitigating factor in sentencing Bergdahl, whose lawyers argued he could not receive a fair trial because of the comments. On Friday, the judge said the Idaho native must forfeit pay equal to $1,000 (Â£765) per month for 10 months. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Bergdahl had been facing up to life in prison after he pleaded guilty last month to desertion and misbehaviour before the enemy. His lawyer Eugene Fidell told reporters: ""He has lost nearly a decade of his life. He said Bergdahl is glad his ""terrible ordeal"" is now over. Major Justin Oshana, for the prosecution, told the sentencing hearing that other US troops were injured in the hunt for Bergdahl. What happened to captured US soldier Bowe Bergdahl? Bergdahl appeals to Obama for pardon But Captain Nina Banks, for the defence, said that when he deserted, Bergdahl had not yet been diagnosed with schizotypal personality disorder, which includes grandiose thinking. The soldier said he had walked away from his outpost in Paktika province to report problems in his unit. The military investigator who interrogated Bergdahl following his return from the US had told officials he did not believe he deserved further punishment. He said Bergdahl had suffered the worst case of prisoner abuse against a US soldier in captivity since the Vietnam War. On Monday, Bergdahl took the stand to apologise to the troops who were wounded in the search for him. Shannon Allen's husband was shot in the head in the search for Bergdahl ""I made a horrible mistake,"" he said in the courtroom at Fort Bragg, North Carolina. ""Saying I'm sorry is not enough."" Master Sergeant Mark Allen was shot in the head during a July 2009 mission to find Bergdahl. His wife, Shannon Allen, who was a witness for the prosecution this week, described the impact of her husband's debilitating brain injury. ""Instead of being his wife, I'm his caregiver,"" she said in an emotional testimony. ""Which doesn't mean I love him any less, but it's a very different dynamic. ""We can't even hold hands anymore without me prying open his hand and putting mine in."" Bergdahl testified that his Taliban captors had locked him in a cage after he briefly escaped. He said he received little food, water or sleep and was forced to watch beheading videos. Bergdahl was freed in a politically contentious 2014 Taliban prisoner swap brokered by former President Barack Obama's administration.

Corbyn 'warned over harassment claim MP',"This video can not be played Ava Etemadzadeh: ""It made me feel extremely uncomfortable and it was a revolting act."" Labour's former chief whip queried Jeremy Corbyn's decision to promote an MP, following allegations of sexual harassment, the BBC has learned. Dame Rosie Winterton rang the Labour leader's office to ask why Kelvin Hopkins had been appointed to the shadow cabinet in July 2016. She reminded them that Mr Hopkins had been reprimanded for harassing a young activist, a Labour source said. The Labour Party has not officially commented on the claim. A party spokesman said an investigation is ongoing into the allegations about Mr Hopkins's conduct and it takes such complaints ""extremely seriously"". Labour suspends MP over harassment claim AM facing allegations about conduct Fallon denies 'lewd remarks' allegation Mr Hopkins, 76, was promoted to Jeremy Corbyn's frontbench team in July 2016 but asked to return to the backbenches four months later. He has not commented on the allegations about his past conduct but has been suspended while the party investigates them. Labour activist Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, earlier told the BBC she had been left feeling ""very powerless and isolated"" after Mr Hopkins was promoted - the year after she complained about his behaviour. Ms Etemadzadeh claims the Luton North MP made inappropriate physical contact while hugging her, after she had invited him to speak at a university event in 2014, which ""made me feel extremely uncomfortable"". ""The second incident was in Parliament when I went to have a conversation and he told me that 'let's not talk about politics, do you have a boyfriend?',"" she told BBC News. ""And he also said that if nobody was in his office he would've taken me there. I was absolutely shocked and I wasn't really expecting that."" After refusing to respond to his phone calls, she claimed he sent her a message ""saying that I'm an attractive, lovely young woman and a man would be lucky to have me as a lover and if he was young ... but he's not"". Some months later she raised concerns about Mr Hopkins' conduct with another Labour MP and her complaint was passed to the party's then chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton, who responded to it. But Ms Etemadzadeh said she was told she would have to waive her anonymity for action to be taken and the prospect of this ""scared"" her. It is understood Mr Hopkins was verbally reprimanded about his alleged behaviour. But he went on to be promoted, albeit briefly, to Labour's front bench in June 2016 - shortly after leader Jeremy Corbyn faced mass resignations following the EU referendum. Mr Hopkins has been MP for Luton North since 1997 Ms Etemadzadeh told the BBC she believed that the Labour leader's office had been contacted about the complaint ""and it was ignored"". ""I'm very disillusioned because just a few months later I realised that Jeremy Corbyn promoted Kelvin Hopkins to the shadow cabinet, despite the fact that the leader's office was aware of this and they refused to act and that made me feel very powerless and isolated and alone."" Labour MP Jess Phillips told the BBC earlier: ""I am a bit concerned about the fact that Kelvin was then promoted afterwards, that does seem wrong to me... I think that people just didn't take it as seriously as it needed to be taken."" Labour MP for Luton North since 1997 Spent most of 20-year political career on backbenches Briefly promoted to front bench from July to October 2016 Long history of involvement with trade union movement One of 36 MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn for his 2015 leadership bid One of the few Labour MPs to campaign for Leave in the EU referendum Married to Patricia. The couple have two grown up children Asked about the story, Shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The issue has come to light and and the matter is being thoroughly investigated by the party."" Last week Mr Corbyn said he would encourage any woman who had been abused or harassed by MPs to speak out, adding that the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) had adopted new ""robust"" procedures to deal with the issue in July.

Labour activist 'isolated' over complaint,"This video can not be played Ava Etemadzadeh: ""It made me feel extremely uncomfortable and it was a revolting act."" Labour's former chief whip queried Jeremy Corbyn's decision to promote an MP, following allegations of sexual harassment, the BBC has learned. Dame Rosie Winterton rang the Labour leader's office to ask why Kelvin Hopkins had been appointed to the shadow cabinet in July 2016. She reminded them that Mr Hopkins had been reprimanded for harassing a young activist, a Labour source said. The Labour Party has not officially commented on the claim. A party spokesman said an investigation is ongoing into the allegations about Mr Hopkins's conduct and it takes such complaints ""extremely seriously"". Labour suspends MP over harassment claim AM facing allegations about conduct Fallon denies 'lewd remarks' allegation Mr Hopkins, 76, was promoted to Jeremy Corbyn's frontbench team in July 2016 but asked to return to the backbenches four months later. He has not commented on the allegations about his past conduct but has been suspended while the party investigates them. Labour activist Ava Etemadzadeh, 27, earlier told the BBC she had been left feeling ""very powerless and isolated"" after Mr Hopkins was promoted - the year after she complained about his behaviour. Ms Etemadzadeh claims the Luton North MP made inappropriate physical contact while hugging her, after she had invited him to speak at a university event in 2014, which ""made me feel extremely uncomfortable"". ""The second incident was in Parliament when I went to have a conversation and he told me that 'let's not talk about politics, do you have a boyfriend?',"" she told BBC News. ""And he also said that if nobody was in his office he would've taken me there. I was absolutely shocked and I wasn't really expecting that."" After refusing to respond to his phone calls, she claimed he sent her a message ""saying that I'm an attractive, lovely young woman and a man would be lucky to have me as a lover and if he was young ... but he's not"". Some months later she raised concerns about Mr Hopkins' conduct with another Labour MP and her complaint was passed to the party's then chief whip Dame Rosie Winterton, who responded to it. But Ms Etemadzadeh said she was told she would have to waive her anonymity for action to be taken and the prospect of this ""scared"" her. It is understood Mr Hopkins was verbally reprimanded about his alleged behaviour. But he went on to be promoted, albeit briefly, to Labour's front bench in June 2016 - shortly after leader Jeremy Corbyn faced mass resignations following the EU referendum. Mr Hopkins has been MP for Luton North since 1997 Ms Etemadzadeh told the BBC she believed that the Labour leader's office had been contacted about the complaint ""and it was ignored"". ""I'm very disillusioned because just a few months later I realised that Jeremy Corbyn promoted Kelvin Hopkins to the shadow cabinet, despite the fact that the leader's office was aware of this and they refused to act and that made me feel very powerless and isolated and alone."" Labour MP Jess Phillips told the BBC earlier: ""I am a bit concerned about the fact that Kelvin was then promoted afterwards, that does seem wrong to me... I think that people just didn't take it as seriously as it needed to be taken."" Labour MP for Luton North since 1997 Spent most of 20-year political career on backbenches Briefly promoted to front bench from July to October 2016 Long history of involvement with trade union movement One of 36 MPs to nominate Jeremy Corbyn for his 2015 leadership bid One of the few Labour MPs to campaign for Leave in the EU referendum Married to Patricia. The couple have two grown up children Asked about the story, Shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz told BBC Radio 4's World at One: ""The issue has come to light and and the matter is being thoroughly investigated by the party."" Last week Mr Corbyn said he would encourage any woman who had been abused or harassed by MPs to speak out, adding that the party's National Executive Committee (NEC) had adopted new ""robust"" procedures to deal with the issue in July.

Acid attack driver 'could lose sight',"One of the victims was attacked in Walthamstow by two men who were trying to steal his moped A 14-year-old has been arrested over an acid attack which left a delivery driver ""fighting for his life"". The 32-year-old could lose his sight after a substance was repeatedly thrown in his face in Walthamstow on Thursday evening, police said. In a separate attack in Tottenham about 30 minutes later, another delivery driver, also 32, had a corrosive substance thrown at him. Police ""strongly suspect"" the attacks are linked, the BBC's Danny Shaw said. The home affairs correspondent added the victim in the first attack - during which two males tried to steal his moped - had injuries to his throat, face, oesophagus and eyes and was in an induced coma. The first attack happened in Walpole Road, Walthamstow The Met said the teenager has been arrested over the Walthamstow attack and is being held on suspicion of committing grievous bodily harm. Detectives said the victim was likely to lose sight in both eyes. ""This attack has left a man fighting for his life and with terrible eye injuries,"" Det Ch Insp Gordon Henderson said. ""This was an innocent man going about his work as a delivery driver, who may never see again."" Forensic teams are carrying out investigations in Walthamstow In the second attack, two males approached the victim on Yarmouth Crescent, Tottenham, in a bid to steal his moped. He was taken to hospital but his injuries are not thought to be life-threatening.

Hollywood 'horrified' by Leith gaffe,"Hollywood was quizzed about Leith's error by An Extra Slice host Jo Brand Bake Off star Paul Hollywood has spoken of his horror after the winner of this year's series was accidentally revealed by fellow judge Prue Leith. ""What can you say? I was horrified,"" he said on Channel 4's spin-off showAn Extra Slice,external. ""She's made a mistake."" ""Unfortunately Prue can't be with us as she's too busy deleting her Twitter account,"" joked presenter Jo Brand. Leith revealedthat Sophie Faldo had won on Tuesday morning, hours before the finale was aired. The tweet was hastily deleted, but not before many people had noticed and circulated the gaffe. She said she was in Bhutan and had been confused by the time difference between the UK and the South Asian country. Sophie Faldo (centre) was named the winner of this year's Bake Off series ""She was in the Himalayas apparently,"" said Hollywood on Thursday's edition of Bake Off's sister programme. Brand made a second reference to Leith's error by pretending the writer and restaurateur had been in touch. ""I've had a text from Prue and apparently the winner [of next year's show] is somebody called Malcolm,"" she said. Leith's mistake did not stop 7.7 million watching the Bake Off final on Tuesday,earning Channel 4 its highest overnight ratingssince 2012.

Police find 'WW2 bomb' was big courgette,"Police agreed with the elderly man that the vegetable looked like a bomb A German man feared a monster courgette he found in his garden was an unexploded World War Two bomb and called the police. The 5kg (11-pound) courgette had probably been thrown over a hedge into the 81 year old's garden, police said. Luckily no evacuation was required in Bretten, a town near Karlsruhe in south-west Germany. The 40cm (16-inch) vegetable - also called zucchini - ""really did look like a bomb"", police said,external. Once police had reassured him following the early morning call-out, the pensioner disposed of the courgette himself. Many unexploded bombs dropped by the British RAF or US Air Force have been unearthed in Germany, usually during construction work. On 3 September 65,000 people were evacuated from their homes in Frankfurt, so that a 1.4-tonne British bomb could be defused. It was the biggest evacuation in post-war German history for an unexploded bomb alert. How dangerous are unexploded bombs?

Pistorius sentence 'shockingly light',"This video can not be played Oscar Pistorius case by numbers South African prosecutors are appealing for a longer sentence for Olympic athlete Oscar Pistorius for murdering girlfriend Reeva Steenkamp. They told the Supreme Court of Appeal the six-year sentence was ""shockingly light"" and he should get 15 years. Defence lawyers say the sentence handed down by a lower court is appropriate. Pistorius claimed he shot dead Ms Steenkamp on Valentine's Day in 2013 after mistaking her for a burglar at his home in the capital Pretoria. The lower court justified deviating from the prescribed 15-year sentence by saying mitigating circumstances such as rehabilitation and remorse outweighed aggravating factors such as his failure to fire a warning shot. But prosecutor Andrea Johnson said the sentence did not match the gravity of the crime. Has Oscar Pistorius got off lightly? The making and unmaking of Oscar Pistorius Reeva Steenkamp, my friend Pistorius, 30, is not in the court in Bloemfontein. He is being held at the Atteridgeville Correctional Centre prison in Pretoria. He was initially given a five-year term for manslaughter in 2014, but was found guilty of murder on appeal in 2015. Ms Steenkamp was a model and celebrity Pistorius shot Reeva Steenkamp four times through a locked toilet door in February 2013. Previously, the six-time Paralympic gold medallist had made history by becoming the first amputee sprinter to compete at the Olympics, in 2012 in London, running on prosthetic ""blades"".

The most dramatic way to quit your job,"Some workers are probably guilty of fantasising about making a spectacular exit from their day job or pulling a Bridget Jones and telling their boss what they really think of them. But one (now former) Twitter employee actually did it, and made their departure known around the world on Thursday bydeleting US President Donald Trump's Twitter account. The social media platform said his account was ""inadvertently deactivated due to human error"" and restored it after 11 minutes. But what are other famous examples of unconventional resignations and frosty workplace goodbyes? In 2010 a disgruntled air steward, Steven Slater, lost patience with passengers' behaviour andended his flying career with a spectacular exit from a Pittsburgh to New York flight. He had reportedly been drawn into an altercation between passengers over overhead luggage space during the flight. After a woman then ignored his requests to stay seated as the plane landed, he took to the plane's intercom system. Reports said he went on a foul-mouthed rebuke of the passenger and said: ""To those who have shown dignity and respect these last 20 years, thanks for the great ride"", before grabbing a beer from the in-flight trolley, activating the JetBlue plane's inflatable slide and departing. He told the New York Times the flamboyant exit had been a long-held fantasy. But it proved to be an expensive one, after a judge eventually ordered him to pay the company $10,000 (Â£7,700) for a replacement slide and sentenced him to a year's probation. He faced felony charges of reckless endangerment and criminal mischief, as well as criminal trespass. In 2013 Chris Holmes, a former airport border force worker,baked his resignation letter and gave it to his employerswhen he opted for a change in career. Four years on he is still baking and running his own business full-time, and told the BBC he had absolutely no regrets about his decision. He said he found his old job at Stansted Airport quite boring and wanted to ""inject a bit of a fun in a final flourish"". ""At the time everyone asked me if I thought everyone should quit their job for something they love,"" he said. ""If you have a plan in place, why not?"" Both animator Marina Schifrin and games developer Jarrad Woods turned their crafts into creative resignations online. In 2009 Mr Woods, who is also known by his nickname Farbs, made a customised level of video game Mario to reveal his resignation from a Australian game developer in order to go freelance. In a blog post he said he spent the night making the game, and then sent it off around his office -you can still play it on his website,external. In 2013 Ms Schifrin was working at the time as an animator in Taiwan when she posted a video of herself quitting by dancing around an empty office on YouTube set to the Kanye West song Gone. The description for ""An Interpretive Dance For My Boss"" said: ""My boss only cares about quantity and how many views each video gets. So I figured I'd make ONE video of my own."" Itgot almost 20 million views online,external(but it has now been removed for copyright infringement on the song). Her old company and manager tried to have the last laugh byposting their own version of her video,externalin response. A Rhode Island hotel-worker staged a spectacular resignation in 2011 when he brought his marching band friends along with him to tell his boss he quit after three and a half years. Joey DeFrancesco posted the video online and it soon went viral (warning: expletives),external. The band are seen sneaking into the hotel and begin playing a celebratory song after the worker hands his manager a letter of resignation. The disagreement was reportedly part of a long-running battle between employees and management over union membership. ""We'd joked about doing it for a really long time, at someone's engagement or them coming out to their parents or something,"" Mr DeFrancesco told the BBC. But he said to quit alongside the band came out of the blue after a ""particularly awful day at work"". His video was watched almost six million times and saw the band invited on US television shows.He still plays music, recently with his new band. A typesetter at an Australian magazinedrew a naked cartoon of himself and put it on the cover of his final edition,external(don't worry - nothing in this link is explicit), replacing British band the Kaiser Chiefs, back in 2012. Luke Benge hijacked the edition by swapping out the image with a crude drawing, complete with genitals, avoiding the pre-print checks. According to Australian media, no one at the magazine knew about the cover until 35,000 copies had been distributed across Melbourne. Beat magazine took it well, and apologised to faint-hearted locals who might have been offended. One of the best-known resignations is that of an Alaskan television news anchor, Charlo Greene, who quit in 2014 while live on-air. She was presenting a story about a group lobbying for legalisation of cannabis - she walked off set because, it surprisingly turned out, she ran the group Another example from 2013 was of a Brazilian priest quitting during Mass,externalby announcing he going to be a father David Powell-Cameron told the BBC how he and a fellow window-dresser in a department store in Pennsylvania in 1983 sabotaged the main window display to become a macabre gorilla wedding scene - complete with animal costumes in wedding gowns in front of a firing squad. ""Our revenge was realized when we watched frantic employees enter the window, with rush-hour foot traffic watching, and wrestle with the grotesque scene to dismantle it,"" he said. You told us that creative notes are also a popular method, including making elaborate designs. Tina told the BBC she had a difficult boss in a bank that refused to directly talk to her so she hid her resignation letter in his letter pile and watched him open it then just walked out. Although we don't recommend violence, Jim McCarthy told the BBC that he resigned from a job as a carpenter when he was 18 with a punch to a boss he described as a ""bully"" .""When he was coming to, I told him, I guess you know today is my last day,"" he said.

Finding the 'teachable moment' in A&E,"This video can not be played The BBC's Tom Symonds met the charity Redthread, that works with gang violence victims Can young people who've been injured in knife and gun crime be steered towards a safer future at the moment they're at their most vulnerable? The idea has been pioneered in four London hospitals by the charity Redthread, which places youth workers an the heart of accident and emergency alongside trauma medics. It is early evening in ""resus"", part of accident and emergency at King's College Hospital in south London. One of the city's four major trauma centres, if you are in a serious accident, or you are stabbed or shot, this is where you may end up. It is an extraordinary place. Green-overalled ambulance crews constantly arrive to be met by teams of medical staff in coloured scrubs. Sometimes there are wails of pain from patients. The public address system blares urgent announcements. A nurse at King's College Hospital takes details of an incoming patient The ring of the ""red phone"" cuts through it all - warning the medics of an incoming patient. Tonight it's a ""paediatric, code red"". A child, with life-threatening injuries. He arrives, dressings marked with blood, on a trolley surrounded by paramedics and is handed over to a 10-strong team of waiting trauma specialists. Senior consultant Dr Emer Sutherland marshals her team. The patient is 16. He has been slashed four times with a large knife. A trauma team attends a patient in the resus unit at King's College Hospital In the course of the next few hours, the resus team will ensure he lives. They're good at what they do. Only three young stabbing victims have died in the hospital this year. But there's another specialist alongside them. Lucy Knell-Taylor is 29, dressed in a T-shirt and leggings. She's not a doctor, but a youth worker with the charity Redthread. She is there not to save a life, but to change one. Dr Emer Sutherland (L) considers Redthread's Lucy Knell-Taylor a vital part of the team We spent four days at King's, during which time we saw a steady flow of patients with stab wounds - almost all of them under 18. The peak time for admission was not late at night, but at school going-home time. After a decade of falling levels of violent crime, they are now increasing again. Reported knife crime rose 26% in the last year. In London, 21 teenagers have been murdered, 15 stabbed to death. On a knife edge: The rise of violence on London's streets 'You have to keep a knife with you' Redthread is trying to help young people escape what for many is a life riven by violence. To achieve that, youth worker Lucy has to wait for the right time. When victims are able to talk, she moves in among the medical team and begins the task of building a relationship with someone she's never met, who may be traumatised and hostile, while they are having emergency treatment. Some respond well. One gestured to his wounds and said to Lucy: ""I want you to look at it and tell me what they are doing."" Others are more difficult. Many young men involved in criminal gangs who won't even tell her their ""government"" or real name.  She's been called a ""pagan"", meaning ""you're not one of us"". She is often told: ""I slipped on glass."" In resus, they know that's usually code for ""I was stabbed."" She responds with reassurance, practical help and personal warmth. Forging a relationship is everything. Redthread calls this ""the teachable moment"". When someone is critically injured, they are suddenly removed from the streets. They are dependent on doctors for their survival. They may be in pain. The aim is to teach them that this is a moment they should grasp. A junction in their lives where a choice can be made. To go back, or to move on. Lucy Knell-Taylor says she seeks to form a bond with patients ""Getting to them now when they are here in the hospital,"" Lucy Knell-Taylor says, ""is my opportunity to say every single thing which has happened before this second, kind of doesn't matter. ""Right now you're in pain, you're away from your natural environment, your friends may or may not be here. This is an opportunity to think - does something need to be different? ""It's live, it's the moment it's most real to them. It's the perfect moment."" A mother's fight against knife crime Stab victim mum in Trafalgar Square sculpture plea When it works, a bond is formed between Ms Knell-Taylor and the victim. It means she can later say ""You can trust me.  I've seen your pain face!"" But it can be traumatic work. Ms Knell-Taylor describes one incident when, called to resus, she was confronted with a large group of ""road men"" - gang members.  One turned, and a kitchen knife was sticking out of his eye. She has seen patients die. This video can not be played Special correspondent Ed Thomas has witnessed the reality of knife crime Dr Emer Sutherland helped set up the project 13 years ago. ""I am a middle-aged mum,"" she says. ""I don't have the same experiences young people have. ""I can keep them alive, I can resuscitate them, but then my expert colleagues - the youth workers - come in to offer them what they want for the future."" The teachable moment is designed to open the door to potentially years of work aimed at extracting victims from a violent life. Ms Knell-Taylor has argued for ""her people"" in court, fought battles with probation officers, sorted housing, and even organised transport for one patient who couldn't go to a certain hospital because he might be stabbed passing through a rival group's territory. Jane - not her real name - is one of Redthread's successes. ""Jane"" (L) has had the support of Redthread's Becky Calnan for several years Now in her 20s, when she was a teenager, she became involved in a drugs gang and was forced to carry guns and knives around London. ""I saw a man get both of his legs broken,"" she tells me. She was sexually abused and sent to be raped by rival gangs, as part of a bizarre arrangement used when her gang had done something which might otherwise result in its rivals retaliating violently. ""If your girl had to sleep with a guy from another gang, it was like they had one up on you. The girls were used as pawns,"" she says. Unwell, Jane came to King's. Hospital staff opened the door to the teachable moment by tipping off Redthread that she would be at a clinic the next morning. ""It was probably one of the lowest points in my life,"" she says. ""I wasn't feeling great, and in that moment Becky was there to help me."" Becky Calnan has recently stopped working directly with Jane, a mark of her progress Becky is Becky Calnan, an experienced Redthread worker who has now been with Jane for years. ""I just felt an automatic connection that actually this was someone who - regardless of what I was involved in - was going to help me,"" Jane says. ""Since then, I've probably spoken to her every other day for years. She's helped me rebuild relationships with my family, get me back into a community."" ""Ideally I'd like her to be in my life forâ¦ well, forever."" But in fact their work connection recently came to an end. Jane accepts that as ""a mark of how far I've come"". The Redthread team is expanding its work into hospitals outside London Lucy Knell-Taylor says success is measured by her services no longer being needed. ""I try and work on this Nanny McPhee principle of when you need me but don't want me I'll be there, but when you want me but no longer need me, I won't,"" she says. A recent report on the charity's work at St Mary's hospital suggested it had led to a 60% reduction in the number of young people coming back to the emergency department as victims of violent crime. However, it has proven tricky for Redthread to show wider evidence of its success, because of a lack of funding for studies of what happens to the young people it contacts. Now the project's being expanded to three hospitals in Birmingham and Nottingham which will provide an opportunity to measure the effect of the ""teachable moment"" both before and after Redthread gets to work. The intensive one-to-one relationships with young people that Redthread believes can divert them from violent lifestyles don't come cheap. Scaling up the project could get very expensive. But every case arriving in resus results in a bill to the NHS for hugely expensive specialist care. Policymakers will also have to consider the real cost of not cutting youth violence.

Interest rates: Your questioned answered,"Are you ready for an interest rate rise? The Bank of England has raised interest rates for the first time in more than a decade. The official bank ratehas been lifted from 0.25% to 0.5%, the first increase since July 2007. While the move was widely expected, it will affect millions of households on mortgages and savings. We asked our BBC Personal Finance Correspondent Simon Gompertz to answer your questions. Yes, variable rate loans will rise, but fixed rate mortgages, for instance, will stay the same. We are still waiting to hear what the big banks will do with their savings rates, but some players have already said they will put some of their rates up, including Nationwide, TSB and Yorkshire Building Society. What happens to the pound will depend on further interest rate rises and how quickly people in the financial markets believe they will arrive. This video can not be played We challenged some ten year olds to explain a system that baffles many adultsâ¦ Higher interest rates lead to higher mortgage costs for some people in the short run and most people in the long run. And in the past that has had the effect of holding back house prices. But this base rate increase is comparatively small, so it's not clear whether it will have much impact. What will the rate rise mean for you? Kamal Ahmed: Are more rate rises ahead? Five things we have learnt from the Bank That's a good point, especially if you include the cost of mortgages in your measure of inflation - though mortgages are not part of the Consumer Prices Index or CPI. What central banks tend to think is that inflation happens when an economy is growing too fast, because firms can put up prices for their goods and people still buy them. The theory is that by raising interest rates you leave people and businesses with less money to spend. Current tuition fee interest is inflation (the RPI measure) +3%, so it's not affected by base rate changes. You may also like: A-level agony? We answer your questions Reality Check: Your Brexit citizens questions answered Panama Papers: What happened next? The pound fell, partly because of hints from the Bank of England that further increases in base rate might be pretty slow in coming. The suggestion was the rate might reach 1% in 2020. The pound's value tends to be affected by investors' judgements on whether they'll receive a good return if they keep their assets in sterling investments. You will struggle to find many people expecting a 6% base rate any time soon. But it's not impossible. Ten years ago you might have been laughed at for saying a 0.5% rate was on the way. The biggest factor is what happens to inflation. High inflation tends to mean high interest rates. Interest rate expectations are always priced into fixed rate deals. The lenders tend to cover themselves against the risk of rates going up or down by doing their own deals in the wholesale money markets - and the prices there depend on dealers' predictions (or bets) on what will happen. The signs are that rates will go up more, but the Bank of England seems to be steering us away from expecting big increases. Tracker mortgages move in line with Bank base rate but not Standard Variable Rates, or not necessarily. Some SVRs are over 5%. It's something borrowers need to watch like hawks.

Big losses for IS in Syria and Iraq,"This video can not be played 'We would rather be killed by IS than be here' - the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Syria So-called Islamic State (IS) has lost control of two of its last remaining strongholds in Syria and Iraq. Early on Friday Syria's army announced it had taken Deir al-Zour. Later in the day the Iraqi prime minister said al-Qaim, across the border, had been recaptured by government forces. The town was taken ""in record time"", PM Haider al-Abadi said. Iraqi forces say they have also seized the last border post between Iraq and Syria that was held by IS. Last month,a US-backed Syrian alliance took control of Raqqa in Syria, the former capital of Islamic State's self-styled ""caliphate"". In July, Mosul - Iraq's second-largest city - was taken from IS after months of fighting. The territorial ambitions of IS are now all but destroyed although its ideology remains powerful, says the BBC's Arab Affairs Editor Sebastian Usher. What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? The rapid rise and fall of 'Islamic State' IS had held most of Deir al-Zour since 2014. It was important because of its proximity to the border with Iraq. While the Syrian army said it had been re-captured, other reports said government forces and their allies were clearing the last pockets of resistance from IS in the city. Al-Qaim was the last sizeable territory held by IS in Iraq. Theoperation to retake the city and the surrounding area was launched last week. Soldiers, police, Sunni tribesmen and mostly Shia paramilitary fighters, some backed by Iran, took part in the assault. IS had designated the area on both sides of the border as its ""Euphrates Province"" and used it to transfer fighters, weapons and goods between Iraq and Syria. The cross-border province was also a symbol of the jihadists' intention to eradicate all the region's frontiers and lay to restthe 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, an emblem of the colonial division of the area resented by many Arabs. Security forces took al-Qaim swiftly from IS, the Iraqi government says Some 350,000 civilians in Syria's Deir al-Zour province have been forced to flee their homes during weeks of fighting. In Syria, the militant group is now confined to a few pockets in Deir al-Zour province. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Syrian government forces have been carrying out separate offensives there with the aim of taking control of Albu Kamal, a key crossing with Iraq. In some areas the US-backed SDF and Russia-backed Syrian army have taken up positions just a few kilometres apart. An SDF spokesman told the BBC they were still encountering some resistance with the militants using suicide cars and trucks, thermal missiles and mortars. In some towns and villages there was house-to-house fighting, Kino Gabriel said. IS has also suffered a series of defeats in recent months to Iraqi government forces, who are advancing along the Euphrates river on the other side of the border. There are about 1,500 IS fighters left in the area, the US-led coalition fighting IS says. IS has now been driven out of about 95% of the land the group once held in Iraq and more than 4.4 million Iraqis have been freed from its rule, according to the US-led coalition. This video can not be played US-backed forces may be celebrating, but IS has not been defeated The group has just ""months [remaining] at most as a proto-state"", the senior Royal Air Force (RAF) officer overseeing British airstrikes against IS in Iraq and Syria said on Friday. But Commodore Johnny Stringer told journalists in London that IS would ""almost certainly morph into an insurgent organisation"" trying to launch attacks in the two countries. Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent The success of the Syrian government forces inevitably raises the potential for clashes between them and US-backed, predominantly Kurdish units who hold a swathe of northern Syria. It is a powerful reminder that while the war against the IS ""caliphate"" is well on the way to being won, the situation on the ground in Syria is becoming ever more complex. With Iran eager to consolidate its influence, questions remain as to the Trump administration's future policy direction now IS is collapsing. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has consolidated his position and looks to squeeze opposition forces in the months ahead.

Patel held undisclosed meetings in Israel,"The International Development Secretary held undisclosed meetings in Israel without telling the Foreign Office while accompanied by an influential pro-Israeli Conservative campaigner, the BBC has learned. Priti Patel met the leader of one of Israel's main political parties and made visits to several organisations where official departmental business was reportedly discussed. According to one source, at least one of the meetings was held at the suggestion of the Israeli ambassador to London. In contrast, British diplomats in Israel were not informed about Ms Patel's plans. Ministers are by convention supposed to tell the Foreign Office when they are conducting official business overseas. Downing Street said Ms Patel was on a private holiday she had paid for herself, during which she took the opportunity to meet people. Ms Pateltold the Guardian,external: ""Boris [Johnson] knew about the visit. The point is that the Foreign Office did know about this, Boris knew about [the trip]. It is not on, it is not on at all. ""I went out there, I paid for it. And there is nothing else to this. It is quite extraordinary. It is for the Foreign Office to go away and explain themselves."" But Labour have called,externalfor an investigation to examine whether Ms Patel breached the ministerial code and rules on lobbying. The meetings took place over two days in August while Ms Patel was on holiday in Israel. No civil servants were present but Ms Patel was accompanied by Lord Polak, honorary president of Conservative Friends of Israel (CFI), an influential lobbying organisation that has access to wealthy party donors. Some ministers and MPs accused Ms Patel of trying to win favour with wealthy pro-Israeli Conservative donors who could fund a potential future leadership campaign. Others accused her of conducting her own ""freelance foreign policy"" on Israel. Ms Patel is a long-standing supporter of Israel and a former vice-chairman of CFI. Ministers also said there was a potential risk that the meetings could have broken the ministerial code of conduct which states that ""ministers must ensure that no conflict arises, or could reasonably be perceived to arise, between their public duties and their private interests, financial or otherwise"". Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu has been in London this week One minister said: ""This is outrageous. She is a Cabinet minister. She just cannot do this. This is about donors and influence."" One former minister said: ""What does it say to the rest of the Middle East if a senior Cabinet minister in charge of Britain's huge aid budget disappears for 48 hours from a family holiday in Israel and is under the wing of a pro-Israeli lobbyist?"" The revelations risk embarrassing the government while the Israeli Prime Minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, is in London to mark the centenary of the Balfour Declaration, when Britain first gave its support for a national home for the Jewish people. A senior Downing Street source denied Ms Patel had done anything wrong. And a source at the Department for International Development said it was a private holiday paid for by the Secretary of State herself. Foreign Office sources in London - and diplomatic sources in the region - confirmed that Ms Patel had not given them any warning of her visit. One minister said: ""Yes, we did not know about the trip. We were unsighted on it."" Another source said the British consulate in Jerusalem was ""blindsided"" and felt ""slightly bruised"". A third Foreign Office source said: ""We didn't know and would have expected to know, given the meetings she had."" Ms Patel took time out from her family holiday on 24 August to meet Yair Lapid, the leader of Israel's centrist Yesh Atid party, a former finance minister in Mr Netanyahu's coalition government. Mr Lapid tweeted a picture of the meeting, saying it was ""great to meet Priti Patel"" whom he described as ""a true friend of Israel."" Mr Lapid's spokesman confirmed that he had met Ms Patel but refused to say what they discussed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Patel was accompanied by the Tory peer, Lord Polak. He is now honorary president of Conservative Friends of Israel but for more than 25 years, he was the director of the lobby group. And in that role he had a huge influence on Conservative thinking on the Middle East, including writing speeches for Tory party leaders. Lord Polak told the BBC that he just happened to be on holiday at the same time as Ms Patel. ""We met up for one or two things,"" he said. ""It was the summer holidays. I just joined her for a couple of days, some drinks, some dinner, that kind of thing."" That included the meeting with Mr Lapid: ""He is just an old friend of mine, a personal friend. He is more a journalist than a politician. We just had coffee with him. It wasn't anything formal. It is all very innocent."" Conservative Friends of Israel regularly pays for MPs and peers to visit Israel. But Lord Polak said that Ms Patel paid for the holiday herself and the trip had nothing to do with CFI. The peer said he organised for Ms Patel to visit Israeli firms and charities creating technologies that could be interesting to a Secretary of State for Development. Ms Patel visited Beit Issie Shapiro (BIS), a leading Israeli disability charity and campaign group, where she reportedly discussed the possibility of her department forming a long-term partnership with the organisation.

Jean Judes, executive director of BIS, published a picture on Facebook of Ms Patel visiting her organisation. Mrs Judes wrote: ""As the director of the DFID - UK Department for International Development, Ms Patel expressed interest in a long-term relationship with Beit Issie Shapiro, harnessing Israeli innovation to advance assistive technology for the benefit of people with disabilities in underdeveloped countries. ""We look forward to a strong, fruitful partnership with the DFID to enhance the quality of life of people with disabilities worldwide."" Mrs Judes told the BBC that the Israeli embassy in London had been involved in setting up the visit: ""We reached out. ""We met with the Israeli ambassador in London and he said this is something we should bring to the attention of Priti Patel."" The Israeli embassy in London declined to respond to questions. Lord Polak said Ms Patel also visited Innovation: Africa, an Israeli not-for-profit organisation developing new solar and water technologies for remote African communities. The fear among some Tory MPs is that Ms Patel also used the trip to discuss reducing her department's support for Palestinian groups. The UK currently sends about Â£68m a year to support the Palestinian territories, most of it from DFID's budget. Some of the money is given directly to the Palestinian Authority, the rest through the local UN agency or individual groups. Critics claim that instead of just supporting Palestinian refugees and institutions, the money has also been used to pay salaries to Palestinians jailed for terrorism-related offences. Ms Patel has long been a critic of this funding. She tightened up the guidelines on Palestinian spending last year, focusing more on health and education, but one Foreign Office source said that she had recently tried to go further, presenting a paper to the prime minister and the foreign secretary for yet more restrictions on the funding. ""But they were not particularly impressed by her arguments,"" said one Foreign Office source. Another said: ""She has been trying this for some time. She has been pushing to get her hands on the PA aid budget and we have been pushing back."" Others suggested Ms Patel was getting close to CFI in preparation for a future leadership contest. One Whitehall source said: ""I have always understood it to be part of her leadership ambitions, if she has got people from CFI who are prepared to put money into her."" The BBC sent Ms Patel's office a list of questions concerning the visit to Israel which it declined to answer.

Spacey 'investigated by UK police',"Kevin Spacey is facing a number of sexual assault allegations Kevin Spacey is being investigated by UK police over an alleged sexual assault. The Sun newspaper said a man, aged 23 at the time, made a complaint,externalon Tuesday about the alleged incident in the London borough of Lambeth. The Metropolitan Police confirmed that they are investigating an alleged assault on a man from 2008. They would not confirm the allegation was made against House of Cards actor and double Oscar winner Spacey. Spacey said on Thursday that he is seeking treatment after facing allegations of sexual misconduct from a string of men. The Sun reported that a British actor claimed he woke up to find Spacey performing a sex act on him in 2008. The man is said to have run from the property after Spacey allegedly said: ""Don't tell anyone about this."" A spokesman for the Met said it had no record of any arrests having been made in connection with the investigation and police declined to comment on The Sun's report, which says the complainant had been interviewed by police. It has been claimed Kevin Spacey ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors while he was artistic director at the Old Vic It comes after a number of allegations, includingCNN reporting that Spacey made the set of Netflix's House of Cards into a ""toxic"" work environment through a pattern of sexual harassment,external. It said allegations were made by eight people who currently work on the show, or worked on it in the past, with one former employee alleging the actor sexually assaulted him. Netflix suspended production on House of Cardson 31 October followingallegations by Star Trek actor Anthony Rapp,external, who claimed Spacey tried to ""seduce"" him when he was 14. Spacey said he was ""beyond horrified"" to hear of the incident, which he does not remember. US filmmaker Tony Montana also claimed he was gropedby the actor in a Los Angeles bar in 2003. Montana said he was left with PTSD for six months after he claims Spacey ""forcefully"" grabbed his crotch. Incidents regarding Spacey are also alleged to have taken place in the UK while he was the artistic director at the Old Vic in London between 2004 and 2015. Mexican actor Roberto Cavazos, who acted in several plays at the theatre, claimed the star ""routinely preyed"" on young male actors. Earlier this week,the Old Vic set up a confidential complaints processfor anyone connected to the theatre to come forward. It said in a statement: ""We aim to foster a safe and supportive environment without prejudice, harassment or bullying of any sort, at any level.""

No 10 has insisted Andrea Leadsom did not call for Sir Michael Fallon to be sacked from the cabinet amid reports she complained about his conduct. The Sun,externalandDaily Mail,externalsaid the Commons leader complained about the ex-defence secretary making ""lewd"" remarks to her. Sir Michael, who quit office on Wednesday saying his general conduct fell short of expected standards, has ""categorically denied"" the allegations. Mrs Leadsom has led ministers' response to the Westminster misconduct claims. In a statement to Parliament on Monday, she said Commons procedures for handling complaints about MPs needed to be overhauled as women working in Parliament had a right to feel safe. Sir Michael became the first minister to resign since allegations of inappropriate behaviour by MPs from different parties first surfaced ten days ago.

Tax fraud case is closed - Mourinho,"This video can not be played Jose Mourinho: ""I paid, it's over"" Manchester United manager JosÃ© Mourinho has denied owing money to the Spanish state in a tax fraud case relating to his time in charge of Real Madrid. He had been accused of owing nearly â¬3.3m (Â£2.9m, $3.8m) in undeclared image rights revenue. After a brief hearing Mr Mourinho said he had paid everything he had been asked for and the case was now closed. However a court official said the Portuguese manager remained under official investigation. A judge will decide whether the case goes to trial. ""I left Spain in 2013 with the information and the conviction that my tax situation was perfectly legal,"" Mr Mourinho said after Friday's hearing. ""A couple of years later I was informed that an investigation had been opened and I was told that in order to regularise my situation I had to pay X amount of money. ""I did not answer, I did not argue. I paid and signed with the state that I am in compliance and the case is closed."" The hearing came two days before a Manchester United game against Chelsea. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? The Spanish authorities began the image rights case against Mr Mourinho in June. Mr Mourinho's representatives, Gestifute Media, said earlier that he had paid more than â¬26m in tax at an average rate of more than 41% while living in Spain from June 2010 until May 2013. In 2015, Gestifute said, he accepted a settlement agreement regarding previous years. Several leading footballers have also recently faced tax investigations in Spain. Argentines Lionel Messi, Javier Mascherano and Ãngel Di MarÃ­a have all beenpunished for tax evasionwhilea case against Real Madrid star Cristiano Ronaldo continues. He denies wrongdoing.

Killer Brady's ashes dispatched at sea,"Ian Brady died at Ashworth Hospital, a secure psychiatric unit in Maghull, Merseyside The ashes of Moors Murderer Ian Brady have been disposed of at sea in the middle of the night after a cremation last week, it has been revealed. The child killer,who died in May aged 79, was cremated without ceremony. It comes after a court ruling to ensure the disposal of his body did not cause ""offence and distress"" to his victims' families. Brady, along with Myra Hindley, tortured and murdered five children in the 1960s. She died in prison in 2002. The killer who showed no remorse Who were Ian Brady's victims? My letters from the Moors Murderer Brady's body was collected from Royal Liverpool Hospital's mortuary by a council official at about 21:00 BST on 25 October, documents show. Under police escort, the corpse was taken to Southport Crematorium where the cremation began at 22:00 BST, with no music or flowers allowed. Brady's ashes were then placed in a weighted biodegradable urn, driven to Liverpool Marina and dispatched at sea at 02:30 BST. Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey, Edward Evans, John Kilbride and Pauline Reade were killed in the Moors Murders It was reported that Brady wished to have his remains burnt and ashes scattered in Glasgow, where he grew up. But the city's council said it wouldrefuse any requestfor Brady to be cremated in the area. There were also concerns his remains would be scattered on Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester - where the pair buried at least three of their victims. Brady's executor Robin Makin had said there was ""no likelihood"" of this happening, but the High Court ruled in October that the disposal of the body should be taken out of his hands. The killer died at Ashworth High Security Hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, having been held there since 1985. He and partner Hindley were convicted of luring children and teenagers to their deaths, with most of their victims buried on Saddleworth Moor, Oldham. He was jailed in 1966 for murdering John Kilbride, aged 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17. In 1985, he also admitted killing Pauline Reade, 16, and 12-year-old Keith Bennett, whose body is believed to be on the moor but has never been found. Despite pleas from Keith's mother Winnie Johnson, who died in 2012, Brady did not reveal where her son was buried. Saddleworth Moor has been the scene of several searches for the remains of Brady's victims John Kilbride's brother Terry said the victims' families knew the plans for Brady's remains in advance. ""The urn was made of salt and it disintegrated after about 10 or 15 minutes of being in the water,"" he said. ""I was originally under the impression he was just going to be burnt and put in the grounds of a prison but being put in the sea is the next best thing. ""This was the only way to really put the families at ease and the public as well."" Brady's ashes were disposed of from a boat that set out from Liverpool Marina Mr Kilbride described Brady as ""clever and manipulative"", saying he ""tormented"" families from his prison cell. ""[When] he always seemed to come up on TV or in the papers, it was always around an anniversary or Christmas. ""He actually died on John's birthday, May 15. You can imagine how that feels,"" he added. An inquest into Brady's death heard he died of natural causes. Margaret Carney, chief executive of Sefton Council, said: ""The High Court ordered us to cremate the remains of Ian Brady because he died within the Sefton borough boundary."" She said it took place outside normal operating hours and no other services at the crematorium were affected. ""The coffin did not enter any public area and was cremated in a separate standby cremator which was professionally cleaned afterwards."" In a statement, Tameside and Oldham councils said: ""We are pleased that this matter is now concluded and we are grateful for the support and professionalism shown... to ensure Ian Stewart-Brady's body and remains were disposed of expediently at sea in a manner compatible with the public interest and those of the victim's relatives."" Police kept Moors victim remains 30 years No ceremony for Brady funeral, judge rules Moors Murderer Ian Brady dies Obituary: Ian Brady Rookie cop who raced to 'tragic' 999 incident handed final written warning for ignoring driving instructions 'We're not going back - we're not taking that chance' Disruption on M66 northbound after 'police incident' Man sentenced as GMP secures biggest penalty in Bury domestic violence pilot scheme Why there are 45-minute delays and lane closures on A56 Stop-smoking service urges people to quit the habit in 2025 At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Why does Trump want Greenland and what do its people think?

IS loses territory in Syria and Iraq,"This video can not be played 'We would rather be killed by IS than be here' - the humanitarian crisis unfolding in Syria So-called Islamic State (IS) has lost control of two of its last remaining strongholds in Syria and Iraq. Early on Friday Syria's army announced it had taken Deir al-Zour. Later in the day the Iraqi prime minister said al-Qaim, across the border, had been recaptured by government forces. The town was taken ""in record time"", PM Haider al-Abadi said. Iraqi forces say they have also seized the last border post between Iraq and Syria that was held by IS. Last month,a US-backed Syrian alliance took control of Raqqa in Syria, the former capital of Islamic State's self-styled ""caliphate"". In July, Mosul - Iraq's second-largest city - was taken from IS after months of fighting. The territorial ambitions of IS are now all but destroyed although its ideology remains powerful, says the BBC's Arab Affairs Editor Sebastian Usher. What should happen to IS fighters in Syria and Iraq? The rapid rise and fall of 'Islamic State' IS had held most of Deir al-Zour since 2014. It was important because of its proximity to the border with Iraq. While the Syrian army said it had been re-captured, other reports said government forces and their allies were clearing the last pockets of resistance from IS in the city. Al-Qaim was the last sizeable territory held by IS in Iraq. Theoperation to retake the city and the surrounding area was launched last week. Soldiers, police, Sunni tribesmen and mostly Shia paramilitary fighters, some backed by Iran, took part in the assault. IS had designated the area on both sides of the border as its ""Euphrates Province"" and used it to transfer fighters, weapons and goods between Iraq and Syria. The cross-border province was also a symbol of the jihadists' intention to eradicate all the region's frontiers and lay to restthe 1916 Sykes-Picot agreement, an emblem of the colonial division of the area resented by many Arabs. Security forces took al-Qaim swiftly from IS, the Iraqi government says Some 350,000 civilians in Syria's Deir al-Zour province have been forced to flee their homes during weeks of fighting. In Syria, the militant group is now confined to a few pockets in Deir al-Zour province. The Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and Syrian government forces have been carrying out separate offensives there with the aim of taking control of Albu Kamal, a key crossing with Iraq. In some areas the US-backed SDF and Russia-backed Syrian army have taken up positions just a few kilometres apart. An SDF spokesman told the BBC they were still encountering some resistance with the militants using suicide cars and trucks, thermal missiles and mortars. In some towns and villages there was house-to-house fighting, Kino Gabriel said. IS has also suffered a series of defeats in recent months to Iraqi government forces, who are advancing along the Euphrates river on the other side of the border. There are about 1,500 IS fighters left in the area, the US-led coalition fighting IS says. IS has now been driven out of about 95% of the land the group once held in Iraq and more than 4.4 million Iraqis have been freed from its rule, according to the US-led coalition. This video can not be played US-backed forces may be celebrating, but IS has not been defeated The group has just ""months [remaining] at most as a proto-state"", the senior Royal Air Force (RAF) officer overseeing British airstrikes against IS in Iraq and Syria said on Friday. But Commodore Johnny Stringer told journalists in London that IS would ""almost certainly morph into an insurgent organisation"" trying to launch attacks in the two countries. Jonathan Marcus, BBC diplomatic correspondent The success of the Syrian government forces inevitably raises the potential for clashes between them and US-backed, predominantly Kurdish units who hold a swathe of northern Syria. It is a powerful reminder that while the war against the IS ""caliphate"" is well on the way to being won, the situation on the ground in Syria is becoming ever more complex. With Iran eager to consolidate its influence, questions remain as to the Trump administration's future policy direction now IS is collapsing. Syrian President Bashar al-Assad has consolidated his position and looks to squeeze opposition forces in the months ahead.

Toyah Willcox: Still punk and proud,"Toyah Willcox is known for her chart hits and acting roles After playing a member of the anarchic and murderous girl gang in the 1978 punk film Jubilee, actress and singer Toyah Willcox is revisiting the story in its first stage version. Is she still punk, 40 years on? ""I can't live in a world of dullards,"" Toyah says. ""So I think on that level, I'm definitely punk."" Toyah, who forged an acting career while also making her name as a pop star, is still rebelling against the expectations of society - in her own way. ""For me, it's non-conformist,"" she says. ""I'm just not interested in the norm. The only example I can give you is I can't go to a hairdresser and talk about holidays. I just don't live in that world. It's not me."" Being punk means something different in 2017 compared with 1977. But the world's a different place now, and Toyah is almost 60. As a 19-year-old, she played the orange-haired pyromaniac Mad in the original Jubilee. She's not returning to that role on stage - this time, she's playing Queen Elizabeth I, who travels forward 400 years to find her country falling apart. Toyah in rehearsals for Jubilee at the Royal Exchange theatre In the film, the semi-fictional Britain the queen visited was terrorised by punks who had overthrown the establishment and who revelled in murder and mayhem. It has been brought up to date for the Royal Exchange theatre in Manchester, with the mob now made up of gloriously outrageous modern youths who are at various points on the gender spectrum. While the world may be a different place, as another generation simmers with anger and resentment at the hand they've been dealt by the establishment, some things have stayed the same. In the 70s, Toyah was pushing against being ""gender specific, which I certainly wasn't back then,"" she recalls. ""I had no interest in people telling me to be feminine, to be ladylike, to wear dresses - it just made me rebel completely. ""But in comparison to today, it was quite an innocent rebellion. Punk 40 years ago was rebelling against conservatism - well, wham, bam, here we are again."" Toyah on Top of the Pops in 1981 During rehearsals, Toyah says she's been given a steep lesson by her fellow cast members in what it's like to be young today. She's decided things are more difficult and complicated in many ways. ""If I was given the choice to be 20 now, I would say, no, I'm happy with where I am. And having experienced that incredible revolution, it felt like a really successful participating revolution,"" she says. ""People today are fighting for their space on social media all the time. I just find social media such a robotic experience, whereas punk was right in your face."" Society is more fractured, too, meaning it's harder for cultural movements like punk to take hold. Whatever else it was responsible for, punk gave artists like Toyah a living through music and acting. ""There were people who wanted to come and see us perform in their 10s of thousands,"" she says. ""We didn't starve. ""Whereas I'm seeing for the first time in this generation the potential for well-educated people to starve, and my eyes are wide open about this and I'm finding it very frightening."" Director Derek Jarman gave up his fee so Toyah could be in the film Toyah got the role in the original Jubilee after being introduced to director Derek Jarman by Chariots of Fire actor Ian Charleson, with whom she had acted at the National Theatre. Going to Jarman's flat in Earls Court for the first time was an eye-opening experience. ""A naked man called Yves, his French boyfriend, answered the door,"" she recalls. ""Yves was the most extraordinarily languid, relaxed human being, who would drape himself over furniture completely naked. Two more naked men were in the kitchen cooking. ""Derek ushered us into a lounge and we sat on the sofa and we had tea and cake."" Soon after offering her the role of Mad, Jarman faced funding problems and cut her character to save money. But he later reinstated her, instead deciding not to pay himself. ""So he gave up his fee,"" Toyah explains. ""He said, 'I could just tell I'd removed the earth from under your feet.' That was it. We were in love."" The film caused controversy when it came out in 1978 - mainly among punks themselves. Toyah also narrated the opening and closing lines of Teletubbies It prompted Vivienne Westwood to write an open letter to Jarman on a T-shirt, describing it as ""the most boring and therefore disgusting film I had ever seen"". Myra Hindley cut from theatre script Derek Jarman: Vision, charm and outrage When Jubilee came to be shown on Channel 4 eight years later, there was outrage that it was being beamed into millions of homes. The outraged included Winston Churchill's grandson, also called Winston and also an MP, who wrote to The Times to complain about this ""corrosively vicious trash"". Now, the stage version has its own controversy. Lines describing Moors Murderer Myra Hindley as ""a true artist"" and a ""hero"" - which were in the film - have been cut from the theatre script for fear of offending the audience in Manchester, where Hindley and Ian Brady preyed on children. Rose Wardlaw plays Crabs in the new version of Jubilee The original film set out to shock and offend, as did many punks themselves. But Toyah says they came to realise they had taken some things too far. ""This is what punk was about at this time - it was about shocking,"" she says. ""And I think as punk grew, it intellectually grew as well, and it examined its roots. ""You can find pictures anywhere of punks in swastikas. We very quickly as a unified group policed that, because we knew the history was wrong."" With much of the film's sex and violence intact, the play is still hoping to shock - and to prove that punk lives on in 2017. Jubilee runs at the Royal Exchange until 18 November and then at the Lyric, Hammersmith, from 15 February to 10 March 2018.

Game won't 'shy away' from WW2 history,"Bosses of the new Call of Duty game say they ""touch on some really dark subject matter"" in the new release. The makers say creating a title based on a conflict that claimed about 60 million lives has been a challenge. It's been 10 years since the Call of Duty franchise based a game during World War Two. ""In no way do you want to glorify violence, but at the same time you can't ignore it,"" says Sledgehammer Games co-founder Michael Condrey. ""We spent a lot of time working on the right balance."" After a lukewarm reaction to last year's entry in the series, Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare, fans have been excited by a return to a historical setting ""When you talk about Nazi Germany and the atrocities committed by Hitler's regime, how do you honour the cause? ""How do you respect the loss of life that happened?"" The answer, the team decided, was detailed research and a decision not to shy away from what was happening. To do that historian Marty Morgan, who's worked on Band of Brothers, was asked to help advise the team. Newsbeat played a preview of the game at the E3 gaming convention over the summer. ""It would be insincere not to touch on what was really happening,"" Michael explains. ""From the politics at the time, segregation among the allies, the role of women, to the Holocaust. ""By turning away from them we would not have brought the right level of awareness or be able to honour what was really happening. ""We saw a chance to tell a story that hadn't been told in video games in almost a decade. It's the most profound and personal subject matter we've ever touched on."" It's particularly personal for Glen Schofield, another co-founder of Sledgehammer games, whose grandfather fought in WW2. ""He had a Purple Heart and Bronze Star,"" he tells Newsbeat. ""My father would tell his stories, and my dad died as we were making the game - so we named the main character after him. ""So for us getting the details right is important. We want people to walk away entertained and learn something at the same time."" That's something Michael agrees with. ""This is more important now than ever,"" he believes. ""Having this platform, which is entertainment but also has a chance to tell this story to millions and millions of people, is very rewarding.""

Reality Check: Are protesters right on South Africa farm murders?,"""Genoeg is genoeg."" Enough is enough. That was the message on Monday, as (mostly white)activists carried crosses and blocked roads to demand better protection for South Africa's farms, after they were targeted in a spate of murders. The South African Police Service has argued thatthe majority of attackers are motivated purely by a desire to rob farmers,,externalbut the country's Institute of Race Relations has warnedthere may be a racial element to some of the attacks.,external There's a sense in some quarters that white farmers are being targeted in particular. Many have claimed in recent weeks that South Africa's farmers are more likely to be murdered than the average South African. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Neither of the claims above is supported by reliable data. So what does the evidence say? According to the best available statistics, farm murders are at their highest level since 2010-11. South Africa's Police Service says 74 people were murdered on farms between April 2016 and March 2017, up from 58 in the previous year. That's broadly in line with figures collected by the Transvaal Agricultural Union (TAU). They rely on media reports, social media posts and tip-offs from their members, which means they don't pick up every murder or attack that takes place. They counted 64 murders on farms in 2015, 71 in 2016, and 68 in the first nine months of 2017 alone. It is worth noting that both the police and the TAU are counting murdered farmers, farm workers and visitors to farms - irrespective of race. But a rise in the number of farm murders doesn't tell us anything about whether farmers are more at risk than average South African. The TAU says most farm murder victims are white. The Police don't record farm murders by race. To do that, we need to calculate the murder rate - the chance of being murdered. It's easy enough to tell you what the average is for South Africa. There were 19,016 murders in South Africa,externalin 2016-17, according to the police. According to Statistics South Africa's mid-year estimate for 2016,there were 55,908,900 people in South Africa.,external That's 34 murders for every 100,000 people. Are farmers at greater risk than this national average? The truth is, we don't know. We can't calculate a meaningful murder rate for farmers, because we don't know how many there are. Do we include all 810,000 people employed in agriculture? That gives a farm murder rate of 9.1 per 100,000 - much lower than the South African average. Or, do we restrict ourselves to the 32,375 commercial farmers counted in the country's last agricultural census in 2007? That's what AfriForum, a group that campaigns for the interests of Afrikaners in South Africa, appears to have done. It has estimated a farm murder rate of 156 per 100,000 that has been widely quoted in recent days. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

First, take the 50 murdered farmers counted by the TAU in 2016 (which excludes murders of family members, employees and visitors). Then, divide by 32,000 - an estimate of the total number of farmers, based on the 2007 figure. There are problems with this approach. First, the data is very old, so the number of farmers may be different now. Second, to exclude murdered family members, employees, and visitors to the farm from such an analysis misses part of the picture of what is happening on South African farms - but we don't know how many of those people there are. Third, the 2007 census did not include small, non-commercial farms - but some of the murders counted in the figures did take place on smaller farms. By leaving them out, the murder rate comes out higher than it should. This also helps explain why it's impossible to say whether white farmers are more at risk than black farmers - or more at risk than the population at large. We simply don't know what proportion of people on South Africa's farms is white. The closest we get isthe 2016 Community Survey,externalof agricultural households. Of the nearly 200,000 households whose agricultural activity takes place on farmland, about 54,000 have a white person at the head of the household. The problem is, we don't know how many people are in each household or how many of the households are racially mixed. So we don't know how many white people there are on South Africa's farms. And that means we can't work out how likely those white people are to be murdered. We could try and guesstimate, by making various assumptions about how many farmers there are now, how many are white and how many people live on their farms. South Africa's Institute of Race Relations has attempted to do so here,external. But as they explain in their analysis, small changes to those assumptions can make huge differences to the estimated murder rate. On some sets of assumptions, the farm murder rate is no higher than the national average. Fellow fact-checkers Africa Check discuss further pitfalls here.,external In short - we have no clear idea about the murder rate on South African farms. And because of that, the claim being made by protesters about farmers being more likely to be murdered is not supported by reliable data.

What's it like being a Childline volunteer?,"Marnie works four hours a week as a counsellor ""It's a way to give something back, to feel in that moment that you're making a difference, you're there to listen to children, you're there to help them."" For Marnie, 27, giving up four hours a week to volunteer as a Childline counsellor is a privilege. She says knowing a child trusts her enough to tell her their story is overwhelming. Childline is urging more people across the UK to volunteer. While it has about 1,400 active volunteers, the charity says 400 more would mean they could answer nearly every child that makes contact. Currently, the helpline can answer only three out of every four calls or contacts. Those who can't be counselled immediately are asked to wait in a queue or call or email back at a less busy time - unless their situation is very serious. Marnie has been volunteering as a counsellor for a year and says the experience has helped her learn to listen. ""The art of listening to people has been good,"" she says. ""We all think we can listen to others and someone telling you about their day or about things that are going on, but I think there's a value in the counselling model and the training you get. ""It really helps you to learn how to listen and pause and let others speak a little bit more than they might have done if you hadn't done that. Childline caller: 'I felt so low, I couldn't see a way out' Thousands of children feeling 'lonely', says Childline ""Also, I think, just generally being able to help people reach decisions by themselves - we all have a tendency to think that we can create solutions for others, but actually quite often it's up to everyone to make their decisions in their life - you can help people do that by thinking through all of their options."" Childline volunteers need to complete 44 hours of initial training and mentoring over a period of a few weeks. They are then asked to commit to one four-and-a-quarter hour counselling shift at the same time each week for a minimum of one year. They must also attend regular workshops and debriefs. Before and after every session, volunteers attend a briefing and debriefing with other volunteers and a supervisor, giving them a chance to talk through the shift and any issues it brought up for them. The most popular time for children to contact Childline for counselling is between 20:00 and 21:00 This year, half of counselling sessions were between 18:00 and midnight The most popular day for counselling is Monday In 2016-17, 71% of  counselling sessions were online, compared with 29% over the phone The charity conducted 295,202 counselling sessions in total last year - 13,746 of these were about anxiety There are 12 Childline bases across the UK, in Aberdeen, Belfast, Birmingham, Cardiff, Foyle, Glasgow, Leeds, Liverpool, London, Manchester, Nottingham and Prestatyn. ""It's not one heavy call after the other - there's lots of experiences out there,"" says Marnie. ""It's easy to forget all the different things that are going on when you're growing up - it can be everything from problems at school, with homework or exams, things like bullying or problems with friends, things in your family and then also dealing with different emotions or pressures in terms of mental health and things like that. ""There are calls about abuse - physical, sexual and emotional abuse as well. We need to be alert to different levels of risk and things like that."" Childline volunteer Michael, 54, says social media is putting young people under a lot of pressure. ""The impact of bullying particularly with social media is relentless,"" he says. Michael says family breakdown is often an issue ""In my day, there was no social media and bullying stopped at the school gate and you could go home and be safe - whereas now, young people go home and open their phones and laptops and it's still there on Facebook or Instagram. ""There's pressure from school and to pass all these exams. There's this pressure to achieve and to be perfect and it's really competitive - for many young people it can be too much."" Michael says family issues, such as adult relationship breakdown, often prompt a lot of contacts to Childline. ""There are lots of pressures within families because many parents are struggling,"" he says. ""There could be breakdowns in relationships, parents getting divorced and different families moving into the home - that can make young people feel isolated.  They may feel isolated within their family unit."" Michael says you find ways to cope with the emotional side of the work. ""With every contact, there's always positives to take out, like the fact that the young person has had the strength to make that call,"" he says. ""There's plenty of support from your peers but also from the supervisors that run the shifts and there's also a debrief at the end of the shift. ""Then, it's about self-care - in order to support others you have to be in a good place yourself and make sure you look after yourself physically and mentally. ""The way I look after myself is I leave it here. I do the best I can for the young people, I follow all the guidelines, but I leave it here. ""When I go home I keep busy, but I know I've done the best I can while I've been here."" Marnie says: ""It can be difficult hearing some of the things that children are telling us - but we've got so much support in the room, we're never taking that call on our own, there's always a supervisor there. ""If you have a particularly heavy call... then you'll have a chat with one of the supervisors immediately afterwards to talk through what you've heard, what your reaction to that is, what feelings you're left with and then, from having that chat, you're ready to go back into the counselling room."" Despite having to deal with some tough calls emotionally, Michael and Marnie would definitely recommend volunteering. ""It's incredibly rewarding - I could have had a difficult day at work, travelled 40 miles to get to base, and then do my four-and-a-quarter hour shift,"" says Michael. ""But by the end of that shift, I'd feel really good about the way we'd supported the young people that had come through. I'd feel quite humble and proud."" Marnie says: ""The sense of privilege that you get from having a child trust you enough to tell their story - it's just such an overwhelming feeling that they want to share their story with you, and at the end of it, they thank you for being there to listen to them. ""And in that moment you feel like you helped them just even to take that first step to getting support or that first step to asking for help or understanding their own feelings - it is just such an overwhelming feeling that you're left with.""

"Old scams, new tricks as fraudsters adapt","Fraudsters are using junk mail in new and more sophisticated ways The organisation at the frontline of UK consumer protection says it is seeing a pattern of ""old scams, new tricks"". National Trading Standards (NTS) said that while online crime was a growing problem, time-honoured fraud methods would not disappear any time soon. It said many people were still hounded by cold callers, scam mail and doorstep criminals. Criminals were also using smart TVs and voice-activated home devices to steal data, its Consumer Harm Report warned. NTS, which was set up by the government in 2012, said 2016-17 had been a record-breaking year, with 104 criminal convictions. However, it said criminals were using new tactics to avoid detection, such as mail arriving via third-party countries and the use of blank envelopes, so that people had to open them to find out what they contained. In its annual report, it listed the potential emerging threats to consumers over the coming year, including: Continued manipulation of online ticket retail sites by scammers and organised criminals The growth of social media as a selling platform, putting consumers at risk of intellectual property crime and product safety issues The risk posed by connected devices such as smart TVs and home assistants, which may leave consumers open to data theft Increasing sophistication of doorstep criminals who use websites, social media and fake reviews and are increasingly part of larger organised crime groups. ""An evolving criminal landscape does not mean the more traditional scams will disappear,"" it said. ""Instead, National Trading Standards is seeing a trend of criminals diversifying and adapting their current schemes, evidenced in mass marketing mail scams. ""Additionally, more scams are originating abroad, with criminals concealing the payments they're receiving from their victims through payment processing companies,"" it said. But it said its actions had prevented nearly Â£127m in losses to consumers and businesses during the year. Lord Toby Harris, who chairs the NTS, said: ""Our teams are operating in an ever-evolving criminal environment. Consumer protection bodies are facing changing and challenging times."" He also praised the efforts of the public, who were ""pivotal"" in reporting crimes and supporting the NTS's work. ""So together, we continue to work to disrupt, investigate, prosecute and keep people safe."" Do not buy fire-risk fridges, says Which?

Mourinho in court in Spain for tax fraud,"This video can not be played Jose Mourinho: ""I paid, it's over"" Manchester United manager JosÃ© Mourinho has denied owing money to the Spanish state in a tax fraud case relating to his time in charge of Real Madrid. He had been accused of owing nearly â¬3.3m (Â£2.9m, $3.8m) in undeclared image rights revenue. After a brief hearing Mr Mourinho said he had paid everything he had been asked for and the case was now closed. However a court official said the Portuguese manager remained under official investigation. A judge will decide whether the case goes to trial. ""I left Spain in 2013 with the information and the conviction that my tax situation was perfectly legal,"" Mr Mourinho said after Friday's hearing. ""A couple of years later I was informed that an investigation had been opened and I was told that in order to regularise my situation I had to pay X amount of money. ""I did not answer, I did not argue. I paid and signed with the state that I am in compliance and the case is closed."" The hearing came two days before a Manchester United game against Chelsea. Why are Spanish football stars in legal trouble? The Spanish authorities began the image rights case against Mr Mourinho in June. Mr Mourinho's representatives, Gestifute Media, said earlier that he had paid more than â¬26m in tax at an average rate of more than 41% while living in Spain from June 2010 until May 2013. In 2015, Gestifute said, he accepted a settlement agreement regarding previous years. Several leading footballers have also recently faced tax investigations in Spain.

May's 'Spider Man' and MP scandals,"Gavin Williamson has replaced Sir Michael Fallon as defence secretary The controversial appointment of Gavin Williamson as the new defence secretary is the main story for most of Friday's newspapers. ""Tory anger at May reshuffle"" is the headlinefor the i,external, whilstthe Times,externalhas: ""May under fire as key ally gets defence job"". The Independent website,externalsays much of the dismay is focused on the fact that Mr Williamson has no experience in connection with the military, let alone running a major government department, whilstthe Daily Telegraph,externalsays Theresa May overlooked several ministers with far more experience. According tothe Financial Times,external, anger at Mr Williamson stems partly from the belief that as Chief Whip, he helped orchestrate the departure of his predecessor, Sir Michael Fallon, and then took advantage of it. The man portrayed as Sir Michael's assassin -the i says,external- had looked at the vacancy, interviewed himself and declared himself up to the task. The Daily Telegraph,externalsays some MPs suggest that the prime minister has brought one of her closest allies into the Cabinet so that he will be in a position to succeed her after Brexit. The Spectator website,externalsays that even those who consider themselves his friends feel that moving a man with no departmental experience to one of the most senior jobs in government says much more about Mrs May's weakness as a leader than it does about Mr Williamson's suitability for the role. The Sun,externalquotes a ""livid"" minister as saying: ""She is so weak she has let Gavin Williamson appoint himself defence secretary. This is appalling. She has to go."" The Daily Mail,externalandthe Sun,externallead with a claim that Sir Michael Fallon was forced to resign after the Leader of the Commons, Andrea Leadsom, complained that he used vile language towards her at a meeting six years ago. According to the Sun, she had told him she had cold hands, to which he responded: ""I know where you can put them to warm them up."" A source close to Sir Michael tells the paper he may have said something that Mrs Leadsom was offended by, but he categorically denies saying something as appalling as has been suggested. Mrs Leadsom has declined to comment. The news that the Home Office has lost track of 56,000 foreign nationals - including convicted criminals and illegal immigrants - sparks incredulity. The Home Office has come under fire in some of Friday's papers It is the lead for theDaily Express,external, which describes the affair as another shambolic mess from the people who are supposed to be keeping this country safe. The Sun,externalsays it is 11 years since the Labour Home Secretary, John Reid, declared the Home Office's immigration systems not fit for purpose - and it's clear nothing has changed. The first rise in interest rates in more than a decade makes the lead forthe Financial Times,external.  But the paper suggests that fewer households will be immediately affected than was the case with previous rate increases. It says fewer people now own their homes and those that do are more likely to own outright.  Three-fifths of mortgages are now fixed rate rather than variable, it adds. Butthe Daily Mail,externalaccuses the banks of ""hammering"" borrowers and doing nothing for ""long-suffering"" savers.

Mourinho to face Spain tax fraud charges,"This video can not be played Jose Mourinho: ""I paid, it's over"" Manchester United manager JosÃ© Mourinho has denied owing money to the Spanish state in a tax fraud case relating to his time in charge of Real Madrid. He had been accused of owing nearly â¬3.3m (Â£2.9m, $3.8m) in undeclared image rights revenue. After a brief hearing Mr Mourinho said he had paid everything he had been asked for and the case was now closed. However a court official said the Portuguese manager remained under official investigation. A judge will decide whether the case goes to trial. ""I left Spain in 2013 with the information and the conviction that my tax situation was perfectly legal,"" Mr Mourinho said after Friday's hearing. ""A couple of years later I was informed that an investigation had been opened and I was told that in order to regularise my situation I had to pay X amount of money.

Killer Brady's ashes scattered at sea,"Ian Brady died at Ashworth Hospital, a secure psychiatric unit in Maghull, Merseyside The ashes of Moors Murderer Ian Brady have been disposed of at sea in the middle of the night after a cremation last week, it has been revealed. The child killer,who died in May aged 79, was cremated without ceremony. It comes after a court ruling to ensure the disposal of his body did not cause ""offence and distress"" to his victims' families. Brady, along with Myra Hindley, tortured and murdered five children in the 1960s. She died in prison in 2002. The killer who showed no remorse Who were Ian Brady's victims? My letters from the Moors Murderer Brady's body was collected from Royal Liverpool Hospital's mortuary by a council official at about 21:00 BST on 25 October, documents show. Under police escort, the corpse was taken to Southport Crematorium where the cremation began at 22:00 BST, with no music or flowers allowed. Brady's ashes were then placed in a weighted biodegradable urn, driven to Liverpool Marina and dispatched at sea at 02:30 BST. Keith Bennett, Lesley Ann Downey, Edward Evans, John Kilbride and Pauline Reade were killed in the Moors Murders It was reported that Brady wished to have his remains burnt and ashes scattered in Glasgow, where he grew up. But the city's council said it wouldrefuse any requestfor Brady to be cremated in the area. There were also concerns his remains would be scattered on Saddleworth Moor in Greater Manchester - where the pair buried at least three of their victims. Brady's executor Robin Makin had said there was ""no likelihood"" of this happening, but the High Court ruled in October that the disposal of the body should be taken out of his hands. The killer died at Ashworth High Security Hospital in Maghull, Merseyside, having been held there since 1985. He and partner Hindley were convicted of luring children and teenagers to their deaths, with most of their victims buried on Saddleworth Moor, Oldham. He was jailed in 1966 for murdering John Kilbride, aged 12, Lesley Ann Downey, 10, and Edward Evans, 17. In 1985, he also admitted killing Pauline Reade, 16, and 12-year-old Keith Bennett, whose body is believed to be on the moor but has never been found. Despite pleas from Keith's mother Winnie Johnson, who died in 2012, Brady did not reveal where her son was buried. Saddleworth Moor has been the scene of several searches for the remains of Brady's victims John Kilbride's brother Terry said the victims' families knew the plans for Brady's remains in advance. ""The urn was made of salt and it disintegrated after about 10 or 15 minutes of being in the water,"" he said. ""I was originally under the impression he was just going to be burnt and put in the grounds of a prison but being put in the sea is the next best thing. ""This was the only way to really put the families at ease and the public as well."" Brady's ashes were disposed of from a boat that set out from Liverpool Marina Mr Kilbride described Brady as ""clever and manipulative"", saying he ""tormented"" families from his prison cell. ""[When] he always seemed to come up on TV or in the papers, it was always around an anniversary or Christmas. ""He actually died on John's birthday, May 15. You can imagine how that feels,"" he added. An inquest into Brady's death heard he died of natural causes. Margaret Carney, chief executive of Sefton Council, said: ""The High Court ordered us to cremate the remains of Ian Brady because he died within the Sefton borough boundary."" She said it took place outside normal operating hours and no other services at the crematorium were affected. ""The coffin did not enter any public area and was cremated in a separate standby cremator which was professionally cleaned afterwards."" In a statement, Tameside and Oldham councils said: ""We are pleased that this matter is now concluded and we are grateful for the support and professionalism shown... to ensure Ian Stewart-Brady's body and remains were disposed of expediently at sea in a manner compatible with the public interest and those of the victim's relatives.""

Gut bacteria 'boost' cancer therapy,"Bacteria living in the murky depths of the digestive system seem to influence whether tumours shrink during cancer therapy, say French and US researchers. They tested the microbiome - the collection of microscopic species that live in us - in cancer patients. Two studies, in the journal Science, linked specific species and the overall diversity of the microbiome to the effectiveness of immunotherapy drugs. Experts said the results were fascinating and held a lot of promise. Our bodies are home to trillions of micro-organisms and the relationship between ""us"" and ""them"" goes far beyond infectious diseases. The microbiome is involved in digestion, protection from infection and regulating the immune system. Gut bugs 'help prevent allergies' Parkinson's disease 'may start in gut' Both studies were on patients receiving immunotherapy, which boosts the body's own defences to fight tumours. It does not work in every patient, but in some cases it can clear even terminal cancer. One study, at the Gustave Roussy Cancer Campus in Paris, looked at 249 patients with lung or kidney cancer. They showed those who had taken antibiotics, such as for dental infection, damaged their microbiome andwere more likely to see tumours grow,externalwhile on immunotherapy. One species of bacteria in particular,Akkermansia muciniphila, was in 69% of patients that did respond compared with just a third of those who did not. Boosting levels ofA. muciniphilain mice seemed to also boost their response to immunotherapy. Meanwhile, at the University of Texas MD Anderson Cancer Center, 112 patients with advanced melanomahad their microbiome analysed,external. Those that responded to therapy tended to have a richer, more diverse microbiome than those that did not. And they had different bacteria too. High levels ofFaecalibacteriumandClostridialesappeared to be beneficial, whileBacteroidalesspecies were bad news in the study. Tissues samples showed there were more cancer-killing immune cells in the tumour of people with the beneficial bacteria. The team then performed a trans-poo-sion, a transplant of faecal matter, from people to mice with melanoma. Mice given bacteria from patients with the ""good"" mix of bacteria had slower-growing tumours than mice given ""bad"" bacteria. Dr Jennifer Wargo, from Texas, told the BBC: ""If you disrupt a patient's microbiome you may impair their ability to respond to cancer treatment."" She is planning clinical trials aimed at altering the microbiome in tandem with cancer treatment. She said: ""Our hypothesis is if we change to a more favourable microbiome, you just may be able to make patients respond better. ""The microbiome is game-changing, not just cancer but for overall health, it's definitely going to be a major player."" Mark Fielder, president of the Society for Applied Microbiology and professor of medical biology at Kingston University, said the study showed the importance of understanding the micro-organisms that call our bodies home. He told the BBC: ""It's really interesting and holds a lot of promise, we need to do more work but there are exciting glimmers here in treating some difficult diseases. ""Some claim the microbiome is the answer to everything, I don't think that's the case. ""But once we understand more, it could be that microbiome manipulation is important in changing people's health."" Dr Emma Smith from Cancer Research UK, said: ""It's fascinating. ""One of the big challenges for using immunotherapies to treat cancer is understanding which patients will respond, and this research is a step towards helping doctors to identify these people.""

News Daily: Labour suspends MP and Fallon denies 'lewd' remarks,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: Allegations of inappropriate behaviour at Westminster continue.Labour has suspended MP Kelvin Hopkinsafter party activist Ava Etemadzadeh claimed he had sexually harassed her. She told the BBC she had first complained about the incident two years ago. Labour has not given any details about the claim against Mr Hopkins, MP for Luton North since 1997, but said it took all such allegations ""extremely seriously"". Mr Hopkins has not yet commented to the BBC. Meanwhile, Conservative MP Sir Michael Fallon has ""categorically""denied making ""lewd"" remarks to House of Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom.The Sun and Daily Mail report that she complained to Number 10 about his behaviour, said to have happened between 2010 and 2012, when neither was in the cabinet. The allegation comes a day after Sir Michael resigned as defence secretary, saying his conduct had in the past ""fallen below"" today's expected standards. Thousands of people in Catalonia have protestedagainst the Spanish high court's decision to detain eight leaders of the region's independence movement. They are accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Meanwhile, a European Arrest Warrant has been issued for for ousted Catalan President Carles Puigdemont, who is in Belgium.

Sympathy for China mum's 'mercy killing',"""Although I didn't want to do this, I am guilty"" - Ms. Huang confesses in court The case of an elderly woman found guilty of killing her disabled son has provoked an outpouring of compassion from Chinese social media users. The 83-year-old, identified only as Ms Huang, was found guilty of the manslaughter of her disabled son, Li. She fed her 46-year-old son about 60 sleeping pills on 9 May and strangled him with a silk scarf as she used cotton pads to cover his nose. Huang was found guilty of manslaughter by the People's Intermediate Court of Guangzhou and received a three-year suspended prison sentence. She said she took her son's life because she feared no one would care for him after she died. Li was born prematurely with severe mental and physical disabilities that left him unable to walk or talk. Prosecutors asked Huang why she could not have arranged for Li to have been cared for by his elder brother, but she said she was not prepared to burden him. ""It was my fault to give birth to him and make him suffer. I'd rather commit murder than leave him to someone else,"" Huang told the court. ""[F]or the past two years my own health was too poor to take care of him any more,"" the 83-year-old said. ""I'm getting older and weaker and might die before him,"" she said. ""The idea of killing him occurred to me a week before and I had been struggling."" Head judge Wan Yunfeng said: ""She deserves mercy even though she did break the law."" The case has gone viral on the Chinese popular social media microblogging platform Weibo. One popular comment highlighted the difficulties that having a disability can have on a person and their families Yuangungun DeXueqiu said: ""In this country, a mental illness or disability can make an ordinary family's lives disastrous. For such people, there is really not enough aid."" The case has also reopened the debate around euthanasia in China. One Sina Weibo user said: ""This happened because euthanasia has not been legalised."" Some users disagreed with this statement, saying that ""This has nothing to do with euthanasia, but with current social welfare issues."" According to theChina Disabled Persons' Federation,external, there are 2.7m people with disabilities in the world's most populous country. However, there are only 6,740 registered disabled care support services, which can only provide some total care for about 204,000 people with any type of disability. This means that the burden of care for disabled people in China often falls upon family members of people with disabilities. As one Weibo user put it: ""The problem lies in social welfare and the [social] security system is far from perfect."" Some users expressed their sorrow for the defendant. Some saw the incident as ""inexplicably sad"", while one commenter said they felt ""drowned in sorrow"". There was also empathy for her plight, with one user saying: ""No-one can understand this mother's love. After all, she personally took care of him for 46 years.""

Catalan protest against Spain jail moves,"This video can not be played In Barcelona's central square, the crowd sings Freedom for Catalonia Thousands of Catalans have protested against the detention of eight regional ministers sacked over Catalonia's push for independence from Spain. The officials - who appeared in Spain's high court - are accused of rebellion, sedition and misuse of public funds. Prosecutors are also seeking a European Arrest Warrant for ousted Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont, who did not show up in court and is now in Belgium. The request also covers four other ex-ministers who ignored the summons. Spain has been gripped by a constitutional crisis since a referendum on independence from Spain was held in Catalonia on 1 October in defiance of a constitutional court ruling that had declared it illegal. Last week, Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy imposed direct rule on Catalonia, dissolving the regional parliament and calling local elections for 21 December. This came after Catalan lawmakers voted to declare the independence of the affluent north-eastern region. The Catalan government said that of the 43% of potential voters who took part in the referendum, 90% were in favour of independence. Catalonia sings for its exiled leaders Catalonia crisis in 300 words What next for Spain? On Thursday, thousands of people gathered outside Catalonia's regional parliament in Barcelona. Many carried Catalan flags and slogans that read ""Freedom for political prisoners"". Similar protest rallies were held in other Catalan towns. Political parties and civic groups in the affluent north-eastern region also condemned the judicial move, Nine out of 14 summoned Catalan ex-ministers appeared before Judge Carmen Lamela. She said they had to be detained because they might otherwise leave the country or destroy evidence. Seven of the eight ex-ministers were pictured turning up to court together Those who were held are: Former Deputy Vice-President Oriol Junqueras Former Interior Minister Joaquim Forn Former Foreign Affairs Minister RaÃ¼l Romeva Former Justice Minister Carles MundÃ³ Former Labour Minister Dolors Bassa Former Government Presidency Councillor Jordi Turull Former Sustainable Development Minister Josep Rull Former Culture Minister Meritxell Borras The ninth official, ex-Business Minister Santi Vila, was granted bail at the request of prosecutors. He quit before the Catalan parliament voted for independence last Friday. In addition to Mr Puigdemont, prosecutors have asked Spain's high court judge to issue European arrest warrants for the following Catalan officials: Meritxell Serret, former agriculture minister Antoni ComÃ­n, former health minister LluÃ­s Puig, former culture minister Clara PonsatÃ­, former education minister Five other senior members of the Catalan parliament, as well as Speaker Carme Forcadell, are facing the same charges but, because of their parliamentary immunity, their cases are being handled by the Supreme Court. Their hearings have been postponed until 9 November. In a statement broadcast on Catalan TV from an undisclosed location in Belgium, he described the detentions as ""an act that breaks with the basic principles of democracy"". ""I demand the release of the ministers and the vice-president,"" he added. Carles Puigdemont was pictured in a Belgian cafe Mr Puigdemont, who was spotted in a Brussels cafe on Thursday, has said he will not return to Spain unless he receives guarantees of a fair trial. He did not specify his exact demands. Belgium's federal prosecutor has said the law will be applied once an arrest warrant is received, according to Efe news agency. Mr Puigdemont's lawyer said the climate was ""not good"" for him to appear in court, but he also said his client would co-operate with the authorities in Spain and Belgium. The man who wants to break up Spain Mr Puigdemont's handling of the crisis has drawn criticism among some other Catalan politicians, with left-wing parliamentary deputy Joan Josep Nuet criticising him for creating ""yet more bewilderment"". Spain's central bank warned on Thursday,externalof the ""significant risks and economic costs"" resulting from the crisis, and that Catalonia's economy could fall into recession. Early numbers suggest that the vital tourism sector of the region has already been affected by the ongoing uncertainty. If Spain's high court judge issues a warrant, a European Arrest Warrant (EAW) will be sent to Belgian prosecutors, who have 24 hours to decide whether the paperwork is correct. If they do, they then have 15 days to arrest Mr Puigdemont and the four others. If one or all of them appeals against it, that process could last another 15 days. Belgium has a maximum of 60 days to return the suspects to Spain after arrest. But if the suspects do not raise legal objections, a transfer could happen within a few days. A country can reject an EU arrest warrant if it fears that extradition would violate the suspect's human rights. Discrimination based on politics, religion or race is grounds for refusal. So are fears that the suspect would not get a fair trial. There is an agreedEU list of 32 offences,external- in Article Two of the EAW law - for which there is no requirement for the offence to be a crime in both countries. In other words, any of those offences can be a justification for extradition, provided the penalty is at least three years in jail. However, neither ""sedition"" nor ""rebellion"" - two of the Spanish accusations against the Catalan leaders - are on that list. Catalonia sings for its exiled leaders What next for Spain?
