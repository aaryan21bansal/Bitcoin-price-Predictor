Suspect had 'cyber spy' training,"Turkish media released CCTV pictures allegedly showing the Saudi 'hit squad' suspected of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance The BBC has uncovered new details about one of the men accused of murdering Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist who was critical of his country's government. Turkish media identified Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb as being part of a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents who flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance from the city's Saudi consulate on 2 October. He is said to have spent two years working in London, with a source describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence to US news network CNN. And now BBC Arabic can reveal he was trained how to use offensive spyware technology on behalf of the Saudi state. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Saudi Arabia profile The source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, has visually confirmed his identity from pictures circulated in the media in the days since Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. According to him, Mr Mutreb was introduced as ""an intelligence security operative"". The spyware trainers, however, nicknamed him ""dark face"". ""Because he looked always grumpy, like he was on the sad sideâ¦ he was very silent,"" the source added. Saudi Arabia denies any knowledge of what happened to Mr Khashoggi, insisting he left the consulate soon after getting routine paperwork. The European surveillance expert described how Mr Mutreb spent two weeks on a course with him in 2011, learning how to use the technology his company was providing the Saudi government so that it could carry out targeted attacks on the phones and computers of its own citizens. ""The training involved things like infecting a computer from potential targets of interest for intelligence and extracting information, so digital evidence, information about this person of interest. CCTV footage from Istanbul airport purports to show Maher Mutreb on 2 October ""This information might have been basically everything from [their] GPS position, conversation, microphone audio around the device itself, camera pictures, files on disk, emails, contacts, everything that was on the device itself."" During the training, which was in a military compound in the suburbs of Riyadh, the surveillance expert says Mr Mutreb ""used to come and go"" and ""almost didn't speak at all"". ""He wasn't one of the guys who was particularly skilled on the technical side,"" the spyware trainer explained. ""The group was split between those doing physical intelligenceâ¦ so cameras, microphones etc, and another group of people that were doing digital surveillanceâ¦ I believe that this guy was more on the physical surveillance than the digital surveillance."" A man identified as Maher Mutreb can be seen in the far right of a photo from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in March The tools he was trained in, the source said, were similar to other tools which, according to Citizenlab and Amnesty International, were recently used against several of Mr Khashoggi's friends. Mr Mutreb is believed to have spent two years working at the Saudi embassy in London.A document published by the British government in 2007,externallisted a man with that name as first secretary. However, he has also been named as a Saudi intelligence officer by several individuals, and some leaked documents. CNN spoke to a Saudi source in London who said he knew Mr Mutreb,external, describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence, while the popular Arabic app MenoM3ay - which enables users to see the names people have linked to phone numbers - lists a man with that name as a colonel in the royal court. On October 12 Wikileaks tweeted the Khashoggi Files, which included emails with the name of Mutreb and five other men who were supposed to have attended a course in Italy in 2011, run by an Italian company called Hacking Team. The emails were part of a dump of 400GB of data first released by Wikileaks in July 2015, which Hacking Team say was stolen from their internal network. The emails also included conversations that suggested the intelligence agencies Hacking Team worked with used it to spy on activists and journalists. Allow Twitter content?

Who's who in alleged 'hit squad',"Turkish media have named 15 Saudi nationals who Turkish officials suspect were involved in the disappearance of Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist critical of the government who was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in the city of Istanbul on 2 October. Most of the men flew into Istanbul on two private jets,externalhours before Mr Khashoggi arrived at the consulate to collect some routine paperwork, and flew back to Riyadh later in the day on the same jets. Turkish officials believe the men are Saudi officials and intelligence officers, an allegation that appears to be supported by open source information that is freely available. Saudi authorities deny any involvement in Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. They insist he left the consulate soon after getting the paperwork. Dr Tubaigy is a forensic pathologist who completed a master's degree at the University of Glasgow in Scotland, andin 2015 he spent three months at the Victorian Institute of Forensic Medicine in Australia,external. The doctor identifies himself on his Twitter account as a professor of forensic medicine,externaland head of the Saudi Scientific Council of Forensics. The account also links to the Saudi interior ministry. In 2014 the London-based Arabic newspaper Asharq al-Awsat saidDr Tubaigy was a lieutenant colonel,externalworking for the forensic science department of the interior ministry's General Directorate of Public Security. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death In an interview, accompanied by a photograph of him wearing uniform, the doctor discussed a mobile laboratory that he had designed to allow pathologists to perform post-mortems in only seven minutes in order to quickly determine the cause of death of Muslims performing the Hajj pilgrimage. Turkish officials have also said that Dr Tubaigy was carrying a bone saw,externalwhenhe flew into Istanbul Ataturk Airport,externalfrom Riyadh at 03:13 on 2 October on a private jet with the tail number HZSK2. The jet is owned by Sky Prime Aviation Services, a company that was reportedly seized by the Saudi government in an anti-corruption drive last year. Dr Tubaigy stayed at a MÃ¶venpick Hotel Istanbul, 0.5km (0.3 miles) west of the Saudi consulate, and departed Istanbul airport on HZSK2 at 22:54 on 2 October. The jet returned to Riyadh via Dubai, landing late on 3 October. Unnamed Turkish officials have since alleged that Dr Tubaigy can be heard in audio recordings,externalfrom inside the consulate on the day of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance, when they believe the journalist was tortured, killed and dismembered by the Saudi team who flew into the country. A man identified as the doctor can be heard,externalrecommending that other people join him in listening to music on headphones while he cuts up Mr Khashoggi's body, according to the officials. Dr Tubaigy has not commented.But a man who said he was the doctor's uncle tweeted that he would never carry out ""such criminal acts"",external. Mr Mutreb is believed to have spent two years working at the Saudi embassy in London.A document published by the British government in 2007,externallisted a man with that name as first secretary.

Turkish media said Mr Mutreb arrived in Istanbul on the private jet HZSK2 along with Dr Tubaigy, and also stayed at the MÃ¶venpick hotel. He flew out of Istanbul on another private jet owned by Sky Prime Aviation with the tail number HZSK1, at 18:40 on 2 October, according to Turkish media. The New York Times cited a French ""professional"" who had worked with the Saudi royal family as identifying him as amember of the security team,externalthat travels with Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Farmer 'devastated' over BSE case,"The isolated case involves Boghead Farm in Lumsden The farmer of the herd found with BSE in Aberdeenshire has spoken of his devastation. Movement restrictions at Boghead Farm in Lumsden were introduced after so-called mad cow disease was found in one cow. Speaking through NFU Scotland, Thomas Jackson said: ""This has been a very difficult time - we have found the situation personally devastating."" It is the first case of its kind in Scotland in a decade. What you need to know about BSE In his statement, Mr Jackson explained: ""We have built up our closed herd over many years and have always taken great pride in doing all the correct things. ""To find through the surveillance system in place that one of our cows has BSE has been heartbreaking. ""Since this has happened we have been fully cooperating with all the parties involved and will continue to do so as we, like everyone, want to move forward and clear up this matter. ""The cohorts and offspring of the cow have now been identified and as a purely precautionary measure they will be slaughtered and tested in due course; again we are fully co-operating with all the parties with regards to this."" Scotland's Chief Veterinary Officer Sheila Voas said it could be ""months"" before tests yield definitive results. However, she stressed that the discovery of the BSE case showed the industry's detection system was working. The case, involving a five-year-old animal, was identified before entering the human food chain. The monitoring of BSE has been an important function since the crisis of 1986 when 180,000 cattle were infected and 4.4 million slaughtered in order to eradicate the disease in the UK. There are understood to have been16 cases in the UK since 2011,external, with the last in 2015 whenfarming officials confirmed a case of BSE in Carmarthenshire, Wales. Ms Voas told BBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme: ""The animal itself is dead, she died before she was tested, and there are three other animals, possibly four, on the farm that will need to be slaughtered purely as a precautionary basis. ""We'll slaughter them, take brain stem samples and and check them."" She said the disease could occur ""spontaneously"" and that it was believed this was probably the case at Boghead Farm. Ms Voas said: ""Investigations are ongoing and it could be several months because of the nature of the disease before we are able to say with certainty. ""We do surveillance as a matter of routine as part of controls. Back in the 90s there was a big problem with BSE and we've learned an awful lot of lessons from then and there are various controls in place to make sure that never happens again. ""Every animal that dies over 48 months is tested, we test something like 20,000 samples a year from Scotland, this one was picked up as a result of that, it's the first one that's been picked up since 2008."" To achieve ""negligible risk"" status, Scotland had to have 11 years free of BSE from the birth of the last animal known to have it. So it was a long wait. And one positive test has overturned it. The status meant a relaxing of some rules governing the way the meat is processed at the abattoir. But much more importantly, it allowed the industry to push harder on the export markets with countries reluctant to deal with nations linked to BSE. Scotland now falls into line with the rest of the UK which is deemed ""controlled risk"". Those controls include things like traceability, testing and disposal of some types of offal. Does it mean the meat is any less safe? Absolutely not. And there's no greater risk to other animals because BSE is not a ""virus"" which can be caught. Consumers and farmers clearly have questions about where the BSE came from in the Aberdeenshire cow. Tests are under way, but the truth is we might never know. It's assumed cattle can contract it spontaneously; a predisposition through some sort of genetic mutation. Bad luck which is no fault of the farmer. Pinpointing that can be tricky and so many of those questions may never be answered. Ms Voas explained that because Scotland had had no trace of the disease for more than a decade it was given the ""negligible risk"" status. The effect of the status was that some of the controls required were reduced. Ms Voas told the BBC: ""From the point at which we confirmed this [BSE case] we immediately went back to the previous controls that were in place until 18 months ago."" She added; ""All the information we have is this is under control, there's no reason for people to panic. ""It's not the start of an outbreak, it's a single isolated case that won't affect the food chain."" Any farmer with concerns is advised to seek immediate veterinary advice. Mad cow disease - as it is more commonly known, because of the animals' erratic behaviour and movements - destroys their brains by eating away the nerve tissue.

"Depressed? The places not to live if you need helpNHS talking therapy service is failing patients in one in seven areas of England, BBC analysis shows.HealthComments","A flagship NHS mental health service is failing patients in one in seven areas of England, research by the BBC shows. People with conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are entitled to psychological therapies, such as counselling. The NHS is meant to successfully treat half of the people it sees. But an analysis of official NHS data showed this was not the case in 28 of the 195 local areas of the country in the first six months of this year. There is a threefold variation in recovery rates between different places, with experts saying if such differences existed in heart bypass surgery there would be an outcry. Psychologists said some areas were not properly funding services, meaning patients are offered fewer appointments than they really need. However, NHS England said the programme - called Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) - was one of the most ambitious of its kind in the world and had helped hundreds of thousands of people overcome depression and anxiety. It said despite the problems in some areas, overall IAPT was successfully treating more than half of patients across the whole population. The findings come as the BBC has re-launched its NHS Tracker, which provides information about the performance of local services, including mental health for the first time.  Karla and Imran have both struggled with their mental health. But they have had different experiences in the NHS. Karla, from Derby, said she got treatment for depression and anxiety quickly and is now in recovery. She was given a talking therapy, known as cognitive behavioural therapy. ""It has taught me how to express things in healthier ways. Now I don't bottle things up so much. ""It gave me the strength to say, 'you know what, it's going to hurt and it's going to get worse'. Before I didn't talk to anyone. Therapy taught me to accept this is what it is. ""It's given me my life back."" Imran (not his real name) has had a very different experience to Karla, and - six years on from first seeking help for his mental health issues - he is still struggling to access effective ongoing support. During that time, he has had contact with a wide range of professionals, his GP, social workers and housing support staff - which ""didn't amount to anything"". He was also referred to a psychiatrist, and later CBT. None of it has worked for him, and he says it can be hard to negotiate ""the system"" when you are also dealing with symptoms. ""There's a lot of pressure on you. It's really hard."" You can read more about Karla and Imran's storieshere. For those with mild to moderate mental health problems, the NHS runs a counselling service called IAPT. It is available in every part of the country after being launched 10 years ago. About 550,000 patients suffering from conditions such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are treated by the service every year. They are given support ranging from telephone advice from trained therapists to group and one-to-one talking therapies. Prof David Clark, clinical adviser to NHS England for IAPT and one of the architects of the programme, said it is ""widely recognised as the most ambitious programme of talking therapies in the world"". The treatment should help half to recover - defined as no longer being clinically mentally ill by the time they are discharged. The NHS has struggled to achieve this since the programme was launched in 2008, but improvements have been made and nationally it was achieved last year for the first time. Since then it has almost continuously been hit. Prof Clark said on others measures, including how long people wait for treatment to start, the service was also achieving its targets proving it was a highly successful scheme. And he added ""most importantly it has helped of hundreds of thousands of people to overcome their depression and anxiety, and better manage their mental health"". But that progress masks the fact some local areas have been struggling. Figures are published every three months by NHS area. There are 195 areas run by clinical commissioning groups and in 28 of them, fewer than half of patients were successfully treated during both the January to March and April to June periods. Another 27 failed in at least one quarter. If you look at the April to June period there was a threefold difference between the best and worst. In Luton, fewer than one in four patients were successfully treated. In Wirral, part of Merseyside, it was only one in three. By comparison, more than two-thirds of patients in Stoke were no longer ill by the time they were discharged. Both Luton and Wirral NHS bosses cited high numbers of people on the waiting list as a factor - meaning people have been waiting longer for treatment to start. They both said they had been making progress on this though. Psychologists say that like many parts of the NHS, services have been squeezed. They say some areas put more resources than others into the programme - and that means patients are sometimes discharged before they are ready. Clinical psychologist Dr Ryan Kemp is a director of therapies at Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, which runs services across north-west London and in Milton Keynes. He said that while the NHS should be ""proud"" of the progress that has been made, he had concerns. He said in some places the funding was ""minimal"", which put ""pressure to move people out of the service"". Patients who have not recovered may be put on drugs or referred on to services for more complex problems, such as psychiatry, but experts say there are long waits for these services. Consultant psychologist Dr Mike Scott, who has written and researched extensively about talking therapies, says: ""The fact there is such a variation in recovery rates raises questions. If you had this with heart bypass surgery, there would be real suspicions. ""There needs to be an independent assessment."" He believes the true recovery rate may actually be much lower, because the way treatment is assessed is not robust enough. ""I have done research on this and the recovery rate is much more like 15%. The service is provided on the cheap. ""Patients do not get enough sessions."" The 28 areas of the country which did not successfully treat half of patients receiving psychological therapies in the first six months of this year are: NHS Blackburn with Darwen NHS Bradford City NHS Brighton & Hove NHS Corby NHS Dudley NHS East Lancashire NHS Fareham & Gosport NHS Greater Huddersfield NHS Guildford & Waverley NHS Harrow NHS Havering NHS Leicester City NHS Luton NHS Manchester NHS Merton NHS Nene NHS North East Lincolnshire NHS North Hampshire NHS Norwich NHS Redbridge NHS Salford NHS Somerset NHS South Eastern Hampshire NHS South Sefton NHS Southwark NHS Vale Royal NHS Wakefield NHS Wirral Data analysis by Christine Jeavans and Ros Anning Male suicide rates at new UK low Sharp drop in UK suicide rates Helping men 'struggling with life' Samaritans - Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Grooming victims 'delivered to hell',"Crying and disorientated, victims of the Huddersfield grooming gang were abandoned on the rugged uplands of Saddleworth Moor Twenty men sexually abused girls as young as 11 as part of a grooming ring that targeted more than a dozen girls in Huddersfield. Intoxicated with drink and drugs, the children were raped repeatedly and often driven to isolated areas and left to fend for themselves. The desolate swathes of Saddleworth Moor have long held a place in history as a scene of innocence lost, having been used as a burial ground by Ian Brady and Myra Hindley to hide the horrors of their crimes. But this vast landscape, straddling Greater Manchester and West Yorkshire, was also a dumping ground for a string of vulnerable girls who fell victim to a large-scale grooming gang. It was on those hills - two miles from the nearest village - that these children would turn up at a remote farm belonging to Christopher Crowther. Twenty guilty of campaign of rape and abuse 'Her neck was black with bites' ""It was a cold, wet night when they knocked. I opened the door and two or three girls, aged 14 or 15, were crying and didn't have a clue where they were. ""I asked them what had happened and they said they had been thrown out of a car; they wouldn't tell me any more."" Sometimes the girls were taken to the moors to carry out sex acts, other times they were simply left there for refusing to do what the men wanted For one victim, her only means of escape was to jump in front of an oncoming vehicle and beg for help. She had been abandoned on the bleak moorland by Mohammed Ibrar for refusing to carry out a sex act on him. Incensed, he beat her up and threw her out of his car -  a harrowing ordeal that left her bloodied and battered. ""He just kept punching me and punching me. There was blood everywhere and it felt like my nose was broken,"" she told jurors of the man she knew, fittingly, as ""Bully"". ""He wanted me to give him what he wanted, whenever he wanted it, no matter what it was."" Mr Crowther recalls how the teenagers who appeared on his doorstep in the years the abuse happened were cold, dishevelled and in tears. His priority was to get the girls home safely, and although he did not report what had happened to police, the youngsters' behaviour made him suspect it had to do with older men. Christopher Crowther said he took some distressed girls to safety ""They were just in T-shirts and jeans, certainly not dressed to be out in the remote hills on a wet, dark night,"" he said. ""It was upsetting to see. They were extremely vulnerable and seemed confused with drink or drugs. They were just sobbing, asking for help. ""Whoever threw them out of that car didn't care for them in the slightest."" He described how on one occasion one of the girls was ""very, very roughed up"". After ringing one of their mothers who ""didn't know where her daughter was"", he and his daughter drove them back home to Huddersfield. If the story sounds familiar, it's because it is: a replay of the sad tales from convictions in Rotherham, Rochdale and Telford - among several other places - where underage white girls were groomed by older men, who said they loved them. Many of the men and places of abuse were located within a two mile radius of the West Yorkshire town These predators were often years older than their prey and the girls were repeatedly passed around and raped. In Huddersfield, many of the Asian gang members lived and carried out the abuse in areas stretching from the edge of Manchester Road - a main road through the town - up into the suburbs of Thornton Lodge and Crosland Moor. In total, 15 girls were groomed - one was in care, another had learning difficulties - and they were often picked up in their school uniforms. They were driven around in cars and given presents as their groomers built a fake relationship to satisfy their perversions. 'Nobody asked me any questions' The history of a child abuse scandal One mother described how she found teddy bears, heart-shaped chocolates and bottles of perfume hidden in her daughter's bedroom. But there was nothing romantic about the scenes of the crimes; just dingy flats, seedy takeaways, alleyways near railway tracks and snooker club car parks. At house parties, drink and drugs were in plentiful supply - time after time, the court heard how the girls were plied with whisky, vodka, cannabis or ecstasy and, once incoherent, they were taken into a room where men would follow. Sometimes no contraception was used, sometimes plastic bags were used as condoms. The court heard that some victims became pregnant, and one girl had a termination. The judge said the sexual abuse suffered by the girls was at the ""top of the scale"" It was common for the abuse to take place after the men ""dared"" each other, or when the rest were watching or filming it on their phones. Raj Singh Barsran raped a girl after she was ""knocked out"" by drink. Before that she was subjected to other ""sickening acts"" which had been filmed by the gang ringleader Amere Singh Dhaliwal . But because the girls were so corrupted by the men, they viewed the behaviour as normal. Parents described how their daughters became ""secretive"" and would regularly go missing. One mother told how her 14-year-old would come home covered in bruises and bites and regularly skipped school. Parents - who were sometimes themselves being threatened by the men - recounted being helpless at keeping their daughters safe and phoning hospitals and the police when they disappeared for hours on end. ""I was always asking her where she had been but I never got a straight answer,"" said one mother. ""We got her a phone in the hope we could keep in touch to make sure she was safe but repeatedly the phones would get lost or taken off her."" Shaf's snooker club, which used to be in this row of shops on Manchester Road, was a place where the girls were taken Although the parents felt unable to protect their daughters, there were opportunities for the authorities to step in and help. But the cycle of abuse and exploitation continued. The girl who was attacked and abandoned on the moors by Ibrar reported it to West Yorkshire Police at the time, but prosecutor Richard Wright said despite her visible injuries nothing was done. ""It's incredible that no action was taken, it's disgraceful,"" he said. Many other chances to intervene were described in court. Injured girls turned up at hospitals, officers were called to house parties and police stopped cars in which the teenagers, in their school uniforms, were being ferried around by the men. The victims and their families said they tried to get help but the authorities ""did not want to know"". One mother, so desperate to release her daughter from the clutches of the gang, wrote to the prime minister after being rebuffed by social services who said her daughter ""was not a risk"". She told jurors how she would lie awake on a night worrying her daughter was dead and when she had not come home she would ring the police. Another victim said: ""The police never helped us. We'd get dropped at a hospital and we'd get left there. They just wouldn't listen to us."" Nazir Afzal said authorities needed to do more to stop grooming Huddersfield MP Barry Sherman raised the issue in Parliament in 2009 after he had been made aware of the issue of child sexual exploitation in the town. In that speech,external, he said that his particular worry was that he did not think West Yorkshire Police took the matter as seriously as other forces. Nazir Afzal, former chief prosecutor for the north-west of England, initiated the prosecution of grooming gangs in Rochdale and said there was a clear pattern of behaviour with street grooming and the authorities needed to do more. ""These men offer the girls the earth and then deliver them to hell. ""[The men] feel able to do this to white girls because they can, because somehow the authorities allow this to happen. ""If the authorities were acting upon the information they had, then these girls would not be put in danger."" Although this particular gang has been jailed for its ""vile and wicked"" actions, echoes of their behaviour still linger. About two years ago, Mr Crowther saw another distressed girl roaming near his home. ""I asked if she was OK and if she wanted a lift. She said there was no way she was getting in another car because she'd just been thrown out of one and she would walk to the bus stop."" He said he regularly sees cars being driven by Asian men pulling into lay-bys late at night and has relayed this to Greater Manchester Police. Suspecting the cycle continues, he said: ""I've told them, but nothing happens."" The force said no concerns had been formally reported to the police and urged anyone with suspicions to contact them.

'Her neck was black with bites',"In total 20 men, from Huddersfield, Sheffield, Bradford and Dewsbury, have been convicted for their part in the abuse A grooming gang in Huddersfield targeted dozens of underage girls and raped, abused, and passed them around for years. One mum recounts the harrowing abuse suffered by her daughter. ""One time she came home and her neck was completely black with bites. ""I had an idea what was going on because I would see her underwear... but these men have a hold over your child and there's nothing you can do apart from be there."" This was the reality of daily life for one family who fought for years to free their daughter from the abusers' grip. At 13, she was not particularly streetwise. Her mother remembers a ""very quiet"", boy band-obsessed ""girly-girl who loved wearing pink hair clips"". But, as she was drawn into a seedy world, she changed. Twenty guilty of campaign of rape and abuse Grooming victims 'delivered to hell' ""Her hair tied so tight on top of her head, her clothes changed, her underwear changed,"" her mother said. ""There were big hooped earrings and she started wearing make-up and listening to this music I didn't recognise. ""All the time she was home her phone was constantly in her hand."" Victims were ""used and abused at will"" over a seven year period from 2004 to 2011 A pattern of behaviour began to stick. She regularly missed school, disappeared every weekend and left her parents frantic until they got a hysterical call in the early hours. Each time, their daughter had been dumped and left to find her own way back to her family. At home, the youngster was bombarded with dozens of phone calls and text messages. Her parents locked windows and doors to try and protect her but she would threaten to hurt herself with a knife. ""There was one time we were trying to talk sense into her and drag her back into the house,"" her mum said. ""She was saying 'I have to go, you don't understand'. ""I was saying 'please make us understand' and she said 'they've said if I don't do what they say then they're going to gang rape you in front of dad'. ""I was gobsmacked. I thought if this is the kind of hold these perpetrators have over your child then you've got absolutely no chance."" Reality Check: The scale of online child sex abuse 'Nobody asked me any questions' Desperate to ""get her off the radar"", her father took her out of the country for several weeks. But when she returned, so did the men and their demands. ""She'd come home totally disorientated. We used to take it in turns and sit up all night with her, making sure she was lying on her side. We didn't know what she'd had. ""She was giddy, silly. I used to always say what's your name, what's your date of birth, do you know what day it is? ""Then she'd sleep right through until dinner time the day after, get up, shower and go out again."" Her parents would constantly ring the police and approached their MP. With support from charity Parents Against Child Sexual Exploitation, they kept a daily log but were told by officers that without any ""hardcore evidence"" or the girls speaking out, nothing could be done. ""Some police officers were nice but the odd one or two did victim-blame or blame us as a family."" The court was told many of the girls were socially isolated and as such became ""easy targets for abuse"" At home the impact was far-reaching. The girl's sibling would struggle to sleep and spend nights watching out of the bedroom window for her to come home, the next day falling asleep in class. The spectre of the men's influence threatened to cause divisions at home but the family did not bend. ""It made us stronger. It was either that of just give in. We used to say we're not letting her go. We can't give up."" Their daughter's escape came when she eventually fell pregnant by one of the abusers. With her parents' support, she kept the baby. Her mother describes how her daughter looked at the child and said it saved her life. In the aftermath, the men faded away, but the trauma they caused has remained. Now a young woman, she sleeps with a light on and takes medication. But thanks to her courage, the abusers are behind bars. A senior police officer contacted the family after hearing the girl's mum interviewed on the radio. It led to her daughter giving evidence and for other girls to be interviewed. ""I'm so pleased we've been taken seriously, not been judged anymore, not been abandoned this time round,"" said her mother. ""I'm so proud of all those girls that have come forward and for being so brave. ""Hopefully they can now move on.""

Scores dead in India as train hits crowd,"This video can not be played Crowds celebrate Hindu festival near Amritsar At least 59 people have been killed and dozens more injured by a train running into a crowd near Amritsar in India's northern Punjab state. The victims were standing on the railway tracks watching celebrations for Dusshera, a Hindu festival, when a train hit them at high speed on Friday. It is not clear who, if anyone, had given permission for the event and officials are trading blame. An inquiry into the incident has been ordered by the Punjab authorities. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi described the incident as ""heart-wrenching"". Families of victims held an angry protest on the tracks on Saturday. A large crowd had gathered to watch a celebration symbolising the triumph of the Hindu god Rama over the 10-headed demon king Ravana, symbolising the victory of good over evil. The event involved the burning of a firecracker-filled effigy of Ravana and a fireworks display. At one point, some of the crowd moved on to some railway tracks a short distance away, with some reports citing organisers' safety concerns about the effigy. According to eyewitnesses, many on the tracks had been busy filming the festivities on their phones at the time so did not hear or see the train approaching at high speed. Children are reported to be among those killed by the train The train that hit the crowds was travelling from Jalandhar to Amritsar. Hardeep Singh, chief medical officer for Amritsar, said on Saturday that at least 59 people had been killed by the train and 90 others injured. Officials have warned identification of all the victims could take several days. Eyewitness Amar Nath told BBC Punjabi that people had been ""mauled"" by the train. ""I removed the bodies from the tracks... my hands were full of blood."" The exact circumstances are not yet clear. On Saturday scores of victims' families gathered at the tracks, criticising the state government and demanding action against the train's driver. Family members mourned at the first funerals for victims on Saturday Ordering the inquiry, Punjab Chief Minister Amarinder Singh described the incident as ""absolutely tragic"". He said officials would do ""everything possible"" to assist the injured. Ashwani Lohani, the chairman of the Railway Board, said it was ""wrong"" to hold the railways responsible for what had happened because they had not been made aware of the event, and people ""are not expected to be on the tracks"". But local residents have told media the effigy burning is a regular local event there for every Dusshera. ""I've been seeing this event every Dusshera from here and this has never happened before, the railways should have stopped or slowed down the train,"" Deep Kumari, who was watching from her home, told Reuters news agency. The incident happened as crowds were celebrating a Hindu festival The deadly accident has renewed criticism of India's state rail system, which has a notoriously poor safety record. A state of mourning was declared in Punjab with offices and schools staying closed on Saturday as the first funerals for identified victims took place. Allow Twitter content?

Twenty members of grooming gang convicted,"The men, all from Yorkshire, went by nicknames including ""Dracula"", ""Bully"", ""Beastie"" and ""Nurse"" Twenty men have been found guilty of being part of a grooming gang that raped and abused girls as young as 11 in Huddersfield. The men were convicted of more than 120 offences against 15 girls. Victims were plied with drink and drugs and then ""used and abused at will"" in a seven-year ""campaign of rape and abuse"" between 2004 and 2011. At Leeds Crown Court, the ringleader, Amere Singh Dhaliwal, 35, was jailed for life with a minimum of 18 years. Other members of the gang were jailed for between five and 18 years but the court heard many perpetrators have never been identified. Details of the men's convictions and sentences can only now be published after reporting restrictions on a series of trials were partially lifted. During the three trials, jurors heard how the men - who are all British Asians mainly of Pakistani heritage - preyed on young, vulnerable girls, one of whom was described as having the mental age of a seven-year-old. This video can not be played Barry Sheerman MP says the authorities did not act quickly enough to investigate grooming The men, all from Yorkshire, went by nicknames including ""Dracula"" - which Nahman Mohammed was known as. Mohammed Imran Ibrar was known as ""Bully"", Abdul Rehman was nicknamed ""Beastie"", while Nasarat Hussain was known as ""Nurse"". Jailing 16 of the men earlier this year, Judge Geoffrey Marson QC said: ""The way you treated these girls defies understanding; this abuse was vile and wicked. ""As cases of sexual abuse with which the courts have to deal, this case comes top of the scale."" Groomed children were 'delivered to hell' 'Her neck was black with bites' How the grooming gang operated As married father-of-two Dhaliwal was sentenced, the judge told him: ""The extent and gravity of your offending far exceeds anything which I have previously encountered. ""Children's lives have been ruined and families profoundly affected by seeing their children, over months and years, out of control, having been groomed by you and other members of your gang."" Amere Singh Dhaliwal was convicted of 54 separate counts including 22 rapes involving 11 girls In May, the former leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson was arrested for reporting on the case live on Facebook during the second of the trials. He was jailed for contempt of court but his conviction was quashed because of a number of procedural errors. He faces a fresh hearing in relation to the alleged breach. Read more on this story and others in West Yorkshire Such was the men's hold over the girls, one mother said her child cracked her head jumping from a first-floor balcony at their home in order to get out after they ordered her to meet them. The girl later told police: ""Every time I went out something bad happened. I risked my life every time. I was a mess."" Another victim, who only escaped the abuse when her family had to move following a house fire, said: ""It was the best thing I ever did, and that's bad saying that burning your house down is the best thing you ever did."" Det Ch Insp Ian Mottershaw, who led the investigation, called the men ""depraved"" By BBC Home Editor Mark Easton Rotherham, Oxford, Rochdale, Derby, Banbury, Telford, Peterborough, Aylesbury, Bristol, Halifax, Keighley, Newcastle...  now Huddersfield. The list seems endlessâ¦ and there will almost certainly be more. The sexual abuse of vulnerable children in English towns by groups of men, often from immigrant communities, is an incarnation of a wider scandal that is dominating our news and overwhelming our police and our courts. It is a crime that until recently was rarely discussed in public. Child sexual abuse was often ignored or covered up: the protection of institutional reputation or community cohesion put before the protection of children. The grooming gangs of provincial England tend to operate where the disinfectant of public scrutiny struggles to reach - poorer neighbourhoods on the edge of town, around the mini-cab ranks and fast food joints, the twilight zones of urban life. Child abuse thrives in such dark corners, where people look the other way, not asking questions or following concerns because the subject matter is uncomfortable and scrutiny is potentially damaging.  But when we look, we find. During the trials, the court heard girls would be driven up to remote moorland late at night and abandoned if they refused the men's sexual demands. A sheep farmer told the BBC how he found distressed girls on the doorstep of his isolated home on a number of occasions. One victim said her relationship with some of the gang became ""one of those things that you couldn't get out of"". At house parties, girls would be plied with alcohol and drugs before being sexually abused ""one by one"" by the men, sometimes without contraception. The court heard they were abused in cars, car parks, houses, a snooker centre and a takeaway, often with other defendants and fellow victims watching on. Shaf's snooker club, which used to be in this row of shops on Manchester Road, was a place where the girls were taken, the court heard Victims and their families said they repeatedly told West Yorkshire Police what was happening but no arrests were made until years later. Speaking outside court, Det Ch Insp Ian Mottershaw, from the force, said: ""The investigation into this case has been extremely complex and the investigative team have worked tirelessly for the past five years to ensure that no stone has been left unturned. ""We welcome the convictions and sentences which have been passed down throughout the year to these depraved individuals, who subjected vulnerable young children to unthinkable sexual and physical abuse."" Barry Sheerman, Labour MP for Huddersfield, said: ""Let's be honest: no-one, local authority leadership, police, many of the people that should have been taking this more seriously earlier did not. ""But also, what happened in Rotherham and the publicity of Rotherham galvanised the action."" Steve Walker, director of children's services at Kirklees Council, said it had asked independent expert Dr Mark Peel to undertake a review of ""these non-recent cases to identify whether there are any lessons we can learn"".

Assange to take legal action against Ecuador,"Julian Assange has lived in Ecuador's UK embassy since 2012 Julian Assange is to launch legal action against the government of Ecuador, accusing it of violating his ""fundamental rights and freedoms"". The Wikileaks co-founder has lived in its UK embassy since 2012 after seeking asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden over a rape inquiry - later dropped. He was given a set of house rules by the London embassy this week, including taking better care of his cat. Mr Assange faces arrest for allegedly breaching bail conditions if he leaves. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga Assange given feline ultimatum by Ecuador Wikileaks lawyer Baltasar Garzon is in Ecuador to launch the case, which the Press Association reports is expected to be heard in court next week. Wikileaks said the country's government had threatened to remove the protection Mr Assange has had since being granted political asylum. It added that his access to the outside world had been ""summarily cut off"". In a memo, it threatened to confiscate the pet if he did not look after it, it said. Mr Assange was given the cat by his children The embassy did remove Mr Assange's internet connection in March, accusing him of ""interfering in other countries' affairs"". However, earlier this week it said it would be partially restored. In a statement, Wikileaks said: ""Ecuador's measures against Julian Assange have been widely condemned by the human rights community."" It claims the government of Ecuador refused a visit by Human Rights Watch general counsel Dinah PoKempner and had not allowed several meetings with his lawyers. Mr Assange's lawyers also said they were challenging the legality of the Ecuador government's ""special protocol"" - which makes his political asylum dependent on ""censoring"" his freedom of opinion, speech and association. Lawyers for Mr Assange claim the protocol: Requires journalists, Mr Assange's lawyers and anyone else looking to see him to disclose private or political details - such as the serial numbers and codes of their phones and tablets The protocol says the government may ""share"" the information ""with other agencies"" Allows the embassy to seize the property of Mr Assange or his visitors and, without a warrant, hand it over to UK authorities Wikileaks said that US congressmen had written an open letter to Ecuador's president, Lenin Moreno, about the situation. It claims the document said that in order to advance crucial matters - such as economic co-operation, counternarcotics assistance and the possible return of a USAID mission to Ecuador - they must first resolve a ""significant challenge"" - the status of Mr Assange. Swedish police first issued a warrant for Mr Assange in August 2010 and he was arrested in London in December that year. The UK's Supreme Court ruled in May 2012 that he should be extradited to the country to face two separate allegations - one of rape and one of molestation. But Mr Assange said the claims were ""without basis"" and by June he was in the Ecuadorian embassy. Ecuador granted him asylum in August 2012, saying it feared his human rights might be violated if he was extradited. In May 2017, Sweden's director of public prosecutions confirmed the investigation had been dropped. And in July 2018, the UK and Ecuador confirmed they were holding ongoing talks over the whistleblower's fate. However, a warrant for Mr Assange's arrest - issued in 2012 after he failed to surrender to a court when his extradition was approved - remains in place.

Journalist murder suspect had 'cyber spy' training,"Turkish media released CCTV pictures allegedly showing the Saudi 'hit squad' suspected of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance The BBC has uncovered new details about one of the men accused of murdering Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist who was critical of his country's government. Turkish media identified Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb as being part of a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents who flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance from the city's Saudi consulate on 2 October. He is said to have spent two years working in London, with a source describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence to US news network CNN. And now BBC Arabic can reveal he was trained how to use offensive spyware technology on behalf of the Saudi state. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Saudi Arabia profile The source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, has visually confirmed his identity from pictures circulated in the media in the days since Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. According to him, Mr Mutreb was introduced as ""an intelligence security operative"". The spyware trainers, however, nicknamed him ""dark face"". ""Because he looked always grumpy, like he was on the sad sideâ¦ he was very silent,"" the source added. Saudi Arabia denies any knowledge of what happened to Mr Khashoggi, insisting he left the consulate soon after getting routine paperwork. The European surveillance expert described how Mr Mutreb spent two weeks on a course with him in 2011, learning how to use the technology his company was providing the Saudi government so that it could carry out targeted attacks on the phones and computers of its own citizens. ""The training involved things like infecting a computer from potential targets of interest for intelligence and extracting information, so digital evidence, information about this person of interest. CCTV footage from Istanbul airport purports to show Maher Mutreb on 2 October ""This information might have been basically everything from [their] GPS position, conversation, microphone audio around the device itself, camera pictures, files on disk, emails, contacts, everything that was on the device itself."" During the training, which was in a military compound in the suburbs of Riyadh, the surveillance expert says Mr Mutreb ""used to come and go"" and ""almost didn't speak at all"". ""He wasn't one of the guys who was particularly skilled on the technical side,"" the spyware trainer explained. ""The group was split between those doing physical intelligenceâ¦ so cameras, microphones etc, and another group of people that were doing digital surveillanceâ¦ I believe that this guy was more on the physical surveillance than the digital surveillance."" A man identified as Maher Mutreb can be seen in the far right of a photo from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in March The tools he was trained in, the source said, were similar to other tools which, according to Citizenlab and Amnesty International, were recently used against several of Mr Khashoggi's friends. Mr Mutreb is believed to have spent two years working at the Saudi embassy in London.A document published by the British government in 2007,externallisted a man with that name as first secretary. However, he has also been named as a Saudi intelligence officer by several individuals, and some leaked documents. CNN spoke to a Saudi source in London who said he knew Mr Mutreb,external, describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence, while the popular Arabic app MenoM3ay - which enables users to see the names people have linked to phone numbers - lists a man with that name as a colonel in the royal court. On October 12 Wikileaks tweeted the Khashoggi Files, which included emails with the name of Mutreb and five other men who were supposed to have attended a course in Italy in 2011, run by an Italian company called Hacking Team. The emails were part of a dump of 400GB of data first released by Wikileaks in July 2015, which Hacking Team say was stolen from their internal network. The emails also included conversations that suggested the intelligence agencies Hacking Team worked with used it to spy on activists and journalists. Allow Twitter content?

Facebook hires former deputy PM Nick Clegg,"Facebook has hired former deputy prime minister Sir Nick Clegg as head of its global affairs and communications team. The 51-year-old politician was leader of the Liberal Democrats and formed a coalition government with David Cameron and the Conservatives in 2010. Facebook has faced intense scrutiny and the threat of government regulation following the Cambridge Analytica data scandal and alleged election meddling. Several prominent executives have left the company in the last year. Amol Rajan: Why Sir Nick Clegg is joining Facebook Sir Nick's new job title will be vice-president of global affairs and communications at Facebook. He will start work on Monday and will spend a week at the company's Menlo Park headquarters, before moving to California with his family permanently in the new year. Allow Twitter content?

Sir Nick told BBC media editor Amol Rajan he has been working on the frontier between technology and politics for the last few years. ""I thought, I could do this academically, as a commentator, running a start-up, but then I thought, in for a penny, in for a pound,""he explained. Facebook founder Mark Zuckerberg and chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg were personally involved in the recruitment, theFinancial Times,externalreported. In a statement, Sir Nick said he was delighted to join the company. ""Having spoken at length to Mark and Sheryl over the last few months, I have been struck by their recognition that the company is on a journey which brings new responsibilities not only to the users of Facebook's apps but to society at large. I hope I will be able to play a role in helping to navigate that journey,"" he wrote. The former Lib Dem leader has expanded further on his reasons for joining the company in aGuardian article,external, stating that he remains ""a stubborn optimist about the progressive potential to society of technological innovation"". He added: ""If the tech industry can work sensibly with governments, regulators, parliaments and civic society around the world, I believe we can enhance the benefits of technology while diminishing the often unintended downsides."" Facebook's chief security officer quits Vote Leave's targeted Brexit ads released by Facebook Facebook Portal video chat screens raise privacy concerns Facebook bans a second data-scooping quiz app Sir Nick has previously written about Facebook for a number of UK newspapers. In 2016, he wrote in theEvening Standard,external: ""I'm not especially bedazzled by Facebook. While I have good friends who work at the company, I actually find the messianic Californian new-worldy-touchy-feely culture of Facebook a little grating."" Analysis by Chris Fox, BBC technology reporter Facebook has had a turbulent few years and is trying to get a grip on its policies and reputation. TheCambridge Analytica data scandalrevealed that the personal information of millions of people had been misused, potentially influencing the results of elections. The company has also removed ""billions"" of fake accounts, linked to the spread of fake news and disinformation, possibly connected to countries such as Russia and Iran. Facebook hopes Sir Nick will challenge the company on its issues. This video can not be played Facebook job not lobbying, says Sir Nick Clegg With his political experience as part of the UK government, and as a former MEP, he will also be well-placed to advise how to keep the regulators away. In aFacebook post,external, Sheryl Sandberg said the company needed ""new perspectives to help us though this time of change"". Sir Nick is not the first Liberal Democrat to take a senior role at Facebook. Lord Allan of Hallam is currently the company's public policy chief for Europe, the Middle East and Africa. Nick Clegg was a Liberal Democrat MP for Sheffield Hallam from 2005 until 2017. In 2010, when he was leader of the Liberal Democrats, he became deputy prime minister in a coalition government with the Conservatives. But he faced a backlash from his supporters when he broke a promise that he would vote against any rise in university tuition fees. Mr Clegg resigned as Liberal Democrat leader in 2015 The Liberal Democrats lost a majority of their seats in the 2015 general election, ending up with just eight MPs, down from 57. Although he had kept his own seat, Nick Clegg resigned as the party leader. He lost his seat in the snap general election of 2017, but was given a knighthood in January 2018. In his statement announcing his new job at Facebook, he said it was ""wrenching"" to ""leave the public debate at a crucial time in the Brexit process"". ""But the key decisions will soon pass to Parliament, of which I am no longer a member, and once I had decided to take up this unique new challenge at Facebook, I felt it was best to get going sooner rather than later,"" he said. Jon Trickett MP, Labour's shadow minister for the cabinet office, said Sir Nick's new job was ""a damning indictment of the sorry state of our country's politics"". ""At a time when digital giants such as Facebook are rightly coming under public scrutiny, our former deputy prime minister has been hired to lobby on their behalf."" by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent In the UK, the reaction has been ""What?"" while in the United States and elsewhere most people will say ""Who?"" - so why has Facebook decided that Sir Nick Clegg is the right fit for one of the most challenging - and best paid - jobs in communications? From the moment in the summer that Sir Nick's predecessor, Elliot Schrage, announced he was leaving, Facebook made clear that it was not going to look inside or to other seasoned PR professionals for his replacement. Instead, bruised and blinking in the spotlight after a catalogue of scandals tarnished its image, it wanted someone who could guide it through choppy political waters in Washington, Brussels and elsewhere. Given how partisan US politics have become, choosing an American politician would have brought allegations of bias. In the UK, Sir Nick may be a divisive figure - especially over Brexit - but elsewhere that will not be such an issue. Facebook will hope that someone who has survived - just about - the cauldron of British politics will not flinch under fire from US senators or EU regulators. Sir Nick may find he needs to challenge Mark Zuckerberg pretty frequently. Just how well he handles his relationship with his new boss will be crucial. If he succeeds he could wield more power than he ever did in politics. If the relationship sours he will be heading home from California pretty quickly. David Cameron After quitting as prime minister in September 2016, Mr Cameron has taken on a raft of paid and unpaid roles - straddling both the private and charitable sectors. Most recently, he became apaid consultant to life-sciences firm Illuminaand vice-chairman of a new UK-China investment fund. He also sits on the boards of a number of organisations involved in international development and foreign relations as well as being president of Alzheimer's Research UK. Sir Nick Clegg Before the former deputy prime minister was hired by Facebook he was busy with his thinktank Open Reason,campaigning for a referendum on the final Brexit deal, and writing his book How To Stop Brexit. George Osborne The former chancellor added what is thought to be his eighth role to his bulging portfolio of post-politics jobs in May. The London Evening Standard editor was madechairman of a panel of advisers to Exor, which owns Juventus football club and has major stakes in Ferrari and Fiat Chrysler cars. It comes on top of academic posts and a Â£650,000 a year role with US investment fund Blackrock. Sir Danny Alexander After losing his parliamentary seat in 2015,Sir Dannywent on to work with the Britain Stronger in Europe campaign and schools cricket charity Chance To Shine. He became vice-president of Chinese-led Asian Infrastructure Investment Bank in 2016. Ed Balls The former Labour cabinet minister took on academic roles when he left politics before a stint on Strictly Come Dancing in 2016 saw him turn his attentions to television, where his BBC documentary, Travels in Trumpland, has proved a success this year. Ed Miliband The former Labour leader is still an MP but dips his toes into the world of radio from time to time, standing in for Jeremy Vine on his BBC Radio 2 programme and hosting his own podcast.

Russian charged with US election meddling,"The US government has charged a Russian woman for her role in a Kremlin-backed campaign to influence the US mid-term congressional elections next month. The criminal complaint against Elena Alekseevna Khusyaynova, 44, was revealed by the US Department of Justice on Friday. It marks the first foreign meddling case in the forthcoming US elections. Officials say she was the chief accountant for a project to ""sow discord in the US political system"". The charges allege Ms Khusyaynova - who lives in St Petersburg - continues to engage in ""information warfare against the United States"" by managing a so-called troll farm which posts inflammatory content online. ""The strategic goal of this alleged conspiracy, which continues to this day, is to sow discord in the US political system and to undermine faith in our democratic institutions,"" US Attorney Zachary Terwilliger said in a statement. She is charged with conspiracy to defraud the US. Ms Khusyaynova is accused of running a programme called Project Lakhta, in which her team created online arguments and misinformation to spark division among Americans. Russia cyber-plots: US, UK and Netherlands allege hacking Transparency - the tool to counter Russia The programme allegedly used social media and other platforms to discuss topics including immigration, gun control, gun rights, the Confederate flag, race relations, LGBT issues, the Women's March and the NFL national anthem debate, according to the justice department. Project Lakhta has a budget of $35m (Â£27m), but not all of their projects are directed at the US, according to officials. US authorities say their ""activities did not exclusively adopt one ideological view; they wrote on topics from varied and sometimes opposing perspectives"". ""Members of the conspiracy were directed, among other things, to create 'political intensity through supporting radical groups' and to 'aggravate the conflict between minorities and the rest of the population'."" The conspirators also ""took extraordinary steps"" to appear as American political activists, officials say, by creating ""thousands of social media and email accounts"" that gave the illusion that they were operated by US citizens. The risks of cyber-conflict with Russia Russia, Fancy Bears and hacking Olympic athletes Officials says the alleged ""conspiracy"" sought to pit Americans against each other. Some guidance to the Project Lakhta staff allegedly include: ""Brand [Senator John] McCain as an old geezer who has lost it and who long ago belonged in a home for the elderly"" Describe Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan as a ""loudmouth"" and ""a complete and absolute nobody incapable of any decisiveness"" ""Fully support Donald Trump and express the hope that this time around Congress will be forced to act as the president says it should"" ""Emphasise that if Congress continues to act like the Colonial British government did before the War of Independence, this will call for another revolution"" US intelligence agencies have concluded that Russia sought to influence the 2016 presidential election in favour of Donald Trump. The conclusion reached by Americans spymasters led the US Department of Justice to appoint former FBI director Robert Mueller to investigate foreign attempts to influence the US electoral system. Friday's complaint accuses Russian oligarch Evgeny Viktorovich Prigozhin, and two companies he controls, of funding Project Lakhta. The two companies - Concord Management and Concord Catering - were among three entities and 13 Russian individuals who were indicted by Mr Mueller in February. This video can not be played The BBC's Gordon Corera looks at why the Russian cyber plot sting was surprising Mr Prigozhin, who has been dubbed ""Putin's cook"" due to the banquets he has organised for the Russian leader, has previously been targeted by US sanctions. The charges against Ms Khusyaynova come as White House National Security Advisor John Bolton is due to meet Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Moscow. US issues sanctions for Russian 'hacking' It also comes as the Office of the Director of National Intelligence warned that it was concerned about ""ongoing campaigns"" by Russia, China and Iran to interfere in the mid-term elections on 6 November. FBI Director Christopher Wray said that the case ""serves as a stark reminder to all Americans: Our foreign adversaries continue their efforts to interfere in our democracy by creating social and political division, spreading distrust in our political system, and advocating for the support or defeat of particular political candidates.""

Macron in English faux pas over visas,"This video can not be played Mr Macron meant ""start"" but actually said ""stop"", aides say France's president mixed up his English when he said in error that UK visitors would need French visas if there was a no-deal Brexit, aides say. Emmanuel Macron had meant to say that British people would not need visas in such circumstances. The confusion came as Mr Macron was speaking to the media in English at the end of an EU summit in Brussels. Instead of ""we will not stop visas"" he meant to say ""we will not start visas"", the ElysÃ©e Palace explained. UK citizens currently enjoy visa-free travel in the EU, but that could change with Brexit. The UK is set to leave the 28-nation bloc on 29 March 2019. The BBC's Gavin Lee raised the visa issue with President Macron at Thursday's news conference, after leaders had failed to achieve a breakthrough on Brexit. By Gavin Lee, BBC News, Brussels The mix-up came after I asked President Macron whether newspaper reports of UK citizens needing visas for work or holidays in the event of a no-deal was true. The president's response was that ""we will not stop visas, it is fake news, as some other leaders would say"", and he went on to say ""we will definitely deliver visas for people"". His team now say it was a case of a ""second language"" slip-up, and that President Macron meant to say ""we will not start visas for British people"". The press team for the ElysÃ©e Palace say the position of the French for their ""no-deal"" contingency planning is one that would categorically not mean visas for British people, UNLESS the UK suddenly imposed them on French workers and tourists in the UK. They say they would aim for a deal which allows for a ""special status"" agreement for workers and tourists for both countries, that avoids the need for any ""official visa system"". In the event of a no-deal Brexit, Mr Macron said, measures would be taken to cover flights, ferries and businesses as well. A draft law has been tabled in the upper house of the French parliament,externalthat will let the government set new rules for Britons visiting France after Brexit. The draft suggests they will be treated as ""third country"" visitors - a similar category to Americans or Chinese. The preamble of the bill raises the possibility that visas may be imposed. But, in the event of a no-deal Brexit, the bill also gives the government the power to adapt or suspend the need for visas and residence permits for UK citizens. A deal remains elusive mainly because of wrangling over the future Northern Ireland border. Brexit risks reinstating physical controls at the border, which were scrapped under the Northern Ireland peace settlement. The current Brexit plan is for a transition period of 21 months from the end of March, to smooth the UK's path to a future relationship outside the EU. UK Prime Minister Theresa May said that transition could be extended ""for a few months"", if needed. But some Brexit campaigners have reacted angrily to the suggestion. EU ready to extend transition period Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop ""I do prefer a deal and I want a deal, but I will never favour a bad deal,"" Mr Macron said on Thursday. ""In case of no deal our responsibility is to ensure that the life of our people will not be so far impacted."" Mr Macron described the ""dynamic"" of the Brexit negotiations as ""positive because there is a willingness on the British side to find a solution"". He said ""now it's for Prime Minister May to propose a solution, but we will not compromise on the key elements of the mandate we gave to [EU negotiator] Michel Barnier"". The French president also denied suggestions that the UK prime minister had been snubbed late on Wednesday, when four EU leaders went out for a drink in the Grand Place in the centre of Brussels. He told the BBC that Theresa May had left the summit earlier, and said she would certainly be invited in future. ""I am always happy and open to share a drink with the different leaders, so obviously Theresa May will be very much welcome,"" he said.

Outrage as Trump hails body slam on reporter,"This video can not be played President Trump mimics the violent move at a rally US President Donald Trump has praised a Republican congressman who assaulted a journalist last year with a ""body slam"", referring to him as ""my guy"". ""Greg is smart,"" Mr Trump said of Montana Congressman Greg Gianforte, adding ""By the way, never wrestle him"". ""Any guy that can do a body slam... he's my guy,"" he said to cheers and laughter at a rally in Montana. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and the Guardian newspaper have called on Mr Trump to apologise. This latest praise from Mr Trump is unlikely to improve his relationship with the media, which he has previously labelled the ""enemy of the people"". He said he had feared that the 2017 assault could have hindered Mr Gianforte's chances of winningthe special congressional election that followed. Mr Trump told supporters: ""I said wait a minute, I know Montana pretty well, I think it might help him - and it did"". After praising Mr Gianforte, Mr Trump also mimicked a person being thrown forcefully to the ground. Why Donald Trump attacks the media 'Body slam' congressman sentenced to 20 hours of anger counselling The president's controversial remarks come as Turkish officials continue to investigatethe alleged killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. With weeks to go beforethe mid-term elections, Mr Gianforte is expected to win again, this time over Democratic challenger Kathleen Williams. Ms Williams has used the 2017 body slam in a new campaign ad, saying ""assault and lies"" are not representative of Montana's values. Should Trump be worried about the mid-terms? The early signs these mid-terms are different A spokesperson for Mr Gianforte said on Thursday that he ""regrets what happened"" last year,according to the Billings Gazette,external. ""He's not perfect, he's taken personal responsibility, this has been widely covered, he's moved on."" Mr Gianforte, 56, pleaded guilty to assaulting a journalist from the UK's Guardian newspaper on the eve of his election last year. He was ordered to pay $385 (Â£304), complete 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management counselling. This video can not be played 'Get the hell out of here!' - listen to the reported attack Ben Jacobs, the reporter who was attacked after asking the candidate whether he supported the Republican healthcare plan, agreed not to sue Mr Gianforte if he wrote a letter of apology and donated $50,000 (Â£39,500) to the Committee to Protect Journalists. A letter sent by Mr Gianforte to Mr Jacobs later offered a ""sincere apology"". ""My physical response to your legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable and unlawful,"" it said. The CPJ confirmed that it accepted the donation,external. Amid an uproar on social media, Mr Trump's comments a year on have also prompted the campaign group CPJ to demand his apology. ""We are disturbed once again to see President Trump standing up for those who would attack the press,"" said Courtney Radsch, the CPJ's advocacy director. In a statement, the Guardian's US editor John Mulholland said he hoped the president would apologise for his comments, adding: ""To celebrate an attack on a journalist who was simply doing his job is an attack on the first amendment [of the US Constitution] by someone who has taken an oath to defend it."" He said the incident ""runs the risk of inviting other assaults on journalists"". On Friday, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa Maytold the Guardian,external: ""We would always say that any violence or intimidation against a journalist is completely unacceptable.""

US man 'fought snakes' to survive pitfall,"It took workers six hours to free the 62-year-old father from the mine An Arizona man has survived two days trapped alone in an abandoned mine shaft with rattlesnakes. He killed three of the snakes while waiting to be discovered, according to rescue crews. John Waddell, 62, was lowering himself into a 100ft (30m) gold mine shaft, when his equipment broke, said a friend who found him. Mr Waddell broke both his legs and survived for 48 hours with no food or water, officials say. Emergency teams worked for over six hours to remove him from the abandoned mine and airlift him to hospital. Terry Schrader, a friend of the victim, told local media that Mr Waddell had called him on Monday to tell him he was going into the mine to look for gold and precious metals, and asked that he check on him if he had not returned by Tuesday. A Western diamondback rattlesnake, which is common in Arizona On Wednesday he arrived at the mine, which is on Mr Waddell's property in Aguila - 90 miles (145km) northwest of downtown Phoenix. ""As I pulled out my truck I could hear him hollering. 'Help, help!'""he told ABC 15,external, expressing guilt that he had not checked on him sooner. The mine was in a remote location with no mobile phone service, so he had to drive out of the desert to call emergency officials, he said. The mineshaft is around 100ft deep Terry Schrader was the first to find the victim ""The carabiner broke I guess, and he supposedly fell 40 to 50 feet,"" said Mr Schrader, adding that his friend is ""a tough guy"". ""He's got both artificial knees. One of them is messed up,"" he said. Another friend, Mike Balowski,told KSAZ-TV,externalthat he believes Mr Waddell killed the rattlesnakes because he was hungry. He described him as an experienced ""miner by trade"" and said he spoke to him in the hospital on Thursday morning. ""I told him I was going to kick his rear end when he gets better for not being there with somebody,"" he said. There are 13 types of rattlesnakes that can be found in Arizona, according to state wildlife officials. Rattlesnakes are venomous and can kill an adult with just one bite. 'Hero' dog saves owner from rattlesnake Texas man bitten by severed snake head Man tries to kiss snake, then gets bitten Officials had to use hundreds of feet of rope to rig a pulley system in order to lift Mr Waddell out of the shaft. As he was raised to the surface, local media say he could be heard screaming in agony. Roger Yensen, Mountain Rescue Posse commander, called it a very challenging operation. He told reporters that one rescuer had to first abseil in to the shaft to assess Mr Waddell's injuries. He was found to be severely dehydrated, but able to speak, and had suffered possible ankle and leg fractures as well as friction burns to his hands - likely caused by gripping the rope. Sheriff Paul Penzone told the AP news agency that the rescue posse and the sheriff's search-and-rescue team saved Mr Waddell's life. ""Our men and women train year-round for this type of event,"" he said, ""and we are all grateful for this positive outcome.""

Khashoggi suspect had 'cyber spy' training,"Turkish media released CCTV pictures allegedly showing the Saudi 'hit squad' suspected of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance The BBC has uncovered new details about one of the men accused of murdering Jamal Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi journalist who was critical of his country's government. Turkish media identified Maher Abdulaziz Mutreb as being part of a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents who flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of Mr Khashoggi's disappearance from the city's Saudi consulate on 2 October. He is said to have spent two years working in London, with a source describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence to US news network CNN. And now BBC Arabic can reveal he was trained how to use offensive spyware technology on behalf of the Saudi state. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Saudi Arabia profile The source, who spoke to the BBC on condition of anonymity, has visually confirmed his identity from pictures circulated in the media in the days since Mr Khashoggi's disappearance. According to him, Mr Mutreb was introduced as ""an intelligence security operative"". The spyware trainers, however, nicknamed him ""dark face"". ""Because he looked always grumpy, like he was on the sad sideâ¦ he was very silent,"" the source added. Saudi Arabia denies any knowledge of what happened to Mr Khashoggi, insisting he left the consulate soon after getting routine paperwork. The European surveillance expert described how Mr Mutreb spent two weeks on a course with him in 2011, learning how to use the technology his company was providing the Saudi government so that it could carry out targeted attacks on the phones and computers of its own citizens. ""The training involved things like infecting a computer from potential targets of interest for intelligence and extracting information, so digital evidence, information about this person of interest. CCTV footage from Istanbul airport purports to show Maher Mutreb on 2 October ""This information might have been basically everything from [their] GPS position, conversation, microphone audio around the device itself, camera pictures, files on disk, emails, contacts, everything that was on the device itself."" During the training, which was in a military compound in the suburbs of Riyadh, the surveillance expert says Mr Mutreb ""used to come and go"" and ""almost didn't speak at all"". ""He wasn't one of the guys who was particularly skilled on the technical side,"" the spyware trainer explained. ""The group was split between those doing physical intelligenceâ¦ so cameras, microphones etc, and another group of people that were doing digital surveillanceâ¦ I believe that this guy was more on the physical surveillance than the digital surveillance."" A man identified as Maher Mutreb can be seen in the far right of a photo from Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman's visit to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology in March The tools he was trained in, the source said, were similar to other tools which, according to Citizenlab and Amnesty International, were recently used against several of Mr Khashoggi's friends. Mr Mutreb is believed to have spent two years working at the Saudi embassy in London.A document published by the British government in 2007,externallisted a man with that name as first secretary. However, he has also been named as a Saudi intelligence officer by several individuals, and some leaked documents. CNN spoke to a Saudi source in London who said he knew Mr Mutreb,external, describing him as a colonel in Saudi intelligence, while the popular Arabic app MenoM3ay - which enables users to see the names people have linked to phone numbers - lists a man with that name as a colonel in the royal court. On October 12 Wikileaks tweeted the Khashoggi Files, which included emails with the name of Mutreb and five other men who were supposed to have attended a course in Italy in 2011, run by an Italian company called Hacking Team. The emails were part of a dump of 400GB of data first released by Wikileaks in July 2015, which Hacking Team say was stolen from their internal network. The emails also included conversations that suggested the intelligence agencies Hacking Team worked with used it to spy on activists and journalists. Allow Twitter content?

By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent On Bondi Beach this morning, an astonishing sight. Harry and Meghan, sitting cross-legged in a  circle of fluorescently dressed men and women, talking about their experiences in an 'anti-bad-vibe circle'. At the end of it all, a group hug. For Meghan perhaps this was business as usual. Yoga and surfing and opening up in front of (and then hugging) strangers is par for the course for an enlightened Californian. But for the House of Windsor? For the sixth-in-line to the throne? Gosh. Wow. The times they are a-changin'. The duke and duchess were greeted by colourful outfits at Bondi Beach During the beach visit, the couple received gifts including a large teddy bear, a lifeguard jacket and a bunch of carrots. ""Oh my goodness, we've got some veggies,"" Meghan said to Harry, who replied: ""Fantastic"". The duke then moved on to his challenge at Sydney Harbour Bridge. This video can not be played Prince Harry climbs Sydney Harbour Bridge to watch the unfurling of the 2018 Invictus Games flag.

Man who 'dislikes cows' in dairy fightClive Shaw is fighting his parents in the High Court over his right to inherit the family farm.Lincolnshire,"Whaley Farm, in New York, Lincolnshire, is at the centre of the dispute A dairy farmer's son who ""doesn't like cows"" is fighting his parents in the High Court over his right to inherit the family farm. Clive Shaw, 55, said he had worked on the farm in New York, Lincolnshire, from the age of seven, and was promised that it would be his. But after the family fell out his parents wrote him out of their wills. The court heard Mr Shaw had not worked hard enough and was in a relationship with ""a gold digger"". For the parents, Gillian and Walt Shaw, both 78, barrister Katherine Hallett claimed their son had exaggerated the extent of the work he did on the farm. ""He would keep out of the way when his father was working with the herd,"" she told London's High Court. Latest news and stories from across Lincolnshire His sister, Cheryl Hughes, told the court he would often say things like cows were ""stinking, horrible, rotten creatures"". ""You frequently said to members of your family that you hated the cows,"" Ms Hallett put to Mr Shaw. He replied: ""I said I didn't like them - I didn't hate them."" Mr Shaw told the court he started work on the farm when he ""was in short pants"" and had given much of his life to the business. His barrister, Leslie Blohm QC, said he had performed ""arduous"" work for relatively little money over many years on the understanding that he would inherit the business. ""Mrs Shaw has a history of finding fault with her son's partners, and the present dispute has been prompted by her belief that Ms Hollis is a gold digger,"" he added. The court also heard Mr Shaw now runs an American show-truck business from the site of the farm and lives in a caravan. Judge John Linwood has reserved his decision until a later date.

Rudd: I'd like to be home secretary again,"Amber Rudd has said she would ""quite like"" to be home secretary again ""because there's a few things I'd like to do a bit better than last time"". Ms Rudd quit the role in April, saying she had ""inadvertently misled"" MPs over the Windrush scandal. She wished she had looked into immigration enforcement ""much earlier"" but had been misled by some civil servants, she told the BBC. ""Unfortunately I was told certain things that turned out not to be true."" The Windrush generation had been encouraged to settle in the UK from the late 1940s to 1973 but, in many cases, were wrongly being declared illegal immigrants. Ms Rudd, then home secretary, apologised at the time but her handling of the crisis was criticised as she sought to defend the wider impact of the government's ""hostile environment"" policy, designed to deter illegal immigration. Formal apology for Windrush members Who are the Windrush generation? Amber Rudd resigns as home secretary During one appearance before a Commons committee, she said there were no removals targets for illegal immigrants - comments subsequently contradicted by a 2015 inspection report. She later admitted ""local"" targets for voluntary removals had been set but told the Commons she had not been aware of them. This was subsequently contradicted by a June 2017 memo from an official, copied to Ms Rudd, that referred to targets. Ms Ruddtold Nick Robinson's Political Thinkingpodcast she should have done more to find out what was happening but when she started ""really probing... it became evident that [officials] didn't know what was going on."" The government has reviewed 11,800 Windrush generation cases She added ""I was told certain things that turned out not to be true"". ""Even at the time when I resigned, I was still being told it's unlikely that we have illegally deported anybody. ""And a week later, the new home secretary announced we had 64. So they just didn't know what the facts were."" She said it had made her more sceptical about civil servants - although she praised those she worked with on counter-terrorism as ""fantastic"". Ms Rudd said she was trying to ""play a part"", as a backbencher, in ""delivering on Brexit in a way that supports the economy and supports our communities"". But she was still interested in returning to frontline politics. ""I would quite like to be home secretary again, if I ever got the opportunity, because there's a few things I'd like to do a bit better than last time. ""I would like to get immigration enforcement right. I think that there is a problem there and it needs some really careful analysis and a brutal look at who's doing what and who's got what powers where."" Her successor as home secretary, Sajid Javid, said in August that a review of 11,800 Windrush cases showed 164 people may have been wrongfully deported or detained. He issued a formal apology to the 18 of those ""most likely to have suffered detriment"".

Depressed? The places not to live if you need help,"A flagship NHS mental health service is failing patients in one in seven areas of England, research by the BBC shows. People with conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are entitled to psychological therapies, such as counselling. The NHS is meant to successfully treat half of the people it sees. But an analysis of official NHS data showed this was not the case in 28 of the 195 local areas of the country in the first six months of this year. There is a threefold variation in recovery rates between different places, with experts saying if such differences existed in heart bypass surgery there would be an outcry. Psychologists said some areas were not properly funding services, meaning patients are offered fewer appointments than they really need. However, NHS England said the programme - called Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) - was one of the most ambitious of its kind in the world and had helped hundreds of thousands of people overcome depression and anxiety. It said despite the problems in some areas, overall IAPT was successfully treating more than half of patients across the whole population. The findings come as the BBC has re-launched its NHS Tracker, which provides information about the performance of local services, including mental health for the first time.  Karla and Imran have both struggled with their mental health. But they have had different experiences in the NHS. Karla, from Derby, said she got treatment for depression and anxiety quickly and is now in recovery. She was given a talking therapy, known as cognitive behavioural therapy. ""It has taught me how to express things in healthier ways. Now I don't bottle things up so much. ""It gave me the strength to say, 'you know what, it's going to hurt and it's going to get worse'. Before I didn't talk to anyone. Therapy taught me to accept this is what it is. ""It's given me my life back."" Imran (not his real name) has had a very different experience to Karla, and - six years on from first seeking help for his mental health issues - he is still struggling to access effective ongoing support. During that time, he has had contact with a wide range of professionals, his GP, social workers and housing support staff - which ""didn't amount to anything"". He was also referred to a psychiatrist, and later CBT. None of it has worked for him, and he says it can be hard to negotiate ""the system"" when you are also dealing with symptoms. ""There's a lot of pressure on you. It's really hard."" You can read more about Karla and Imran's storieshere. For those with mild to moderate mental health problems, the NHS runs a counselling service called IAPT. It is available in every part of the country after being launched 10 years ago. About 550,000 patients suffering from conditions such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are treated by the service every year. They are given support ranging from telephone advice from trained therapists to group and one-to-one talking therapies. Prof David Clark, clinical adviser to NHS England for IAPT and one of the architects of the programme, said it is ""widely recognised as the most ambitious programme of talking therapies in the world"". The treatment should help half to recover - defined as no longer being clinically mentally ill by the time they are discharged. The NHS has struggled to achieve this since the programme was launched in 2008, but improvements have been made and nationally it was achieved last year for the first time. Since then it has almost continuously been hit. Prof Clark said on others measures, including how long people wait for treatment to start, the service was also achieving its targets proving it was a highly successful scheme. And he added ""most importantly it has helped of hundreds of thousands of people to overcome their depression and anxiety, and better manage their mental health"". But that progress masks the fact some local areas have been struggling. Figures are published every three months by NHS area. There are 195 areas run by clinical commissioning groups and in 28 of them, fewer than half of patients were successfully treated during both the January to March and April to June periods. Another 27 failed in at least one quarter. If you look at the April to June period there was a threefold difference between the best and worst. In Luton, fewer than one in four patients were successfully treated. In Wirral, part of Merseyside, it was only one in three. By comparison, more than two-thirds of patients in Stoke were no longer ill by the time they were discharged. Both Luton and Wirral NHS bosses cited high numbers of people on the waiting list as a factor - meaning people have been waiting longer for treatment to start. They both said they had been making progress on this though. Psychologists say that like many parts of the NHS, services have been squeezed. They say some areas put more resources than others into the programme - and that means patients are sometimes discharged before they are ready. Clinical psychologist Dr Ryan Kemp is a director of therapies at Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, which runs services across north-west London and in Milton Keynes. He said that while the NHS should be ""proud"" of the progress that has been made, he had concerns. He said in some places the funding was ""minimal"", which put ""pressure to move people out of the service"". Patients who have not recovered may be put on drugs or referred on to services for more complex problems, such as psychiatry, but experts say there are long waits for these services. Consultant psychologist Dr Mike Scott, who has written and researched extensively about talking therapies, says: ""The fact there is such a variation in recovery rates raises questions. If you had this with heart bypass surgery, there would be real suspicions. ""There needs to be an independent assessment."" He believes the true recovery rate may actually be much lower, because the way treatment is assessed is not robust enough. ""I have done research on this and the recovery rate is much more like 15%. The service is provided on the cheap. ""Patients do not get enough sessions."" The 28 areas of the country which did not successfully treat half of patients receiving psychological therapies in the first six months of this year are: NHS Blackburn with Darwen NHS Bradford City NHS Brighton & Hove NHS Corby NHS Dudley NHS East Lancashire NHS Fareham & Gosport NHS Greater Huddersfield NHS Guildford & Waverley NHS Harrow NHS Havering NHS Leicester City NHS Luton NHS Manchester NHS Merton NHS Nene NHS North East Lincolnshire NHS North Hampshire NHS Norwich NHS Redbridge NHS Salford NHS Somerset NHS South Eastern Hampshire NHS South Sefton NHS Southwark NHS Vale Royal NHS Wakefield NHS Wirral Data analysis by Christine Jeavans and Ros Anning Male suicide rates at new UK low Sharp drop in UK suicide rates Helping men 'struggling with life' Samaritans - Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

How Huddersfield grooming gang operated,"The abuse took place in and around Huddersfield between 2004 and 2011 A gang of men who abused vulnerable teenage girls in Huddersfield has been given lengthy jail sentences. How did these sex offenders from West Yorkshire, who were convicted of more than 120 offences against 15 girls, operate? The men, who are all British Asians mainly of Pakistani heritage, groomed girls by making them feel special, then plying them with alcohol, cannabis and other drugs. They then used violence and threats to control them, on one occasion threatening to bomb a girl's family home. The victims were often taken to parties where they were given drink and drugs and forced to have sex with men who were sometimes decades older than them. On other occasions they were sexually assaulted in car parks, above takeaways, at snooker clubs and in parks around West Yorkshire. Some were raped and abused as part of ""truth or dare games"" while others were abandoned on the moors late at night if they refused to do what they were told. One girl was raped by the gang's leader as punishment for ""showing him up"" after she refused to perform a sex act on another man in the back of a car. The same girl was also forced to have an abortion and told the court she had no idea whose baby it was. Another girl was abducted from the children's home she was staying in and taken and abused on the moors when she was just 12. The men, all from Yorkshire, went by nicknames including ""Dracula"", ""Bully"", ""Beastie"" and ""Nurse"" A large amount of the grooming and abuse was carried out by the gang's ringleader Amere Singh Dhaliwal, a Sikh man who was known by the nickname Pretos. The now-married father-of-two was convicted of attacks on 11 of the 15 girls. His treatment of his victims was described by Judge Marson as ""inhuman"". The other men - aged between 27 and 54 - were equally described as ""predatory and perverted"". In total 20 men, from Huddersfield, Sheffield, Bradford and Dewsbury, have beenconvicted and sentencedfor their part in the abuse. The court heard many other perpetrators have not been identified and girls spoke of being abused by men they heard being called ""Mangos"" - a term used for men from Pakistan who did not really speak English. Prosecutor Richard Wright QC told the court: ""These men cared only for themselves and viewed these girls as objects to be used an abused at will. ""These men did not only control the girls by grooming them, they were also quite capable of employing threats of violence if the need arose, on occasion using violence and threats to control them and force them into sexual activity against their will."" In total 15 girls aged between 11 and 17 fell victim to the gang. Many of them were socially isolated and as such became ""easy targets for abuse"", the court heard. Among the victims were girls with mild learning disabilities, girls who were bullied at school; one girl's mother was completely unable to look after her because of her own drink and drug problems. As a result they often craved the attention they were given, leaving them unable to see what was being done to them until it was too late. The court heard some of the victims felt they were in genuine relationships, such was the extent to which they had been groomed. Over the course of the three trials jurors listened as the gang's victims recounted how they had been groomed and exploited over many years, unable to escape. ""I suppose when you're young and you get bullied at school you do sort of like the attention, and things getting bought for you and stuff, but then once you were in with them you couldn't get out of it,"" one girl said. ""They got your trust and then stuff would start happening to you. I was constantly getting raped and beaten up."" Another, when asked why she kept going back to the men said: ""They just threatened me - 'I'm coming to pick you up now and if you don't come, I'm coming to get your mum'."" Such was the men's hold over the girls one woman said her daughter cracked her head jumping from a first floor balcony at their home in order to get out. The girl later told police: ""Every time I went out something bad happened. I risked my life every time. I was a mess."" One victim, who only escaped her abusers when her family was forced to move out of the area following a house fire, said: ""It was the best thing I ever did, and that's bad saying that burning your house down is the best thing you ever did."" Speaking to detectives many years later one girl said: ""I always bugged myself - 'why did I go back?' - and I still cannot answer that question. ""For years and years I blamed myself that it was my fault I went back, [but] they're quite manipulative and when you're in that situation you're so pressured, you feel so stupid and dirty and horrible."" This video can not be played Nazir Afzal, the prosecutor in the Rochdale grooming gang in 2012, tells Radio 4's PM programme that the fear of being called racist should not be used as an excuse for not investigating these men Victims and their families say they repeatedly told police and the authorities what was happening at the time but that it had fallen on deaf ears. One woman said she had even written to the Prime Minister. One girl said when she tried to tell two officers who took her to hospital after she was assaulted by one of her abusers they told her ""you must have wanted it"". The first allegations to be taken seriously surfaced in 2011 when a victim wrote a letter to a judge outlining the abuse she had suffered, but she did not make a formal complaint. It was not until 2013 that another victim came forward to police to make formal allegations against two gang members, Nasarat Hussain and Irfan Ahmed. Over the following three years dozens of girls and men were interviewed. Then in March 2017 a total of 29 people were initially charged as part of what became known as Operation Tendersea. Details of the convictions and lengthy jail sentences imposed can only now be reported as a blanket ban on coverage put in place in November 2017 was lifted following an application by the media. The press restrictions were put in place under the 1981 Contempt of Court Act, which allows a judge to stop reporting of a case to avoid prejudice and protect the integrity of the hearing or any future hearings. That ban on coverage, however, has attracted criticism from certain groups, including those with links to the far-right. In May, the former leader of the English Defence League Tommy Robinson was jailed for 13 months after he admitted a charge of contempt for filming outside Leeds Crown Court during the second of three trials. The footage, lasting about an hour-and-a-half, of Robinson discussing the trial was watched 250,000 times within hours of being posted as a Facebook Live. On appeal, however, Robinson's conviction was quashed because of a number of procedural errors, though he faces a fresh hearing in relation to the alleged breach later this year.

Man who 'dislikes cows' in dairy fight,"Whaley Farm, in New York, Lincolnshire, is at the centre of the dispute A dairy farmer's son who ""doesn't like cows"" is fighting his parents in the High Court over his right to inherit the family farm. Clive Shaw, 55, said he had worked on the farm in New York, Lincolnshire, from the age of seven, and was promised that it would be his. But after the family fell out his parents wrote him out of their wills. The court heard Mr Shaw had not worked hard enough and was in a relationship with ""a gold digger"". For the parents, Gillian and Walt Shaw, both 78, barrister Katherine Hallett claimed their son had exaggerated the extent of the work he did on the farm. ""He would keep out of the way when his father was working with the herd,"" she told London's High Court. Latest news and stories from across Lincolnshire His sister, Cheryl Hughes, told the court he would often say things like cows were ""stinking, horrible, rotten creatures"". ""You frequently said to members of your family that you hated the cows,"" Ms Hallett put to Mr Shaw. He replied: ""I said I didn't like them - I didn't hate them."" Mr Shaw told the court he started work on the farm when he ""was in short pants"" and had given much of his life to the business. His barrister, Leslie Blohm QC, said he had performed ""arduous"" work for relatively little money over many years on the understanding that he would inherit the business. ""Mrs Shaw has a history of finding fault with her son's partners, and the present dispute has been prompted by her belief that Ms Hollis is a gold digger,"" he added. The court also heard Mr Shaw now runs an American show-truck business from the site of the farm and lives in a caravan. Judge John Linwood has reserved his decision until a later date.

Plastic recycling firms face investigation,"The plastics recycling industry faces an investigation amid reports firms are illegally profiting from the market and in some cases polluting rivers. The Environment Agency, the regulator, confirmed it had set up an investigative team and was pursuing ""several lines of enquiry"". It comes as councils cut back their plastics recycling services amid a fall in demand for exports to China. Importers are said to be worried about high contamination levels in UK waste. Britain sends about two-thirds of its plastic packaging waste abroad every year, including plastic bottles, yoghurt pots and other items. Exporters charge retailers and manufacturers a rate per tonne for plastic waste, and retailers are allowed to use these payments as proof they are meeting their recycling obligations. But MPs have criticised the system for being open to fraud. As first reported by the Guardian,,externalallegations the Environment Agency (EA) is understood to be investigating include: Exporters are illegally claiming for tens of thousands of tonnes of plastic waste which might not exist Plastic waste is not being recycled and is being left to leak into rivers and oceans UK firms accused of shipping contaminated waste - when non-recyclable items are mixed in with recyclables items - are being allowed to continue exporting. According to the Guardian, data passed to the EA shows a huge difference between the amount of packaging exports recorded by HM Customs, compared with the amount UK exporters claim to have shipped. The newspaper, which analysed the data, said British exporters claimed to have exported 35,135 tonnes more plastic than HM Customs recorded. It also reported that six UK exporters of plastic waste have had their licences suspended or cancelled in the last three months. One had had 57 containers of plastic waste stopped at UK ports over the last three years due to concerns over contamination. The UK plastic waste export industry is said to be worth Â£50m year. An EA spokesman did not comment on specific claims, but said: ""Waste crime damages lives, livelihoods and the environment. ""We have a specialist central investigative team and dedicated staff up and down the country who tackle it. We take seriously all allegations of fraud and... will bring fraudsters and criminals to justice."" All the plastic you can and cannot recycle Is your plastic REALLY being recycled? Councils are cutting back their plastic recycling services. A National Audit Office inquiry earlier this year warned that the current system was open to abuse and was not being monitored properly. It said that the financial incentive for companies to fraudulently claim they had recycled plastic packaging was ""higher than for any other material"". ""There is therefore a risk that some of it is not recycled under equivalent standards to the UK and is instead sent to landfill or contributes to pollution,"" it said. On top of that, this year, five export firms flagged as high risk are still operating and 33 considered to be of medium risk are also still accredited to export waste. It comes after China and Vietnam have stopped importing foreign plastic waste amid concerns about high contamination levels. This has had a knock-on effect on UK local authorities, many of which have cut their plastic recycling services amid a build-up of waste. Basingstoke and Deane Borough Council has told residents to recycle only plastic bottles, leaving all other plastics in normal rubbish bins. And Swindon Borough Councilhas told residents to put mixed plastic waste,external, such as yoghurt pots, into their regular bins so it can be incinerated and turned into fuel.

Police force admits restraining offence,"Thomas Orchard was found unconscious in a cell and later died in hospital A police force has pleaded guilty to breaking health and safety rules over the use of an emergency response belt. Devon and Cornwall Police were charged in relation to the death of Thomas Orchard who was arrested and restrained by officers in Exeter in October 2012. The force admitted the breach on the basis that there were failings on how officers were trained to use the emergency restraint belt. It has not accepted that the belt led directly to Mr Orchard's death. Latest news and stories from Devon There will be a hearing in April 2019 when a judge will rule on whether the conduct led to his death. This is the first time that a police force has admitted breaching the Health and Safety at Work Act in connection with the death of a member of the public. Shaun Sawyer, the chief constable, appeared at Bristol Crown Court on behalf of the force and entered a guilty plea to the single charge against it. Mr Orchard was found unconscious at Heavitree Road Police Station In a statement afterwards, he said: ""In respect of the use of the emergency restraint belt, it is my belief that the standards expected by Devon and Cornwall Police were not met between 2002 and 2012 and did not meet the legal threshold of the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974."" Ken Orchard, Thomas's father, said: ""Having watched and listened to much evidence over the years we are shocked and horrified that they are still denying that those failings in any way contributed to Thomas's death. ""Despite the claims of the chief constable we see very little actual evidence of remorse therefore, whilst the family does not relish the prospect of yet another hearing, we are pleased that the defendant's denial its criminal conduct caused Thomas's death will now be tested in open court."" Solicitor Helen Stone, representing Mr Orchard's family, said the failure of the force to accept that the breach of health and safety rules caused Thomas Orchard's death was ""deeply concerning"". Mr Orchard, 32, who had paranoid schizophrenia, died in hospital a week after he suffered a cardiac arrest at Heavitree Road police station in Exeter. Force charged over custody death Officers face hearings over custody death How are belt restraints used in the UK? During his detention he was restrained and an Emergency Response Belt was placed across his face. He was then left in a locked cell, where he lay apparently motionless for 12 minutes before custody staff re-entered and commenced CPR. In March 2017,a custody sergeant and two staff members from Devon and Cornwall Police were acquittedof Mr Orchard's manslaughter by gross negligence. In April 2018, the Crown Prosecution Service announced it hadcharged the office of the chief constableof the force under the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974.

Radical preacher Anjem Choudary released,"Anjem Choudary pictured outside a bail hostel after his release Radical preacher Anjem Choudary, jailed for inviting support for the Islamic State group, has been released. The cleric was sentenced in 2016 to five and a half years in prison. He led an extremist network linked to violent jihadists, including one of the killers of soldier Lee Rigby in 2013. Choudary, 51, has served less than half of his sentence and will complete the rest under strict supervision. Up to 25 measures to control him have been prepared, the BBC understands. His release from prison comes approximately four months early because of time spent bailed on an electronic tag before his conviction. Choudary, from Ilford in east London, once headed up the al-Muhajiroun network - a leading extremist group which was banned under terrorism laws. The father-of-five did not organise terror attacks, but is considered one of the UK's most prominent radicalisers. He has been described as a ""hardened dangerous terrorist"" and someone who has had a ""huge influence on Islamist extremism in this country"" by former Met Police terror chief Richard Walton. Read more: Who is Anjem Choudary and why was he in prison? The BBC has learnt from counter-extremism sources that Anjem Choudary refused to take part in deradicalisation courses or exercises while serving the custodial part of his sentence. He spent most of his time at HMP Frankland, County Durham, where he became the first inmate to be held in a separation unit, designed for the most high-risk terrorism offenders who are capable of radicalising others. On a number of occasions, Choudary was offered opportunities to speak to mainstream religious leaders and other experts who have successfully turned around the mindset of other extremists. But on each of those occasions, Choudary refused. Nevertheless, the prison authorities were not able to delay his release. His departure from Belmarsh prison came automatically under legislation that allows prisoners to serve the second part of their sentence ""on licence"" in the community. This means he will not be free but must comply with a list of conditions. If he breaches them, he risks being recalled to prison. Police will be closely monitoring Choudary - through probation officers and a requirement that he report to officials. Cars were seen leaving HMP Belmarsh in Woolwich, south-east London, early on Friday morning Choudary is staying at a bail hostel in north London. He will be in a probation hostel for six months, the BBC understands. The conditions he must obey include: A ban from preaching at or attending certain mosques He will only be allowed to associate with people who have been approved by the authorities He will be allowed one phone and is banned from using an internet-enabled device without permission Use of the internet will be supervised He cannot travel outside Greater London's M25 He will not be able to leave the UK without permission. Earlier this week, it was announced Choudary had his assets frozen andwas listed on a global record of known terrorists,externaloverseen by the United Nations Security Council. The asset-freezing order means he will be under extremely strict financial controls which typically mean the authorities will be alerted if he tries to open a bank account or move money. This video can not be played The former head of counter-terror at the Met police speaks to Newsnight ahead of Anjem Choudary's release Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that authorities including the police, prison and probation service had ""significant experience in dealing with such offenders"". But John Woodcock, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee,tweeted that his release was ""wrong"", ""crazy"" and ""puts the public in danger"",external. Calling on Home Secretary Sajid Javid to take a tougher counter-terror approach, using Australian law as an example, Mr Woodcock added: ""He needs to act fast to protect the public from terrorists being released back onto British streets."" Sir Mark Rowley, the former UK head of counter-terror policing, said it is important ""not to overstate his [Choudary's] significance"". ""At the end of the day he's a pathetic groomer of others, that's what he has done in the past,"" said Mr Rowley. ""He's not some sort of evil genius we all need to be afraid of."" By BBC home affairs correspondent, Dominic Casciani When Choudary was charged in 2015 with inviting support for IS, it was a moment of great success for counter-terrorism chiefs - and they were already trying to build cases against other associates. Some, including close confidantes, were jailed. At least four others, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure (TPim), a form of control that places two years of restrictions on the movements and activities of terrorism suspects who have not been charged with a crime. Detectives also looked for evidence of standard crimes - such as fraud - as a means to further ""disrupt"" the network. The insider view is that this work has been generally successful because it made the targets aware they could no longer act with impunity. In theory, it created space for the security service MI5 and their police detective colleagues to focus on more urgent threats.

ÃÂ£75m bonus boss walks off over pay question,"This video can not be played Last year Persimmon's previous chief executive refused to answer questions about his pay The boss of house building firm Persimmon has walked off in the middle of a BBC interview after being asked about his Â£75m bonus. ""I'd rather not talk about that,"" Jeff Fairburn said, when asked if he had regrets about last year's payout. The Â£75m, which was reduced from Â£100m after a public outcry, is believed to be the largest by a listed UK firm. Mr Fairburn has previously said he will give a ""substantial proportion"" of the bonus to charity. The scale of the bonus last year drew widespread criticism from investors, politicians, charities and corporate governance experts. They argued the unusually high bonus didn't reflect executives' hard work, but was driven largely by circumstances, including rising house prices and the government's house-buying incentive scheme Help to Buy. Labour MP Rachel Reeves, who chairs the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy Select Committee, said it was ""unfortunate"" that ""Mr Fairburn thinks he is above answering questions about his extravagant gains and the cost to the public purse"". The bonus scheme for top executives at the firm was linked to the company's share price. The long term incentive plan was set up in 2012, when the shares were trading at about Â£4 each. Executives were rewarded in shares, which they could cash in after a certain period. By the time they were due to be awarded last year, the shares were trading about six times higher than this, at Â£24. Crucially, the reward scheme did not include a cap, meaning the payout was potentially unlimited. A combination of rising house prices, low interest rates enabling people to borrow more cheaply and government incentive schemes have been credited with driving all housebuilder shares higher. The government's Help to Buy equity loan scheme was introduced shortly after the bonus scheme was established. It allowed people to buy a new home with a deposit of just 5% of the cost and a low-interest equity loan from the government. Critics argued that the scheme was the main reason Persimmon's share price had risen so far so quickly, and said that the firm's executives were unfairly benefiting from a government subsidy. Vince Cable, the leader of the Liberal Democrats, said the bonus was ""obscene"" and ""reminiscent of the worst excesses of corporate greed that helped to create the financial crisis, when short-termism was heavily incentivised and long-term planning ignored"". Initially in 2012, the bonus scheme was approved by the majority (85%) of investors. However, once the scale of the awards became clear, shareholders complained. Aberdeen Standard Investments, the sixth-largest shareholder in Persimmon, called the reward package ""grossly excessive"". By the end of last year, both Persimmon's chairman and the head of the remuneration committee had resigned after admitting the plan was poorly designed and should have included a bonus cap. Then in February, Mr Fairburn agreed to cut his windfall to Â£75m. At the firm'sannual meeting in April,some 48.5% of investors voted against the housebuilder's remuneration report. The firm's interim chair, Nigel Mill, apologised and admitted it ""could have all have been handled better... it should have been."" But he also said that no-one could have predicted that the ""performance of the business would be so good over such a long period of time"".

Briton faces jail for Thai gate graffiti,"The graffiti was scrawled on the Tha Phae Gate in the city of Chiang Mai A British tourist accused of spray painting his name on a historic landmark in Thailand could face 10 years in prison. Local police said Lee Furlong, 23, from Liverpool, has admitted defacing Tha Phae Gate in the city of Chiang Mai. Video appears to show a man spraying ""Scouser Lee"" on the gate, part of which dates back to the 13th Century. Supt Teerasak Sriprasert said Mr Furlong would be charged with ""vandalising an archaeological site"". A Canadian woman, Brittney Schneider, has also been arrested and charged with vandalism for allegedly adding her first initial to graffiti on the gate. ""They will face no more than 10 years' jail [and/or] a fine of no more than a million baht (about Â£23,555),"" Supt Sriprasert said. ""They admitted to the crime, saying they did it because of the thrill and they were also a little bit drunk."" Brittney Schneider and Lee Furlong were taken back to the scene by police A Foreign and Commonwealth Office spokesperson said its staff were ""providing assistance to a British man following his arrest in Thailand"" and ""are in touch with the local authorities"". Thai media reported CCTV from a nearby cafe shows four people approaching the gate at about 04:00 on Thursday. Two of them approach the wall and one begins to spray it. Mr Furlong reportedly told detectives he and his group were drunk and walking back to their guesthouse when he picked up a discarded spray can and used it before his companion. After being indentified the following day, he and Ms Schneider were arrested at their guesthouse and taken on a re-enactment to the Northern gate, one of five historical gates in the city, according to Thai PBS. The other two people shown in the video were not arrested. Chiang Mai is Thailand's fourth-largest city and tourists can visit the historic walled parts of the city.

How will the petrol and diesel ban work?,"A ban on the sale of new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars is to be brought forward, the government says. So how could the move help the UK meet its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050? And what does it mean for drivers? The ban is being introduced in 2035 - five years earlier than previously planned. Experts said the original target of 2040 would be too late if the UK wanted to achieve its target of emitting virtually zero carbon by 2050. The ban is also being expanded to hybrid cars and plug-in hybrids, which had not been included under the original proposals. As a result, people will be able to buy only electric or hydrogen cars and vans. About a third of CO2 emissions in the UK come from transport. So the ban on conventional car sales will certainly help move the UK towards the net-zero target the government announced in 2019. The Committee on Climate Change, which advises government, said if other countries followed the UK, there was a 50-50 chance of staying below the recommended temperature rise of 1.5C by 2100. This is considered the threshold for dangerous climate change. However, banning new petrol, diesel and hybrid cars won't be enough on its own. The government will also need to tackle the emissions coming from energy generation. These are almost as high as from transport and come from things such as industry and people's homes. Emissions of nitrogen oxides (Nox) - which come from car exhausts - regularly exceed safe levels in many cities. Diesel vehicles produce the overwhelming majority of roadside Nox gases. So removing petrol and diesel vehicles from the roads should help bring air qualitywithin the guidelines set out by the World Health Organization (WHO),external. Air pollution has been a concern for decades. But the issue gained renewed urgency when the UK government lost court cases over its plans to reduce nitrogen-dioxide levels. As a result,ministers were ordered by the courts to produce a new plan to tackle Nox levels. The discussion was complicatedwhen carmakers were found to be cheating emissions tests. But in recent years, scientists have become more certain about the ways air pollution harms people.Studies have linked it to heart disease and lung problems,external, as well as other conditions. A really simple guide to climate change The five major challenges facing electric vehicles Rise of SUVs 'makes mockery' of electric car push The Committee on Climate Change believes the cost of electric cars will be similar to that of petrol or diesel vehicles by 2024-25. But for now, electric cars are more expensive than their petrol or diesel counterparts. That's because battery technology is still developing and production requires expensive raw materials and engineers. The UK's most popular electric car, the Nissan Leaf, costs Â£26,000 for a basic model. The government does provide a Â£3,500 subsidy but for many motorists, the cost is still too high. Some experts say a more radical approach, such as no VAT on electric cars, would create a surge in demand. A scheme like this exists in Norway, where 2019 saw a huge increase in people opting for electric cars. At present, there is a very small second-hand market for electric cars. That's because they make up less than 1% of the total number of cars on UK roads. If we're to switch to electric cars, the speed of installing charging points will have to radically increase, to cope with demand. It has been estimated theUK needs to have 25 million charging points for electric vehicles. There are now nearly 11,000 places in the UK where you can charge electric vehicles. While there are parts of the country where the number of charging points is keeping up with demand, more are needed in many places. And there are other potential problems. For example, where will power points be sited? Will roads have to be dug up for cabling? Will drivers have to share power points, and so be restricted to certain charging times? People who live in flats, or houses without driveways, could struggle to charge their electric cars at home. It is hoped charge points installed in lampposts next to parking bays could help but rollout so far has been limited. There is also a need for more rapid-charging points, for people on long journeys and those who haven't charged overnight. There is currently no UK-wide scrappage scheme in place for petrol and diesel cars and it is unclear if the government is considering this. In London, the city's Mayor, Sadiq Khan, announced a Â£25m scrappage scheme to take older polluting cars and motorbikes off its streets, to reduce CO2 pollution. You will still be able to buy a second-hand petrol or diesel car in 2035 and drive one you currently own. There could even be a boom in petrol or diesel sales in 2034, as motorists prepare to buy combustion engines for the final time.

Assange takes legal action against Ecuador,"Julian Assange has lived in Ecuador's UK embassy since 2012 Julian Assange is to launch legal action against the government of Ecuador, accusing it of violating his ""fundamental rights and freedoms"". The Wikileaks co-founder has lived in its UK embassy since 2012 after seeking asylum to avoid extradition to Sweden over a rape inquiry - later dropped. He was given a set of house rules by the London embassy this week, including taking better care of his cat. Mr Assange faces arrest for allegedly breaching bail conditions if he leaves. Profile: Julian Assange Timeline: Julian Assange saga Assange given feline ultimatum by Ecuador Wikileaks lawyer Baltasar Garzon is in Ecuador to launch the case, which the Press Association reports is expected to be heard in court next week. Wikileaks said the country's government had threatened to remove the protection Mr Assange has had since being granted political asylum. It added that his access to the outside world had been ""summarily cut off"". In a memo, it threatened to confiscate the pet if he did not look after it, it said. Mr Assange was given the cat by his children The embassy did remove Mr Assange's internet connection in March, accusing him of ""interfering in other countries' affairs"". However, earlier this week it said it would be partially restored. In a statement, Wikileaks said: ""Ecuador's measures against Julian Assange have been widely condemned by the human rights community."" It claims the government of Ecuador refused a visit by Human Rights Watch general counsel Dinah PoKempner and had not allowed several meetings with his lawyers. Mr Assange's lawyers also said they were challenging the legality of the Ecuador government's ""special protocol"" - which makes his political asylum dependent on ""censoring"" his freedom of opinion, speech and association. Lawyers for Mr Assange claim the protocol: Requires journalists, Mr Assange's lawyers and anyone else looking to see him to disclose private or political details - such as the serial numbers and codes of their phones and tablets The protocol says the government may ""share"" the information ""with other agencies"" Allows the embassy to seize the property of Mr Assange or his visitors and, without a warrant, hand it over to UK authorities Wikileaks said that US congressmen had written an open letter to Ecuador's president, Lenin Moreno, about the situation. It claims the document said that in order to advance crucial matters - such as economic co-operation, counternarcotics assistance and the possible return of a USAID mission to Ecuador - they must first resolve a ""significant challenge"" - the status of Mr Assange. Swedish police first issued a warrant for Mr Assange in August 2010 and he was arrested in London in December that year. The UK's Supreme Court ruled in May 2012 that he should be extradited to the country to face two separate allegations - one of rape and one of molestation. But Mr Assange said the claims were ""without basis"" and by June he was in the Ecuadorian embassy. Ecuador granted him asylum in August 2012, saying it feared his human rights might be violated if he was extradited. In May 2017, Sweden's director of public prosecutions confirmed the investigation had been dropped. And in July 2018, the UK and Ecuador confirmed they were holding ongoing talks over the whistleblower's fate. However, a warrant for Mr Assange's arrest - issued in 2012 after he failed to surrender to a court when his extradition was approved - remains in place.

Facebook and Twitter 'too slow' on meddling,"Jack Dorsey and Sheryl Sandberg appeared at the hearing in Washington DC Facebook and Twitter have said that they took too long to tackle foreign campaigns to meddle in US elections. Responding to lawmakers, Facebook's chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg said the social network was ""too slow"" to act on election interference. Twitter's chief executive Jack Dorsey said his platform was ""unprepared and ill-equipped"" for the ""weaponisation"" of debate. Google did not show up to the Senate Intelligence Committee hearing. Opening the hearing, Democratic senator Mark Warner said he was ""deeply disappointed"" that Google ""chose not to send its own top corporate leadership"". An empty chair was left for Google The senate committee focused on what the technology giants were doing to prevent future election meddling. It followed claims that Russia and other foreign actors spread misinformation and propaganda ahead of the 2016 presidential election. ""With the benefit of hindsight, it is obvious that serious mistakes were made by both Facebook and Twitter. You, like the US government, were caught flat-footed by the brazen attacks on our election.  Even after the election, you were reluctant to admit there was a problem,"" said Mr Warner. He warned that the social networks could face new regulations. ""The era of the wild west in social media is coming to an end. Where we go from here is an open question,"" he told the hearing. by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter at the Capitol Building The empty chair left for Google is what those in the public relations business refer to as ""terrible optics"". In other words, it really didn't look good. Google was accused of not taking the issue seriously enough to bother to send a senior executive - though I suspect Google's gamble was more about avoiding the inevitable questions about its plans in China. Of the companies that did turn up, this hearing felt like what we'd seen before. Senators' questions - while marginally more informed than in previous hearings - failed to land any serious punches. The companies now know the cheat codes that get them through these hearings: admit mistakes, pledge to do better, offer to work on regulation. But I felt the self-described ""shy"" Jack Dorsey offered something a little more profound, when he drifted into talking about the incentives social media provides: incentives that make us obsess about our follower count and level of engagement, arguably more than we care about the quality of what we share in the ""public square"". Mr Dorsey seems willing to look inward and rethink how his business works at its most basic level. I'm looking forward to seeing how that approach plays out. Facebook, on the other hand, is reaching out for help. It can't solve this problem alone, Ms Sandberg said. It needs government, law enforcement and security specialists to work on this issue. She's right, but Facebook will need to be more open about how it works in order for those kind of collaborations to be truly successful. Mr Warner asked whether Twitter would introduce an indicator to show which accounts were humans and which were automated bots. Mr Dorsey said Twitter had been ""considering"" the idea, and could label accounts as bots as long as it could detect them Mr Heinrich asked whether a US citizen ""intentionally spreading false information"" would violate Facebook's community standards. He gave the example of somebody claiming the victims of a mass shooting were actors. Ms Sandberg said Facebook did not want to be the ""arbiter of truth"" and worked with third-party fact-checkers to identify misinformation. Stories flagged as false had their distribution ""massively decreased"", she said Ms Sandberg and Mr Dorsey are giving evidence under oath Ms Collins asked whether the social networks would notify people if they had been engaging with fake accounts, once those accounts were identified and removed. Mr Dorsey said Twitter had not done enough. Ms Sandberg said Facebook had notified people in specific cases - including people who had indicated they would attend a fake event set up in Washington Ms Collins asked why Twitter did not notify politicians that were the subject of misinformation campaigns by foreign agents.

Mr King asked whether Facebook could help people judge the validity of sources in the same way that auction site eBay gives sellers ratings based on feedback. Ms Sandberg said people could decide for themselves which people and news sources to follow, and that it was easy to unfollow sources they did not trust Mr Manchin asked whether new laws should be introduced to hold social networks responsible for illegal drugs sold on the platforms. Facebook and Twitter both said selling drugs was against their terms of service and that they took action when they discovered such activity Facebook chief operating officer Sheryl Sandberg Ahead of the hearing, Facebook submitted written testimony outlining how it had disabled 1.27 billion fake accounts globally between October 2017 to March 2018. It said it employed 20,000 people to work on safety and security. In July, the social network announced that it had removed 32 accounts and pages believed to have been set up to influence the mid-term US elections in November. A month later it said that it had removed hundreds more ""misleading"" pages and accounts which targeted people in the Middle East, Latin America, the UK and the US. Twitter chief executive Jack Dorsey Twitter's Dorsey will also face questions from the House Committee on Energy and Commerce about perceived conservative censorship on its platform. President Trump has repeatedly accused Google, Facebook and Twitter of political bias and threatened regulation of the platforms. In written testimony submitted ahead of the hearing,external, Mr Dorsey denied that his firm de-emphasised certain accounts in search results, a practice known as ""shadow banning"". ""Twitter does not use political ideology to make any decisions, whether related to ranking content on our service or how we enforce our rules,"" he said.

Father-of-two Ian Tomlin, 46, waskilled on Wednesdayat flats on Charlotte Despard Avenue, Battersea. Police are yet to comment on whether Mr Tomlin, who worked as a lorry driver, had been confronting drug dealers. Cecil Tomlin told theEvening Standard,externalhis son was ""a great father"".

Police refuse to comment on reports Ian Tomlin was attacked for confronting suspected drug dealers Neighbour Francis Rafferty had been returning from shopping at about the time Mr Tomlin was killed. He said: ""Police told me he was stabbed twice in the neck, twice in the head and once in the leg. They just told me to get some towels. ""I've lived here seven years and not seen anything like this before."" Police have not officially confirmed the nature of Mr Tomlin's injuries. More than 100 murder investigations have been launched across London in 2018 Mr Tomlin worked for a waste company contracted to Wandsworth Council, whose leader Ravi Govindia described the killing as ""truly shocking"".

Police in Khashoggi case 'search forest',"Police are believed to have extended their search to the Belgrad Forest Police in Turkey investigating the alleged killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi have expanded their search. Unnamed Turkish officials say his body may have been disposed of in the nearby Belgrad forest or on farmland. Mr Khashoggi disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October, where Turkish officials allege he was murdered. Saudi Arabia denies any knowledge of what happened to him. Samples taken from the Saudi consulate and the consul's residence during searches this week are being tested for a match with Mr Khashoggi's DNA. What we know about Saudi journalist's disappearance Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Khashoggi suspect had 'cyber spy' training The BBC understands the police are searching the Belgrade forest because it is believed at least two vehicles from the Saudi consulate headed in that direction on the day of the suspected killing. Meanwhile, 15 Turkish nationals employed at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul have been questioned by prosecutors, state news agency Anadolu reports. Those giving witness statements included the consulate driver, receptionists, technicians and accountants, Anadolu said. Mr Khashoggi - a prominent journalist who fell out of favour with the Saudi government - has been living in self-imposed exile in the US since last year. He was last seen entering the Saudi consulate in Turkey's capital Istanbul on 2 October, to pick up paperwork that would allow him to marry his fiancÃ©e Hatice Cengiz. Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents inside the consulate, and his body then removed. Saudi Arabia has denied the claims, and initially insisted Mr Khashoggi had freely left the embassy. Turkish officials say they have audio and video recordings that show Mr Khashoggi being murdered by a team of Saudi agents. Turkish newspapers with close links to the government have published gruesome details of the alleged audio, including what they describe as the sounds of screams and Mr Khashoggi being interrogated and tortured. Meanwhile,Turkish media say they have identified a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents,externalwho flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of the disappearance. Turkish officials say the group brought a bone saw into the country and that one of its members was a doctor who specialised in post-mortems. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Several vehicles with Saudi diplomatic number plates were filmed by CCTV cameras moving from the consulate to the residence just under two hours after Mr Khashoggi entered the consulate. However, the recordings have not been publicly released, and Turkey's foreign minister says they have not shared the audio with anyone. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo denied US media reports that he had listened to the audio recordings, saying: ""I've heard no tape, I've seen no transcript."" ""This is a very serious matter that we're working diligently on, and so to put out headlines that are factually false does no one any good."" Some intelligence experts say they believe Turkey's claims about the audio recording are true. Turkish forensic investigators have already searched the Saudi consulate and consul's residence Sir John Sawers, the former head of the UK's foreign intelligence service MI6, told the BBC's World at One: ""The level of detail that's coming out from Turkish security sources is so clear and so damning that some form of tape must exist."" ""All the evidence points to [the killing] being ordered and carried out by people close to [Saudi Crown Prince] Mohammed bin Salman,"" he said. ""I don't think he would have done this if he hadn't thought he had license from the US administration to frankly behave as he wishes to do so,"" he added. Did Apple Watch record Khashoggi killing? Bot campaign follows Khashoggi disappearance However, Saudi Arabia has said reports on Mr Khashoggi's death are ""completely false and baseless"" and that it is ""open to co-operation"" to find out what happened. Turkish police were allowed to enter the Saudi consulate on 15 October. On Thursday, US PresidentDonald Trump told the New York Times that it appeared that Mr Khashoggi was dead,external, based on ""intelligence coming from every side"". However, he has also cautioned against jumping to conclusions about Saudi Arabia's role, telling AP news agency the country was being treated as ""guilty until proven innocent"". Russian President Vladimir Putin has said it is a pity that Mr Khashoggi has gone missing, but that Russia cannot damage relations with Saudi Arabia without hard facts. The incident has caused considerable strain between Saudi Arabia and its Western allies. On Thursday, the New York Times reported,externalthat Saudi Arabia's leaders are considering blaming a high-level intelligence official close to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the killing. This, says the newspaper, is being viewed as a recognition of the international outcry over the scandal. Several politicians, including US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and UK International Trade Secretary Liam Fox have pulled out of a major investment conference in Riyadh next week. What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? Jamal Khashoggi in his own words The summit, dubbed ""Davos in the Desert"", is being hosted by the Saudi Crown Prince to promote his reform agenda. However, a number ofmajor businesses - including Pepsi and EDF - are still intending to godespite growing pressure for a boycott. 2 October 03:28: A private jet carrying suspected Saudi agents arrives at Istanbul airport.

"Accelerate petrol and diesel ban, say MPs","A ban on sales of new petrol and diesel cars should be brought forward by eight years to 2032, MPs have said. The government's current plans to ensure all new cars are ""effectively zero emission"" by 2040 were ""vague and unambitious"", a report by Parliament's business select committee said. It also criticised cuts to subsidies and the lack of charging points. The government said it aimed to make the UK ""the best place in the world"" to own an electric vehicle. However, the report from the Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy committee said the government's deeds did not match the ambitions of its words. The committee's chairwoman, Rachel Reeves MP, said the government's targets gave ""little clarity or incentive to industry or the consumer to invest in electric cars."" Earlier this year the prime minister said that all new cars and vans should be ""effectively zero emission"" by 2040. The government's Road to Zero Strategy said it wanted ""almost every car and van"" in the UK to be zero emission by 2050. However it was unclear which, if any, hybrid models were being included. The committee said ""zero should mean zero"" and called for the government to bring forward ""a clear, precise target for new sales of cars and vans to be truly zero emission by 2032"". How will the petrol and diesel ban work? Car industry condemns 'green' car change Why you have (probably) already bought your last car The UK was amongthe top 10 countries for electric vehicle sales in 2017,external, and has around 14,500 public charging points. However, in its report the committee said the country was far from electric vehicle ready. by Theo Leggett, BBC business correspondent MPs say the government's targets are ""vague and unambitious""; but are they? Vague may well be a fair criticism. When the 2040 target was first announced, the government was initially unable even to say whether or not hybrid cars would be covered. It later confirmed it had ""no plans to ban any particular technology - like hybrids - as part of its strategy"" - but insisted it wanted all cars to be ""effectively zero emission"" by that date. It could certainly have been clearer. Unambitious? The car industry thinks not - the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders says it would be ""nigh on impossible"" to bring the ban forward by eight years. Ah, but they would say that wouldn't they? Nevertheless, it's a fact that electric cars currently make up 0.6% of all cars sold in the UK, and plug-in hybrids just 1.6%. Overall, they make up a tiny proportion of the 31.5 million registered cars on our roads. Yes, sales are expected to grow rapidly over the next few years, and yes some countries are planning to move more quickly. But with so many unknown factors ahead - such as whether or not enough batteries can be made to support rapid growth of electric vehicles - you could argue that it's already a pretty challenging target. The MPs said the UK's charging infrastructure was still inadequate, and gave rise to ""range anxiety"" - potential buyers of electric vehicles worrying whether they will be able to reach the next charging station. The report said the government had left delivery of charging points to councils and private companies when a ""shared approach"" was needed. In addition, it calledplans announced last weekto slash subsidies for less-polluting vehicles ""perverse"". The government will end grants for new plug-in hybrids in November and the subsidy for cars that are purely electric is being reduced from Â£4,500 to Â£3,500. The purchase costs of electric vehicles remain very high relative to internal combustion engine vehicles, the report said, and therefore ""incentives are required to encourage motorists to make the switch"". Some European countries, including Denmark, Germany and Ireland, plan to ban sales of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, ten years ahead of the UK. But Mike Hawes, head of the Society of Motor Manufacturers & Traders (SMMT), said calls to shift to entirely electric-powered  cars by 2032 were ""unrealistic"". ""Zero emission vehicles make up just 0.6% of the market, meaning consumer appetite would have to grow by some 17,000% in just over a decade,"" he said. Electric cars: What if you live in a flat? Diesel car ban approved for German cities Nicholas Lyes, head of roads policy at the RAC, said he understood the rationale for wanting to bring forward the end of conventionally-fuelled vehicles, but said to achieve that it ""would have to be matched with bold and decisive action from the government"". The Department for Transport said its green car strategy was one of the most comprehensive in the world. A statement said it was consulting on legislation to make all new homes ""electric vehicle ready"". ""We want between 50% and 70% of new car sales to be ultra low emission by 2030, and for all new cars and vans to be effectively zero emission by 2040,"" a spokeswoman said. ""And we also outlined measures to bring forward a major uplift in electric vehicle charging infrastructure, paving the way for the widespread adoption of ultra-low emission vehicles.""

Tories must be as united as EU - Hunt,"Jeremy Hunt has urged Tory MPs to get behind Theresa May - amid a backlash against suggestions the Brexit transition period could be extended. The foreign secretary said the ""great strength"" of other EU nations was that they had stayed united in the talks - and he urged Tories to do the same. The PM had to ""maximise her negotiating leverage in Brussels,"" he added. Scottish Secretary David Mundell has raised concerns about a longer transition period with No 10. He told the BBC: ""What I want to be quite clear is that we are still leaving the Commons Fisheries Policy at the end of 2020. I think that's a very important thing for fishermen here in Scotland to know and understand."" Buthe addedthere was not a ""specific proposal"" about extending the transition period, it was just ""something that has been floated"" and said the ""prime minister has my full backing in terms of getting a deal"". Former Conservative leader and prominent Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said it would see the UK paying the EU ""tens of billions"" more. How many Labour MPs will back May's Brexit Five things that happened at EU summit No deal Brexit 'could hit food supplies' Brexit: All you need to know He toldBBC's Newsnighthe could not understand an extension when the UK ""still hasn't got anything back in return"",  and said the negotiations ""look more like a capitulation"". But Mr Hunt said it was precisely because Mrs May had not ""capitulated"" to EU demands that no agreement had been reached at the European Council summit this week. And he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The great strength of the EU in these negotiations is that the 27 EU nations have remained united. And we now need to do the same behind Theresa May to maximise her negotiating leverage in Brussels."" Mrs May briefed around 120 business leaders on Brexit negotiations in a conference call on Friday - Downing Street said while businesses were regularly briefed after European Council meetings, this was the first time Mrs May had conducted one personally. This video can not be played PM: Extension would be 'a matter of months' By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg As we move towards what the legal deadlines imply are the closing moments of this whole process, some of its moments are becoming pretty strange. The prime minister had a hint of warmth from some parts of the EU empire for the idea of drawing out the implementation period, to give more time to work out the long term fixes. But even so, the politics put such a straitjacket on proceedings that she can't even quite manage to be completely clear about that. So we heard about a proposal that's not a proposal but an ""idea that's emerged"". An extension to an extension that's not a request for a longer transition period but a desire perhaps to have the option. It might sound like Kafka. But it's the words of a government struggling to keep a set of almost impossible promises. Read more from Laura The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and the transition period, which Mrs May prefers to call the implementation period, is designed to smooth the path to a future permanent relationship between the UK and EU. During this period, which is due to finish on 31 December 2020, the UK's relationship with the EU will stay largely the same. But with the two sides failing to reach agreement yet, Mrs May said this arrangement could be extended ""for a few months"", if needed. The UK has signed up to the principle of agreeing an Irish border ""backstop"" - an insurance policy designed to prevent the need for customs checks - in case there is a gap between the transition period ending and the future permanent relationship coming into force. The problem is that the two sides have yet to agree what form the backstop will take, and how long it could last. Please upgrade your browser Mr Hunt said the backstop remained the ""key"" outstanding issue to negotiating a withdrawal agreement for the UK. The UK would not agree to allow ""customs barriers down the Irish Sea"" - the EU has suggested keeping Northern Ireland within EU customs rules for a period - or for the whole of the UK to remain in the customs union ""indefinitely"". ""Because she has held firm on that that has meant we haven't been able to solve the problem this week. But those are two very important matters of principle for the United Kingdom,"" he said. While the issue about the Irish border could be resolved through a free trade deal between the UK and EU, the EU was insisting the UK's withdrawal agreement should be negotiated first, with a ""backstop"", before the ""future relationship"" discussion began, he added. ""If we are going to resolve this, we need to make more progress on the future relationship.""

Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said any proposal that meant an extra Â£15bn a year being paid into the EU budget in return for ""a waffly political declaration"" would be ""very hard to get through the House of Commons"".

Who is Anjem Choudary?,"The poster behind Choudary at this April 2014 demonstration includes the words ""Islamic State Is Solution"" - the initial letters spell ISIS The radical preacher Anjem Choudary has been released from jail. He's considered one of the most influential and dangerous radicalisers in the UK because of his connection to a long line of terrorism suspects. His release comes less than halfway through a five-and-a-half-year sentence after being convicted of inviting support for Islamic State. His departure from prison comes approximately four months earlier than it would have otherwise occurred because of the time he spent bailed on an electronic tag before his conviction. But it does not mean he is free to do as he pleases. So how dangerous is he - and what is being done to manage the threat security chiefs believe he poses? Choudary headed the Al-Muhajiroun (ALM) network. This was the leading group in the UK that supported an extreme interpretation of Islam that advocated Sharia law for Muslim lands and, ultimately, an inevitable conflict with Western liberal democracy. The network, which had various guises, franchises and what amounted to brand names, was progressively banned under terrorism legislation in the wake of the 2005 London attacks. When its founder, a Syrian Islamist cleric called Omar Bakri Mohammed, fled the UK following those attacks, Choudary, as his key disciple, took the helm. British-born Choudary is charismatic and media-savvy and, in his drive for members, he would regularly make headlines with events such as high-profile demonstrations. Choudary was a follower of another radical Islamist figure, Omar Bakri Mohammed These would regularly involve denouncing the West and Middle Eastern regimes, the war in Iraq, Afghanistan and anywhere else where he could claim that Muslims were victims. How Anjem Choudary's mouth was finally shut No. His danger came from the role he played in radicalising others. Once his followers bought into the idea that the West was victimising Muslims, that opened the way to them choosing violence themselves. In many ways he was no different to many violent revolutionary ideologues through history: creating the conditions of hostility, without ever picking up a weapon himself. Terrorism researcher Hannah Stuart, who has studied British jihadists since 1999, discovered that ALM was a factor in the lives of at least a quarter of those who have carried out attacks, gone to fight overseas or ended up in jail. These included: Omar Sharif - a British suicide bomber who attacked Tel Aviv in 2003. He was a follower of the ALM network. Ten years later Michael Adebolajo murdered Fusilier Lee Rigby in London. Choudary confirmed the killer had been a follower - but said he had left the group. ""Boy S"" from Blackburnwas the youngest ever teenager to be convicted of a terrorism offence in the UK after he tried to organise an attack via his smartphone in his bedroom. He was under the spell of one of Choudary's circle - and met the leader himself before developing his plans. Siddartha Dhar - one of Choudary's closest lieutenants in London - skipped police bail while under investigation and turned up in Syria fighting for the Islamic State group. It's very difficult to measure - and if MI5 ever worked it out, they're unlikely to put the figure in the public domain because it would give away exactly what they knew. But al-Muhajiroun and Anjem Choudary were influential in two ways. First, there was personal contact. The core of the ALM network was quite tight and focused on a few centres of organisation, including London's East End and Luton. Sometimes he could attract more than 100 supporters to a demonstration - other times half a dozen to man a prayer stall in a town centre. More on al-Muhajiroun Luton But he also had supporters online. Choudary and his core preachers were prolific on YouTube. They hosted video conferences on private platforms and spread messages far and wide via social media messaging services. Some extremists were part of the network but not necessarily part of the inner circle, such as Khurram Butt, one of the three men who carried out the London Bridge/Borough Market attack in 2017. He has reached the halfway point of his five-and-a-half-year sentence. He spent some of this sentence in a special ""separation unit"" for dangerous extremists inside Frankland Prison in County Durham, to limit his possible influence over other inmates. Now he is leaving jail, he is not going to be free. When an offender is released at the midway point of their sentence, the remainder is spent on ""licence"" in the community, as part of attempts to reintegrate them and reduce the risk of reoffending. He must comply with 25 conditions that his release team, made up of probation and police officers, believe are necessary and proportionate to manage the risk he may still pose. If he breaches them, he risks being recalled to prison. Anjem Choudary spent some of this sentence in a ""separation unit"" inside Frankland Prison in County Durham These conditions have been headlined as being among the strictest ever - but the truth is a little more prosaic. They're taken from a wide menu of options that are used to manage the risk of people convicted of a terrorism offence. In Choudary's case, the risk is that he will not have changed and could radicalise others once more. While in prison he refused to take part in deradicalisation courses or exercises, the BBC has learned from counter-extremism sources. On a number of occasions, Choudary was offered opportunities to speak to mainstream religious leaders and other experts who have successfully turned around the mindset of other extremists. On each of those occasions, Choudary refused to get involved. While the preacher reportedly refused to address his mindset, prison authorities could not hold up his release. The restrictions he will face for the next two-and-a-half years therefore include a ban on preaching, organising meetings, associating with members of the ALM network, using the internet without permission or giving media interviews to spread his message. He's also under a UK travel ban - restricted to within Greater London's M25 - as well as barred from foreign travel without permission. In other words, he will be carefully monitored. Security concerns over Choudary release When Anjem Choudary was charged in 2015 with inviting support for IS, it was a moment of great success for counter-terrorism chiefs - and they were already trying to build cases against other associates. Michael Adebolajo (left) was a follower of Anjem Choudary (right) before killing Fusilier Lee Rigby Some, including close confidantes, were jailed. At least four others, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure (TPim), a form of control that places two years of restrictions on the movements and activities of terrorism suspects who have not been charged with a crime. Others were investigated by social services as to whether they posed a risk to their own children or others. There was also an attempt to use Anti-Social Behaviour Orders against targets from Luton. Detectives also looked for evidence of standard crimes - such as fraud - as a means to further ""disrupt"" the network. At least one member of the wider ALM family was jailed for fraud. The insider view is that this work has been generally successful because it made the targets aware they could no longer act with impunity. In theory, it created space for the security service MI5 and their police detective colleagues to focus on more urgent threats.

Radical preacher has assets frozen,"Radical preacher Anjem Choudary has had his assets frozen, days before he is due to leave prison. The 51-year-old, who was jailed for five-and-a-half years for inviting support for the Islamic State group, is expected to be released on Friday. The BBC understands police have been preparing a list of up to 20 measures to control the east London preacher. The government's asset freezing team confirmed,externalChoudary had been listed on a global record of known terrorists. Former Met terror chief Richard Walton told BBC Newsnight that Choudary was a ""hardened dangerous terrorist"" and someone who has had a ""huge influence on Islamist extremism in this country"". The international list, overseen by the United Nations Security Council, is designed to prevent targets spending money on their causes. In the entry, Choudary, who headed the banned al-Muhajiroun network, is described as a resident of Frankland Prison in County Durham and also known by the alias, Abu Luqman. It states that Choudary ""pledged allegiance to Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)"". Security concerns over Choudary release How Anjem Choudary's mouth was finally shut The asset freezing order means the preacher will be subject to extremely strict financial controls which typically mean that any attempt to open a bank account or move money will alert the authorities. If his release goes ahead on Friday, the BBC understands that Choudary will stay in a probation hostel for up to the first six months of his licence, which continues until July 2021. The BBC also understands Choudary will be subject to licence conditions including: A ban from preaching at or attending certain mosques He will only be allowed to associate with people who have been approved by the authorities He will be allowed one phone and is banned from using an internet-enabled device without permission Use of the internet will be supervised He will not be able to leave the UK without permission from his probation officer This video can not be played The former head of counter-terror at the Met police speaks to Newsnight ahead of Anjem Choudary's release Mr Walton told BBC Newsnight that he tried to convict Choudary 10 times over 12 to 13 years, but failed because the the law ""was not robust enough"". He saida new counter-terrorism bill,external, which is currently with the House of Lords, would address this issue and will allow police to prosecute below the existing threshold for incitement to commit terrorism. He added that more convicted terrorists are due to be released, saying they will ""place a burden on the police and the intelligence agencies"". Choudary is due for automatic release after serving half his sentence.

Google takes down (some) travel visa ads,"Many commercial Esta sites look official Here's a word of warning to anybody applying for a US travel visa or Esta online. The top search results in Google are not for the official application forms, but paid advertisements for commercial websites that charge more than five times as much as the government one. Regular travellers will know this has been going on since at least 2010. But after a BBC News investigation, Google has taken some of the ads down. Only some of them though. In 2010, the US startedcharging UK travellersto use the Electronic System for Travel Authorisation (Esta) before their visit. Theofficial Esta website,externalis run by the US Department for Homeland Security, which charges $14 (Â£10.70) for each Esta. Google removed an ad for this website But there are countless sites that charge more than $80 for the same application. One site advertised on Google charged $99 (Â£76) per Esta. Customers may still get their Esta, but end up quite severely out of pocket - and Google earns money in the process. The sites justify their prices by offering ""24/7 support"" to anybody who is struggling to type their details into the web form. ""It's a fairly simple message from me. Don't go near them with a barge pole,"" said Guy Anker, deputy editor of the consumer advice siteMoney Saving Expert,external. ""Double check you're using the official site or you're going to be paying a lot more than you should."" The BBC sent Google several ads that appeared at the top of search results for terms such as Esta and US visa. Google said the ads did break its rules and would be taken down. An ad for this Esta site was also taken down In a statement it said: ""We have policies that prevent ads for paid products or services that are available from a government or public source for free or at a lower price, unless they offer a clear added value."" But following the removal, the top search results were still ads for commercial sites - so the BBC reported those to Google too.  Google said those ads would also be taken down. A third look found ads for service sites still remained at the top of Google's search results - including an identical copy of one Google previously said had broken its rules. The ad was taken down for investigation, while others remain at the top of Google's search results. Since the commercial websites are charging for a service and do submit your Esta application on your behalf, it is difficult to get a refund if you have paid more than $14. Money Saving Expert,externalsays to look for the official Esta logo, which is a trademark and can only legitimately be used on theofficial Esta website,external. Google told the BBC it encourages the public toreport advertisements,externalthat break its rules. The BBC asked Google why it did not ""pin"" the official Esta website to the top of its search results, or highlight it more prominently. It said its search results were determined by algorithms.

"Depressed? The places not to live if you need helpNHS talking therapy service is failing patients in one in seven areas of England, BBC analysis shows.","A flagship NHS mental health service is failing patients in one in seven areas of England, research by the BBC shows. People with conditions like depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are entitled to psychological therapies, such as counselling. The NHS is meant to successfully treat half of the people it sees. But an analysis of official NHS data showed this was not the case in 28 of the 195 local areas of the country in the first six months of this year. There is a threefold variation in recovery rates between different places, with experts saying if such differences existed in heart bypass surgery there would be an outcry. Psychologists said some areas were not properly funding services, meaning patients are offered fewer appointments than they really need. However, NHS England said the programme - called Improving Access to Psychological Therapies (IAPT) - was one of the most ambitious of its kind in the world and had helped hundreds of thousands of people overcome depression and anxiety. It said despite the problems in some areas, overall IAPT was successfully treating more than half of patients across the whole population. The findings come as the BBC has re-launched its NHS Tracker, which provides information about the performance of local services, including mental health for the first time.  Karla and Imran have both struggled with their mental health. But they have had different experiences in the NHS. Karla, from Derby, said she got treatment for depression and anxiety quickly and is now in recovery. She was given a talking therapy, known as cognitive behavioural therapy. ""It has taught me how to express things in healthier ways. Now I don't bottle things up so much. ""It gave me the strength to say, 'you know what, it's going to hurt and it's going to get worse'. Before I didn't talk to anyone. Therapy taught me to accept this is what it is. ""It's given me my life back."" Imran (not his real name) has had a very different experience to Karla, and - six years on from first seeking help for his mental health issues - he is still struggling to access effective ongoing support. During that time, he has had contact with a wide range of professionals, his GP, social workers and housing support staff - which ""didn't amount to anything"". He was also referred to a psychiatrist, and later CBT. None of it has worked for him, and he says it can be hard to negotiate ""the system"" when you are also dealing with symptoms. ""There's a lot of pressure on you. It's really hard."" You can read more about Karla and Imran's storieshere. For those with mild to moderate mental health problems, the NHS runs a counselling service called IAPT. It is available in every part of the country after being launched 10 years ago. About 550,000 patients suffering from conditions such as depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder are treated by the service every year. They are given support ranging from telephone advice from trained therapists to group and one-to-one talking therapies. Prof David Clark, clinical adviser to NHS England for IAPT and one of the architects of the programme, said it is ""widely recognised as the most ambitious programme of talking therapies in the world"". The treatment should help half to recover - defined as no longer being clinically mentally ill by the time they are discharged. The NHS has struggled to achieve this since the programme was launched in 2008, but improvements have been made and nationally it was achieved last year for the first time. Since then it has almost continuously been hit. Prof Clark said on others measures, including how long people wait for treatment to start, the service was also achieving its targets proving it was a highly successful scheme. And he added ""most importantly it has helped of hundreds of thousands of people to overcome their depression and anxiety, and better manage their mental health"". But that progress masks the fact some local areas have been struggling. Figures are published every three months by NHS area. There are 195 areas run by clinical commissioning groups and in 28 of them, fewer than half of patients were successfully treated during both the January to March and April to June periods. Another 27 failed in at least one quarter. If you look at the April to June period there was a threefold difference between the best and worst. In Luton, fewer than one in four patients were successfully treated. In Wirral, part of Merseyside, it was only one in three. By comparison, more than two-thirds of patients in Stoke were no longer ill by the time they were discharged. Both Luton and Wirral NHS bosses cited high numbers of people on the waiting list as a factor - meaning people have been waiting longer for treatment to start. They both said they had been making progress on this though. Psychologists say that like many parts of the NHS, services have been squeezed. They say some areas put more resources than others into the programme - and that means patients are sometimes discharged before they are ready. Clinical psychologist Dr Ryan Kemp is a director of therapies at Central and North West London NHS Foundation Trust, which runs services across north-west London and in Milton Keynes. He said that while the NHS should be ""proud"" of the progress that has been made, he had concerns. He said in some places the funding was ""minimal"", which put ""pressure to move people out of the service"". Patients who have not recovered may be put on drugs or referred on to services for more complex problems, such as psychiatry, but experts say there are long waits for these services. Consultant psychologist Dr Mike Scott, who has written and researched extensively about talking therapies, says: ""The fact there is such a variation in recovery rates raises questions. If you had this with heart bypass surgery, there would be real suspicions. ""There needs to be an independent assessment."" He believes the true recovery rate may actually be much lower, because the way treatment is assessed is not robust enough. ""I have done research on this and the recovery rate is much more like 15%. The service is provided on the cheap. ""Patients do not get enough sessions."" The 28 areas of the country which did not successfully treat half of patients receiving psychological therapies in the first six months of this year are: NHS Blackburn with Darwen NHS Bradford City NHS Brighton & Hove NHS Corby NHS Dudley NHS East Lancashire NHS Fareham & Gosport NHS Greater Huddersfield NHS Guildford & Waverley NHS Harrow NHS Havering NHS Leicester City NHS Luton NHS Manchester NHS Merton NHS Nene NHS North East Lincolnshire NHS North Hampshire NHS Norwich NHS Redbridge NHS Salford NHS Somerset NHS South Eastern Hampshire NHS South Sefton NHS Southwark NHS Vale Royal NHS Wakefield NHS Wirral Data analysis by Christine Jeavans and Ros Anning Male suicide rates at new UK low Sharp drop in UK suicide rates Helping men 'struggling with life' Samaritans - Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Sorry, your browser cannot display this map Organisations and governments regularly invite politicians on all-expenses paid visits overseas. These are often related to an MP's role in an international organisation or part of a one-off fact finding delegation, all of which form a legitimate part of their role as Parliamentarians. Our research is limited to visits that were declared to Parliament by MPs before 18th June 2018 - some trips before this date were not recorded until later and have not been included. The register of interests does not include ministerial costs or trips taken as part of delegations including Nato and the Council of Europe. New MPs' code 'risks cover-up claims' The findings come after questions were raised over the travels of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and DUP MP Ian Paisley this year. Mr Corbyn's conduct was reported to Parliament's Standards Commissioner after he failed to declarea 2013 trip he took to Tunisia, that was at the centre of the anti-Semitism controversy. MPs must register all trips that are valued more than Â£600, but the Labour Party claimed that his visit was worth less than the threshold. Ian Paisley was suspended as an MP in July for 30 sitting daysafter failing to declare two family holidays to Sri Lanka, covered by the Sri Lankan government. By far the most common destination for politicians was Israel and the Palestinian territories, with 102 visits over two years, followed by the USA, Germany and the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar. Most trips to Israel and the Palestinian territories were covered by pressure groups including Conservative Friends of Israel, Labour Friends of Israel or Medical Aid for Palestine. And most of them were described as ""fact-finding missions"", visiting both Israel and the Palestinian territories. Nine of the 10 MPs who had the most money spent on them in the year after the 2017 election belong to the Conservative Party, with only Labour's Rotherham MP Sarah Champion breaking the mould after expensive trips to Hong Kong, Taiwan and India. The most expensive traveller in the year after the 2017 election was Leo Docherty, Conservative MP for Aldershot, who went on six trips worth a total of Â£26,895. Most of this was at the invitation of the governments of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Mr Docherty, who ran the Conservative Middle East Council before entering Parliament last year, was part of a delegation invited by the Saudi government to ""see the impact of ballistic missile strikes in the Saudi/Yemen border region and gain a deeper understanding of the strategic importance of the Coalition operations in Yemen"". His four-day visit in January was valued at Â£8,257. In response to questions about this trip, Mr Docherty said: ""The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has for many years been a hugely important strategically for UK across many sectors."" In a contribution to an emergency debate on the crisis in Yemen on 11 September 2017, Mr Docherty defended the actions of the Saudi military, saying: ""I am convinced that our influence helps the Saudis fight this war better, and that is extremely important."" Mr Docherty also travelled to the kingdom in September 2017 to meet King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, two weeks before putting down a Parliamentary question to the then Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, asking ""what steps his department is taking to support the sale of a second tranche of Typhoon aircraft to Saudi Arabia"". Many overseas delegations are organised by the near 200 All-Party Parliamentary Groups, which are informal collections of MPs and Lords focusing on particular countries or subjects. Mark Menzies - who is a member of 17 of the groups - totalled Â£22,186 worth of travel over five visits, while David Morris cost Â£17,894 to governments including Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Armenia. Not all of the invitations were on behalf of governments. The single most expensive trip over the two-year period was taken by former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell. The MP for Sutton Coldfield charged Â£21,157 for a two-day visit to Washington DC with his wife in April 2017 to attend meetings about international development. He was sponsored by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. John Mann, who registered eight overseas visits on the Register of Interests in the year following the election, the most recorded by any MP, said these trips are ""part of the job"". None of Mr Mann's trips were sponsored by foreign governments and most were related to his role as the UK chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Committee Against Antisemitism. Rachel Davies Teka, head of advocacy at Transparency International UK, which argues for a ban on foreign government-sponsored travel by MPs said the figures represented ""an obvious risk of undue influence over our democratic processes"".

"Outrage as Trump hails body slam on reporter""He's my guy,"" says the US president as he jokes about Greg Gianforte's attack on a reporter last year.US & Canada","This video can not be played President Trump mimics the violent move at a rally US President Donald Trump has praised a Republican congressman who assaulted a journalist last year with a ""body slam"", referring to him as ""my guy"". ""Greg is smart,"" Mr Trump said of Montana Congressman Greg Gianforte, adding ""By the way, never wrestle him"". ""Any guy that can do a body slam... he's my guy,"" he said to cheers and laughter at a rally in Montana. The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ) and the Guardian newspaper have called on Mr Trump to apologise. This latest praise from Mr Trump is unlikely to improve his relationship with the media, which he has previously labelled the ""enemy of the people"". He said he had feared that the 2017 assault could have hindered Mr Gianforte's chances of winningthe special congressional election that followed. Mr Trump told supporters: ""I said wait a minute, I know Montana pretty well, I think it might help him - and it did"". After praising Mr Gianforte, Mr Trump also mimicked a person being thrown forcefully to the ground. Why Donald Trump attacks the media 'Body slam' congressman sentenced to 20 hours of anger counselling The president's controversial remarks come as Turkish officials continue to investigatethe alleged killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. With weeks to go beforethe mid-term elections, Mr Gianforte is expected to win again, this time over Democratic challenger Kathleen Williams. Ms Williams has used the 2017 body slam in a new campaign ad, saying ""assault and lies"" are not representative of Montana's values. Should Trump be worried about the mid-terms? The early signs these mid-terms are different A spokesperson for Mr Gianforte said on Thursday that he ""regrets what happened"" last year,according to the Billings Gazette,external. ""He's not perfect, he's taken personal responsibility, this has been widely covered, he's moved on."" Mr Gianforte, 56, pleaded guilty to assaulting a journalist from the UK's Guardian newspaper on the eve of his election last year. He was ordered to pay $385 (Â£304), complete 40 hours of community service and 20 hours of anger management counselling. This video can not be played 'Get the hell out of here!' - listen to the reported attack Ben Jacobs, the reporter who was attacked after asking the candidate whether he supported the Republican healthcare plan, agreed not to sue Mr Gianforte if he wrote a letter of apology and donated $50,000 (Â£39,500) to the Committee to Protect Journalists. A letter sent by Mr Gianforte to Mr Jacobs later offered a ""sincere apology"". ""My physical response to your legitimate question was unprofessional, unacceptable and unlawful,"" it said. The CPJ confirmed that it accepted the donation,external. Amid an uproar on social media, Mr Trump's comments a year on have also prompted the campaign group CPJ to demand his apology. ""We are disturbed once again to see President Trump standing up for those who would attack the press,"" said Courtney Radsch, the CPJ's advocacy director. In a statement, the Guardian's US editor John Mulholland said he hoped the president would apologise for his comments, adding: ""To celebrate an attack on a journalist who was simply doing his job is an attack on the first amendment [of the US Constitution] by someone who has taken an oath to defend it."" He said the incident ""runs the risk of inviting other assaults on journalists"". On Friday, a spokesperson for British Prime Minister Theresa Maytold the Guardian,external: ""We would always say that any violence or intimidation against a journalist is completely unacceptable.""

"I travelled 4,000 miles to find my dad"," My journey to find my dad started in the attic of my London flat in January this year. That's where I sat to look at these pictures of him for the first time. I'm an only child and my parents split up when I was a baby. Nobody in the family had heard from him since. But I always knew there would be a moment in my life when I would need to go and meet my dad at least once. I’m 27 now and live in South London. I grew up in Birmingham and went to Leeds University where I presented a specialist music show on the student radio station. The show received a bit of notice and won a few awards, and this ultimately led to my current career as a radio show host for BBC Radio 1Xtra. I've done some acting too: my first feature film, Freehold - a horror with comedic elements - came out in 2017. And I recently landed a role in the new BBC drama seriesInformer. I’m happy with the way my life is going so far, but before I started on this journey, I always had a nagging feeling that something in my life was unresolved. Nobody had seen my dad for 26 years. All I had were three decades-old photos, the year of his marriage to my mum, and his name from my birth certificate. The idea of trying to find a man I knew so little about seemed almost inconceivable. I was afraid of the emotional impact of discovering he was dead, or that he didn’t want to see me, or of simply not finding him. And I was angry with him. Mim's nan Mim's foster mum - Zahida (right) I decided that if I was really going to find my dad, I’d turn it into a work project. I wanted to document my journey, whatever happened. I approached BBC Three with the idea of making a documentary because I thought my story – of a son trying to reconnect with his father – was something young people could relate to. At this point, my dad was still not a real person to me - just a fragmented collection of photos and stories filtered through my relatives. I was determined to keep an open mind and stay as objective as possible to find out what really happened – and what I really thought and felt. The first place to look for my dad was the City of Westminster Archives Centre. This holds the published indexes of births, marriages and deaths, and I needed my parents’ marriage certificate. It took hours of searching – but it was worth it. I spoke to family members including Zahida – a family friend who took care of me while my nan devoted herself to caring for my mum – who showed me some pictures of me from my childhood. I wanted to know why my parents separated. She told me she had heard that my father’s behaviour with my mother was “not very good” and that my mother had been very sick. I had always understood that my mother’s condition deteriorated during her relationship with my father. I was told that he had even been abusive towards her. But I wanted the other side of the story. My parents’ marriage certificate showed that dad had lived in Dudley in the West Midlands – a large market town ten miles northwest of Birmingham. I checked the electoral roll hoping he might have returned – but there were no current addresses registered to his name. I went through every former residence – including one where he had apparently lived with his first wife – but nobody remembered him. I didn’t have many leads left to follow. I called a local politician who I had been told knew a lot of people in the area. He didn’t know my father, but he pointed me to a mosque in my dad’s old neighbourhood. It was a long shot – but I asked him to set up a meeting. One of the men had lived with my dad in the same house – along with eight or nine other people. He was “1,000% sure” that he knew who he was from the photo. I couldn’t believe it. What was he like? The men exchanged glances. “Put it this way,” said one. “He didn’t have a very good reputation.” My dad was very impatient, and not “strong”, the men said. But he was alive – in Pakistan. He’d been living there for at least 10 years. They had a phone number for him. One of them even remembered the address of my father’s home town of Thara, in Kashmir because he had written letters for my father – who was illiterate – when he had lived with him. It took me a few days to take it in. But I’d come so far there was now only option: I was going to go to Pakistan to find my dad. I was scared of rejection, so I tried calling him first. My dad hung up the phone – twice. But after everything I’d been through, I wasn’t about to give up. So I wrote him a letter and told him that I wanted to meet him in July. “I am travelling to your country, and in return I just require an hour of your time. That’s all I want. Please, for the son you have brought into the world, just allow yourself to have a conversation with him.” I called my dad. He didn’t want to meet. “You being in Pakistan – what relation is that to me?” he said. He turned his phone off. I was crushed. I felt rejected. It didn’t make any sense to me. I had travelled so far and I couldn’t understand why he didn’t want to see me. But overnight I received a message from my dad. He wanted to speak. He explained that the day before he was in shock that I was in Pakistan. He said he would meet me – but he refused to be on camera. So our first meeting wasn’t filmed out of respect for his wishes. My dad lives in Thara, Azad Kashmir – a small village about two hours away from Islamabad. Throughout the journey I was filled with a mix of nervousness and anticipation. We weren’t expecting a reception but when our car pulled up there was a crowd of about 10 to 20 men gathered around, all wearing Shalwar Kameez (traditional Pakistani dress). “Oh my god,” I thought. “How many people have come out here?” The car door opened and my eyes fixed on one man – and his eyes fixed on me. He had a well-kempt white beard and looked frail but healthy. I recognised him instantly. I had no memories of him, but I still knew he was my own blood and flesh. I didn't have to look at anyone else to know that this was my dad. I had a box of mangoes in my hand. I put them down and embraced him. He started crying. In that moment I didn't feel anything towards this man, and that really surprised me. I was just so numb. I think I was still protecting myself from what was about to happen. I realised afterwards that I needed some time to be able to process it in my head. “It feels very good,” my dad said to those around us. “He is my son. He tried so hard to come to his father. He came to Pakistan and we embraced each other.” In the end I stayed in Thara for several days. I wasn’t expecting such a warm welcome into the family. We took photos together. I played cricket with my two younger brothers and met my sister. My dad even opened up to me. I was able to talk to him about the breakdown of his marriage to my mum. He firmly denied abusing her and said my mum’s family plotted against him to take me away. I will never know for sure what happened between my parents given that my mum can’t tell me and I have heard contrasting accounts from different people. But I saw from my dad’s household that he is very strict, non-negotiable and adamant on having things a certain way. I was grateful I wasn’t raised in an environment like that. But at the same time my dad has a softer side. He cried when he saw me, and was emotional throughout our meeting. He can still have a laugh. He still makes jokes. He is a complex character for sure. We don’t speak on the phone every day to each other, like, ""Hey, what did you have for dinner tonight?"" But we speak here and there, whenever we get an opportunity. I can’t quite believe that we’re in contact and have a relationship. It has taught me that if I ever have children, I never want them to go for so long without knowing their father. Has the experience helped me understand who I am? Well, I’ve lived a very different life to my dad. I was brought up in a Western country. I received a lot of love and support from my friends and family. I don’t think I would be as strict as he is, and I think I am probably more reflective too. But even though my dad and I are very different, I still have his DNA. There is one thing I noticed we have in common. During my time with him, I remember him laughing at something that I didn't find that funny at all. He laughs at very weird things sometimes. It was confusing to me – until I realised I do exactly the same thing. I'm always laughing at weird things too. Mim Shaikh: Finding Dad is on BBC iPlayer now. Built with Shorthand"

Man admits raping Briton in outback ordeal,"The woman was rescued after police pulled over a 4x4 A man has pleaded guilty to repeatedly raping a British backpacker during a weeks-long kidnapping ordeal in Australia. The woman, from Liverpool, was rescued by police in Queensland last year after they stopped a 4x4 she was driving. Her attacker, local man Marcus Martin, then aged 22, was found hiding in the back of the vehicle. On Friday, Mr Martin pleaded guilty to three charges of rape and one of deprivation of liberty. He had previously pleaded guilty to other charges, including assault occasioning bodily harm, wilful damage, and strangulation or choking. Last year, police said that Mr Martin had met the 22-year-old woman at a party in Cairns in late January 2017. The pair agreed to start a road trip through Queensland, but Mr Martin then began to hold the woman against her will. He subjected her to a ""horrific and terrifying"" experience over about four weeks, Detective Insp Paul Hart from Queensland Police said at the time. The ordeal ended in March last year in the town of Mitchell, more than 1,000km (620 miles) south of Cairns. The rescue was prompted by a service station owner in Mitchell calling police to report concerns about the woman. ""She pulled up and fuelled up and then when she came in, she couldn't pay for her fuel,"" the owner, Beverley Page, told the Courier Mail at the time. Police said the victim's injuries included facial fractures, bruising, abrasions to her neck and cuts to her body, as well as psychological harm. Mr Martin, from Cairns, will face his next court hearing in February, when a sentence date will be set.

How many foreign trips has your MP accepted?,"Members of Parliament have benefitted from more than Â£2m worth of free overseas trips in the last two years.

And most of them were described as ""fact-finding missions"", visiting both Israel and the Palestinian territories. Nine of the 10 MPs who had the most money spent on them in the year after the 2017 election belong to the Conservative Party, with only Labour's Rotherham MP Sarah Champion breaking the mould after expensive trips to Hong Kong, Taiwan and India. The most expensive traveller in the year after the 2017 election was Leo Docherty, Conservative MP for Aldershot, who went on six trips worth a total of Â£26,895. Most of this was at the invitation of the governments of Bahrain, Saudi Arabia and United Arab Emirates. Mr Docherty, who ran the Conservative Middle East Council before entering Parliament last year, was part of a delegation invited by the Saudi government to ""see the impact of ballistic missile strikes in the Saudi/Yemen border region and gain a deeper understanding of the strategic importance of the Coalition operations in Yemen"". His four-day visit in January was valued at Â£8,257. In response to questions about this trip, Mr Docherty said: ""The kingdom of Saudi Arabia has for many years been a hugely important strategically for UK across many sectors."" In a contribution to an emergency debate on the crisis in Yemen on 11 September 2017, Mr Docherty defended the actions of the Saudi military, saying: ""I am convinced that our influence helps the Saudis fight this war better, and that is extremely important."" Mr Docherty also travelled to the kingdom in September 2017 to meet King Salman bin Abdul Aziz Al Saud, two weeks before putting down a Parliamentary question to the then Defence Secretary Michael Fallon, asking ""what steps his department is taking to support the sale of a second tranche of Typhoon aircraft to Saudi Arabia"". Many overseas delegations are organised by the near 200 All-Party Parliamentary Groups, which are informal collections of MPs and Lords focusing on particular countries or subjects. Mark Menzies - who is a member of 17 of the groups - totalled Â£22,186 worth of travel over five visits, while David Morris cost Â£17,894 to governments including Azerbaijan, Bahrain and Armenia. Not all of the invitations were on behalf of governments. The single most expensive trip over the two-year period was taken by former Conservative cabinet minister Andrew Mitchell. The MP for Sutton Coldfield charged Â£21,157 for a two-day visit to Washington DC with his wife in April 2017 to attend meetings about international development. He was sponsored by the Centre for Strategic and International Studies. John Mann, who registered eight overseas visits on the Register of Interests in the year following the election, the most recorded by any MP, said these trips are ""part of the job"". None of Mr Mann's trips were sponsored by foreign governments and most were related to his role as the UK chair of the Inter-Parliamentary Committee Against Antisemitism. Rachel Davies Teka, head of advocacy at Transparency International UK, which argues for a ban on foreign government-sponsored travel by MPs said the figures represented ""an obvious risk of undue influence over our democratic processes"".

Millions lose half of their local banks,"Sowerby Bridge in West Yorkshire used to have six banks, but Halifax closed in July leaving the town with none About 13 million adults in the UK live in areas where at least half of the local banks and building societies have closed, analysis by the BBC reveals. Figures from theOffice for National Statistics (ONS),externalshow nearly 6,000 local branches have shut since 2010, a fall of a third. The consumer group Which? called the number of closures ""alarming"". Trade association UK Finance said closing a branch was a last resort when usage falls. Banks and building societies have been closing as services have moved online and fewer people visit branches. The breakdown ofONS figures,externalshows that 133 out of 650 parliamentary constituencies across the UK have seen the number of branches fall by at least half since 2010. Figures from Link,external, a cash machine network, also show that between January and August of this year 1,400 free to use cash machines closed across Great Britain. Karen Doyle says banks closing in Sowerby Bridge has affected businesses across the town Sowerby Bridge in West Yorkshire had six banks a decade ago but the last one, a branch of Halifax, closed in July. ""Bank closures have just ripped the heart out of the town"" said Karen Doyle who runs a bakery on the main street. ""For 40 years the cashiers and managers used to come in at lunchtime, and you'd get to know them and it fostered a feeling of community but that's all gone now. ""What really annoys me, is that as taxpayers we bailed the banks out when they were in trouble and now they've left places like Sowerby Bridge behind,"" said Mrs Doyle. A branch of Lloyds Bank used to be housed in this Victorian building in Sowerby Bridge, West Yorkshire Residents have to make what can be an hour-long round trip into Halifax to access banking services. ""It used to be a 10-minute job, taking the weekend's cash into the bank, but it can now take most of the morning,"" said pub landlord Dan Shackleton. ""With every bank closure we've lost another cash machine as well. ""This is a tourist town and and I've lost count of the number of times that our three cash machines have run out."" Landlord Dan Shackleton says local business have to borrow change from each other if they run out The closure of bank branches and building societies has also contributed to the loss of over 1,400 free to use cash machines in the first eight months of 2018. Analysing the data published by Link,external, the BBC found each parliamentary constituency had on average eight free to use cash machines per 10,000 residents in August. There are 63 constituencies with fewer than five ATMs per 10,000 people. The constituency of Sheffield Hallam in South Yorkshire had just two free to use cash machines per 10,000 local residents, the lowest rate in the country. Fish and chip shop worker Billie Cockerill said her shop is getting its first card machine because people are carrying less cash Billie Cockerill works in a fish and chip shop in the constituency. ""Its noticeable that there are fewer cash machines nearby but people's habits are also changing. ""I'd say in the last year I've been really surprised by the the number of people coming in and wanting to pay by card. ""We've been running this shop for over 20 years and in the next couple months we're getting our first card machine because people are just carrying less cash"". MP works 28 hours a week as doctor Having a leg amputated 'like Christmas' Councillor 'teased' with Britney taunts Major city centres such as Glasgow, Cardiff,  Birmingham, Manchester and Leeds have more than 15 machines per 10,000 residents, with more than 60 per 10,000 in the centre of London. Greater use of contactless card payments, extra regulatory costs and more people choosing to use online banking services are all reasons why local bank branches and cash machines have disappeared from local high streets. Councillor 'teased' with Britney taunts 'My husband's cancer lies stole my life' Banksy shredding 'did not go to plan' The ONS reported in August thatmore than two-thirds of people now use the internet to access banking services,external. According to UK Finance, the body that represents banks, the number ofdebit card payments in 2017 made by consumers, was for the first time greater than the number of cash payments. Some experts though have been left concerned by the large drop in the number of banks and cash machines in small geographical areas. ""There are many people still reliant on traditional banking services who are at risk being financially excluded by this alarming rate of branch closures"" said Gareth Shaw from consumer group Which? ""While banks should ensure there are alternative banking facilities in the area, we're told by consumers that these options simply do not offer the full range of services or convenience that a dedicated branch does."" A UK Finance spokesman said: ""Bank branches play an important role in local communities which is why decisions to close them are only ever taken after all other options, like reducing opening hours and staff numbers, have been exhausted."" Bank branch visits have fallen by a quarter since 2012 as people do more banking online from home and on their phones, the spokesman added, but promised investment in ""ATMs and mobile bank branches to reach out to more communities"" would continue.

PM faces backlash over post-Brexit plan,"Jeremy Hunt has urged Tory MPs to get behind Theresa May - amid a backlash against suggestions the Brexit transition period could be extended. The foreign secretary said the ""great strength"" of other EU nations was that they had stayed united in the talks - and he urged Tories to do the same. The PM had to ""maximise her negotiating leverage in Brussels,"" he added. Scottish Secretary David Mundell has raised concerns about a longer transition period with No 10. He told the BBC: ""What I want to be quite clear is that we are still leaving the Commons Fisheries Policy at the end of 2020. I think that's a very important thing for fishermen here in Scotland to know and understand."" Buthe addedthere was not a ""specific proposal"" about extending the transition period, it was just ""something that has been floated"" and said the ""prime minister has my full backing in terms of getting a deal"". Former Conservative leader and prominent Brexiteer Iain Duncan Smith said it would see the UK paying the EU ""tens of billions"" more. How many Labour MPs will back May's Brexit Five things that happened at EU summit No deal Brexit 'could hit food supplies' Brexit: All you need to know He toldBBC's Newsnighthe could not understand an extension when the UK ""still hasn't got anything back in return"",  and said the negotiations ""look more like a capitulation"". But Mr Hunt said it was precisely because Mrs May had not ""capitulated"" to EU demands that no agreement had been reached at the European Council summit this week. And he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""The great strength of the EU in these negotiations is that the 27 EU nations have remained united. And we now need to do the same behind Theresa May to maximise her negotiating leverage in Brussels."" Mrs May briefed around 120 business leaders on Brexit negotiations in a conference call on Friday - Downing Street said while businesses were regularly briefed after European Council meetings, this was the first time Mrs May had conducted one personally. This video can not be played PM: Extension would be 'a matter of months' By BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg As we move towards what the legal deadlines imply are the closing moments of this whole process, some of its moments are becoming pretty strange. The prime minister had a hint of warmth from some parts of the EU empire for the idea of drawing out the implementation period, to give more time to work out the long term fixes. But even so, the politics put such a straitjacket on proceedings that she can't even quite manage to be completely clear about that. So we heard about a proposal that's not a proposal but an ""idea that's emerged"". An extension to an extension that's not a request for a longer transition period but a desire perhaps to have the option. It might sound like Kafka. But it's the words of a government struggling to keep a set of almost impossible promises. Read more from Laura The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and the transition period, which Mrs May prefers to call the implementation period, is designed to smooth the path to a future permanent relationship between the UK and EU. During this period, which is due to finish on 31 December 2020, the UK's relationship with the EU will stay largely the same. But with the two sides failing to reach agreement yet, Mrs May said this arrangement could be extended ""for a few months"", if needed. The UK has signed up to the principle of agreeing an Irish border ""backstop"" - an insurance policy designed to prevent the need for customs checks - in case there is a gap between the transition period ending and the future permanent relationship coming into force. The problem is that the two sides have yet to agree what form the backstop will take, and how long it could last. Please upgrade your browser Mr Hunt said the backstop remained the ""key"" outstanding issue to negotiating a withdrawal agreement for the UK. The UK would not agree to allow ""customs barriers down the Irish Sea"" - the EU has suggested keeping Northern Ireland within EU customs rules for a period - or for the whole of the UK to remain in the customs union ""indefinitely"". ""Because she has held firm on that that has meant we haven't been able to solve the problem this week. But those are two very important matters of principle for the United Kingdom,"" he said. While the issue about the Irish border could be resolved through a free trade deal between the UK and EU, the EU was insisting the UK's withdrawal agreement should be negotiated first, with a ""backstop"", before the ""future relationship"" discussion began, he added. ""If we are going to resolve this, we need to make more progress on the future relationship."" Brexit, the Irish border and the 'battle for the union' Asked if the UK would have to pay more into the EU budget, if the transition period were to be extended, he said: ""All those are issues that would have to be discussed"" adding that the issues of money and of the Common Fisheries Policy were ""very difficult"". Eurosceptic backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg said any proposal that meant an extra Â£15bn a year being paid into the EU budget in return for ""a waffly political declaration"" would be ""very hard to get through the House of Commons"". He told the BBC: ""We are going to be tied to the EU for longer if we go along with what the prime minister is saying, without having any votes. ""So we will pay the EU for the privilege of it making our laws and interpreting them through the European Court of Justice for an extended period - that is not a good deal."" EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier told France Inter radio on Friday that ""90% of the accord on the table has been agreed with Britain"" but added: ""I'm convinced a deal is necessary, I'm still not sure we'll get one."" Asked if the whole agreement could fail on the issue of avoiding a hard border in Ireland, he replied: ""My answer is yes."" In a separate development, Tory MP Johnny Mercer has hit out at the current state of the government, describing it as a ""shit show"". In aninterview with The House magazine, the former Army officer said he would not have stood as an MP ""if the situation was like it is now"" and that he was no longer sure that his ""set of values and ethos"" were still ""aligned with the Conservative Party"".

EU ready to extend transition period,"This video can not be played Theresa May is asked who will be ""disappointed"" by the outcome of Brexit talks The EU says it is ready to extend the proposed length of the post-Brexit transition period if the UK wants. The current plan is for a transition period of 21 months to smooth the path from Brexit to the UK and EU's future permanent relationship. But with the two sides failing to reach a deal yet, UK Prime Minister Theresa May said this arrangement could be extended ""for a few months"", if needed. Some Brexit campaigners have reacted angrily to the suggestion. Mrs May said she was not proposing extending the transition, but that having the option to do so could help solve the current impasse over the Irish border. An EU source told the BBC there would have to be ""financial implications"" if the UK did extend the transition period. EU Council president Donald Tusk spoke to journalists at the end of a Brussels summit where there was no major breakthrough on the key issue of how to avoid new visible border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. Laura Kuenssberg: May's Kafka-esque balancing act Row over Commons 'meaningful vote' Five things that happened at EU summit Varadkar on hard border violence fears France's Macron plays down UK visa fears He said that if ""the UK decided an extension of the transition period would be helpful to reach a deal, I am sure the leaders would be ready to consider this positively"". Mr Tusk declared himself in a ""much better mood"" than after the last summit, in Salzburg. Jean-Claude Juncker, the president of the European Commission, said extension of the transition period ""will probably happen"" saying it was a good idea because it would allow more time to draw up a long-term relationship between the UK and the EU. In her post-summit press conference, Mrs May said the idea of having the option to extend the transition period could be ""a further solution"" to the search for a ""backstop"" to ensure no hard border. ""What we are not doing, we are not standing here proposing an extension to the implementation period,"" she said. ""What we are doing is working to ensure that we have a solution to the backstop issue in Northern Ireland."" This video can not be played BBC Europe editor Katya Adler looks at how united the EU really is over Brexit Both sides are committed to resolving the outstanding issues as soon as possible, she said, adding there was a ""very real sense that people want that deal to be done"". Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar said: ""A lot of things have been agreed but there are still big gaps both in terms of the shape of the future relationship and also the protocol on Northern Ireland and Ireland and the backstop."" The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019, and the transition period, which Mrs May prefers to call the implementation period, is designed to smooth the path to a future permanent relationship.

This is because it involves Northern Ireland staying aligned to EU rules, which the DUP - and the UK government - says is unacceptable because it creates a new border in the Irish sea. Brexiteers are not impressed, with Conservative backbench MP Jacob Rees-Mogg telling Sky News it was ""a rather poor attempt at kicking the can down the road"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The Leave Means Leave campaign said a longer transition would give the EU ""zero incentive to negotiate anything and gives Brussels the power to force whatever they want on to the UK"". Downing Street, meanwhile, insisted there was no difference of opinion with International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who said earlier that the prime minister ""has been very clear about when the implementation period will come to an end"" and ""this is about the rules within that implementation period"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, former Conservative minister Nick Boles described extending this period as as ""desperate last move"" and warned that Mrs May was losing the support of the Tory party. Brexit: All you need to know Another former minister, Remain-voting Nicky Morgan, said an extension would be ""unhelpful"" and would leave the UK in a ""Brexit holding pattern"". Asked earlier whether he would support a longer transition period, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""The prime minister has got herself into this mess by failing to reach any meaningful agreements with the EU"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said the cost of extending the transition period would have to be ""teased out"" during the negotiations.

Electric cars: What if you live in a flat?,"Charging a car at work is a possibility for some flat-dwellers In the street where I live no one yet owns an electric car - because there are no driveways on which to charge them. Indeed nearly a third of car-owners in the UK have no off-street parking, as they live in a flat or a terraced house. Public charge points are not always an option either; even in big cities the nearest facility can often be a 20-minute walk away. It is a problem the government is doing its best to tackle, but the pace of change is slow. In the meantime the worry is that the electric car revolution could by-pass millions of people, particularly in the inner cities. But there are some things that flat-dwellers can do to make owning an electric vehicle (EV) practical. One option is to ask your local authority to install a charge point in your street. The government's Office for Low Emission Vehicles (OLEV) has set aside Â£4.5m to support such applications over the next two years. OLEV will pay,externalup to 75% of the costs of installation, to a maximum of Â£7,500. That leaves councils having to find just 25% of the costs. Clickhere,externalto find your nearest charge point. However, since 2016, only five local authorities have applied for money from the scheme: Portsmouth, Kensington and Chelsea, Cambridge, Luton and Kettering. Together they have installed just 50 charging points between them. As a result the government has written to all local councils, telling them there is plenty of money in the pot, and they should use it. ""Millions of homes in the UK do not have off-street parking, so this funding is important to help local councils ensure that all their residents can take advantage of this revolution,"" said a frustrated transport minister, Jesse Norman. How your car could power your home Switching to electric cars will take time However some cash-short local authorities are still concerned about the cost, as well as having to clutter up streets with dedicated parking places. Thanks to government subsidies, more and more employers are installing charge points at work. By 2022, half the firms that have car parks are expected to have at least one charging facility. Matthew Thomason is able to use his workplace charging point Matthew Thomason, who lives in a flat in Nottingham, has been able to take advantage of such a scheme at Rolls-Royce, where he works as an engineer on the engine that goes into the Airbus A350. He commutes 17 miles to Derby each day, and charges his Renault Zoe in the car park for around four hours. ""It's just so convenient,"" he says. ""It's approximately as good as having a charge point at home."" But he thinks many other flat-dwellers still struggle with the charging network. ""It's definitely got to improve. If we want to have mass uptake, then you need to make it simpler."" It is the big cities which are most affected by the lack of driveways, and which have a high proportion of flat-dwellers. But it is precisely these areas where electric cars are an effective means to reduce pollution. Six councils in London - Richmond, Hounslow, Westminster, Wandsworth, Hackney and Kensington and Chelsea - have been trialling charge points installed in lamp posts next to parking bays. These may not be as powerful as dedicated fast or rapid charge points, but they are cheaper to install, and do not require additional street furniture. In partnership with OVO energy, Kensington and Chelsea is currently having an extra 50 lamp-post charging points installed, all powered by renewable energy. ""Most residents do not have access to off-street parking to charge an electric vehicle,"" says Cllr Gerard Hargreaves of Kensington and Chelsea Council. ""Retro-fitting street lamps with charging technology allows drivers to conveniently charge their vehicles closer to home, while helping to tackle air pollution in London."" Among the other options are to use public charge points near where you live - or at a supermarket, for example. In total there are now 5244 places to charge your car, around 20% of which are in London. Elsewhere - particularly in rural areas like Wales - coverage is very patchy. But since many charge point locations have several sockets, there are 14,839 ""connectors"". However Justin Benson, the UK head of automotive at the consultancy firm KPMG, believes improvements in battery technology will soon change the dynamics of re-charging. Within a couple of years, cars will be made which have a range of up to 300 miles (500km) between charges, double that of current vehicles. So owners will no longer have to charge their cars every night. ""If you want to buy an electric vehicle, I wouldn't discourage someone who lives in a flat,"" says Mr Benson. ""The main reason being that the average EV driver will soon be re-charging for a 200-300 mile range. ""We see them charging it once a week, or once every ten days."" He also believes that the biggest thing holding back the adoption of electric cars is not the charging network, but the price of the cars themselves and the lack of a certainty about their value second-hand. The government is adamant that it is doing everything it can to improve the charging network. Among its other initiatives are: A plan to install charge points at least every 20 miles on motorways and A roads in England A scheme to make Â£200m available to companies that make charge points Plans to install 17 rapid charging hubs in city centres and on ring roads TheElectric Vehicle Home Charge scheme,external, which gives up to Â£500 for charge points in driveways Those with a drive can get a grant for a charge point A Department for Transport spokesperson told the BBC: ""Additional measures will be brought forward under the Automated and Electric Vehicles Bill, which will increase the number of public charge points, make them more convenient to access, and work seamlessly right across the UK."" However, a group of MPs on the Environmental Audit Committee says the government is still not doing enough to encourage drivers to buy low-emission vehicles. And it accused ministers of falling behind on their own targets - namely that ""most"" cars and vans should be electric by 2030. Last month less than 2% of the vehicles sold in the UK were electric. If that is to change, those who don't own a drive, or who live in a flat, may need a lot of persuading to buy one.

Have you already bought your last car?,"Driverless taxis - the transport of the future? I'm guessing you are scoffing in disbelief at the very suggestion of this article, but bear with me. A growing number of tech analysts are predicting that in less than 20 years we'll all have stopped owning cars, and, what's more, the internal combustion engine will have been consigned to the dustbin of history. Yes, it's a big claim and you are right to be sceptical, but the argument that a unique convergence of new technology is poised to revolutionise personal transportation is more persuasive than you might think. The central idea is pretty simple: Self-driving electric vehicles organised into an Uber-style network will be able to offer such cheap transport that you'll very quickly - we're talking perhaps a decade - decide you don't need a car any more. And if you're thinking this timescale is wildly optimistic, just recall how rapidly cars replaced horses. Take a look at this picture of 5th Avenue in New York in 1900. Can you spot the car? Now look at this picture from 1913. Yes, this time where's the horse? In 1908 the first Model T Ford rolled off the production line;by 1930 the equestrian age was, to all intents and purposes, over,external- and all thanks to the disruptive power of an earlier tech innovation - the internal combustion engine. So how will this latest transportation revolution unfold? First off, consider how Uber and other networked taxi companies have already changed the way we move around. In most major cities an Uber driver - or one of its rivals - is usually just a couple of minutes away, and charges less than established taxis, let's say Â£10. The company's exponential growth is evidence ofhow powerful the Uber business model is. Now take out the driver. You've probably cut costs by at least 50%. Uber has been experimenting with driverless cars So if we're trying to work out when this revolution will begin in earnest the key date will be when self-driving vehicle technology is available and - crucially - has regulatory backing. That could well be sooner than you think. The UK has said it hopes to authorisethe first fully autonomous cars as early as 2021. And, say enthusiasts for autonomy, it will only take one city to prove the technology is safe and useful and the rest of the world will very quickly rush to catch up. So self-driving cars have cut our Â£10 journey to Â£5. Now imagine the current mostly fossil fuel-powered taxi fleet is replaced with electric cars. At the moment electric vehicles are more expensive than similar models with internal combustion engines, but offer significantly lower lifetime costs. Electric vehicle sales surge in UK The UK firm hoping to take on Googleâs driverless cars Driverless cars on UK roads by 2021 - really? They are more reliable, for a start. The typical electric car has around 20 moving parts compared to the 2,000 or so in an internal combustion engine. As a result electric vehicles also tend to last much longer. Most electric car manufacturers expect their vehicles to keep on going for at least 500,000 miles. These factors aren't that important for most consumers - after all,the average driver in England does less than 10,000 miles a year,externalandour cars are parked 95% of the time,external. However, they are huge issues if you're using a vehicle pretty much continuously, as would be the case with a self-driving taxi. The end of the road for the internal combustion engine? Add in the low cost of recharging batteries compared to refuelling and you've got another dramatic reduction in costs. And it's worth noting that the cost of electric vehicles is likely to continue to fall, and rapidly. As they become mainstream, returns to scale will drive down costs. That's the logic behind Tesla's $5bn (Â£3.8bn) battery plant,the so-called ""Gigafactory"". How does this affect our Â£10 journey? It brings another dramatic reduction. Fully autonomous electric taxi networks could offer rides at as little as 10% of current rates. At least that's what tech prophet Tony Seba reckons. He and his team at the think-tank RethinkX have done more than anyone else to think through how this revolution might rip throughthe personal transportation market,external. We've now cut our Â£10 fare to just Â£1. Mr Seba calls the idea of a robo-taxi network ""transport as a service"", and estimates it could save the average American as much as $6,000 (Â£4,560) a year. That's the equivalent of a 10% pay rise. And don't forget, when the revolution comes you won't be behind the wheel so now you'll be working or relaxing as you travel - another big benefit. You still think that car parked outside your flat is worth having? What's more, once this new model of getting around takes hold the benefits are likely to be reinforcing. The more vehicles in the network, the better the service offered to consumers; the more miles self-driving cars do, the more efficient and safer they'll get; the more electric vehicles manufactured, the cheaper each one will be. Don't worry about running out of charge Don't worry that rural areas will be left out. A vehicle could be parked in every village waiting for your order to come. And range anxiety - the fear that you might run out of electricity - won't be a problem either. Should the battery run low the network will send a fully charged car to meet you so you can continue your journey. You've probably seen headlines about accidents involving self-driving cars but the truth is they will be far safer than ones driven by you and me - they won't get regulatory approval if they are not.  That means tens of thousands of lives - perhaps hundreds of thousands - will be savedas accident rates plummet. That will generate yet another cost saving for our fleets of robo-taxis. The price of insurance will tumble, while at the same time those of us who insist on continuing to drive our own vehicles will face higher charges. According to the tech visionaries it won't be long before the whole market tilts irreversibly away from car ownership and the trusty old internal combustion engine. RethinkX, for example, reckons that within 10 years of self-driving cars getting regulatory approval 95% of passenger miles will be in these electric robo-taxis. Will cars parked outside houses soon be a thing of the past? The logical next step will be for human beings to be banned from driving cars at all because they pose such a risk to other road users. Take a moment to think about the wide-reaching effects this revolution will have, aside from just changing how we get around. There will be downsides: millions of car industry workers and taxi drivers will be looking for new jobs, for a start. But think of the hundreds of billions of dollars consumers will save, and which can now be spent elsewhere in the economy. Meanwhile, the numbers of cars will plummet. RethinkX estimates that the number of vehicles on US roads will fall from nearly 250 million to just 45 million over a 10-year period. That will free up huge amounts of space in our towns and cities. And, please take note: I haven't mentioned the enormous environmental benefits of converting the world's cars to electricity. That's because the logic of this upheaval isn't driven by new rules on pollution or worries about global warming but by the most powerful incentive in any economy - cold hard cash. That said, there's no question that a wholesale switch away from fossil fuels will slow climate change and massively reduce air pollution. In short, let the revolution begin! But seriously, I've deliberately put these arguments forcefully to prompt debate and we want to hear what you think. You can comment below, or tweet me@BBCJustinR,external.

"Doctors 'need to discuss death honestly'They shouldn't shy away when patients want to talk about the end of their lives, a report says.Health","Doctors need to get better at having difficult conversations with dying patients and not just in their final days, according to a report from the Royal College of Physicians. It says doctors should talk to people who could die within 12 months, who may be frail or terminally ill, and give them choices over their future care. But the report says that rarely happens and doctors should be more proactive. It recommends involving family, friends and carers in the conversation too. The report,Talking about dying,external, gathered the views of patients, trainees and doctors on how to begin conversations about the end of someone's life. Although doctors say they find these types of conversations challenging, the report said it was important they didn't ""shy away"" from them. It said doctors in all areas of healthcare should engage with a patient who wanted to talk about dying. But it shouldn't be ""a one-off, tick-box event"". Linda Magistris set up a charity called the Good Grief Trust after her husband died from cancer. She says she was shocked by the way he was told the end was close. ""They literally just said you've got weeks to live, and, sadly, it was done in an environment that wasn't private. ""There were five people around the bed, pagers were going off at the same time - it was very chaotic. ""That was a private moment and a really significant moment for him and it should have been done more sensitively."" How do you talk about dying to someone who is dying? One in three adults admitted to hospital with a serious illness or injury and 80% of care home residents are estimated to be in their last year of life. The General Medical Council says patients should be considered to be approaching the end of their life if they: are likely to die in the next year have progressive, incurable conditions have other conditions and are generally frail have conditions that could cause death if there was a sudden deterioration have life-threatening acute conditions caused by sudden catastrophic events But only a quarter of patients in these categories are given the chance to discuss the end of their life with a doctor, the report says, and those with heart failure, dementia and frailty are much less likely to be identified. Nearly half of all deaths in England happen in hospital - and 25% of people who die there have been in hospital for more than a month. But surveys suggest hospitals are where communication about the end of life is poorest. Why the world needs to get ready for more people dying Talk more about dying, expert says UK end-of-life care 'best in world' âWhy I filmed a man take his final breath' Ask the patient if they would like to have the conversation and how much information they want All healthcare professionals treating patients with chronic conditions or a terminal illness should help plan their care Start conversations about the future at any point - and there doesn't have to be a conclusion reached Use appropriate language with patients and their families - and involve all the relevant people The report suggests junior doctors don't get enough hands-on training talking about dying with real patients. Dr Victoria Tzortziou Brown, from the Royal College of GPs, said patients should feel reassured that GPs were ""highly-trained to have sensitive conversations"" with them and their families. She said: ""The entire relationship between GP and patient is based on good communication, and we have a unique role in the NHS of caring for our patients from when they are born to the end of their lives. ""We are pleased that the report highlights this and hope it will help GPs and other healthcare professionals with their conversations on these important issues."" Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians London, said: ""This is not just about palliative care in the final days but about having a series of conversations much earlier after a terminal diagnosis."" Prof Dame Jane Dacre, the previous president of the RCP, said: ""Patients value and benefit from clear conversations about the end of life.

Choudary, 51, has served less than half of his sentence and will complete the rest under strict supervision. Up to 25 measures to control him have been prepared, the BBC understands. His release from prison comes approximately four months early because of time spent bailed on an electronic tag before his conviction. Choudary, from Ilford in east London, once headed up the al-Muhajiroun network - a leading extremist group which was banned under terrorism laws. The father-of-five did not organise terror attacks, but is considered one of the UK's most prominent radicalisers. He has been described as a ""hardened dangerous terrorist"" and someone who has had a ""huge influence on Islamist extremism in this country"" by former Met Police terror chief Richard Walton. Read more: Who is Anjem Choudary and why was he in prison? The BBC has learnt from counter-extremism sources that Anjem Choudary refused to take part in deradicalisation courses or exercises while serving the custodial part of his sentence. He spent most of his time at HMP Frankland, County Durham, where he became the first inmate to be held in a separation unit, designed for the most high-risk terrorism offenders who are capable of radicalising others. On a number of occasions, Choudary was offered opportunities to speak to mainstream religious leaders and other experts who have successfully turned around the mindset of other extremists. But on each of those occasions, Choudary refused. Nevertheless, the prison authorities were not able to delay his release. His departure from Belmarsh prison came automatically under legislation that allows prisoners to serve the second part of their sentence ""on licence"" in the community. This means he will not be free but must comply with a list of conditions. If he breaches them, he risks being recalled to prison. Police will be closely monitoring Choudary - through probation officers and a requirement that he report to officials. Cars were seen leaving HMP Belmarsh in Woolwich, south-east London, early on Friday morning Choudary is staying at a bail hostel in north London. He will be in a probation hostel for six months, the BBC understands. The conditions he must obey include: A ban from preaching at or attending certain mosques He will only be allowed to associate with people who have been approved by the authorities He will be allowed one phone and is banned from using an internet-enabled device without permission Use of the internet will be supervised He cannot travel outside Greater London's M25 He will not be able to leave the UK without permission. Earlier this week, it was announced Choudary had his assets frozen andwas listed on a global record of known terrorists,externaloverseen by the United Nations Security Council. The asset-freezing order means he will be under extremely strict financial controls which typically mean the authorities will be alerted if he tries to open a bank account or move money. This video can not be played The former head of counter-terror at the Met police speaks to Newsnight ahead of Anjem Choudary's release Prime Minister Theresa May said on Thursday that authorities including the police, prison and probation service had ""significant experience in dealing with such offenders"". But John Woodcock, a member of the Home Affairs Select Committee,tweeted that his release was ""wrong"", ""crazy"" and ""puts the public in danger"",external. Calling on Home Secretary Sajid Javid to take a tougher counter-terror approach, using Australian law as an example, Mr Woodcock added: ""He needs to act fast to protect the public from terrorists being released back onto British streets."" Sir Mark Rowley, the former UK head of counter-terror policing, said it is important ""not to overstate his [Choudary's] significance"". ""At the end of the day he's a pathetic groomer of others, that's what he has done in the past,"" said Mr Rowley. ""He's not some sort of evil genius we all need to be afraid of."" By BBC home affairs correspondent, Dominic Casciani When Choudary was charged in 2015 with inviting support for IS, it was a moment of great success for counter-terrorism chiefs - and they were already trying to build cases against other associates. Some, including close confidantes, were jailed. At least four others, who cannot be named for legal reasons, were subject to a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure (TPim), a form of control that places two years of restrictions on the movements and activities of terrorism suspects who have not been charged with a crime. Detectives also looked for evidence of standard crimes - such as fraud - as a means to further ""disrupt"" the network. The insider view is that this work has been generally successful because it made the targets aware they could no longer act with impunity. In theory, it created space for the security service MI5 and their police detective colleagues to focus on more urgent threats.

Trump makes new threat over border,"The group was held at the border by Guatemalan police on Monday for several hours US President Donald Trump has threatened to use military force to completely close the US-Mexico border. The warning, via a series of tweets on Thursday, comes as a new caravan of more than 3,000 migrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala heads north. Mr Trump has already threatened to cut all aid payments to the three countries over illegal immigration. The group says they are fleeing violence and poverty. ""In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military andCLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER,external!,"" Mr Trump wrote. Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' Who decided to separate illegal immigrant families? Good news for Honduras' murder capital? The president has previously threatenedto cut Honduran aid.The US sent more than $175m (Â£130m) to the country in 2016 and 2017,external, according to the US Agency for International Development. The group of Central American migrants has made its intentions clear: they are heading to the US. Since he was on the campaign trail, Mr Trump has lambasted illegal immigrants, and this latest caravan comes after a major crackdown on migrants heading over the Mexican border. Changes to detention rules sawthousands of migrant children detainedand separated from their parents earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation. The president's threats also come just weeks before the mid-term elections on 6 November, which could see Democrats unseating Republicans on Capitol Hill. Mr Trump's recent comments are probably an effort to bolster support among his base by cracking down on migration. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News This isn't the first time President Donald Trump has used an organised group of Central American refugees heading to the US to drum up support for his border security and immigration policies. With the mid-term elections 19 days away, however, the stakes are higher and the rhetoric is sharper. It may not end up much more than rhetoric, however. Mr Trump's Twitter threats have, in the past, proven an unreliable indicator of future decisions. There could be political benefit to the president's accusations, lobbed toward Democrats, and the warnings to Latin American leaders - but presidential action would have consequences. Using the military to ""close"" the border would be enormously disruptive in states like Texas and Arizona (which, by the way, have two high-profile Senate races). The move would also complicate relations between the US and Mexico, as Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to assume the Mexican presidency in December. A recent Fox News poll shows that probable midterm voters are more interested in preserving healthcare protections and ""reining in Donald Trump"" than immigration or border security. The president, with his tweets, is trying to change that. If he can't, it will be an election fought on uncomfortable ground for Republicans. The migrant caravan is currently making its way through Guatemala, mostly on foot, with several of the quickest already arriving at Mexico's southern border by Thursday. Their journey began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on Friday. Most migrants are carrying few belongings, taking what they can carry in backpacks, as they head out on the nearly 2,800 mile (4,500km) trek from Honduras to the US border. This video can not be played The migrant caravan Trump keeps referencing Thousands of people and goods legally cross the US-Mexico border daily. While Mr Trump has sent national guard troops to the border before, it is unclear what he means by shutting it down entirely, and whether that would affect businesses or people with legitimate visas. And according to international law, the US cannot deport asylum seekers without first determining the validity of their claim. Under pressure from the US to stop the migrants, Mexico has sent federal police to the border, though they are not officially there to stop the caravan. Mexican officials said on Wednesday that those without papers would have to apply for refugee status or turn back. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be in Mexico this Friday, and US media report that he will discuss plans to stop the caravan. ""The surreal side of this perceived crisis at the border is that the border is more under control now than it was 15 or 20 years ago,"" Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, told the BBC. Mr Selee said closing the border ""would wreak havoc on Mexican and American economies"". ""It could be a symbolic effort,"" he adds. ""A way of pressuring Mexico - but that would have a limited effect on illegal crossings and a huge effect on legal crossings."" A caravan of immigrants departs the Guatemalan capital city at dawn en route to the Mexican border The Associated Press,externalreports that many migrants do not have passports and have been using national ID cards, which allow them to travel within Central America. Mexico, however, requires a passport at entry. Human rights groups have criticised the US and Mexican response to the caravan. Erika Guevara-Rosas of Amnesty International said in a statement: ""Mexican authorities should not take a Trump approach treating people like a security threat."" ""These families deserve dignity and respect to ensure that no one is illegally returned to situations where they could risk serious harm due to violence."" Mexican president-elect AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador plans to offer work visas to Central Americans when he takes office in December. ""It is a plan that we have, that anyone who wants to work in Mexico will have a work visa,"" he said. Mr Selee told the BBC he thinks Mexico will ""try to defuse the crisis"" the same way they did with the last migrant caravan: by giving some people legal status or the chance to apply for asylum and deporting others. ""The caravan will probably diminish before it reaches the US-Mexico border, but the whole episode will harden views on immigration in the US on both sides and make Mexico more wary about cooperating with the US,"" he says. A Honduran migrant, part of a caravan trying to reach the US, and her daughter at a migrant shelter in Guatemala City An estimated 10% of the population of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have fled danger, forced gang recruitment and dismal economic opportunities. The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The UN reported murder rates in 2015 in Honduras standing at 63.75 deaths per 100,000 and El Salvador at 108.64 deaths. Jari Dixon, an opposition politician in Honduras, tweeted on Monday that the caravan was not ""seeking the American dream"" but ""fleeing the Honduras nightmare"". In a statement on Tuesday, Honduras' foreign ministry urged its citizens to ""not let themselves be used by a movement that is clearly political and seeks to disrupt the governability, stability and peace"".

Scotswoman is fastest to cycle round world,"A Scottish adventurer has become the fastest woman to cycle around the world. Jenny Graham, from Inverness, circumnavigated the globe by bike in 125 days. The 38-year-old arrived at the Brandenburg Gate in Berlin on Thursday. Jenny knocked almost three weeks off the previous women's record of 144 days, which was set by Italy's Paola Gianotti in 2014. She left Berlin on 16 June, and cycled 18,000 miles across four continents, travelling through 16 countries. Jenny Graham's achievement took her through 16 countries She passed through Germany, Poland, Latvia, Lithuania, Russia, Mongolia, China, Australia, New Zealand, Canada, US, Portugal, Spain and France. She took four flights and one boat, and carried everything she needed with her. Jenny said she cycled for 32 hours to get to the finish line, and that the team effort to organise the world record attempt started around a year before she began. She said: ""I just set out to see how far I could go. The furthest I've cycled before was from Land's End to John o' Groats, now I have cycled right around the world. ""It's sometimes been tough, but I thrive on challenges on the road and of course it has also been so amazing! ""I knew I wanted to do something solo to test my physical and mental ability. ""I am the fittest I have ever been, so I thought I'd train hard and give it a go - here I am back in Berlin, I can hardly believe it."" Jenny's progress was mapped on the Adventure Syndicate website She said the response from people around the world was mostly good. ""The majority of people wanted the best for me, and wanted to help me. Getting away from them was the hardest part."" To make the record official, Guinness World Records still needs to ratify the data. Fellow Scot Mark Beaumont is the current male record-holder for the feat, which he completed in September 2017.

Doctors 'need to discuss death honestly',"Doctors need to get better at having difficult conversations with dying patients and not just in their final days, according to a report from the Royal College of Physicians. It says doctors should talk to people who could die within 12 months, who may be frail or terminally ill, and give them choices over their future care. But the report says that rarely happens and doctors should be more proactive. It recommends involving family, friends and carers in the conversation too. The report,Talking about dying,external, gathered the views of patients, trainees and doctors on how to begin conversations about the end of someone's life. Although doctors say they find these types of conversations challenging, the report said it was important they didn't ""shy away"" from them. It said doctors in all areas of healthcare should engage with a patient who wanted to talk about dying. But it shouldn't be ""a one-off, tick-box event"". Linda Magistris set up a charity called the Good Grief Trust after her husband died from cancer. She says she was shocked by the way he was told the end was close. ""They literally just said you've got weeks to live, and, sadly, it was done in an environment that wasn't private. ""There were five people around the bed, pagers were going off at the same time - it was very chaotic. ""That was a private moment and a really significant moment for him and it should have been done more sensitively."" How do you talk about dying to someone who is dying? One in three adults admitted to hospital with a serious illness or injury and 80% of care home residents are estimated to be in their last year of life. The General Medical Council says patients should be considered to be approaching the end of their life if they: are likely to die in the next year have progressive, incurable conditions have other conditions and are generally frail have conditions that could cause death if there was a sudden deterioration have life-threatening acute conditions caused by sudden catastrophic events But only a quarter of patients in these categories are given the chance to discuss the end of their life with a doctor, the report says, and those with heart failure, dementia and frailty are much less likely to be identified. Nearly half of all deaths in England happen in hospital - and 25% of people who die there have been in hospital for more than a month. But surveys suggest hospitals are where communication about the end of life is poorest. Why the world needs to get ready for more people dying Talk more about dying, expert says UK end-of-life care 'best in world' âWhy I filmed a man take his final breath' Ask the patient if they would like to have the conversation and how much information they want All healthcare professionals treating patients with chronic conditions or a terminal illness should help plan their care Start conversations about the future at any point - and there doesn't have to be a conclusion reached Use appropriate language with patients and their families - and involve all the relevant people The report suggests junior doctors don't get enough hands-on training talking about dying with real patients. Dr Victoria Tzortziou Brown, from the Royal College of GPs, said patients should feel reassured that GPs were ""highly-trained to have sensitive conversations"" with them and their families. She said: ""The entire relationship between GP and patient is based on good communication, and we have a unique role in the NHS of caring for our patients from when they are born to the end of their lives. ""We are pleased that the report highlights this and hope it will help GPs and other healthcare professionals with their conversations on these important issues."" Prof Andrew Goddard, president of the Royal College of Physicians London, said: ""This is not just about palliative care in the final days but about having a series of conversations much earlier after a terminal diagnosis."" Prof Dame Jane Dacre, the previous president of the RCP, said: ""Patients value and benefit from clear conversations about the end of life.

Having a leg amputated 'like Christmas',"Lexi Chambers says: ""I don't get very much sleep, I'm very reliant on my crutches and I've just ordered a wheelchair"" A woman having a leg amputated has said the operation ""will be like my birthday and Christmas rolled into one"". Lexi Chambers, a nurse from Exeter, said she suffers ""gut-wrenching pain"" in her foot. The 40-year-old has had five operations to cure pain from ""hammer toes,external"" in her left leg and has had two toes removed. But she has remained in constant pain and her request to have her leg amputated has now been approved by an NHS surgeon. Ms Chambers, who had run half marathons and taken part in fitness competitions, said the pain in her foot started five years ago. Latest news and stories from Devon ""After running it would be a sharp pain with a dull ache for several hours,"" she said. Five operations have left her without two toes but still in constant pain Two operations left her in more pain so she asked to have a toe removed.

MP unsure if Tories still share his values,"A Tory backbencher has criticised the government and said he would not have stood as an MP ""if the situation was like it is now"". Johnny Mercer told The House magazine he was no longer sure that his ""set of values and ethos"" were still ""aligned with the Conservative Party"". And he used strong language to describe the current state of the government. He said he was an ""inherently team player"" but had to come to the realisation that it was a ""shit show"". ""And it's hard because people like me are in this because we believe in something, because we want to be part of something greater than ourselves,"" he said. Mr Mercer, an ex-Army officer, has saidhe never voted until he became an MP. The MP for Plymouth Moor View has been critical of the party before, telling the Telegraph in 2017 it was ""in danger of losing credibility"". In hisinterview with The House,external, Mr Mercer - who was first elected in 2015 - was critical of Prime Minister Theresa May's response to a question about investigations into Northern Ireland veterans, saying ""she did not answer in a way that made me proud to be a member of the governing party"". And, of her Chequers blueprint for post-Brexit relations with the EU, he said: ""That is your classic professional politicians' answer because it's right down the middle. It doesn't make anybody happy. It's the ultimate in not making a decision."" He said, ""under this chief whip, under this prime minister, there is no role for people like me"" but added: ""That's fine because nothing lasts for ever."" Mr Mercer admitted he would like to be defence secretary - he has campaigned for veterans, including those with mental health problems - and said that while his ""set of values and ethos"" had been aligned with the Conservative Party, ""I'm not as comfortable that that's the case any more"". Asked at an event on Friday whether he regretted his comments, he said: ""I think people for a long time have had problems with politicians who are not real, are not honest, and then when you are honest you attract the sort of attention I have today."" He told the audience at the Dorchester Literary Festival that the ""political class"" was moving away from the values he believed in, adding: ""So I absolutely don't regret it. ""Clearly, you know, I could have used some less harsh language. But... the reality is that's how I feel about politics at the moment."" Before becoming an MP, Mr Mercer served with 29 Commando, part of the Royal Artillery and completed three tours in Afghanistan. He won his Devon seat from Labour in 2015 and increased his majority in last year's snap election. Mr Mercer is currently appearing in the Channel 4 series Celebrity Hunted, in which eight well-known personalities go ""on the run"" in pairs and have to evade a team of former police, military and intelligence experts given the job of tracking them down.

Diesel sales to plummet by 2030,"Diesel-powered vehicles are expected to fall to just 5% of the EU car market by 2030, a new study indicates. Worries about air quality and emissions standards have already hit diesel car sales, but consulting firm AlixPartners says the decline will accelerate. Diesels' share of the European market has already fallen from 52% to 45% between 2015 and 2017, the firm says. However, the shift away from diesel will make it even harder for the EU to meet CO2 emissions targets, it adds. Diesel was promoted as more environmentally-friendly than petrol as part of EU efforts to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and carbon dioxide (CO2) in particular. While diesel fuel contains slightly more carbon, overall CO2 emissions of the average diesel car are lower. However, diesel engines generally produce higher levels of nitrogen oxides and of particulates - tiny pieces of soot that can enter the lungs. ""The EU fleet needs to deliver a 4.6% reduction [in CO2] per year through to 2021. However, in 2017, overall EU CO2 increased 0.3g/km,"" said the study. AlixPartners said carmakers were ""facing a technology choice"", with electric and hybrid vehicles ""the only answer"" to the challenge of reducing emissions. Diesel cars: Why are sales falling? 'Worst to come' for diesel cars Diesel cars: Your questions answered Is diesel always the biggest pollution hazard? Public confidence in diesel was also dented by the Volkswagen emissions scandal, when it emerged in 2015 that diesel cars had been fitted with devices designed to cheat emissions tests. In the UK, diesel car sales fell by 23.6% in May compared with the same month in 2017, according to the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). It was the 14th month in a row that diesel's UK market segment had shrunk. In 2017, demand for new diesel cars fell 17%. Higher taxes on diesel vehicles may have affected demand in the UK too. In the November 2017 Budget, the government announced a levy on new diesel vehicles that failed to meet the latest emissions standards. The first-year road tax increase for diesel cars came into effect in April and will apply until about 2021. Diesel cars: Why are sales falling?

Trump makes new threat over borderDonald Trump says he may call upon the military to shut the border if the Central American caravan continues.US & Canada,"The group was held at the border by Guatemalan police on Monday for several hours US President Donald Trump has threatened to use military force to completely close the US-Mexico border. The warning, via a series of tweets on Thursday, comes as a new caravan of more than 3,000 migrants from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala heads north. Mr Trump has already threatened to cut all aid payments to the three countries over illegal immigration. The group says they are fleeing violence and poverty. ""In addition to stopping all payments to these countries, which seem to have almost no control over their population, I must, in the strongest of terms, ask Mexico to stop this onslaught - and if unable to do so I will call up the U.S. Military andCLOSE OUR SOUTHERN BORDER,external!,"" Mr Trump wrote. Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' Who decided to separate illegal immigrant families? Good news for Honduras' murder capital? The president has previously threatenedto cut Honduran aid.The US sent more than $175m (Â£130m) to the country in 2016 and 2017,external, according to the US Agency for International Development. The group of Central American migrants has made its intentions clear: they are heading to the US. Since he was on the campaign trail, Mr Trump has lambasted illegal immigrants, and this latest caravan comes after a major crackdown on migrants heading over the Mexican border. Changes to detention rules sawthousands of migrant children detainedand separated from their parents earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation. The president's threats also come just weeks before the mid-term elections on 6 November, which could see Democrats unseating Republicans on Capitol Hill. Mr Trump's recent comments are probably an effort to bolster support among his base by cracking down on migration. Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News This isn't the first time President Donald Trump has used an organised group of Central American refugees heading to the US to drum up support for his border security and immigration policies. With the mid-term elections 19 days away, however, the stakes are higher and the rhetoric is sharper. It may not end up much more than rhetoric, however. Mr Trump's Twitter threats have, in the past, proven an unreliable indicator of future decisions. There could be political benefit to the president's accusations, lobbed toward Democrats, and the warnings to Latin American leaders - but presidential action would have consequences. Using the military to ""close"" the border would be enormously disruptive in states like Texas and Arizona (which, by the way, have two high-profile Senate races). The move would also complicate relations between the US and Mexico, as Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador prepares to assume the Mexican presidency in December. A recent Fox News poll shows that probable midterm voters are more interested in preserving healthcare protections and ""reining in Donald Trump"" than immigration or border security. The president, with his tweets, is trying to change that. If he can't, it will be an election fought on uncomfortable ground for Republicans. The migrant caravan is currently making its way through Guatemala, mostly on foot, with several of the quickest already arriving at Mexico's southern border by Thursday. Their journey began in San Pedro Sula, Honduras, on Friday. Most migrants are carrying few belongings, taking what they can carry in backpacks, as they head out on the nearly 2,800 mile (4,500km) trek from Honduras to the US border. This video can not be played The migrant caravan Trump keeps referencing Thousands of people and goods legally cross the US-Mexico border daily. While Mr Trump has sent national guard troops to the border before, it is unclear what he means by shutting it down entirely, and whether that would affect businesses or people with legitimate visas. And according to international law, the US cannot deport asylum seekers without first determining the validity of their claim. Under pressure from the US to stop the migrants, Mexico has sent federal police to the border, though they are not officially there to stop the caravan. Mexican officials said on Wednesday that those without papers would have to apply for refugee status or turn back. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will be in Mexico this Friday, and US media report that he will discuss plans to stop the caravan. ""The surreal side of this perceived crisis at the border is that the border is more under control now than it was 15 or 20 years ago,"" Andrew Selee, president of the Migration Policy Institute, told the BBC. Mr Selee said closing the border ""would wreak havoc on Mexican and American economies"". ""It could be a symbolic effort,"" he adds. ""A way of pressuring Mexico - but that would have a limited effect on illegal crossings and a huge effect on legal crossings."" A caravan of immigrants departs the Guatemalan capital city at dawn en route to the Mexican border The Associated Press,externalreports that many migrants do not have passports and have been using national ID cards, which allow them to travel within Central America. Mexico, however, requires a passport at entry. Human rights groups have criticised the US and Mexican response to the caravan. Erika Guevara-Rosas of Amnesty International said in a statement: ""Mexican authorities should not take a Trump approach treating people like a security threat."" ""These families deserve dignity and respect to ensure that no one is illegally returned to situations where they could risk serious harm due to violence."" Mexican president-elect AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador plans to offer work visas to Central Americans when he takes office in December. ""It is a plan that we have, that anyone who wants to work in Mexico will have a work visa,"" he said. Mr Selee told the BBC he thinks Mexico will ""try to defuse the crisis"" the same way they did with the last migrant caravan: by giving some people legal status or the chance to apply for asylum and deporting others. ""The caravan will probably diminish before it reaches the US-Mexico border, but the whole episode will harden views on immigration in the US on both sides and make Mexico more wary about cooperating with the US,"" he says. A Honduran migrant, part of a caravan trying to reach the US, and her daughter at a migrant shelter in Guatemala City An estimated 10% of the population of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have fled danger, forced gang recruitment and dismal economic opportunities. The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The UN reported murder rates in 2015 in Honduras standing at 63.75 deaths per 100,000 and El Salvador at 108.64 deaths. Jari Dixon, an opposition politician in Honduras, tweeted on Monday that the caravan was not ""seeking the American dream"" but ""fleeing the Honduras nightmare"". In a statement on Tuesday, Honduras' foreign ministry urged its citizens to ""not let themselves be used by a movement that is clearly political and seeks to disrupt the governability, stability and peace"".
