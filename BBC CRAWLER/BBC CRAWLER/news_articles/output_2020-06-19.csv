What went wrong with the coronavirus app?,"After months of work, the UK has ditched the way its coronavirus-tracing app works, prompting a blame game between the government and two of the world's biggest tech firms. So what went wrong? At the end of March, I got a text from a senior figure in the UK's technology industry. This person said they were helping the NHS ""on a very substantial project that will launch in days and potentially save hundreds of thousands of British lives."" That was the first I knew of the plan to build a contact tracing app, a project that soon appeared to be at the very centre of the government's strategy to beat coronavirus and help us all emerge from lockdown. How does contact tracing work? Apple 'not told' about UK's latest app plans Minister suggests winter wait for app The tech luminary had somehow assumed that I could be an adviser to the project - I made it clear that could not be my role but I was very interested in following its progress. Now, nearly three months on, after missing deadline after deadline,there has been a radical change in direction. The app that has been developed so far is being scrapped, and a new approach will be tried based on a system created by Apple and Google. But there is no guarantee when, if ever, this will be rolled out. So what went wrong? When the team from the NHSX digital division was assembled they were told they were engaged on a vital mission. According to a presentation the team was shown the Covid-19 app would have four aims: Stop or slow the epidemic Control the flow of patients into hospitals Help people return to normal life Gather secondary data for use by the NHS and strategic leaders Once installed on a user's phone, the app would use Bluetooth to keep a record of other people with whom they came into close contact - as long as they too had installed the app. Then when someone tested positive for the virus, alerts would be sent to their close contacts of recent days telling them to go into quarantine. The epidemiological expertise was provided by a team of Oxford scientists who had argued that there was an urgent need to  identify people who were spreading the virus without knowing. ""Very fast contact tracing was likely to be essential,"" says one of the Oxford team, Dr David Bonsall. ""And smartphones have the technological capability to speed up that process."" But using the Bluetooth connection on smartphones to detect contacts was untested technology. Still, the team was inspired by Singapore,which had released its Trace Together app using that system. 12 April Heath Secretary Matt Hancock announces the development of ""a new NHS app for contact tracing"". 5 May The app is launched on the Isle of Wight. It is downloaded by 60,000 people, under half the population of the island, over the following 10 days. Â Mr Hancock tells BBC Breakfast that if the trial on the Isle of Wight is successful, the app will be rolled out nationwide by the middle of May. He also says the public would have a ""duty"" to download the app and that 60% of people in the country would have to do so for the system to function. 20 May Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells Parliament: ""We will have a test, track and trace operation that will be world-beating and yes it will be in place by 1 June."" He also says there will be 25,000 trackers who ""will be able to cope with 10,000 new cases a day"". 27 May Contact-tracing system is launched without a nationwide app. Anybody who has been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will have to self-isolate for 14 days. According to government figures, in the first week tracers contact 5,407 people with the virus. 5 June Business Minister Nadhim Zahawi says the app tested on the Isle of Wight will ""be running as soon as we think it is robust"". Speaking on BBC Question Time, the minister says: ""I can't give you an exact date, it would be wrong for me to do so."" Asked to confirm it would be rolled out nationwide this month, he says: ""I'd like to think we'd be able to manage by this month, yes."" 17 June Lord Bethell, the Minister for Innovation at the Department of Health and Social Care, says the app ""isnât the priority"". Answering a question about the app from the Science and Technology Committee, the minister says: ""We are seeking to get something going for the winter, but it isn't the priority for us at the moment."" He declines to offer a launch date for the app. 18 June In a major U-turn, the UK ditches its version and shifts to a model based on technology provided by Apple and Google. The Apple-Google design is promoted as being more privacy-focused. However, it means epidemiologists will have access to less data. But it soon became clear that using Bluetooth was tricky. Reports from Singapore suggested people were reluctant to download the app because it had to be kept open on the phone all the time, draining the battery. Thenon 10 April came a surprising announcement from Google and Apple. The two tech giants - on whose software virtually all the world's smartphones depend - said they were going to develop a system that would help Bluetooth contact-tracing apps work smoothly. But there was a catch - only privacy-focused apps would be allowed to use the platform. Apple and Google favoured decentralised apps, where the matching between infected people and their list of contacts happened between their phones. The alternative was for the matching to be done on a central computer, owned by a health authority, which would end up storing lots of very sensitive information. The app the NHS was developing was based on a centralised model, which the Oxford scientists felt was vital if the health service was to be able to monitor virus outbreaks properly. This video can not be played Matt Hancock said Isle of Wight residents using the app ""will be saving lives"" Two days later, with quite a fanfare, Health Secretary Matt Hancock unveiled the plans for the Covid-19 app, promising ""all data will be handled according to the highest ethical and security standards, and would only be used for NHS care and research"". But immediately privacy campaigners, politicians and technology experts raised concerns. ""I recognise the overwhelming force of the public health arguments for a centralised system, but I also have 25 years' experience of the NHS being incompetent at developing systems and repeatedly breaking their privacy promises,"" said Cambridge University's Prof Ross Anderson. Contact-tracing app forced to delete data Alarm over 'invasive' Kuwait and Bahrain contact-tracing apps Ministers consider NHS contact-tracing app rethink Yet the project was still gathering pacewith the first trial of the app at RAF Leeming, in Yorkshire. The trial was held under artificial conditions, with servicemen and women placing phones adjacent to each other on tables to see what happened. Meanwhile, privacy-conscious Germany became the latest country to switch its app to the decentralised model, using the Apple and Google system. It seemed that Apple had made it clear that it would not cooperate with a centralised app. Michael Veale, a British academic working with a consortium developing decentralised apps, warned that the NHS app was on the wrong path,asking on Twitter,external""will the UK push ahead with an app that will not work on iPhones - which has devastated adoption in Singapore?"" This video can not be played Watch: What is contact tracing and how does it work? But the UKpushed ahead with a trial in the Isle of Wight. As it got underway Mr Hancock told the public they had a ""duty"" to download the app when it became available and that it would be crucial in getting ""our liberty back"" as the lockdown was eased. First sight of the app showed it was very simple, asking users whether they had a fever or a continuous cough. But any symptom alerts sent out to contacts merely echoed the standard ""stay alert"" advice - test results couldn't be entered into the app at this stage. It left many residents confused. Still, the fact that the appwas quickly downloaded bymore than half of the island's smartphone users saw the government branding the trial a success. Meanwhile,the Financial Times revealed,externalthat the government had hired a Swiss software developer to build a second app, using the Apple and Google technology. NHS insiders were quick to downplay the significance of this move - although one admitted ""Downing Street is getting nervous"". This video can not be played Johnson: ""Test, track and trace system in place in the UK by June 1"" Work continued on a second, more sophisticated version of the original app, which was again going to be tested in the Isle of Wight before a national rollout - though the original deadline of mid-May had been missed. On 20 May, however, it became clear that the government's focus was switching to manual-contact tracing. The prime minister announced thata ""world beating"" tracing systemwould be in place by the beginning of June, though Number 10 stressed that the app's contribution to the system would come a bit later. As May drew to a close the boss of the wider test and trace programme, Baroness Dido Harding, said the app would be the ""cherry on the cake"" of the project. It was no longer the cake itself. By early June, more deadlines for the national release of the app had come and gone. Three weeks into the Isle of Wight trial residents were getting restless, with very little information on how it was going or when an updated version of the app was coming. France launched its centralised Stop-Covid app, which had drawn heavy criticism from privacy campaigners, and digital minister Cedric O said600,000 downloads in the first few hours was ""a good start"". On 4 June, Business Minister Nadhim Zadhawi was coaxed into saying the appshould be ready by the end of the month, but that was the last firm deadline that would be promised. Singapore, which had continued to struggle to make its contact tracing app work, announced plans to give all citizens a wearable device in the hope that this would do a better job than a smartphone. On 14 June, Germany became the biggest country to launch a decentralised app on the Apple/Google platform. It quickly outstripped France in terms of downloads with something approaching 10% of the population installing it. By now thesilence from the UK government about the NHS app was deafening. What was going on? Around lunchtime on 18 June all became clear. The BBC broke the story that the government was abandoning the centralised app and moving to something based on Google and Apple's technology. Despite all the spin, the Isle of Wight trial had highlighted a disastrous flaw in the app - it failed to detect 96% of contacts with Apple iPhones. The blame game has already begun. Mr Hancock and some of the scientists working with the NHS believe Apple should have been more cooperative. Technology experts and privacy campaigners say they warned months ago how this story would end. Apple says it did not knowthe UK was working on a ""hybrid"" version of the NHS coronavirus contact-tracing app using tech it developed with Google. Meanwhile, there is scant proof from anywhere around the world that smartphone apps using Bluetooth are an effective method of contact tracing. Back in March, it seemed that the hugely powerful devices most of us carry with us might help us emerge from this health crisis. Now it looks as though a human being on the end of a phone is a far better option. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take?

Hard-hit Brazil passes one million virus cases,"Health experts say the outbreak in Brazil is still weeks away from its peak Brazil has become the second country in the world to confirm more than one million cases of Covid-19, as the disease continues to spread. The health ministry also posted a record number of new cases in the past 24 hours - more than 54,000. In addition, there were more than 1,200 deaths for the fourth consecutive day, taking the total to nearly 49,000. A lack of testing suggests the true figures are higher and experts say the outbreak is weeks away from its peak. The new figure was revealed hours after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the pandemic was entering a ""new and dangerous"" phase, with its director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warning that cases were rising at the same time as people are growing weary of lockdowns and governments are seeking to restart their economies. What are the numbers out of Latin America? Latin America is among the areas currently seeing a spike in infections. There are major outbreaks in a number of countries, including Chile and Peru, while Mexico became the seventh country to officially surpass 20,000 virus-related deaths on Friday. But only the US has seen more infections than Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for his response to the crisis. He has repeatedly clashed with state governors and mayors who have adopted strict restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, shutting down major cities. Mr Bolsonaro argues that the economic impact of the measures will be much bigger than the virus itself, a position shared by many. But his overall approach to the crisis has led to the resignation of two doctors as health minister. Jair Bolsonaro has long-admired Donald Trump and his way of doing politics. The two men have much in common - not least the way they have handled the pandemic in their own countries. The figures in the US are staggering - but Brazil, too, is frightening. They are now exclusive members of a club nobody wants to join. Such a massive spike in the numbers - even if it was down to inaccurate reporting earlier this week - reveals how out of control the virus still is here. This, at a time when big cities are reopening and people are returning to work. For a long time, there was a stand-off between President Bolsonaro and state governors - he was angry that they were imposing tough quarantine measures that he said would damage the economy. But fast forward three months and that pressure from the top seems to have filtered down. With millions of people struggling and out of work, there is a desire to return to some kind of normality. But it feels like a dangerous plan - Brazil has not yet reached its peak. As there was no national lockdown, states and cities adopted their own measures. After months of restrictions, some are slowly being lifted, even though the infection level remains high. There is still concern that the health system will be unable to cope in some places, and that the disease is spreading faster in deprived neighbourhoods and remote areas, such as indigenous communities, where access to adequate care is difficult. This video can not be played Ordinary people in Brazil are taking on extraordinary roles to help their cities cope At the same time, there is a widespread wish to restart the economy as analysts forecast a contraction between 6% and 8% this year with millions of jobs lost. The government has introduced temporary payments to help people affected by the pandemic but large numbers are expected to be thrown into poverty. On Friday, Brazil's health ministry confirmed a total of 1,032,913 cases. It said that the large spike in the number of infections was due, in part, to several states having trouble with reporting data on Thursday. The US has the world's highest numbers of cases - more than 2.2 million - and nearly 119,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. LETTER FROM BRAZIL:How pandemic turned political AT THE HEART OF AMAZON:Disease meets deforestation REALITY CHECK:The crisis in Latin America in numbers RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The coronavirus has become a highly political issue in Brazil. Experts say the president's refusal to follow scientific advice - including those set by the WHO, such as social distancing - is partially responsible for the severity of the crisis. At the start, Mr Bolsonaro repeatedly said the risk posed by the virus had been exaggerated, and even joined some anti-lockdown rallies organised by his supporters, undermining the message of his own health ministry against crowds. Mr Bolsonaro has accused state governors of using the issue for political gain as many who have taken stricter measures oppose his government. JoÃ£o Doria, governor of Brazil's richest state SÃ£o Paulo and an ally-turned-rival, has previously described the president's views on tackling the disease as ""Bolsonarovirus"". Jair Bolsonaro originally said the risk of coronavirus was exaggerated The president has also strongly supported the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of patients, a drug the WHO says does not reduce death rates. After two health ministers quit, the government's response is now being led by an army general who has no experience in public health. Meanwhile, Mr Bolsonaro and his allies have turned against the media, claiming an excessive focus on the number of victims.The health ministry removed data about the virus from a government websiteearlier this month, but was forced to reverse the decision after a Supreme Court order and accusations of trying to manipulate the figures. Amid the pandemic,Mr Bolsonaro is facing a growing political crisis. He is under investigation for allegedly trying to interfere with the police for political motives, which he denies, while the Supreme Court is carrying out two separate inquiries into his allies.

India's Modi vows to protect borders after clashes,"An Indian army convoy drives towards an area bordering China India has vowed to defend its border with military force if necessary, after 20 of its soldiers were killed in violence with Chinese troops on Monday. Prime Minister Narendra Modi says no foreign soldiers are inside Indian borders and no territory has been lost. China has not released any information about its casualties since the clashes at the disputed Himalayan border. The two nuclear powers accuse each other of crossing the poorly demarcated border and provoking the fight. India has said that both sides suffered losses during the fighting in the Galwan Valley, in Ladakh. India and China downplay reports of soldier release The fake news about India and China's border clash In a televised statement on Friday, Mr Modi said that India's armed forces had been ""given a free hand to take all necessary steps"" to protect Indian territory. ""The entire country is hurt and angry at the steps taken by China,"" he said, adding: ""India wants peace and friendship, but upholding sovereignty is foremost."" Mr Modi went on to say that following Monday's clashes, ""neither is anyone inside our territory nor is any of our post captured"". The fatal incident, which was fought without any firearms because of a 1996 agreement barring guns and explosives from the area, also reportedly injured at least 76 other Indian soldiers. An image that emerged on Thursday purportedly showed some of the crude weapons used in the fight. An image passed to the BBC by an Indian military official shows crude weapons purportedly used in the fight The photograph, which appears to show iron rods studded with nails, was passed to the BBC by a senior Indian military official on the India-China border, who said the weapons had been used by the Chinese. The image was widely shared on Twitter in India, prompting outrage from many social media users. Neither Chinese or Indian officials have commented on it. Media reports said troops clashed on ridges at a height of nearly 4,300m (14,000 ft) on steep terrain, with some soldiers falling into the fast-flowing Galwan river in sub-zero temperatures. The Galwan river valley in Ladakh, with its harsh climate and high-altitude terrain, is close to Aksai Chin, a disputed area claimed by India but controlled by China. This is not the first time the two nuclear-armed neighbours have fought without conventional firearms on the border. India and China have a history of face-offs and overlapping territorial claims along the more than 3,440km (2,100 mile), poorly drawn LAC separating the two sides. The last firing on the border happened in 1975 when four Indian soldiers were killed in a remote pass in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. The clash was variously described by former diplomats as an ambush and an accident. But no bullets have been fired since. At the root of this is a 1996 bilateral agreement that says ""neither side shall open fire... conduct blast operations or hunt with guns or explosives within two kilometres of the Line of Actual Control"". But there have been other tense confrontations along the border in recent weeks. In May Indian and Chinese soldiers exchanged physical blows on the border at Pangong Lake, also in Ladakh, and in the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim hundreds of miles to the east. India has accused China of sending thousands of troops into the Galwan Valley and says China occupies 38,000 sq km (14,700 sq miles) of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary disputes.

As we conclude our live coverage today, here is a reminder of Friday's main stories:  We'll be back with more live coverage in the morning. In the meantime, stay safe and enjoy your Friday evening. Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. The Tower opened more than 20 years ago A well-known Edinburgh rooftop restaurant has closed its
doors for the final time amid the coronavirus pandemic. Owners of the Tower Restaurant at the National Museum of Scotland said the premises was coming to the end of its lease and would not reopen when lockdown eases. Proprietor James Thomson said he was concerned about how the business could operate under future social distancing restrictions. Redundancy consultations have started with 37 members of
staff at the Tower, which first opened 22 years ago.  Staff at the intensive care unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary are raising money for a mental health charity to say thank you for the support they've received from the public during the coronavirus crisis. About 120 nurses, doctors and pharmacists are this week collectively covering the distance between John O'Groats and Lands End, through walking, running or cycling. So farthey've raised nearly Â£14,000,externalfor the Glasgow Association for Mental Health. We will never forget the support shown to us and as a huge thank you we would like to do something in return. We are aware that many of the people who have helped us may have challenges of their own to face in time to come. Sarah Haxton, ICU Nurse Newly-qualified teachers have raised concerns they are not be able to get a job because of the coronavirus crisis. In a letter to the Scottish government, 30 teachers say opportunities for permanent jobs in schools are currently limited because of the pandemic. This comes despite calls for extra staff to be hired to help with the new blended learning model of teaching. Nicola Sturgeon said the country will need to utilise ""all talents"" to get schools back to normal. Education Secretary John Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland he plans urgent talks with the group of newly-qualified teachers early next week. Read

The limit of five miles for journeys for outdoor pursuits remains in place for Phase 2 of easing of lockdown rules in Scotland. Mountaineering Scotland said it welcomed the ""positive progress"" made in suppressing the virus, but has asked for greater allowances for outdoor activities. The group has almost 15,000 members. Chief executive Stuart Younie said he appreciated the ""very difficult"" decisions the Scottish government was having to make. But he added: ""While a lucky few who live within five miles or
so of mountains have been able to restart their activities in Phase 1, that
option remains closed to the vast majority, especially those living in the
central belt."" Dundee United were runaway leaders in the Championship when the season was called Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers say they will ""robustly defend"" their positions after a petition was lodged that could prevent their promotions. Hearts and Partick Thistle went to the Court of Session on Wednesday to challenge their respective relegations - and that of Stranraer - after the SPFL ended the season early because of the coronavirus crisis. The three title winners have all instructed lawyers to act for them and say scrapping promotion would ""potentially have catastrophic financial implications"" not just for them, but for all other clubs. Read more SSF said there were signs business was beginning to bounce back Salmon producer Scottish Sea Farms (SSF) has said it will repay all the cash it has received from the UK government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Since March, the company has furloughed 36 full-time and part-time staff - about 8% of its 451-strong workforce. It has received about Â£106,000 in support until the end of June. SSF said its move was in response to signs that business was beginning to bounce back. It added that the furlough scheme had provided ""vital support"" at the start of the Covid-19 restrictions, and that it would not be making any further claims. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney will be holding regular conversations with his opposite number in Northern Ireland and the UK government about safe social distancing in schools. Northern Ireland say their aim is to have all pupils back andobserving a one metre distancein mid-August, while the plan in England is to have all year groups fully returned to classroom learning by September. Mr Swinney stresses that he has to work to the current advice, which is to maintain a two-metre distance, but says the advice could well change over time. And he concedes that a reduction in distancing would make a ""significant difference"" to planning. That planning currently concentrates on a combination of physical space, staffing, transport issues, food and use of toilets, while Mr Swinney says options like the use of church halls, leisure facilities and vacant offices will be considered. He repeats that he is determined to do everything he can to maximise the amount of formal schooling children receive and to make sure they are supported by high quality digital learning if that is not possible by the 11 August return date. A 101-year-old woman has raised Â£12,000 by completing a high speed zip wire challenge. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Schools returning in other countries have seen teachers and students wearing face coverings Education Secretary John Swinney does not accept that he was wrong to warn last Sunday that it was unlikely schools would be back to normal before the end of the next school year. ""I can't be absolutely certain about the path of the virus,"" he says. ""All I was saying is that we are likely to be facing a period of disruption. ""I want us to get back to full-time formal education at the earliest opportunity, when it is safe to do so. ""I am acting with my local authority partners, the teaching unions and parents on the basis of scientific advice that is available today. We can't do anything that jeopardises the safety of pupils and staff."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney says he wants urgent talks with the group of newly-qualified teachers who wrote to him raisingconcerns over their employment prospectsbecause of the coronavirus crisis. ""I'm very sympathetic to their position because they have worked hard,"" Mr Swinney tells BBC Radio Scotland, before adding ""I want to do everything I possibly can to help them."" He then goes on to congratulate North Lanarkshire Council, who say they will be taking on all 195 newly-qualified teachers in full-time roles. ""I want to make sure we have all of our talents available to help us through a really challenging situation,"" says Mr Swinney. ""I don't employ teachers directly but I can be part of the solution."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland SNP MSP and former health secretary Alex Neil has criticised the current plan to restart schools in August, claiming ""it's not blending education, it's bleeding education"". ""There are too many children being told they are only going back into schools for one-and-a-half days a week, including my own grandchildren, and that is just not unacceptable,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. Mr Neil reckons there are many parts of the country that could have all pupils back full-time with ""a bit of imagination and proper planning"". Planning is being done on the existing capacity of schools, so we need to find other ways of working, says the education committee member. He says authorities could use empty buildings nearby and portacabins for homework 'hubs' and recruit as many teaching staff as are needed to get as close to 100% education as possible. ""This is not beyond the whit of people to be able to do this,"" he says, insisting 50% - two-and-a-half days a week - should be the bare minimum any child must have from 11 August. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says that, despite the downgrading in the Covid alert system to level three, the pandemic ""isn't over"" and that people have to remain on their guard. A further 173 deaths among people who tested positive for Covid-19 have been reported (including six in Scotland). This brings the total to 42,461 since the outbreak began in the UK. In total, 5,030 people are currently reported to be in hospital with Covid-19. Followupdates from the briefing here. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been responding to the news that theUK's debt is now larger than the size of its economyfor the first time since 1963. It comes after government borrowing surged to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Johnson said: ""It matters hugely but we will manage our finances as sensibly and prudently as we can. ""What I will say is I think the British economy is remarkably resilient, we will come out of this well in the end but there will be some difficult times ahead."" He added: ""There has been a massive lack of economic activity for a very long time - of course that is going to be painful and expensive to make up. But we are a very creative and dynamic society; we will come back."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will lead the daily UK government briefing shortly.

Margaret Payne said on Friday she has seven of the 282 trips upstairs at her Sutherland home remaining. ""I hope to do two more today, and I average between two and four a day as a rule,"" she told BBC Radio Scotland. Inspired byArmy veteran Captain Tom Moore's 100 lapsof his garden, she began her own mission on Easter Sunday, 12 April, and has so farraised around Â£418,000,external, including gift aid. Mrs Payne, from Ardvar, first climbed Suilven, in the west of Sutherland, aged 15, in 1944, and said it is the only mountain she has climbed to the top of. Her daughter, Nicola, said her mother's effort was ""absolutely amazing"". ""Mum has got fitter, she is sleeping and eating well, and she has stuck at it,"" she added. ""The whole family is really proud."" Lord Carloway said he would not contemplate any measure that might compromise the basic principle of a fair trial Scotland's most senior judge has called for new legislation to help address the growing backlog of court cases. The Lord President, Lord Carloway, said measures proposed so far had simply been ""tinkering at the edges"" of a major problem. He warned that if things continued as they had been, there could be a backlog of 3,000 jury trials in the high and sheriff courts by next March. Some cases have now resumed but social distancing has reduced capacity to 30%. In a strongly-worded statement, Lord Carloway paid tribute to the court service for the speed at which it had developed digitally-based techniques of working, but he said new legislation was needed.

Hard-hit Brazil passes one million virus casesThe country becomes the second to hit the mark amid warnings the outbreak's peak is still weeks away.Latin America & Caribbean,"Health experts say the outbreak in Brazil is still weeks away from its peak Brazil has become the second country in the world to confirm more than one million cases of Covid-19, as the disease continues to spread. The health ministry also posted a record number of new cases in the past 24 hours - more than 54,000. In addition, there were more than 1,200 deaths for the fourth consecutive day, taking the total to nearly 49,000. A lack of testing suggests the true figures are higher and experts say the outbreak is weeks away from its peak. The new figure was revealed hours after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the pandemic was entering a ""new and dangerous"" phase, with its director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warning that cases were rising at the same time as people are growing weary of lockdowns and governments are seeking to restart their economies. What are the numbers out of Latin America? Latin America is among the areas currently seeing a spike in infections. There are major outbreaks in a number of countries, including Chile and Peru, while Mexico became the seventh country to officially surpass 20,000 virus-related deaths on Friday. But only the US has seen more infections than Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for his response to the crisis. He has repeatedly clashed with state governors and mayors who have adopted strict restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, shutting down major cities. Mr Bolsonaro argues that the economic impact of the measures will be much bigger than the virus itself, a position shared by many. But his overall approach to the crisis has led to the resignation of two doctors as health minister. Jair Bolsonaro has long-admired Donald Trump and his way of doing politics. The two men have much in common - not least the way they have handled the pandemic in their own countries. The figures in the US are staggering - but Brazil, too, is frightening. They are now exclusive members of a club nobody wants to join. Such a massive spike in the numbers - even if it was down to inaccurate reporting earlier this week - reveals how out of control the virus still is here. This, at a time when big cities are reopening and people are returning to work. For a long time, there was a stand-off between President Bolsonaro and state governors - he was angry that they were imposing tough quarantine measures that he said would damage the economy. But fast forward three months and that pressure from the top seems to have filtered down. With millions of people struggling and out of work, there is a desire to return to some kind of normality. But it feels like a dangerous plan - Brazil has not yet reached its peak. As there was no national lockdown, states and cities adopted their own measures. After months of restrictions, some are slowly being lifted, even though the infection level remains high. There is still concern that the health system will be unable to cope in some places, and that the disease is spreading faster in deprived neighbourhoods and remote areas, such as indigenous communities, where access to adequate care is difficult. This video can not be played Ordinary people in Brazil are taking on extraordinary roles to help their cities cope At the same time, there is a widespread wish to restart the economy as analysts forecast a contraction between 6% and 8% this year with millions of jobs lost. The government has introduced temporary payments to help people affected by the pandemic but large numbers are expected to be thrown into poverty. On Friday, Brazil's health ministry confirmed a total of 1,032,913 cases. It said that the large spike in the number of infections was due, in part, to several states having trouble with reporting data on Thursday. The US has the world's highest numbers of cases - more than 2.2 million - and nearly 119,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. LETTER FROM BRAZIL:How pandemic turned political AT THE HEART OF AMAZON:Disease meets deforestation REALITY CHECK:The crisis in Latin America in numbers RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The coronavirus has become a highly political issue in Brazil. Experts say the president's refusal to follow scientific advice - including those set by the WHO, such as social distancing - is partially responsible for the severity of the crisis. At the start, Mr Bolsonaro repeatedly said the risk posed by the virus had been exaggerated, and even joined some anti-lockdown rallies organised by his supporters, undermining the message of his own health ministry against crowds. Mr Bolsonaro has accused state governors of using the issue for political gain as many who have taken stricter measures oppose his government. JoÃ£o Doria, governor of Brazil's richest state SÃ£o Paulo and an ally-turned-rival, has previously described the president's views on tackling the disease as ""Bolsonarovirus"". Jair Bolsonaro originally said the risk of coronavirus was exaggerated The president has also strongly supported the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of patients, a drug the WHO says does not reduce death rates. After two health ministers quit, the government's response is now being led by an army general who has no experience in public health. Meanwhile, Mr Bolsonaro and his allies have turned against the media, claiming an excessive focus on the number of victims.The health ministry removed data about the virus from a government websiteearlier this month, but was forced to reverse the decision after a Supreme Court order and accusations of trying to manipulate the figures. Amid the pandemic,Mr Bolsonaro is facing a growing political crisis. He is under investigation for allegedly trying to interfere with the police for political motives, which he denies, while the Supreme Court is carrying out two separate inquiries into his allies.

Wales' travel restrictions set to end on 6 July,"People in Wales have been told to stay local - restrictions that have not been in place in England Wales' coronavirus travel restrictions could be lifted from 6 July so people can ""travel as far as they like for all purposes,"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Travel into and around Wales will be possible from that date, as long as coronavirus is still under control. But rules that require people tostay local, within five miles of their home as a guide, will stay for now. It comes as Mr Drakeford announced major changes to lockdown laws. From Monday, visits beyond people's local area on compassionate grounds, such as to family, care homes or young offender institutions, will be allowed. On the same day: Retailers can open, with social distancing measures in place Private prayer can take place in places of worship Restrictions on outdoor sports courts will be lifted for non-contact sports Non-professional elite athletes can resume training House viewings in vacant properties and home moves will also be allowed, restarting the housing market. This video can not be played Wales' tourist industry 'ready' for July reopening But rules stating you can only meet one other household outdoors remain in place. The Welsh Government has also signalled when the country's tourism sector can reopen - with trips to outdoor tourist attractions from 6 July - and bookings for self-contained accommodation can start to be made from 13 July. Schools in Wales are also due to reopen on29 June. Both the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the five-mile travel advice to be scrapped. It remains unclear when hairdressers, pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to reopen. But the Welsh government promised to look at ""personal care services"", including hairdressers and beauty salons, at the next review on 9 July. This video can not be played A relaxing of restrictions for shops, the housing market and worship will come into force on Monday Mr Drakeford told the daily Welsh government press conference that hairdressers should use the next three weeks to prepare for reopening by appointment only. Discussions will be held with the hospitality sector about the potential phased reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants. ""We are now making concerted steps to resume something approaching a new normal while living alongside coronavirus,"" Mr Drakeford told the press conference. ""This public health crisis is not yet over. Through all our efforts we have succeeded in bringing the fire of coronavirus under control but that fire is not out."" He said hospitality has not been given a date to reopen, while tourism has, because ""there's only so much headroom we have"". Non-essential shops can reopen from Monday In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he is ""keen"" to allow for household bubbles in Wales and has promised to look at it at the start of ""next week"". But in an interview with BBC Wales he said he would not wait an ""artificial"" period of time to make the announcement. ""We can announce it as soon as we think we have got everything in place,"" he said. What are household bubbles? Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, he asked people to do ""one more lap"" and observe the ""stay local"" message for two more weeks. ""It has really helped to bring the virus under control in Wales,"" he said. ""We need you to go on doing it, and if you do, then in two weeks we should be in a position where all this can be over."" What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Where do the parties stand on lockdown? Calls for five-mile travel advice to be reviewed The first minister said the stay local instruction ""has really helped to bring the virus under control"". Later, Mr Drakeford said the five-mile rule would remain in place for two more weeks because ""communities who have seen very few visitors will have to be prepared to see visitors again"". ""Simple things like public toilets will need to be reopened in our visitor economy, car parks will need to be reopened, our national parks need time to prepare,"" he said. Fines that have been used to enforce the ""stay local"" law will remain in place. Conservative politicians had criticised the five-mile guidance as unfair on people from rural areas. Caravans could be open to tourists from 13 July The Welsh government had been under pressure to allow for a reopening of the tourism sector for the summer. The lifting of travel restrictions means that the ""tourism economy will reopen in Wales"" from 6 July, Mr Drakeford said, and advised the industry to spend the next three weeks to prepare to re-open self-contained accommodation in July. The self-contained element was important because of the way coronavirus can spread, he argued. ""If you have a static caravan that has its own kitchen or bathroom, if you're renting a cottage or going to a hotel that has turned itself into self-contained accommodation, there will be a clear signal... that you should use the next three weeks to get everything you need in place, and you will be able to start taking bookings for after 13 July,"" the first minister added. Latest figures showed Wales attracts96m day-trippers every year,external- who spend about Â£4bn. That compares to 10m overnight visitors from Great Britain, worth Â£1.8bn. The five-mile guidance has been in place since late May The Welsh Conservatives claimed Mr Drakeford had ""woken up"" to the party's calls for ""a safe and sensible approach to lifting the lockdown"". But Paul Davies, Senedd Tory leader, questioned why the five-mile guidance could not be lifted ""now"". ""Why wait until Monday to allow non-essential retail businesses to reopen when they were given notice to prepare three weeks ago,"" Mr Davies asked. Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said the five mile advice ""really should have gone"". ""I know the first minister said the five-mile rule is just guidance but that's not how people are interpreting it,"" she said. The Brexit Party leader in the Senedd Mark Reckless welcomed the ""belated reduction"" but said all the restrictions should be lifted, trusting ""people's judgement"". Clothing retailer Primark said no shops will be reopening in Wales on Monday. A spokesman said the store ""will only re-open our stores inÂ WalesÂ once we are convinced that it is safe and right to do so"". This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defends the ""careful and cautious"" approach to easing restrictions But the South Wales Chamber of Commerce said the reopening of shops ""will boost the economic re-start"". Huw Pendleton, vice chairman of the UK Holiday Parks Association, said he as delighted ""we have some sort of date to aim for - which puts us on the same playing field as the other nations of the UK"". ""We've lost four bank holidays, so we're never going to recover that lost ground, but at least we look like we'll get some of the summer holiday. ""The only criticism I would give is that it would have been great to have an indication of likely opening dates a bit earlier than we have had - to at least do what the other nations have done - they've had clarity a lot earlier than we have.""

How many will really get tutoring?,"Parents will be waiting to find out if schools will have all pupils back in September The billion pound school catch-up plan for England aims to drag the return-to-school policy out of a quagmire of indecision. Parents have been increasingly baffled by how few pupils have returned to school this term, confused by what would be offered over the summer and downright horrified at the idea that schools might not even go back full-time in September. A parent emailed the BBC this week to say she wanted to burst into tears when she got a letter from her school to say pupils were only likely to go back half-time in the autumn. And head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said it was like operating in an ""information black hole"". So has this juggernaut of cash put the show back on the road? It's a lot of money - but it has to tackle massive disruption to almost nine million children in primary and secondary schools. Â£1bn tutoring plan for school catch-up Summer catch-up plan pledged by PM Plan for all primary pupils to return dropped Growing calls for cut in 2m social distancing And every family will want to know what will be done for their children, with many expected to be out of school for almost six months. First of all, there's no mention of extra summer activities. And nothing yet to explain how pupils might all go back in September. The big focus is on private tutoring - and for schools, there is no such thing as a free launch. Secondary schools are back, but pupils are only attending part time The Â£350m for tutoring will fund discounts - it's not added to school budgets. So schools will have to spend their own money to take advantage of the subsidy. It's still not entirely clear how much schools will have to pay - but at the most generous, the discount will be 75%. So, based on Â£50 per session, it would cost schools Â£12.50 per pupil per session. But there is financial support for this, in a Â£650m one-off payment to schools, otherwise the tutoring scheme would have actually cost schools money. Tutoring businesses and charities can apply to join the new tutoring service, with the criteria for selection not yet published. How much tuition will the funding deliver? The programme is scheduled to start in the ""autumn"", paid for by the Department for Education and with extra cash from the KPMG Foundation. Luke Sibieta of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) says the funding represents a 1% increase in school budgets and will be worth, on average, about Â£80 per pupil per year. To put the Â£650m in context, the annual pupil premium supplement to schools to help disadvantaged pupils is about Â£2.4bn per year. Head teachers and many education researchers are supportive of the idea of providing one-to-one tuition to pupils - to give more pupils the type of help already accessed by many better-off families. So how much tutoring will this buy? If the total Â£650m was spent on tutoring, and schools accessed all of the Â£350m available in subsidies, the IFS says it would mean about Â£2,400 available per class of 30 for the year. This could give one hour each week to about five pupils in a class of 30. On average, there are about five pupils eligible for free school meals in each class - so it would provide a real opportunity for them to catch-up, not just on missed school, but also to narrow the wealth related gap in educational attainment. Head teachers' leaders are supportive - and even with a nervous glance at the funding model, they're backing the idea of subsidised extra lessons. There are schools already using their pupil premium money to buy private tutors and the Education Endowment Foundation (which test drives ideas for improving achievement) says there is evidence that such extra tuition works. The Education Policy Institute is less impressed. David Laws, chair of the think tank and a former education minister, said the new funding was ""poorly targeted"". He disagrees with schools in affluent areas getting the same share as the poorest - and there's no requirement to spend the money on disadvantaged pupils. But here's the big question: Is it really a summer catch-up programme at all? It might be a positive example of ""never let a crisis go to waste"" - in that it's an opportunity to launch a national tutoring scheme that could make a big difference to those most in need of help. But it's not the type of summer educational recovery programme that parents might have been expecting. And there's nothing for early years, sixth forms or further education. It might give a few children extra lessons, but what about the rest of the class, including those worrying about exams next year, those who have had only patchy access to online lessons and, well, everybody else who has been out of school for so long? Parents might already feel they've had contradictory messages over schools, with confusion over who was going back and uncertainty about what to expect from lessons at home. And the catch-up plans might not stop them looking anxiously at the clock, ticking away to the autumn term. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Fear pubs 'will go bust' because of two-metre rule,"This video can not be played SA Brain chief executive Alistair Darby: ""The industry is running out of time rapidly"" Many Welsh pubs will go bust - putting thousands of jobs at risk - unless social distancing measures are relaxed, the boss of Wales' biggest brewery has said. Pubs and bars have been closed since the start of lockdown in March. Now the boss of Brains has said even if they are allowed to reopen this summer, many will not be able to due to the two-metre social distancing rule. The Welsh Government said lockdown would only be eased when it is safe to. Pubs, bars and restaurants across the UK were told to close on 20 March, as social distancing rules came into force to limit the spread of coronavirus. In Wales, there is currently no date for them to reopen, whilein England the UK government has suggested they will reopen ""no earlier than 4 July"", if Covid-19 safety guidelines could be met. The Welsh Government is due to make an announcement on lockdown measures on Friday. But Alistair Darby, the CEO of Brains, Wales largest domestic pub chain, said many brewers, caterers and landlords had depleted their reserves and time was now running out to save the industry. The Duke of Wellington pub is one of Brains' many pubs in Cardiff Brains, which employs 1,400 people in Wales, is initially planning to reopen only 40 of its 104 Welsh pubs, with it predicting demand to be at about a third of what it was before the pandemic. Social distancing rules, in place since the start of the pandemic, mean people must remain two metres (6ft) apart in a bid to curb the spread of the virus. In Wales, employers arerequired by law to make sure employees can maintain social distancingwhile at work, and can be fined if not. But Mr Darby said this rule needed to be eased to one metre if pubs were to survive, while another pub landlord in Swansea said enforcing the distance would be a ""logistical nightmare"". Mr Darby said: ""The industry is running out of time rapidly, you can't choke off an industry's turnover and expect it to be able to survive, even with substantial government support. ""All business needs certainty and we aren't getting that at the moment, and the longer the uncertainty continues the more people are going to lose their jobs."" Before the pandemic,Brains announced the closure of 40 of its pubs, with staff told their jobs could be at riskand the company blaming economic uncertainty - partly caused by Brexit, for the closures. JD Wetherspoon said all 50 of its pubs in Wales would open on the first day they were allowed to In 2019, the number of UK pubs and bars increased for the first time in a decadeafter years of concerns about closures, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). But a survey in April by the British Beer and Pub Association [BBPA] found that 40% of pubs in the UK now said they would not survive until September, due to lockdown. According to the BBPA, the beer and pub industry employs 42,000 people in Wales and is worth Â£950m to the economy. 'Around 2.8m' pints of old beer in Wales' locked-up pubs and clubs When will pubs, bars, cafes and restaurants reopen? Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the BBPA, said businesses were ""burning through cash"" during lockdown and many would not be able to reopen. Social distancing will mean pubs not being able to sit as many customers as usual David Morgan has owned the Cross Inn pub in Maesteg for 28 years and started brewing a decade ago. After having to furlough four staff, he is now running the brewery with his wife to try and keep the business afloat. Mr Morgan said if social distancing rules were not relaxed he would only be able to have 12 people in the Cross Inn at one time, which he said would not make it viable to reopen. ""You see beaches are chock-a-block in England, and these protests, there's no social distancing,"" Mr Morgan said. ""It's time for people to take responsibility for their own safety. Valley towns, in general, were starting to get the high street back on its feet and now it's going to be devastated."" Green King, which manages the Claude, said it had plans for opening its 30 pubs across Wales Sara John, owns BOSS Brewery in Swansea, which sells 80% of its beer to pubs, and also runs a pub in the city. The lockdown has meant furloughing most staff, but Ms John said they had been doing everything they could to make sales through a new online shop. ""Retailers have seen a surge in beer sales so that's ticked over nicely and we've started to work with beer subscription companies,"" said Ms John. She said the beer only had a three-week shelf life and the Welsh Government needed to give a firm date for the reopening of pubs so they can plan production. Ms John added that opening the pub would not be feasible, and enforcing social distancing would be a ""logistical nightmare"" when people had been drinking. ""We estimate 25 people, though there is talk of some pubs using beer garden and street access. But if we see strict queuing rules like in supermarkets we will serve less people,"" she said. ""And if the public is not feeling safe they won't show up. So better to stay closed then opening to people who won't come.""

Guidance for NI schools' reopening published,"Education Minister Peter Weir has published new guidance setting out how schools should plan to reopen. The New School Day guidance,externalhas been designed by the Department of Education, school leaders and partners. Among the plans is a possible ""no bell"" strategy with flexible class times to cut pupil flow in busier schools. On Thursday, Mr Weir announced that the2m social distancing rule would be reduced to 1mbetween pupils, when schools reopen in September. The minister said this was to allow ""full classes"" to attend school as lockdown restrictions are eased. Guidance issued on Friday suggests: There will be an element of part-time learning due to limitations - such as small classrooms - in some schools Primary school pupils should be in school for at least two days a week Post-primary schools might be able to return to full-time education if they implement a so-called bubble model Post-primary schools that can't do that should have pupils in school at least half the time Secondary schools are urged to consider a new model whereby the teacher would move between classes, not the children. Children will be prevented from bringing items such as bags into the school setting and taking items out of school at the end of day. Pupils will be asked to wash their hands on arrival at schools and at regular intervals throughout the day. Consideration to a ""no bell"" strategy to allow flexibility on class start/finish times and avoid ""the intensity of (pupil) flow"" Further specific guidance for special and early years schools is being developed Mr Weir said his ambition remained for all pupils to resume classroom-based learning ""as soon as it is safely possible to do so"". He told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback programme the direct threat to young people from coronavirus was extremely low, while their continued absence from school was damaging. He said he appreciated the stresses felt by teachers, parents and pupils during a time of disruption and uncertainty. A diagram showing a classroom with 26 pupils ""Although our overall approach to managing the Covid-19 virus must rightly remain cautious, today is a positive step forward in providing a road map to plan for the reopening of schools in two months' time,"" he said. The National Association of Head Teachers (NAHT) said expectations needed to be managed about the reopening of schools. Its vice president, Graham Gault, said comments by First Minister Arlene Foster on Thursday - that the executive wanted ""to get everybody back to school in September"" - were unrealistic and undeliverable. Graham Gault said he did not have the teaching staff to take pupils to neighbouring non-school buildings Mr Gault the principal of Maghaberry Primary School, said this would need ""very drastic changes"", as even with the 1m distancing rule his classrooms would only be able to cater for 15 pupils at one time rather than the usual 30. Although great progress had been made in talks between trade unions and the education department on how to manage school numbers safely, Mr Gault rejected the first minister's suggestion that schools should use extra spaces, such as assembly and dining halls, for teaching - saying these comments ""stopped (him) from sleeping last night"". Meanwhile, Nicola Sturgeon said the Scottish government was looking carefully at Northern Ireland's decision to reduce physical distancing in schools, saying she had been advised 2m distancing was required to inhibit the spread of coronavirus. The Scottish government's current plan isfor all schools to reopen on 11 August, but with elements of remote learning. By Robbie Meredith, BBC News NI Education Correspondent Many pupils in only part-time, and staggered start and finishes to the school day. One way corridors, small group 'bubbles, maybe even no schoolbags or school bells. When children return in September their experience of school is set to be very different. But the Department of Education wants to get as many pupils as possible back in class for as much time as possible, an aspiration shared by school leaders and their staff. The guidance will help, but many difficult decisions will still be left at the door of principals. Some schools may be able to get all pupils in full-time, but many won't and that will lead to headaches for parents. And specific guidance on the complex tasks of opening special schools - and how to provide school meals and school transport - has yet to be published. Julie Thomas, principal of Clandeboye Primary School in Bangor, welcomed the reduction in the social distancing guidelines but said it was important not to over-promise parents what schools might be able to deliver in the new academic year. Methodist College Belfast Principal Scott Naismith echoed that sentiment, saying Mr Weir had been overly optimistic. While favourable pupil-staff ratios and accommodation meant Methody's preparatory school could get all the pupils back full-time from August, complexities in the senior school meant only half its pupils could be safely accommodated at one time.

Tories suspend activist over Muslim MP comments,"A Conservative activist has been suspended after tweeting a British Muslim MP should ""go back to Pakistan"". The party said they were investigating the comments made by Theodora Dickinson on Twitter about Labour's Naz Shah. Responding to a GIF of the MP talking about her experience of poverty while growing up in Yorkshire, she wrote if Ms Shah ""hates this country so much why doesn't she go back to Pakistan"". The Muslim Council of Britain said such ""blatant racism"" was unacceptable. The group -which has previously accused the Conservatives of turning a blind eye to Islamophobia- said it showed there was still a ""serious problem"" within the party. Muslim group urges Tory Islamophobia investigation Tories publish terms for discrimination review Former party chair Baroness Warsi has also suggested the Conservatives are in denial about the extent of Islamophobia within its ranks. The Conservatives have launched an inquiry into all forms of prejudice within the party. But critics have said it is not independent and would not specifically address anti-Muslim racism. Ms Dickinson posted the tweet in response to a clip from a speech the MP made in a Commons debate on free school meals. Ms Shah accused ministers of having ""no real understanding, care or emotion"" about the extent of child poverty in the UK. In the clip, the Labour politician - who was born in Bradford and now represents the city - spoke of her experience, being ""palmed off"" to social services when she was a child, separated from her family and taken on trips to Scarborough, adding ""that is what poverty is"". Ms Dickinson's comments,which were first reported by the Huffington Post,external, have since been deleted. On her Twitter handle, Ms Dickinson describes herself as a political communications and social media consultant. She is understood to have worked for the Vote Leave campaign during the 2016 Brexit referendum. Labour MP Naz Shah was born in Bradford and now represents the city The Muslim Council of Britain claimed the party activist had previously shared an Islamophobic conspiracy theory in response to the 2019 terror attack on a mosque in Christchurch, New Zealand, but no action had been taken against her. In a statement, the group said: ""Will this latest blatant racism elicit action? The party must reflect and consider why it chooses to ignore widespread concerns about its institutional Islamophobia. ""If a truly independent inquiry is not enacted with its recommendations implemented, there will be a drip-feed of these stories for a long time to come."" A Conservative Party spokesman said: ""Theodora Dickinson has been suspended pending the outcome of an investigation.""

Â£1bn catch-up tutoring for pupils,"A Â£1bn fund to help England's children catch up on what they have missed while schools have been closed has been announced by the prime minister. The most disadvantaged pupils will have access to tutors through a Â£350m programme over the year from September. Primary and secondary schools will be given Â£650m to spend on one-to-one or group tuition for any pupils they think need it. Head teachers welcomed the funds, but said more details were needed. Labour said ministers should convene a taskforce - involving trade unions and scientific and health experts - to help all pupils return to school safely as soon as possible. School catch up: No such thing as a free launch How will pupils catch up? Paediatricians seek clear plans on school return A third of pupils 'not engaging with set work' Shadow education secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the plans ""lack detail and appear to be a tiny fraction of the support"" needed and called for a ""detailed national education plan to get children's education and health back on track"". However, Boris Johnson said the fund would help head teachers provide what pupils need. He thanked teachers, childcare workers and support staff for their efforts during the pandemic, and said he was ""determined to do everything"" he could to get all children back in school from September. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âWe have got to start thinking of a world in which we are less apprehensive."" ""We will bring forward plans on how this will happen as soon as possible,"" he said. And during a visit to a school on Friday, Mr Johnson suggested there may be change in the rules on social distancing, with more guidance due ""very, very shortly"", adding: ""Watch this space."" It comes asthe Covid-19 alert level has been downgraded, bringing with it a possible relaxation of the rules that have kept many pupils out of school. The Scottish Government said it is also looking at social distancing rules in schools, after Northern Ireland decided to reduce its two-metre rule to one metre. Nicola Sturgeon has said she wanted schools to open safely as soon as possible. The announcement comes a week after Mr Johnson said the government was planning""a huge amount of catch up for pupils over the summer"". But the announcement did not include any specific push towards catch-up activities running through the summer break except a expectation that usual summer clubs would be running. Instead there is a strong push for head teachers to target catch-up help via tutoring from September. However, schools minister Nick Gibb told the BBC there was lee-way for heads to set up summer schemes if they so wished. But he said: ""If you want children to catch up, it can't just be done over the month of August - it has to be longer term over the academic year"". Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests the Â£650m pot represents about Â£80 extra for each student. That is a rise of about 1% but would leave total spending still 3% below 2010 levels in real terms. Early years providers and colleges for 16 to 19-year-olds are not included in the plans. Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said it would be ""entirely unjustifiable"" to exclude sixth form students from the package. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said the government's decision not to include pre-schoolers ""beggars belief"". But Mr Gibb said that older age groups had ""fared better with remote education than other age groups"" which is why the government was focused on helping younger pupils. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Schools were shut across the UK on 20 March. Apart from the children of key workers, most children have not been to school since then and will not enter a classroom until after the summer holidays. Children in nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 have begun returning to primary schools in England, and some Year 10 and 12 pupils returned to secondary schools and colleges this week. Schools in Wales are reopening at the end of June, with only a third of pupils in class at any time, while in Scotland, schools are preparing to reopen on 11 August. Social distancing in schools has beenhalved to 1m (just over 3ft) in Northern Ireland, where ministers are aiming for a full reopening of schools on 24 August. However, head teachers havewarned that parts of the Northern Ireland plan are ""unrealistic and undeliverable"". Plans for the subsidised National Tutoring Programme have been developed with a group of social mobility organisations and academics led by the charity Education Endowment Fund (EEF). The EEF has said that until now, access to tutoring has been the preserve of wealthy families - but this would no longer be the case as schools would be able to seek subsidised tutoring. However, individual schools would be expected to pay 25% of the tutoring costs in the first year, or from their share of the Â£650m in extra funding being made available to them as part of this package. The tutors themselves will be provided by organisations approved by the National Tutoring Programme. Many of them will be students or graduates trained by tutoring groups. Their modelling suggests between 550,000 and 650,000 courses, featuring three pupils to one tutor, would run for an hour a week over 15 weeks. ""Tutoring is the catch-up approach supported by the strongest evidence,"" said the EEF's chief executive, Prof Becky Francis. She said the programme hoped to reach more than a million pupils, calling it a tremendous opportunity to create long-lasting change. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton welcomed the investment, saying it would help support the work schools are already undertaking on pupil catch-up. But he noted that the investment was expected to be spent on tutoring, rather than being left to head teachers to decide. ""As ever, we suspect the devil will be in the detail and we await further information,"" he said. He was also concerned that there was no investment for sixth forms. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, criticised the decision not to include colleges for 16 to 19-year-olds in the plans. He said teenage college students deserved as much catch-up support as every other age group and it was ""indefensible"" to overlook them. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

But he noted that the investment was expected to be spent on tutoring, rather than being left to head teachers to decide. ""As ever, we suspect the devil will be in the detail and we await further information,"" he said. He was also concerned that there was no investment for sixth forms. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, criticised the decision not to include colleges for 16 to 19-year-olds in the plans. He said teenage college students deserved as much catch-up support as every other age group and it was ""indefensible"" to overlook them. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said he was pleased ministers had listened to calls for a longer-term response, rather than short-term fixes. ""This is a considerable sum of money,"" said Mr Whiteman, but he also warned there were many details still to be worked through.

Schools will not reopen after food factory outbreak,"2 Sisters produces a third of all poultry products consumed in the UK Schools in Anglesey will not reopen as planned, after an outbreak of coronavirus at a meat processing factory. All staff at the 2 Sisters chicken factory, in Llangefni are self-isolating after 61 workers tested positive. Classrooms across Wales are due to reopen on Monday 29 June, for pupils to check in with their teachers. But thecouncil said,externalthe safety of children and teachers was its priority. It comes after Public Health Wales statistics showed a growing number of positive cases of Covid-19 on Anglesey in recent days. Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said health and safety was the top priority Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said the increasing number of cases and the outbreak at the factory had caused a ""great deal of uncertainty and concern on the island"".Â ""It is, of course, possible that we could see an increase in community transmission of the virus,"" she said. ""I am not, at present, willing to see classrooms reopened to Anglesey children.""Â ""Given the current uncertainty, I believe that this is the right course of action, and the best decision in respect of the safety of our children, all school staff and wider communities.""Â She earlier told BBC Radio Wales the island may not be ready to reopen to visitors on 6 July - the date the Welsh Government hasindicated the ""stay local"" restrictions will be lifted. 2 Sisters is one of the largest food producers in the UK and produces about a third of all the poultry products eaten each day. It has suspended production and closed the factory, which supplies local authorities, hospitals, restaurants and small businesses, following the outbreak. Public Health Wales said staff and contractors working at the processing plant, which has 560 workers, had been asked to self-isolate for 14 days, and all staff would be contacted by the company for testing. Mark Drakeford has said the outbreak at the factory may be to do with the ""challenges of maintaining social distance"". Meanwhile in Wrexham, 38 staff havetested positive at Rowan Foods, which supplies supermarkets. The company, which employs 1,500 people, said 38 staff were ""absent due to testing positive for Covid-19"", but said there was ""no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site"". Public Health Wales said an outbreak ""has not been declared at the site"", and investigations were ongoing as to the ""possible cause of the cluster, and no firm conclusions can be reached at this early stage"". An army testing unit is being set up in Wrexham to help test workers for Covid-19. Staff at Rowan Foods in Wrexham, which makes ready meals, have also tested positive First Minister Mark Drakeford said the virus at the Anglesey factory was down to its internal organisation, but it had been brought into the Wrexham factory. 2 Sisters said it had no agency workers at the Llangefni plant, and ""the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues is ultimately the thing that matters most at our business. It added: ""We will not tolerate any unnecessary risks - however small - for our existing loyal workforce at the facility."" The untold story of America's biggest outbreak Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry Concerns over Covid-19 cases in NI meat plants Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""What we're being told is that there's a different explanation in Wrexham and a different explanation on the island of Anglesey. ""On Anglesey, we think it may be to do with the internal organisation of the factory and the challenges of maintaining social distance. ""In Wrexham, so far the science is saying that wasn't the cause, it's not internal to the factory. It's just that the disease was brought in by people who would become infected outside the factory so there's not just one explanation for both."" He said ministers did not believe the Wrexham factory had found social distancing a challenge. In Wales, employers are required by law to do everything they can to make sure workers can socially distance while in the workplace, or face a fine of up to Â£120. The Food Standards Agency said it was ""very unlikely you can catch coronavirus from food"" as the virus is a respiratory illness. Virginia Crosbie won the seat of Anglesey in December's general election Anglesey MP Virginia Crosbie said she was ""hugely concerned"" by what had happened at 2 Sisters. ""This situation highlights the risks faced by people working in this sector and we should all be hugely grateful for the contribution that the 2 Sisters employees have made, and the courage that they have demonstrated, in supporting the fight against Covid-19,"" she said. She said she was liaising with the management at the plant to ensure that ""none of the workers are left without pay during the duration of the plant's closure"". Anywhere cold, damp and indoors is an ideal environment for the coronavirus to thrive. It survives best on cool surfaces, especially if there's no dry breeze to get rid of the moisture or any ultraviolet light from the sun to kill it off. Add to that the challenges of social distancing on a busy production line, together with loud machinery forcing staff to raise their voices. Researchers know that situations where people sing - or have to shout - increases the chances of them projecting the virus to others nearby. According to Prof Calum Semple, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Liverpool, and an adviser to the government, meat processing plants can be ""a perfect environment for the virus to persist on surfaces and in the air.""

UK debt now larger than size of whole economy,"The furlough scheme means the government is paying the wages of more than 6.3 million people The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. The Â£55.2bn figure was nine times higher than in May last year and the highest since records began in 1993. The borrowing splurge sent total government debt surging to Â£1.95trn, exceeding the size of the economy for the first time in more than 50 years. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures confirmed the severe impact the virus was having on public finances. ""The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work. ""We've set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery,"" he added. Income from tax, National Insurance and VAT all dived in May amid the coronavirus lockdown as spending on support measures soared. This is the first time debt has been larger than the size of the economy since 1963, but it is not as high as the post-war peak of 258% in 1946-47. The deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - for the first two months of the financial year (April and May) is now estimated to have been Â£103.7bn, Â£87bn more than in the same period last year, another record. But the ONS estimates borrowing for the 2020-21 financial year will dwarf that at Â£298bn. That would be the largest deficit since World War Two. It cautioned that due to the coronavirus, its official estimates were subject to greater than usual uncertainty. The Office for National Statistics,externalhad previously said that April's borrowing figure was the highest since records began in 1993, but it subsequently revised the figure down to Â£48.5bn from Â£62bn. The revision was due to higher than expected income from taxes and national insurance, as well as the spending on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme being lower than originally estimated. Where do governments go when they need money? Alex Tuckett, senior economist at consultants PwC, pointed to the 46% fall in the amount of VAT collected in the month, although it said the biggest issue for the government's finances was the Â£29bn it spent on the various support schemes for the economy. ""In the near term, there are signs the economy is recovering as the country re-opens, and this should boost tax receipts. ""However, these figures remind us that Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a difficult backdrop to any summer fiscal event."" Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said the emergency support measures had placed a ""colossal burden"" on the public finances. In a release packed with striking figures, he singled out the fact the government had needed to raise more cash in the first two months of this fiscal year than in total in any prior 10 fiscal years. Busting the overdraft, with a borrowing figure nine times as high as a year ago is not an easy thing for any government to swallow. In his first full year as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak is on track for the biggest public sector deficit since World War Two, But it is, he reckons, a price worth paying to prevent a bigger cost to the economy, in terms of lost jobs and output. Billions have been pumped into supporting millions of jobs, and many businesses, while, on the other side, tax receipts have plunged. Those lifelines will be wound down in the coming months, and the government can borrow cheaply on financial markets to fund them. But what happens next? As lockdown is eased, the Treasury is watching closely, knowing the recovery may need extra support - perhaps tax cuts or more spending. That will present the government with more bills - but failing to provide more help risks an even higher cost. The chancellor is to present some sort of statement before Parliament ceases for the summer in July - that won't be a full Budget but may contain some measures to boost the recovery.

No new bikes until 2021?,"Saskia Breet was told she could pre-order a bike after other models sold out - but that it might not arrive until January Toilet rolls. Hand sanitiser. Pasta. Flour. The early pandemic-induced shortages have passed, but now there is a new one: bicycles. As people venture further afield for exercise, or return to the workplace while avoiding public transport, bikes - new and used - are at a premium, write Alice Evans and Ella Wills. Teacher Saskia Breet had to abandon any hopes of a jaunt to a foreign land this coronavirus-affected summer - but dreamed of getting on a bike and exploring the world around her. There are plenty of sights to savour within comfortable cycling distance of her Bristol home - but first the 26-year-old needed to buy a bike. She soon found that task was harder than any homework assignment she sets for her secondary school pupils. Because she plans to follow government advice and use pedal power to get to and from work when her school fully reopens, Saskia signed up to the cycle-to-work scheme, which allows employees to buy tax-free bikes and equipment. ""I finally just bit the bullet and thought, well I may as well - there's quite a lot of money to be saved and I've got time [to cycle a lot],"" she says. Saskia, who has been working from home during lockdown, is ""really looking forward"" to cycling to school in September. It will be an easy 10-minute pedal down the city's famous Park Street in the autumn mornings - and she's even keen about the prospect of the ""slightly more painful"" uphill return trip. So the languages teacher began looking for bikes to buy in mid-May but the hunt soon became ""frustrating"". ""When I rang various different bike shops around Bristol - some big brands like Trek, and some smaller independent shops - they all just said either 'it's completely sold out and we're not getting any more stock this year', or 'we don't know when we'll have a new shipment for that particular model',"" she says. Recent high demand has meant Trek has sold out of the 2020 models of most of its bikes earlier than expected. It has made 2021 models available to pre-order but customer service staff told the BBC: ""If you were to place a pre-order now the stock would likely arrive in January."" Smaller retailers that have already pre-ordered stock might be selling those models earlier, they added. Giving up on Trek, Saskia found a ""really good value"" bike on the website of the French sports retailer Decathlon. She added it to her online basket and spent a bit of time browsing for other items, such as inner tubes and a cycling jersey. But when she went to the checkout, an error message popped up - the limited capacity of the number of bikes available that day had been reached, so she could not complete her order. ""It told me to log back on at 11pm [when] it reset the meter. So I did that two nights in a row, with no luck - it just sold out immediately,"" she says. Saskia (left), a teacher, is hoping to venture out of Bristol on her new bike during the school holidays She took her search elsewhere and after finding no suitable bikes in stock on Wiggle, Rutland Cycling, or Halfords, Saskia eventually managed to order one from Evans Cycles. Four weeks after ordering the bike, Saskia was finally told it was ready to pick up. ""Whether that's normal, I don't know - but my hunch is it's just this particular time is making it really tricky."" Shops cash in with Â£1 loo roll and Â£15 sanitiser Watch: The unexpected items deemed 'essential' Boom time for bikes as virus changes lifestyles Saskia's hunch is correct; bike shops across the country have struggled to keep up with what many have described as ""unprecedented"" demand. The Bicycle Association's executive director, Steve Garidis, says initial figures from across the UK industry show sales of bikes below Â£500 have been ""especially strong"" since lockdown - as well as for products such as home turbo trainers. Peter Skelton, from bike shop chain Cycles UK says the entire industry was ""caught off-guard"" by the increase in demand for bikes and that most UK distributors have run out of any bikes under Â£1,000. But he adds that Cycles UK has been ""pretty lucky"" as stock from Europe is slowly arriving. He expects supply to be at ""near-normal"" levels in August. When told about Saskia's experience using its site, Decathlon said it was ""working hard to find solutions"" after ""extremely high demand"" for many of its bikes. Peter Lazarus, the company's cycling chief, says he was ""expecting doom and gloom"" for his firm when the pandemic forced it to close all of its stores across the world, and rely on online sales only. But after 23 March, when the UK went into lockdown, ""there was a dramatic shift like someone switched on a light"" - and sales surged. Peter Lazarus, cycling market leader at Decathlon, says he saw an ""exceptional spike"" in bike sales when the UK went into lockdown The firm ""suffered in the short term"" because some factories closed temporarily, affecting Decathlon's ability to cope with an ""exceptional spike"" in demand. Online bike sales in May more than doubled compared with last year. ""You can't forecast growth of 200%, it's impossible,"" Peter says. He said Decathlon's production is now ""ramping up"" so that, by July, low to mid-range bikes will be ""back to availability"". Peter says people's urgent desire to revamp ""dead bikes"" that had been gathering dust before lockdown had contributed to a five-fold increase in spare part sales in May, compared with May 2019 - the ""biggest growth we have ever had"". The boom in demand for spare parts was a spanner in the works for Claudia Watts, a data ecologist using her time on furlough to do some DIY on her old bike. The 57-year-old, who lives on the Isle of Dogs in east London, hasn't used her bike much since she broke her nose cycling in London more than 10 years ago. Claudia Watts said her ""serious cyclist"" friends were ""horrified"" when she decided to add a basket to her mountain bike to help carry shopping But when lockdown rules demanded people only exercise close to home, Claudia decided it would be easier to maintain social distancing on a bike than on a walk. ""I live on a really busy footpath with lots of people going past, it's quite narrow. And I thought a bike would get me a bit further afield. You can go further and see more."" She retrieved the old bike from the garage and was ""a bit dubious"" about its condition, having been collecting dust for a while. It looked ""fine"" but was ""completely covered in muck"". After a thorough clean, a degreasing and a regreasing, Claudia set about repairing two punctured tyres. This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said social distancing will be easier on public transport if more people walk or cycle She could not find the replacement tyres she needed in stock on any website in the UK, so ended up ordering them - along with some inner tubes - from the Netherlands. Claudia was ""really surprised"" that the Dutch delivery only took a few days to arrive at the end of April, amid the peak of the epidemic when many supply chains and delivery services were choking on a backlog of orders. While people like Saskia and Claudia waited patiently for deliveries, others took more drastic measures to get their hands on a bike. The insurer, Admiral, reporteda 46% increase in claims for bike thefts,externalfor the first seven weeks of lockdown, compared with the same period last year. Cycling numbers jump during coronavirus lockdown Bike-theft doctor offers rides to NHS colleagues One victim of bike theft is Lucy Stickland, a physiotherapist helping coronavirus patients to recover after they return home from hospital. The 26-year-old said she felt ""violated"" when she realised her bike had been stolen as she bought food from a Sainsbury's in Brixton, south London, on her way back from work. Charities giving bikes to NHS workers told Lucy Stickland there were none left, after her bike was stolen She had begun cycling into work every day after her car broke down. She has tried to avoid contact with people throughout lockdown, due to fears for the ""really vulnerable"" patients she works with - and therefore decided not to get the car fixed. Luckily for Lucy, she has been able to borrow a bike from her friend's brother. She wants to be able to give it back but has not managed to find a replacement. SOCIAL DISTANCING:The rules as they are now PUBLIC TRANSPORT:Is it safe to travel? TRAVEL:Can I get a holiday refund? SPORTWhat now for the Olympics, F1 and Six Nations? FOOD:How can I shop or get deliveries safely? Companies such asBrompton Bikes,external,Buzzbike,externaland theGreen Commute Initiative,externalhad all launched schemes to give or lend bikes to NHS workers during the pandemic - but none were available when Lucy inquired. Lucy has also been bargain-hunting on Gumtree and Facebook Marketplace - ""but the ones on sale in London go so quickly"". She said friends have told her you must ""be ready"" for bike ads on second-hand sites, and that the bikes will sell within half an hour of ads being posted. ""They're all just getting snapped up so quickly,"" she added. For now, Lucy will simply have to keep trying. But asthe government has pumped money into cycling and walking infrastructureto encourage people to avoid public transport, it's likely that bikes will retain their gold-dust status for some time yet.

Wales' travel restrictions set to end on 6 JulyWales politicsComments,"People in Wales have been told to stay local - restrictions that have not been in place in England Wales' coronavirus travel restrictions could be lifted from 6 July so people can ""travel as far as they like for all purposes,"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Travel into and around Wales will be possible from that date, as long as coronavirus is still under control. But rules that require people tostay local, within five miles of their home as a guide, will stay for now. It comes as Mr Drakeford announced major changes to lockdown laws. From Monday, visits beyond people's local area on compassionate grounds, such as to family, care homes or young offender institutions, will be allowed. On the same day: Retailers can open, with social distancing measures in place Private prayer can take place in places of worship Restrictions on outdoor sports courts will be lifted for non-contact sports Non-professional elite athletes can resume training House viewings in vacant properties and home moves will also be allowed, restarting the housing market. This video can not be played Wales' tourist industry 'ready' for July reopening But rules stating you can only meet one other household outdoors remain in place. The Welsh Government has also signalled when the country's tourism sector can reopen - with trips to outdoor tourist attractions from 6 July - and bookings for self-contained accommodation can start to be made from 13 July. Schools in Wales are also due to reopen on29 June. Both the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the five-mile travel advice to be scrapped. It remains unclear when hairdressers, pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to reopen. But the Welsh government promised to look at ""personal care services"", including hairdressers and beauty salons, at the next review on 9 July. This video can not be played A relaxing of restrictions for shops, the housing market and worship will come into force on Monday Mr Drakeford told the daily Welsh government press conference that hairdressers should use the next three weeks to prepare for reopening by appointment only. Discussions will be held with the hospitality sector about the potential phased reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants. ""We are now making concerted steps to resume something approaching a new normal while living alongside coronavirus,"" Mr Drakeford told the press conference. ""This public health crisis is not yet over. Through all our efforts we have succeeded in bringing the fire of coronavirus under control but that fire is not out."" He said hospitality has not been given a date to reopen, while tourism has, because ""there's only so much headroom we have"". Non-essential shops can reopen from Monday In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he is ""keen"" to allow for household bubbles in Wales and has promised to look at it at the start of ""next week"". But in an interview with BBC Wales he said he would not wait an ""artificial"" period of time to make the announcement. ""We can announce it as soon as we think we have got everything in place,"" he said. What are household bubbles? Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, he asked people to do ""one more lap"" and observe the ""stay local"" message for two more weeks. ""It has really helped to bring the virus under control in Wales,"" he said. ""We need you to go on doing it, and if you do, then in two weeks we should be in a position where all this can be over."" What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Where do the parties stand on lockdown? Calls for five-mile travel advice to be reviewed The first minister said the stay local instruction ""has really helped to bring the virus under control"". Later, Mr Drakeford said the five-mile rule would remain in place for two more weeks because ""communities who have seen very few visitors will have to be prepared to see visitors again"". ""Simple things like public toilets will need to be reopened in our visitor economy, car parks will need to be reopened, our national parks need time to prepare,"" he said. Fines that have been used to enforce the ""stay local"" law will remain in place. Conservative politicians had criticised the five-mile guidance as unfair on people from rural areas. Caravans could be open to tourists from 13 July The Welsh government had been under pressure to allow for a reopening of the tourism sector for the summer. The lifting of travel restrictions means that the ""tourism economy will reopen in Wales"" from 6 July, Mr Drakeford said, and advised the industry to spend the next three weeks to prepare to re-open self-contained accommodation in July. The self-contained element was important because of the way coronavirus can spread, he argued. ""If you have a static caravan that has its own kitchen or bathroom, if you're renting a cottage or going to a hotel that has turned itself into self-contained accommodation, there will be a clear signal... that you should use the next three weeks to get everything you need in place, and you will be able to start taking bookings for after 13 July,"" the first minister added. Latest figures showed Wales attracts96m day-trippers every year,external- who spend about Â£4bn. That compares to 10m overnight visitors from Great Britain, worth Â£1.8bn. The five-mile guidance has been in place since late May The Welsh Conservatives claimed Mr Drakeford had ""woken up"" to the party's calls for ""a safe and sensible approach to lifting the lockdown"". But Paul Davies, Senedd Tory leader, questioned why the five-mile guidance could not be lifted ""now"". ""Why wait until Monday to allow non-essential retail businesses to reopen when they were given notice to prepare three weeks ago,"" Mr Davies asked. Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said the five mile advice ""really should have gone"". ""I know the first minister said the five-mile rule is just guidance but that's not how people are interpreting it,"" she said. The Brexit Party leader in the Senedd Mark Reckless welcomed the ""belated reduction"" but said all the restrictions should be lifted, trusting ""people's judgement"". Clothing retailer Primark said no shops will be reopening in Wales on Monday. A spokesman said the store ""will only re-open our stores inÂ WalesÂ once we are convinced that it is safe and right to do so"". This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defends the ""careful and cautious"" approach to easing restrictions But the South Wales Chamber of Commerce said the reopening of shops ""will boost the economic re-start"". Huw Pendleton, vice chairman of the UK Holiday Parks Association, said he as delighted ""we have some sort of date to aim for - which puts us on the same playing field as the other nations of the UK"". ""We've lost four bank holidays, so we're never going to recover that lost ground, but at least we look like we'll get some of the summer holiday. ""The only criticism I would give is that it would have been great to have an indication of likely opening dates a bit earlier than we have had - to at least do what the other nations have done - they've had clarity a lot earlier than we have.""

'Different reasons' for food factory covid cases,"2 Sisters produces a third of all poultry products consumed in the UK Schools in Anglesey will not reopen as planned, after an outbreak of coronavirus at a meat processing factory. All staff at the 2 Sisters chicken factory, in Llangefni are self-isolating after 61 workers tested positive. Classrooms across Wales are due to reopen on Monday 29 June, for pupils to check in with their teachers. But thecouncil said,externalthe safety of children and teachers was its priority. It comes after Public Health Wales statistics showed a growing number of positive cases of Covid-19 on Anglesey in recent days. Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said health and safety was the top priority Anglesey council leader Llinos Medi said the increasing number of cases and the outbreak at the factory had caused a ""great deal of uncertainty and concern on the island"".Â ""It is, of course, possible that we could see an increase in community transmission of the virus,"" she said. ""I am not, at present, willing to see classrooms reopened to Anglesey children.""Â ""Given the current uncertainty, I believe that this is the right course of action, and the best decision in respect of the safety of our children, all school staff and wider communities.""Â She earlier told BBC Radio Wales the island may not be ready to reopen to visitors on 6 July - the date the Welsh Government hasindicated the ""stay local"" restrictions will be lifted. 2 Sisters is one of the largest food producers in the UK and produces about a third of all the poultry products eaten each day. It has suspended production and closed the factory, which supplies local authorities, hospitals, restaurants and small businesses, following the outbreak. Public Health Wales said staff and contractors working at the processing plant, which has 560 workers, had been asked to self-isolate for 14 days, and all staff would be contacted by the company for testing. Mark Drakeford has said the outbreak at the factory may be to do with the ""challenges of maintaining social distance"". Meanwhile in Wrexham, 38 staff havetested positive at Rowan Foods, which supplies supermarkets. The company, which employs 1,500 people, said 38 staff were ""absent due to testing positive for Covid-19"", but said there was ""no clear evidence to suggest that there is a spread of the virus within the site"". Public Health Wales said an outbreak ""has not been declared at the site"", and investigations were ongoing as to the ""possible cause of the cluster, and no firm conclusions can be reached at this early stage"". An army testing unit is being set up in Wrexham to help test workers for Covid-19. Staff at Rowan Foods in Wrexham, which makes ready meals, have also tested positive First Minister Mark Drakeford said the virus at the Anglesey factory was down to its internal organisation, but it had been brought into the Wrexham factory. 2 Sisters said it had no agency workers at the Llangefni plant, and ""the health, safety and well-being of our colleagues is ultimately the thing that matters most at our business. It added: ""We will not tolerate any unnecessary risks - however small - for our existing loyal workforce at the facility."" The untold story of America's biggest outbreak Five ways coronavirus is disrupting the food industry Concerns over Covid-19 cases in NI meat plants Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""What we're being told is that there's a different explanation in Wrexham and a different explanation on the island of Anglesey. ""On Anglesey, we think it may be to do with the internal organisation of the factory and the challenges of maintaining social distance. ""In Wrexham, so far the science is saying that wasn't the cause, it's not internal to the factory. It's just that the disease was brought in by people who would become infected outside the factory so there's not just one explanation for both."" He said ministers did not believe the Wrexham factory had found social distancing a challenge. In Wales, employers are required by law to do everything they can to make sure workers can socially distance while in the workplace, or face a fine of up to Â£120. The Food Standards Agency said it was ""very unlikely you can catch coronavirus from food"" as the virus is a respiratory illness. Virginia Crosbie won the seat of Anglesey in December's general election Anglesey MP Virginia Crosbie said she was ""hugely concerned"" by what had happened at 2 Sisters. ""This situation highlights the risks faced by people working in this sector and we should all be hugely grateful for the contribution that the 2 Sisters employees have made, and the courage that they have demonstrated, in supporting the fight against Covid-19,"" she said. She said she was liaising with the management at the plant to ensure that ""none of the workers are left without pay during the duration of the plant's closure"". Anywhere cold, damp and indoors is an ideal environment for the coronavirus to thrive. It survives best on cool surfaces, especially if there's no dry breeze to get rid of the moisture or any ultraviolet light from the sun to kill it off. Add to that the challenges of social distancing on a busy production line, together with loud machinery forcing staff to raise their voices. Researchers know that situations where people sing - or have to shout - increases the chances of them projecting the virus to others nearby. According to Prof Calum Semple, an infectious disease specialist at the University of Liverpool, and an adviser to the government, meat processing plants can be ""a perfect environment for the virus to persist on surfaces and in the air.""

Olga RobinsonDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring Facebook has taken down an advert claiming the new
coronavirus was engineered by humans, saying it spread âmisinformation about
Covid-19â. The ad, bought by a minor UK political party, suggested that
a study on a potential coronavirus vaccine found âunequivocal evidenceâ that
the virus was âman-madeâ. But the scientific paper the ad links to makes no such
claims. Before it was removed, the ad had received several thousand
views â mostly from Facebook users in their 50s and older. Conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus have been doing the
rounds on social media since the start of the outbreak. As
we have previously reported, they have been dismissed by scientists who say genome sequencing shows
that the virus came from animals and was not made by humans. All pupils in all year groups in England will go back to school in September,Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announced.

BBC Radio Devon A zoo that closed, partly because of the loss of income during the coronavirus lockdown, has found new homes for all its animals. Living Coastsannounced on Mondaythat it would not be reopening, and that as a last resort it would have to consider euthanising the animals if homes couldn't be found. Owners Wild Planet Trust said the animals would not be moved immediately as it's a complex process. They will be rehomed at ""specialist facilities"" which are part of the ""world-wide network of zoos and aquariums"". Living Coasts staff will continue to
care for the animals until they can be moved. Comedian Jason Manford is used to raising a laugh but has also been busy raising the spirits of NHS workers during the coronavirus outbreak. He sent a surprise video message of support and thanks to staff at Nottingham University Hospitals QMC and the East Midlands Ambulance Service. The message was arranged by emergency department assistant Hayley Pedwell for ambulance technician husband Neil. East Midlands Ambulance Service said the shout-out from the comedian, TV and radio presenter has ""really boosted morale"" during ""challenging"" times.

The UK's coronavirus alert level has been downgraded from four to three. It means the government believes the virus is now thought to be in general circulation, but not high or rising quickly. Here's afull explanation on how the alert levels work. BBC Radio Devon Plymouth Arts Cinema has been given Â£15,000 in emergency funding to help it survive being shut during lockdown. It is part of a Â£1.3m resilience fund given to the British film industry through National Lottery funding. The director of the Plymouth Arts Centre said she was ""delighted"" to receive the ""lifeline"", but said the future was ""going to be uncertain"" for the independent sector. ""There is certainly hard work ahead but this funding means we have a better chance of weathering the months ahead and helping us safely get back on the big screen as soon as we possibly can,â said Anna Navas. Six-year-old Dhillon has raised Â£21,000 to buy an incubator for premature babies at Kingston hospital. A high street that was closed to traffic to give more space for pedestrians to socially distance has re-opened - because shoppers didn't return in droves after all. After just four days in operation,Milton Keynes Council,externalscrapped the scheme for Newport Pagnell High Street. More shops reopened on Monday, and the road closure was put in place in the belief that too many customers would come back for them to stay two metres apart on the pavements,but things were quieter than expected. Liberal Democrat Jane Carr, who represents the Newport Pagnell South Ward, said on Facebook that she had been feeding back residents' and
traders' comments to the council. ""They believe that with the current level of
trade, it is not necessary for the High Street to remain closed at this time to
ensure social distancing,"" Ms Carr said. Leicester City Council's director of public health said there was still a risk of infection Members of Leicester's BAME community say they are alarmed by a ""surge"" of coronavirus cases in ""the most deprived area of the city"". About 25% of the city's 2,494 confirmed Covid-19 cases were reported in the past two weeks, many in east Leicester. Analysis has found South Asian people are themost likely to die from Covid-19 after being admitted to hospital.

Australia targeted by 'state-based' cyber attacks,"Scott Morrison said the ""malicious"" activity had been increasing over months Australia's government and institutions are being targeted by ongoing sophisticated state-based cyber hacks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. Mr Morrison said the cyber attacks were widespread, covering ""all levels of government"" as well as essential services and businesses. He declined to identify a specific state actor and said no major personal data breaches had been made. The attacks have happened over many months and are increasing, he said. The prime minister said his announcement on Friday was intended to raise public awareness and to urge businesses to improve their defences. But he stressed that ""malicious"" activity was also being seen globally, making it not unique to Australia. Mr Morrison did not name specific cases but said it had spanned ""government, industry, political organisations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure"". He did not give further details. Previously, defence manufacturers, government contractors and accounting firms have been among those to report data breaches. Australia's parliamentary network was the subject of an attack in 2019 Last year,the Australian National University said it had been hackedby a sophisticated operation which had accessed staff and student details. Australia's main political parties and parliament were hitby a ""malicious intrusion"" earlier in 2019, also attributed to a ""sophisticated state actor"". Speaking on Friday, Mr Morrison said officials had identified it as a state hack ""because of the scale and nature of the targeting and the trade craft used"". ""There are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity,"" he said, without giving specifics. When asked to identify a country, Mr Morrison said he would not make ""any public attribution"". Amazon 'thwarts largest ever DDoS cyber-attack' Australia defence data in 'extensive' hack Cyber intelligence experts have long linked various hacks in Australia to China. They say China is one of the few states, along with Russia, Iran, and North Korea, which have the capacity for such attacks - and are not allied with Australia. However, they also note that cyber espionage between countries and even allies is common. This video can not be played Joshua Kennedy-White: Four countries with the capability and intent ""There's always simmering tensions between Russia and China so really it comes down to those being the key actors they [Australia] would be referring to,"" expert Joshua Kennedy-White told the BBC. The Reuters news agency has previously reported that Australian intelligence agencies suspected China of carrying out the parliament hack in 2019. Canberra declined to comment. Shaimaa Khalil, BBC News Australia correspondent The headline itself was clear. Many political, educational and health organisations have been targeted by a state-based cyber actor with ""significant capabilities"". However, much about Mr Morrison's press conference was understated. For example, it was not clear why this announcement was made at this particular moment - given these attacks have been going on for a while. Mr Morrison made a similar announcement early last year. Despite blaming a ""sophisticated state actor"", he refused to name names - even after being directly asked about the country almost everyone was thinking about: China. Relations between the countries have grown tense in recent years but have significantly worsened after Australia echoed the US in calling for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, first detected in China late last year. China has since imposed tariffs on Australian barley, stopped beef imports and warned Chinese citizens and students about the ""risks"" of travelling to Australia for tourism or education because of racist incidents. Australia has also ratcheted up its rhetoric. Last week, Mr Morrison said he would not give in to ""coercion"" from Beijing. It's hard to be 100% sure that China could be behind this, but what we know is that Australia's leadership has chosen a moment when its relationship with its powerful trading partner is at an all-time low to announce publicly that it is under cyber-attack from a powerful state. How reliant is Australia on China? He said businesses - particularly health infrastructure and service providers - should improve their technical defences. Cyber defence agencies had thwarted ""many"" hacking attempts but protection required ""constant persistence and application"", he added. ""We raised this issue today not to raise concerns in the public's mind, but to raise awareness in the public's mind,"" Mr Morrison said. ""We know what is going on. We are on it, but it is a day-to-day task."" 2020: Incidents reported across major Australian firms, including steel maker BlueScope, logistics firm Toll Group, and state government agency Services New South Wales June 2019: The Australian National University revealed a ""highly professional"" group of up to 15 hackers gained access to student and staff details, as well as academic research, for about six months February 2019:Australia's parliamentary computer network and political parties were subject of an attempted attack by a ""state actor"" 2017:Information about fighter planes and navy vessels was stolen from anAustralian government contactor. 2015:Foreign spies attacked theAustralian Bureau of Meteorology.

Wales's five-mile travel rule could be lifted in two weeks,"People in Wales have been told to stay local - restrictions that have not been in place in England Wales' coronavirus travel restrictions could be lifted from 6 July so people can ""travel as far as they like for all purposes,"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Travel into and around Wales will be possible from that date, as long as coronavirus is still under control. But rules that require people tostay local, within five miles of their home as a guide, will stay for now. It comes as Mr Drakeford announced major changes to lockdown laws. From Monday, visits beyond people's local area on compassionate grounds, such as to family, care homes or young offender institutions, will be allowed. On the same day: Retailers can open, with social distancing measures in place Private prayer can take place in places of worship Restrictions on outdoor sports courts will be lifted for non-contact sports Non-professional elite athletes can resume training House viewings in vacant properties and home moves will also be allowed, restarting the housing market. This video can not be played Wales' tourist industry 'ready' for July reopening But rules stating you can only meet one other household outdoors remain in place. The Welsh Government has also signalled when the country's tourism sector can reopen - with trips to outdoor tourist attractions from 6 July - and bookings for self-contained accommodation can start to be made from 13 July. Schools in Wales are also due to reopen on29 June. Both the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the five-mile travel advice to be scrapped. It remains unclear when hairdressers, pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to reopen. But the Welsh government promised to look at ""personal care services"", including hairdressers and beauty salons, at the next review on 9 July. This video can not be played A relaxing of restrictions for shops, the housing market and worship will come into force on Monday Mr Drakeford told the daily Welsh government press conference that hairdressers should use the next three weeks to prepare for reopening by appointment only. Discussions will be held with the hospitality sector about the potential phased reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants. ""We are now making concerted steps to resume something approaching a new normal while living alongside coronavirus,"" Mr Drakeford told the press conference. ""This public health crisis is not yet over. Through all our efforts we have succeeded in bringing the fire of coronavirus under control but that fire is not out."" He said hospitality has not been given a date to reopen, while tourism has, because ""there's only so much headroom we have"". Non-essential shops can reopen from Monday In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he is ""keen"" to allow for household bubbles in Wales and has promised to look at it at the start of ""next week"". But in an interview with BBC Wales he said he would not wait an ""artificial"" period of time to make the announcement. ""We can announce it as soon as we think we have got everything in place,"" he said. What are household bubbles? Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, he asked people to do ""one more lap"" and observe the ""stay local"" message for two more weeks. ""It has really helped to bring the virus under control in Wales,"" he said. ""We need you to go on doing it, and if you do, then in two weeks we should be in a position where all this can be over."" What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Where do the parties stand on lockdown? Calls for five-mile travel advice to be reviewed The first minister said the stay local instruction ""has really helped to bring the virus under control"". Later, Mr Drakeford said the five-mile rule would remain in place for two more weeks because ""communities who have seen very few visitors will have to be prepared to see visitors again"". ""Simple things like public toilets will need to be reopened in our visitor economy, car parks will need to be reopened, our national parks need time to prepare,"" he said. Fines that have been used to enforce the ""stay local"" law will remain in place. Conservative politicians had criticised the five-mile guidance as unfair on people from rural areas. Caravans could be open to tourists from 13 July The Welsh government had been under pressure to allow for a reopening of the tourism sector for the summer. The lifting of travel restrictions means that the ""tourism economy will reopen in Wales"" from 6 July, Mr Drakeford said, and advised the industry to spend the next three weeks to prepare to re-open self-contained accommodation in July. The self-contained element was important because of the way coronavirus can spread, he argued. ""If you have a static caravan that has its own kitchen or bathroom, if you're renting a cottage or going to a hotel that has turned itself into self-contained accommodation, there will be a clear signal... that you should use the next three weeks to get everything you need in place, and you will be able to start taking bookings for after 13 July,"" the first minister added. Latest figures showed Wales attracts96m day-trippers every year,external- who spend about Â£4bn. That compares to 10m overnight visitors from Great Britain, worth Â£1.8bn. The five-mile guidance has been in place since late May The Welsh Conservatives claimed Mr Drakeford had ""woken up"" to the party's calls for ""a safe and sensible approach to lifting the lockdown"". But Paul Davies, Senedd Tory leader, questioned why the five-mile guidance could not be lifted ""now"". ""Why wait until Monday to allow non-essential retail businesses to reopen when they were given notice to prepare three weeks ago,"" Mr Davies asked. Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said the five mile advice ""really should have gone"". ""I know the first minister said the five-mile rule is just guidance but that's not how people are interpreting it,"" she said. The Brexit Party leader in the Senedd Mark Reckless welcomed the ""belated reduction"" but said all the restrictions should be lifted, trusting ""people's judgement"". Clothing retailer Primark said no shops will be reopening in Wales on Monday. A spokesman said the store ""will only re-open our stores inÂ WalesÂ once we are convinced that it is safe and right to do so"". This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defends the ""careful and cautious"" approach to easing restrictions But the South Wales Chamber of Commerce said the reopening of shops ""will boost the economic re-start"". Huw Pendleton, vice chairman of the UK Holiday Parks Association, said he as delighted ""we have some sort of date to aim for - which puts us on the same playing field as the other nations of the UK"". ""We've lost four bank holidays, so we're never going to recover that lost ground, but at least we look like we'll get some of the summer holiday. ""The only criticism I would give is that it would have been great to have an indication of likely opening dates a bit earlier than we have had - to at least do what the other nations have done - they've had clarity a lot earlier than we have.""

"UK debt now larger than size of whole economyMay's record borrowing as income drops and spending balloons sees country's debt outstrips its economy.BusinessCommentsSouth Asian people most likely to die in hospitalPatients are younger than white counterparts and far more likely to have diabetes, analysis shows.Health","The furlough scheme means the government is paying the wages of more than 6.3 million people The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. The Â£55.2bn figure was nine times higher than in May last year and the highest since records began in 1993. The borrowing splurge sent total government debt surging to Â£1.95trn, exceeding the size of the economy for the first time in more than 50 years. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures confirmed the severe impact the virus was having on public finances. ""The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work. ""We've set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery,"" he added. Income from tax, National Insurance and VAT all dived in May amid the coronavirus lockdown as spending on support measures soared. This is the first time debt has been larger than the size of the economy since 1963, but it is not as high as the post-war peak of 258% in 1946-47. The deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - for the first two months of the financial year (April and May) is now estimated to have been Â£103.7bn, Â£87bn more than in the same period last year, another record. But the ONS estimates borrowing for the 2020-21 financial year will dwarf that at Â£298bn. That would be the largest deficit since World War Two. It cautioned that due to the coronavirus, its official estimates were subject to greater than usual uncertainty. The Office for National Statistics,externalhad previously said that April's borrowing figure was the highest since records began in 1993, but it subsequently revised the figure down to Â£48.5bn from Â£62bn. The revision was due to higher than expected income from taxes and national insurance, as well as the spending on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme being lower than originally estimated. Where do governments go when they need money? Alex Tuckett, senior economist at consultants PwC, pointed to the 46% fall in the amount of VAT collected in the month, although it said the biggest issue for the government's finances was the Â£29bn it spent on the various support schemes for the economy. ""In the near term, there are signs the economy is recovering as the country re-opens, and this should boost tax receipts. ""However, these figures remind us that Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a difficult backdrop to any summer fiscal event."" Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said the emergency support measures had placed a ""colossal burden"" on the public finances. In a release packed with striking figures, he singled out the fact the government had needed to raise more cash in the first two months of this fiscal year than in total in any prior 10 fiscal years. Busting the overdraft, with a borrowing figure nine times as high as a year ago is not an easy thing for any government to swallow. In his first full year as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak is on track for the biggest public sector deficit since World War Two, But it is, he reckons, a price worth paying to prevent a bigger cost to the economy, in terms of lost jobs and output. Billions have been pumped into supporting millions of jobs, and many businesses, while, on the other side, tax receipts have plunged. Those lifelines will be wound down in the coming months, and the government can borrow cheaply on financial markets to fund them. But what happens next? As lockdown is eased, the Treasury is watching closely, knowing the recovery may need extra support - perhaps tax cuts or more spending. That will present the government with more bills - but failing to provide more help risks an even higher cost. The chancellor is to present some sort of statement before Parliament ceases for the summer in July - that won't be a full Budget but may contain some measures to boost the recovery.

Should I go to university this year?,"As students begin the new term, they'll find many Covid restrictions have been lifted. There will be more face-to-face teaching, but things won't be entirely normal. Thegovernment wants all students to get vaccinated,external, but won't exclude those who aren't. Universities are also calling on undergraduates to get jabbed and many have on-site vaccination centres. What do under-30s need to know about the vaccine?

Freshers' Week events include parties, club nights, sports sessions and society fairs. Many universities will hold in-person events for the first time since 2019.

The Russell Group of leading universities saysstaff are preparing for most seminars, small group classes and lab work to be taught in person.,externalHowever it sayssome online learning will continue- partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes.

What do parents think?,"Victoria Rogers says children need some degree of normality Relief that children will be kept away from school for another few months, or despair that they are losing out on education and time with their friends? What do parents make of the government's ditching of a plan for all primary school years in England to go back to school for four weeks before the end of term? Jonathan Wills a parent from Barnton Primary in Northwich in Cheshire says families need to get back to some sort of routine. ""I think it's going to be extremely difficult for kids and some families, because it's a long time to try to recreate the structure that schools give you. ""And I think without that structure, a lot of schools and kids will struggle, particularly with the stresses of financial problems and then all the types of psychological problems. ""I think the kids that were struggling before will be struggling even more now."" Mother-of-two Victoria Rogers agrees: ""I do think children should start coming back to school, as we need to get back to some form of normality."" Jonathan Wills says many families are struggling But elsewhere, mother-of-one Molly told the BBC she is relieved that not all primary years will be returning this term, as she would not have been prepared to send her daughter back to school. ""Until it is safe for parliament to sit next to each other and until it's 'safe' to cuddle your own blood mother, then how is it deemed safe to mix your children with numerous other households? Plan dropped for all primary pupils back in school Schools to remain shut over virus infection fear ""But our children can be placed into school with numerous other households' children. Even at small groups of 15, how is that safe? When we are only allowed to meet up in groups of six? ""It's either dangerous to us all or it's not as dangerous as what they are making out. ""As much as my daughter needs to go back to school and the lockdown has taken its toll with her, I will not be sending her back. ""If it's this big killer, keeping us away from blood relatives, then it's not safe."" For some families, there is a difference of opinion even within the family. One mother-of-three - who was expecting two of hers to return to school before the summer - told BBC Radio Four's Today programme that her children had opposing views on the matter. ""I know that one of them is going to be really disappointed at the prospect of not seeing her friends. ""That's been something she's really counting down to, even though we knew it was uncertain. ""But the boy in Year 5 will be absolutely delighted!"" As for her, she remains ambivalent on it all: ""I feel sort of resigned to it really. I just feel sad for them that they're not going to see their friends for such a long time now."" Nigel Rowlands says his daughter is happier now she is back to school Another mother told Today said she was ""unsurprised"" but ""incredibly disappointed"" by the news. ""I feel really sad for my son. I've got one son in year two, and another one in reception. ""My child in reception's gone back, albeit only four days a week, every other week. ""And my older son, who is just about to turn seven, is desperate to go back, can't understand, thinks it's so unfair - which it is. ""He and the school are going to have to put up with my rather inadequate home schooling, while I'm stuck at home, also with a one-and-a-half year old, trying to juggle a business and everything else."" But another mother, with two children aged eight and six, told Today she thought a return before the summer was too early. ""I'm actually relieved if schools don't go back until September because I think it's too soon. ""They don't socially distance at that age. I don't think there's enough protective equipment available in school."" However, for Nigel Rowlands, the past few weeks have been very difficult and he is glad to have his daughter back in school. ""It's been difficult - we've been through a lot. There's no structure, learning at home is entirely different to learning at school,"" he told the BBC. ""I've been working from home. So we've just spent a huge amount of time together, confined within four walls with not a lot of other places to go to. ""We try to get out and do a daily walk, but that's not the same as spending all day in school with other people. ""Having her back in school now has given some of that structure back and that's reflected in her being connected with other children and you can see that in that her demeanour is completely different since she's been back in school.""

"Â£1bn catch-up tutoring fund for England's pupilsHead teachers welcome the move but want more details as some children face six months out of school.Family & EducationSouth Asian people most likely to die in hospitalPatients are younger than white counterparts and far more likely to have diabetes, analysis shows.Health","A Â£1bn fund to help England's children catch up on what they have missed while schools have been closed has been announced by the prime minister. The most disadvantaged pupils will have access to tutors through a Â£350m programme over the year from September. Primary and secondary schools will be given Â£650m to spend on one-to-one or group tuition for any pupils they think need it. Head teachers welcomed the funds, but said more details were needed. Labour said ministers should convene a taskforce - involving trade unions and scientific and health experts - to help all pupils return to school safely as soon as possible. School catch up: No such thing as a free launch How will pupils catch up? Paediatricians seek clear plans on school return A third of pupils 'not engaging with set work' Shadow education secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said the plans ""lack detail and appear to be a tiny fraction of the support"" needed and called for a ""detailed national education plan to get children's education and health back on track"". However, Boris Johnson said the fund would help head teachers provide what pupils need. He thanked teachers, childcare workers and support staff for their efforts during the pandemic, and said he was ""determined to do everything"" he could to get all children back in school from September. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: âWe have got to start thinking of a world in which we are less apprehensive."" ""We will bring forward plans on how this will happen as soon as possible,"" he said. And during a visit to a school on Friday, Mr Johnson suggested there may be change in the rules on social distancing, with more guidance due ""very, very shortly"", adding: ""Watch this space."" It comes asthe Covid-19 alert level has been downgraded, bringing with it a possible relaxation of the rules that have kept many pupils out of school. The Scottish Government said it is also looking at social distancing rules in schools, after Northern Ireland decided to reduce its two-metre rule to one metre. Nicola Sturgeon has said she wanted schools to open safely as soon as possible. The announcement comes a week after Mr Johnson said the government was planning""a huge amount of catch up for pupils over the summer"". But the announcement did not include any specific push towards catch-up activities running through the summer break except a expectation that usual summer clubs would be running. Instead there is a strong push for head teachers to target catch-up help via tutoring from September. However, schools minister Nick Gibb told the BBC there was lee-way for heads to set up summer schemes if they so wished. But he said: ""If you want children to catch up, it can't just be done over the month of August - it has to be longer term over the academic year"". Research by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) suggests the Â£650m pot represents about Â£80 extra for each student. That is a rise of about 1% but would leave total spending still 3% below 2010 levels in real terms. Early years providers and colleges for 16 to 19-year-olds are not included in the plans. Bill Watkin, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said it would be ""entirely unjustifiable"" to exclude sixth form students from the package. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, said the government's decision not to include pre-schoolers ""beggars belief"". But Mr Gibb said that older age groups had ""fared better with remote education than other age groups"" which is why the government was focused on helping younger pupils. This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Schools were shut across the UK on 20 March. Apart from the children of key workers, most children have not been to school since then and will not enter a classroom until after the summer holidays. Children in nursery, Reception, Year 1 and Year 6 have begun returning to primary schools in England, and some Year 10 and 12 pupils returned to secondary schools and colleges this week. Schools in Wales are reopening at the end of June, with only a third of pupils in class at any time, while in Scotland, schools are preparing to reopen on 11 August. Social distancing in schools has beenhalved to 1m (just over 3ft) in Northern Ireland, where ministers are aiming for a full reopening of schools on 24 August. However, head teachers havewarned that parts of the Northern Ireland plan are ""unrealistic and undeliverable"". Plans for the subsidised National Tutoring Programme have been developed with a group of social mobility organisations and academics led by the charity Education Endowment Fund (EEF). The EEF has said that until now, access to tutoring has been the preserve of wealthy families - but this would no longer be the case as schools would be able to seek subsidised tutoring. However, individual schools would be expected to pay 25% of the tutoring costs in the first year, or from their share of the Â£650m in extra funding being made available to them as part of this package. The tutors themselves will be provided by organisations approved by the National Tutoring Programme. Many of them will be students or graduates trained by tutoring groups. Their modelling suggests between 550,000 and 650,000 courses, featuring three pupils to one tutor, would run for an hour a week over 15 weeks. ""Tutoring is the catch-up approach supported by the strongest evidence,"" said the EEF's chief executive, Prof Becky Francis. She said the programme hoped to reach more than a million pupils, calling it a tremendous opportunity to create long-lasting change. Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton welcomed the investment, saying it would help support the work schools are already undertaking on pupil catch-up. But he noted that the investment was expected to be spent on tutoring, rather than being left to head teachers to decide. ""As ever, we suspect the devil will be in the detail and we await further information,"" he said. He was also concerned that there was no investment for sixth forms. David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, criticised the decision not to include colleges for 16 to 19-year-olds in the plans. He said teenage college students deserved as much catch-up support as every other age group and it was ""indefensible"" to overlook them. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? IMPACT:What the virus does to the body RECOVERY:How long does it take? LOCKDOWN:How can we lift restrictions? ENDGAME:How do we get out of this mess? National Association of Head Teachers general secretary Paul Whiteman said he was pleased ministers had listened to calls for a longer-term response, rather than short-term fixes. ""This is a considerable sum of money,"" said Mr Whiteman, but he also warned there were many details still to be worked through.

LiveLiveCoronavirus in England: Latest updates10 minutes ago,"The UK's coronavirus alert level is downgraded from four to three All pupils in England will go back to school in September, the Education Secretary has said Leicester sees hundreds of confirmed coronavirus cases in two weeks, while an outbreak in Yorkshire is reported. A baby, aged just 13 days, is thought to be the youngest to die with the disease in the UK. A Â£1bn fund to help England's children catch up on what they have missed while schools have been closed is announced Researchers want to establish if ""post-Covid syndrome"" should itself be recognised as an illness.

Thanks for keeping us company. Have a good evening. A series ofdrive-in concerts have been announced to take place across the UK this summer. Gary Numan is among the acts announced by Live Nation, presumably so he can belt out his hit 'Cars' to a crowd full of them. What will the experience be like for those driving up to watch acts like Beverly Knight, Sigala, and Jack Savoretti? Drive-in concerts have already been tried out in Denmark, Germany and the US.

About6,000 revellersdescended on an industrial site in Carrington and at Daisy Nook Country Park on Saturday, against coronavirus restricions. A 20-year-old man died of a suspected drug overdose at the Daisy Nook rave in Failsworth while a woman was raped and three people stabbed in Carrington. One parent said his son was ""dying in a field"" as officers tried to find him. As a warning to others, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has released footage of the struggles officers faced trying to reach the teenager because there were no safety precautions in place. The parent, who has asked not to be named, told BBC Radio Manchester if it hadn't been for the actions of emergency services, his son ""wouldn't be with us today"" and warned that next time ""it might be too late"". Olga RobinsonDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring Facebook has taken down an advert claiming the new
coronavirus was engineered by humans, saying it spread âmisinformation about
Covid-19â. The ad, bought by a minor UK political party, suggested that
a study on a potential coronavirus vaccine found âunequivocal evidenceâ that
the virus was âman-madeâ. But the scientific paper the ad links to makes no such
claims. Before it was removed, the ad had received several thousand
views â mostly from Facebook users in their 50s and older. Conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus have been doing the
rounds on social media since the start of the outbreak. As
we have previously reported, they have been dismissed by scientists who say genome sequencing shows
that the virus came from animals and was not made by humans. All pupils in all year groups in England will go back to school in September,Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announced. At the daily coronavirus briefing, he said the government was ""signed up... to bring every child back, in every year group, in every school"". Guidance on safety measures will be published in the next fortnight. It comes after the prime minister announced a Â£1bn fundto help England's pupils catch up with learning.

Three-year-old Cilla was one of around 500 virtual fans at Colchester United's League Two play-off first-leg win over Exeter City. Supporters pay for the cut-outs which has helped the club generate revenue while having to play behind closed doors during the coronavirus pandemic.

BBC Radio Devon A zoo that closed, partly because of the loss of income during the coronavirus lockdown, has found new homes for all its animals. Living Coastsannounced on Mondaythat it would not be reopening, and that as a last resort it would have to consider euthanising the animals if homes couldn't be found. Owners Wild Planet Trust said the animals would not be moved immediately as it's a complex process. They will be rehomed at ""specialist facilities"" which are part of the ""world-wide network of zoos and aquariums"". Living Coasts staff will continue to
care for the animals until they can be moved. Comedian Jason Manford is used to raising a laugh but has also been busy raising the spirits of NHS workers during the coronavirus outbreak.

The UK's coronavirus alert level has been downgraded from four to three. It means the government believes the virus is now thought to be in general circulation, but not high or rising quickly. Here's afull explanation on how the alert levels work. BBC Radio Devon Plymouth Arts Cinema has been given Â£15,000 in emergency funding to help it survive being shut during lockdown. It is part of a Â£1.3m resilience fund given to the British film industry through National Lottery funding. The director of the Plymouth Arts Centre said she was ""delighted"" to receive the ""lifeline"", but said the future was ""going to be uncertain"" for the independent sector. ""There is certainly hard work ahead but this funding means we have a better chance of weathering the months ahead and helping us safely get back on the big screen as soon as we possibly can,â said Anna Navas. Six-year-old Dhillon has raised Â£21,000 to buy an incubator for premature babies at Kingston hospital. A high street that was closed to traffic to give more space for pedestrians to socially distance has re-opened - because shoppers didn't return in droves after all. After just four days in operation,Milton Keynes Council,externalscrapped the scheme for Newport Pagnell High Street. More shops reopened on Monday, and the road closure was put in place in the belief that too many customers would come back for them to stay two metres apart on the pavements,but things were quieter than expected. Liberal Democrat Jane Carr, who represents the Newport Pagnell South Ward, said on Facebook that she had been feeding back residents' and
traders' comments to the council. ""They believe that with the current level of
trade, it is not necessary for the High Street to remain closed at this time to
ensure social distancing,"" Ms Carr said.

"Wales's five-mile travel rule could be lifted in two weeksFirst Minister Mark Drakeford hopes people will be able to ""travel as far as they like"".Wales politics","People in Wales have been told to stay local - restrictions that have not been in place in England Wales' coronavirus travel restrictions could be lifted from 6 July so people can ""travel as far as they like for all purposes,"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Travel into and around Wales will be possible from that date, as long as coronavirus is still under control. But rules that require people tostay local, within five miles of their home as a guide, will stay for now. It comes as Mr Drakeford announced major changes to lockdown laws. From Monday, visits beyond people's local area on compassionate grounds, such as to family, care homes or young offender institutions, will be allowed. On the same day: Retailers can open, with social distancing measures in place Private prayer can take place in places of worship Restrictions on outdoor sports courts will be lifted for non-contact sports Non-professional elite athletes can resume training House viewings in vacant properties and home moves will also be allowed, restarting the housing market. This video can not be played Wales' tourist industry 'ready' for July reopening But rules stating you can only meet one other household outdoors remain in place. The Welsh Government has also signalled when the country's tourism sector can reopen - with trips to outdoor tourist attractions from 6 July - and bookings for self-contained accommodation can start to be made from 13 July. Schools in Wales are also due to reopen on29 June. Both the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the five-mile travel advice to be scrapped. It remains unclear when hairdressers, pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to reopen. But the Welsh government promised to look at ""personal care services"", including hairdressers and beauty salons, at the next review on 9 July. This video can not be played A relaxing of restrictions for shops, the housing market and worship will come into force on Monday Mr Drakeford told the daily Welsh government press conference that hairdressers should use the next three weeks to prepare for reopening by appointment only. Discussions will be held with the hospitality sector about the potential phased reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants. ""We are now making concerted steps to resume something approaching a new normal while living alongside coronavirus,"" Mr Drakeford told the press conference. ""This public health crisis is not yet over. Through all our efforts we have succeeded in bringing the fire of coronavirus under control but that fire is not out."" He said hospitality has not been given a date to reopen, while tourism has, because ""there's only so much headroom we have"". Non-essential shops can reopen from Monday In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he is ""keen"" to allow for household bubbles in Wales and has promised to look at it at the start of ""next week"". But in an interview with BBC Wales he said he would not wait an ""artificial"" period of time to make the announcement. ""We can announce it as soon as we think we have got everything in place,"" he said. What are household bubbles? Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, he asked people to do ""one more lap"" and observe the ""stay local"" message for two more weeks. ""It has really helped to bring the virus under control in Wales,"" he said. ""We need you to go on doing it, and if you do, then in two weeks we should be in a position where all this can be over."" What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Where do the parties stand on lockdown? Calls for five-mile travel advice to be reviewed The first minister said the stay local instruction ""has really helped to bring the virus under control"". Later, Mr Drakeford said the five-mile rule would remain in place for two more weeks because ""communities who have seen very few visitors will have to be prepared to see visitors again"". ""Simple things like public toilets will need to be reopened in our visitor economy, car parks will need to be reopened, our national parks need time to prepare,"" he said. Fines that have been used to enforce the ""stay local"" law will remain in place. Conservative politicians had criticised the five-mile guidance as unfair on people from rural areas. Caravans could be open to tourists from 13 July The Welsh government had been under pressure to allow for a reopening of the tourism sector for the summer. The lifting of travel restrictions means that the ""tourism economy will reopen in Wales"" from 6 July, Mr Drakeford said, and advised the industry to spend the next three weeks to prepare to re-open self-contained accommodation in July. The self-contained element was important because of the way coronavirus can spread, he argued. ""If you have a static caravan that has its own kitchen or bathroom, if you're renting a cottage or going to a hotel that has turned itself into self-contained accommodation, there will be a clear signal... that you should use the next three weeks to get everything you need in place, and you will be able to start taking bookings for after 13 July,"" the first minister added. Latest figures showed Wales attracts96m day-trippers every year,external- who spend about Â£4bn. That compares to 10m overnight visitors from Great Britain, worth Â£1.8bn. The five-mile guidance has been in place since late May The Welsh Conservatives claimed Mr Drakeford had ""woken up"" to the party's calls for ""a safe and sensible approach to lifting the lockdown"". But Paul Davies, Senedd Tory leader, questioned why the five-mile guidance could not be lifted ""now"". ""Why wait until Monday to allow non-essential retail businesses to reopen when they were given notice to prepare three weeks ago,"" Mr Davies asked. Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said the five mile advice ""really should have gone"". ""I know the first minister said the five-mile rule is just guidance but that's not how people are interpreting it,"" she said. The Brexit Party leader in the Senedd Mark Reckless welcomed the ""belated reduction"" but said all the restrictions should be lifted, trusting ""people's judgement"". Clothing retailer Primark said no shops will be reopening in Wales on Monday. A spokesman said the store ""will only re-open our stores inÂ WalesÂ once we are convinced that it is safe and right to do so"". This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defends the ""careful and cautious"" approach to easing restrictions But the South Wales Chamber of Commerce said the reopening of shops ""will boost the economic re-start"". Huw Pendleton, vice chairman of the UK Holiday Parks Association, said he as delighted ""we have some sort of date to aim for - which puts us on the same playing field as the other nations of the UK"". ""We've lost four bank holidays, so we're never going to recover that lost ground, but at least we look like we'll get some of the summer holiday. ""The only criticism I would give is that it would have been great to have an indication of likely opening dates a bit earlier than we have had - to at least do what the other nations have done - they've had clarity a lot earlier than we have.""

"Australia targeted by 'state-based' cyber attacksThe government and institutions are under threat from a ""sophisticated"" actor, PM Scott Morrison says.","Scott Morrison said the ""malicious"" activity had been increasing over months Australia's government and institutions are being targeted by ongoing sophisticated state-based cyber hacks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. Mr Morrison said the cyber attacks were widespread, covering ""all levels of government"" as well as essential services and businesses. He declined to identify a specific state actor and said no major personal data breaches had been made. The attacks have happened over many months and are increasing, he said. The prime minister said his announcement on Friday was intended to raise public awareness and to urge businesses to improve their defences. But he stressed that ""malicious"" activity was also being seen globally, making it not unique to Australia. Mr Morrison did not name specific cases but said it had spanned ""government, industry, political organisations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure"". He did not give further details. Previously, defence manufacturers, government contractors and accounting firms have been among those to report data breaches. Australia's parliamentary network was the subject of an attack in 2019 Last year,the Australian National University said it had been hackedby a sophisticated operation which had accessed staff and student details. Australia's main political parties and parliament were hitby a ""malicious intrusion"" earlier in 2019, also attributed to a ""sophisticated state actor"". Speaking on Friday, Mr Morrison said officials had identified it as a state hack ""because of the scale and nature of the targeting and the trade craft used"". ""There are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity,"" he said, without giving specifics. When asked to identify a country, Mr Morrison said he would not make ""any public attribution"". Amazon 'thwarts largest ever DDoS cyber-attack' Australia defence data in 'extensive' hack Cyber intelligence experts have long linked various hacks in Australia to China. They say China is one of the few states, along with Russia, Iran, and North Korea, which have the capacity for such attacks - and are not allied with Australia. However, they also note that cyber espionage between countries and even allies is common.

Shaimaa Khalil, BBC News Australia correspondent The headline itself was clear. Many political, educational and health organisations have been targeted by a state-based cyber actor with ""significant capabilities"". However, much about Mr Morrison's press conference was understated. For example, it was not clear why this announcement was made at this particular moment - given these attacks have been going on for a while. Mr Morrison made a similar announcement early last year. Despite blaming a ""sophisticated state actor"", he refused to name names - even after being directly asked about the country almost everyone was thinking about: China. Relations between the countries have grown tense in recent years but have significantly worsened after Australia echoed the US in calling for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, first detected in China late last year. China has since imposed tariffs on Australian barley, stopped beef imports and warned Chinese citizens and students about the ""risks"" of travelling to Australia for tourism or education because of racist incidents. Australia has also ratcheted up its rhetoric. Last week, Mr Morrison said he would not give in to ""coercion"" from Beijing. It's hard to be 100% sure that China could be behind this, but what we know is that Australia's leadership has chosen a moment when its relationship with its powerful trading partner is at an all-time low to announce publicly that it is under cyber-attack from a powerful state. How reliant is Australia on China? He said businesses - particularly health infrastructure and service providers - should improve their technical defences. Cyber defence agencies had thwarted ""many"" hacking attempts but protection required ""constant persistence and application"", he added.

A 20-year-old man died of a suspected drug overdose at the Daisy Nook rave in Failsworth while a woman was raped and three people stabbed in Carrington. One parent said his son was ""dying in a field"" as officers tried to find him. As a warning to others, Greater Manchester Police (GMP) has released footage of the struggles officers faced trying to reach the teenager because there were no safety precautions in place. The parent, who has asked not to be named, told BBC Radio Manchester if it hadn't been for the actions of emergency services, his son ""wouldn't be with us today"" and warned that next time ""it might be too late"". Olga RobinsonDisinformation specialist, BBC Monitoring Facebook has taken down an advert claiming the new
coronavirus was engineered by humans, saying it spread âmisinformation about
Covid-19â. The ad, bought by a minor UK political party, suggested that
a study on a potential coronavirus vaccine found âunequivocal evidenceâ that
the virus was âman-madeâ. But the scientific paper the ad links to makes no such
claims. Before it was removed, the ad had received several thousand
views â mostly from Facebook users in their 50s and older. Conspiracy theories about the origins of the virus have been doing the
rounds on social media since the start of the outbreak. As
we have previously reported, they have been dismissed by scientists who say genome sequencing shows
that the virus came from animals and was not made by humans. All pupils in all year groups in England will go back to school in September,Education Secretary Gavin Williamson has announced. At the daily coronavirus briefing, he said the government was ""signed up... to bring every child back, in every year group, in every school"".

It is part of a Â£1.3m resilience fund given to the British film industry through National Lottery funding. The director of the Plymouth Arts Centre said she was ""delighted"" to receive the ""lifeline"", but said the future was ""going to be uncertain"" for the independent sector. ""There is certainly hard work ahead but this funding means we have a better chance of weathering the months ahead and helping us safely get back on the big screen as soon as we possibly can,â said Anna Navas. Six-year-old Dhillon has raised Â£21,000 to buy an incubator for premature babies at Kingston hospital. A high street that was closed to traffic to give more space for pedestrians to socially distance has re-opened - because shoppers didn't return in droves after all. After just four days in operation,Milton Keynes Council,externalscrapped the scheme for Newport Pagnell High Street. More shops reopened on Monday, and the road closure was put in place in the belief that too many customers would come back for them to stay two metres apart on the pavements,but things were quieter than expected. Liberal Democrat Jane Carr, who represents the Newport Pagnell South Ward, said on Facebook that she had been feeding back residents' and
traders' comments to the council. ""They believe that with the current level of
trade, it is not necessary for the High Street to remain closed at this time to
ensure social distancing,"" Ms Carr said.

May UK government borrowing hits record Â£55.2bn,"The furlough scheme means the government is paying the wages of more than 6.3 million people The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. The Â£55.2bn figure was nine times higher than in May last year and the highest since records began in 1993. The borrowing splurge sent total government debt surging to Â£1.95trn, exceeding the size of the economy for the first time in more than 50 years. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the figures confirmed the severe impact the virus was having on public finances. ""The best way to restore our public finances to a more sustainable footing is to safely reopen our economy so people can return to work. ""We've set out our plan to do this in a gradual and safe fashion, including reopening high streets across the country this week, as we kickstart our economic recovery,"" he added. Income from tax, National Insurance and VAT all dived in May amid the coronavirus lockdown as spending on support measures soared. This is the first time debt has been larger than the size of the economy since 1963, but it is not as high as the post-war peak of 258% in 1946-47. The deficit - the difference between spending and tax income - for the first two months of the financial year (April and May) is now estimated to have been Â£103.7bn, Â£87bn more than in the same period last year, another record. But the ONS estimates borrowing for the 2020-21 financial year will dwarf that at Â£298bn. That would be the largest deficit since World War Two. It cautioned that due to the coronavirus, its official estimates were subject to greater than usual uncertainty. The Office for National Statistics,externalhad previously said that April's borrowing figure was the highest since records began in 1993, but it subsequently revised the figure down to Â£48.5bn from Â£62bn. The revision was due to higher than expected income from taxes and national insurance, as well as the spending on the Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme being lower than originally estimated. Where do governments go when they need money? Alex Tuckett, senior economist at consultants PwC, pointed to the 46% fall in the amount of VAT collected in the month, although it said the biggest issue for the government's finances was the Â£29bn it spent on the various support schemes for the economy. ""In the near term, there are signs the economy is recovering as the country re-opens, and this should boost tax receipts. ""However, these figures remind us that Chancellor Rishi Sunak faces a difficult backdrop to any summer fiscal event."" Samuel Tombs at Pantheon Economics said the emergency support measures had placed a ""colossal burden"" on the public finances. In a release packed with striking figures, he singled out the fact the government had needed to raise more cash in the first two months of this fiscal year than in total in any prior 10 fiscal years. Busting the overdraft, with a borrowing figure nine times as high as a year ago is not an easy thing for any government to swallow. In his first full year as Chancellor, Rishi Sunak is on track for the biggest public sector deficit since World War Two, But it is, he reckons, a price worth paying to prevent a bigger cost to the economy, in terms of lost jobs and output. Billions have been pumped into supporting millions of jobs, and many businesses, while, on the other side, tax receipts have plunged. Those lifelines will be wound down in the coming months, and the government can borrow cheaply on financial markets to fund them. But what happens next? As lockdown is eased, the Treasury is watching closely, knowing the recovery may need extra support - perhaps tax cuts or more spending. That will present the government with more bills - but failing to provide more help risks an even higher cost. The chancellor is to present some sort of statement before Parliament ceases for the summer in July - that won't be a full Budget but may contain some measures to boost the recovery.

Welsh travel restrictions to be reviewed by 6 July,"People in Wales have been told to stay local - restrictions that have not been in place in England Wales' coronavirus travel restrictions could be lifted from 6 July so people can ""travel as far as they like for all purposes,"" First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. Travel into and around Wales will be possible from that date, as long as coronavirus is still under control. But rules that require people tostay local, within five miles of their home as a guide, will stay for now. It comes as Mr Drakeford announced major changes to lockdown laws. From Monday, visits beyond people's local area on compassionate grounds, such as to family, care homes or young offender institutions, will be allowed. On the same day: Retailers can open, with social distancing measures in place Private prayer can take place in places of worship Restrictions on outdoor sports courts will be lifted for non-contact sports Non-professional elite athletes can resume training House viewings in vacant properties and home moves will also be allowed, restarting the housing market. This video can not be played Wales' tourist industry 'ready' for July reopening But rules stating you can only meet one other household outdoors remain in place. The Welsh Government has also signalled when the country's tourism sector can reopen - with trips to outdoor tourist attractions from 6 July - and bookings for self-contained accommodation can start to be made from 13 July. Schools in Wales are also due to reopen on29 June. Both the Welsh Conservatives and Plaid Cymru called for the five-mile travel advice to be scrapped. It remains unclear when hairdressers, pubs, cafes and restaurants will be able to reopen. But the Welsh government promised to look at ""personal care services"", including hairdressers and beauty salons, at the next review on 9 July. This video can not be played A relaxing of restrictions for shops, the housing market and worship will come into force on Monday Mr Drakeford told the daily Welsh government press conference that hairdressers should use the next three weeks to prepare for reopening by appointment only. Discussions will be held with the hospitality sector about the potential phased reopening of pubs, cafes and restaurants. ""We are now making concerted steps to resume something approaching a new normal while living alongside coronavirus,"" Mr Drakeford told the press conference. ""This public health crisis is not yet over. Through all our efforts we have succeeded in bringing the fire of coronavirus under control but that fire is not out."" He said hospitality has not been given a date to reopen, while tourism has, because ""there's only so much headroom we have"". Non-essential shops can reopen from Monday In England, Scotland and Northern Ireland, single adults living alone - or single parents whose children are under 18 - can form a support bubble with one other household. First Minister Mark Drakeford has said he is ""keen"" to allow for household bubbles in Wales and has promised to look at it at the start of ""next week"". But in an interview with BBC Wales he said he would not wait an ""artificial"" period of time to make the announcement. ""We can announce it as soon as we think we have got everything in place,"" he said. What are household bubbles? Speaking on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast, he asked people to do ""one more lap"" and observe the ""stay local"" message for two more weeks. ""It has really helped to bring the virus under control in Wales,"" he said. ""We need you to go on doing it, and if you do, then in two weeks we should be in a position where all this can be over."" What do the latest lockdown rules mean? Where do the parties stand on lockdown? Calls for five-mile travel advice to be reviewed The first minister said the stay local instruction ""has really helped to bring the virus under control"". Later, Mr Drakeford said the five-mile rule would remain in place for two more weeks because ""communities who have seen very few visitors will have to be prepared to see visitors again"". ""Simple things like public toilets will need to be reopened in our visitor economy, car parks will need to be reopened, our national parks need time to prepare,"" he said. Fines that have been used to enforce the ""stay local"" law will remain in place. Conservative politicians had criticised the five-mile guidance as unfair on people from rural areas. Caravans could be open to tourists from 13 July The Welsh government had been under pressure to allow for a reopening of the tourism sector for the summer. The lifting of travel restrictions means that the ""tourism economy will reopen in Wales"" from 6 July, Mr Drakeford said, and advised the industry to spend the next three weeks to prepare to re-open self-contained accommodation in July. The self-contained element was important because of the way coronavirus can spread, he argued. ""If you have a static caravan that has its own kitchen or bathroom, if you're renting a cottage or going to a hotel that has turned itself into self-contained accommodation, there will be a clear signal... that you should use the next three weeks to get everything you need in place, and you will be able to start taking bookings for after 13 July,"" the first minister added. Latest figures showed Wales attracts96m day-trippers every year,external- who spend about Â£4bn. That compares to 10m overnight visitors from Great Britain, worth Â£1.8bn. The five-mile guidance has been in place since late May The Welsh Conservatives claimed Mr Drakeford had ""woken up"" to the party's calls for ""a safe and sensible approach to lifting the lockdown"". But Paul Davies, Senedd Tory leader, questioned why the five-mile guidance could not be lifted ""now"". ""Why wait until Monday to allow non-essential retail businesses to reopen when they were given notice to prepare three weeks ago,"" Mr Davies asked. Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones said the five mile advice ""really should have gone"". ""I know the first minister said the five-mile rule is just guidance but that's not how people are interpreting it,"" she said. The Brexit Party leader in the Senedd Mark Reckless welcomed the ""belated reduction"" but said all the restrictions should be lifted, trusting ""people's judgement"". Clothing retailer Primark said no shops will be reopening in Wales on Monday. A spokesman said the store ""will only re-open our stores inÂ WalesÂ once we are convinced that it is safe and right to do so"". This video can not be played Mark Drakeford defends the ""careful and cautious"" approach to easing restrictions But the South Wales Chamber of Commerce said the reopening of shops ""will boost the economic re-start"". Huw Pendleton, vice chairman of the UK Holiday Parks Association, said he as delighted ""we have some sort of date to aim for - which puts us on the same playing field as the other nations of the UK"". ""We've lost four bank holidays, so we're never going to recover that lost ground, but at least we look like we'll get some of the summer holiday. ""The only criticism I would give is that it would have been great to have an indication of likely opening dates a bit earlier than we have had - to at least do what the other nations have done - they've had clarity a lot earlier than we have.""

As we conclude our live coverage today, here is a reminder of Friday's main stories:  We'll be back with more live coverage in the morning. In the meantime, stay safe and enjoy your Friday evening. Five things you need to know about the coronavirus outbreak this evening. The Tower opened more than 20 years ago A well-known Edinburgh rooftop restaurant has closed its
doors for the final time amid the coronavirus pandemic. Owners of the Tower Restaurant at the National Museum of Scotland said the premises was coming to the end of its lease and would not reopen when lockdown eases. Proprietor James Thomson said he was concerned about how the business could operate under future social distancing restrictions. Redundancy consultations have started with 37 members of
staff at the Tower, which first opened 22 years ago.  Staff at the intensive care unit at Glasgow Royal Infirmary are raising money for a mental health charity to say thank you for the support they've received from the public during the coronavirus crisis. About 120 nurses, doctors and pharmacists are this week collectively covering the distance between John O'Groats and Lands End, through walking, running or cycling. So farthey've raised nearly Â£14,000,externalfor the Glasgow Association for Mental Health. We will never forget the support shown to us and as a huge thank you we would like to do something in return. We are aware that many of the people who have helped us may have challenges of their own to face in time to come. Sarah Haxton, ICU Nurse Newly-qualified teachers have raised concerns they are not be able to get a job because of the coronavirus crisis. In a letter to the Scottish government, 30 teachers say opportunities for permanent jobs in schools are currently limited because of the pandemic. This comes despite calls for extra staff to be hired to help with the new blended learning model of teaching. Nicola Sturgeon said the country will need to utilise ""all talents"" to get schools back to normal. Education Secretary John Swinney told BBC Radio Scotland he plans urgent talks with the group of newly-qualified teachers early next week. Read

The limit of five miles for journeys for outdoor pursuits remains in place for Phase 2 of easing of lockdown rules in Scotland. Mountaineering Scotland said it welcomed the ""positive progress"" made in suppressing the virus, but has asked for greater allowances for outdoor activities. The group has almost 15,000 members. Chief executive Stuart Younie said he appreciated the ""very difficult"" decisions the Scottish government was having to make. But he added: ""While a lucky few who live within five miles or
so of mountains have been able to restart their activities in Phase 1, that
option remains closed to the vast majority, especially those living in the
central belt."" Dundee United were runaway leaders in the Championship when the season was called Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers say they will ""robustly defend"" their positions after a petition was lodged that could prevent their promotions. Hearts and Partick Thistle went to the Court of Session on Wednesday to challenge their respective relegations - and that of Stranraer - after the SPFL ended the season early because of the coronavirus crisis. The three title winners have all instructed lawyers to act for them and say scrapping promotion would ""potentially have catastrophic financial implications"" not just for them, but for all other clubs. Read more SSF said there were signs business was beginning to bounce back Salmon producer Scottish Sea Farms (SSF) has said it will repay all the cash it has received from the UK government's Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme. Since March, the company has furloughed 36 full-time and part-time staff - about 8% of its 451-strong workforce. It has received about Â£106,000 in support until the end of June. SSF said its move was in response to signs that business was beginning to bounce back. It added that the furlough scheme had provided ""vital support"" at the start of the Covid-19 restrictions, and that it would not be making any further claims. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney will be holding regular conversations with his opposite number in Northern Ireland and the UK government about safe social distancing in schools. Northern Ireland say their aim is to have all pupils back andobserving a one metre distancein mid-August, while the plan in England is to have all year groups fully returned to classroom learning by September. Mr Swinney stresses that he has to work to the current advice, which is to maintain a two-metre distance, but says the advice could well change over time. And he concedes that a reduction in distancing would make a ""significant difference"" to planning. That planning currently concentrates on a combination of physical space, staffing, transport issues, food and use of toilets, while Mr Swinney says options like the use of church halls, leisure facilities and vacant offices will be considered. He repeats that he is determined to do everything he can to maximise the amount of formal schooling children receive and to make sure they are supported by high quality digital learning if that is not possible by the 11 August return date. A 101-year-old woman has raised Â£12,000 by completing a high speed zip wire challenge. Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Schools returning in other countries have seen teachers and students wearing face coverings Education Secretary John Swinney does not accept that he was wrong to warn last Sunday that it was unlikely schools would be back to normal before the end of the next school year. ""I can't be absolutely certain about the path of the virus,"" he says. ""All I was saying is that we are likely to be facing a period of disruption. ""I want us to get back to full-time formal education at the earliest opportunity, when it is safe to do so. ""I am acting with my local authority partners, the teaching unions and parents on the basis of scientific advice that is available today. We can't do anything that jeopardises the safety of pupils and staff."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland Education Secretary John Swinney says he wants urgent talks with the group of newly-qualified teachers who wrote to him raisingconcerns over their employment prospectsbecause of the coronavirus crisis. ""I'm very sympathetic to their position because they have worked hard,"" Mr Swinney tells BBC Radio Scotland, before adding ""I want to do everything I possibly can to help them."" He then goes on to congratulate North Lanarkshire Council, who say they will be taking on all 195 newly-qualified teachers in full-time roles. ""I want to make sure we have all of our talents available to help us through a really challenging situation,"" says Mr Swinney. ""I don't employ teachers directly but I can be part of the solution."" Drivetime with Fiona StalkerBBC Radio Scotland SNP MSP and former health secretary Alex Neil has criticised the current plan to restart schools in August, claiming ""it's not blending education, it's bleeding education"". ""There are too many children being told they are only going back into schools for one-and-a-half days a week, including my own grandchildren, and that is just not unacceptable,"" he tells BBC Radio Scotland. Mr Neil reckons there are many parts of the country that could have all pupils back full-time with ""a bit of imagination and proper planning"". Planning is being done on the existing capacity of schools, so we need to find other ways of working, says the education committee member. He says authorities could use empty buildings nearby and portacabins for homework 'hubs' and recruit as many teaching staff as are needed to get as close to 100% education as possible. ""This is not beyond the whit of people to be able to do this,"" he says, insisting 50% - two-and-a-half days a week - should be the bare minimum any child must have from 11 August. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson says that, despite the downgrading in the Covid alert system to level three, the pandemic ""isn't over"" and that people have to remain on their guard. A further 173 deaths among people who tested positive for Covid-19 have been reported (including six in Scotland). This brings the total to 42,461 since the outbreak began in the UK. In total, 5,030 people are currently reported to be in hospital with Covid-19. Followupdates from the briefing here. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been responding to the news that theUK's debt is now larger than the size of its economyfor the first time since 1963. It comes after government borrowing surged to help tackle the coronavirus pandemic. Mr Johnson said: ""It matters hugely but we will manage our finances as sensibly and prudently as we can. ""What I will say is I think the British economy is remarkably resilient, we will come out of this well in the end but there will be some difficult times ahead."" He added: ""There has been a massive lack of economic activity for a very long time - of course that is going to be painful and expensive to make up. But we are a very creative and dynamic society; we will come back."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson will lead the daily UK government briefing shortly. There will be no scientists or experts joining him. You can follow that here...

Margaret Payne said on Friday she has seven of the 282 trips upstairs at her Sutherland home remaining. ""I hope to do two more today, and I average between two and four a day as a rule,"" she told BBC Radio Scotland. Inspired byArmy veteran Captain Tom Moore's 100 lapsof his garden, she began her own mission on Easter Sunday, 12 April, and has so farraised around Â£418,000,external, including gift aid. Mrs Payne, from Ardvar, first climbed Suilven, in the west of Sutherland, aged 15, in 1944, and said it is the only mountain she has climbed to the top of. Her daughter, Nicola, said her mother's effort was ""absolutely amazing"". ""Mum has got fitter, she is sleeping and eating well, and she has stuck at it,"" she added. ""The whole family is really proud."" Lord Carloway said he would not contemplate any measure that might compromise the basic principle of a fair trial Scotland's most senior judge has called for new legislation to help address the growing backlog of court cases. The Lord President, Lord Carloway, said measures proposed so far had simply been ""tinkering at the edges"" of a major problem. He warned that if things continued as they had been, there could be a backlog of 3,000 jury trials in the high and sheriff courts by next March. Some cases have now resumed but social distancing has reduced capacity to 30%. In a strongly-worded statement, Lord Carloway paid tribute to the court service for the speed at which it had developed digitally-based techniques of working, but he said new legislation was needed.

Australia targeted by 'state-based' cyber attack,"Scott Morrison said the ""malicious"" activity had been increasing over months Australia's government and institutions are being targeted by ongoing sophisticated state-based cyber hacks, Prime Minister Scott Morrison says. Mr Morrison said the cyber attacks were widespread, covering ""all levels of government"" as well as essential services and businesses. He declined to identify a specific state actor and said no major personal data breaches had been made. The attacks have happened over many months and are increasing, he said. The prime minister said his announcement on Friday was intended to raise public awareness and to urge businesses to improve their defences. But he stressed that ""malicious"" activity was also being seen globally, making it not unique to Australia. Mr Morrison did not name specific cases but said it had spanned ""government, industry, political organisations, education, health, essential service providers and operators of other critical infrastructure"". He did not give further details. Previously, defence manufacturers, government contractors and accounting firms have been among those to report data breaches. Australia's parliamentary network was the subject of an attack in 2019 Last year,the Australian National University said it had been hackedby a sophisticated operation which had accessed staff and student details. Australia's main political parties and parliament were hitby a ""malicious intrusion"" earlier in 2019, also attributed to a ""sophisticated state actor"". Speaking on Friday, Mr Morrison said officials had identified it as a state hack ""because of the scale and nature of the targeting and the trade craft used"". ""There are not a large number of state-based actors that can engage in this type of activity,"" he said, without giving specifics. When asked to identify a country, Mr Morrison said he would not make ""any public attribution"". Amazon 'thwarts largest ever DDoS cyber-attack' Australia defence data in 'extensive' hack Cyber intelligence experts have long linked various hacks in Australia to China. They say China is one of the few states, along with Russia, Iran, and North Korea, which have the capacity for such attacks - and are not allied with Australia. However, they also note that cyber espionage between countries and even allies is common. This video can not be played Joshua Kennedy-White: Four countries with the capability and intent ""There's always simmering tensions between Russia and China so really it comes down to those being the key actors they [Australia] would be referring to,"" expert Joshua Kennedy-White told the BBC. The Reuters news agency has previously reported that Australian intelligence agencies suspected China of carrying out the parliament hack in 2019. Canberra declined to comment. Shaimaa Khalil, BBC News Australia correspondent The headline itself was clear. Many political, educational and health organisations have been targeted by a state-based cyber actor with ""significant capabilities"". However, much about Mr Morrison's press conference was understated. For example, it was not clear why this announcement was made at this particular moment - given these attacks have been going on for a while. Mr Morrison made a similar announcement early last year. Despite blaming a ""sophisticated state actor"", he refused to name names - even after being directly asked about the country almost everyone was thinking about: China. Relations between the countries have grown tense in recent years but have significantly worsened after Australia echoed the US in calling for an inquiry into the origins of the coronavirus, first detected in China late last year. China has since imposed tariffs on Australian barley, stopped beef imports and warned Chinese citizens and students about the ""risks"" of travelling to Australia for tourism or education because of racist incidents. Australia has also ratcheted up its rhetoric. Last week, Mr Morrison said he would not give in to ""coercion"" from Beijing. It's hard to be 100% sure that China could be behind this, but what we know is that Australia's leadership has chosen a moment when its relationship with its powerful trading partner is at an all-time low to announce publicly that it is under cyber-attack from a powerful state. How reliant is Australia on China? He said businesses - particularly health infrastructure and service providers - should improve their technical defences. Cyber defence agencies had thwarted ""many"" hacking attempts but protection required ""constant persistence and application"", he added. ""We raised this issue today not to raise concerns in the public's mind, but to raise awareness in the public's mind,"" Mr Morrison said. ""We know what is going on. We are on it, but it is a day-to-day task."" 2020: Incidents reported across major Australian firms, including steel maker BlueScope, logistics firm Toll Group, and state government agency Services New South Wales June 2019: The Australian National University revealed a ""highly professional"" group of up to 15 hackers gained access to student and staff details, as well as academic research, for about six months February 2019:Australia's parliamentary computer network and political parties were subject of an attempted attack by a ""state actor"" 2017:Information about fighter planes and navy vessels was stolen from anAustralian government contactor. 2015:Foreign spies attacked theAustralian Bureau of Meteorology.

Staff concerns 'shut down' at child gender clinic,"The Gender Identity Service is based at the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust Staff at England's only children's NHS gender clinic say concerns about patient welfare were shut down, leaked documents reveal. Clinicians reported worries that some patients were referred onto a gender transitioning pathway too quickly. BBC Newsnight has seen transcripts of staff interviews from a review into the Gender Identity Development Service. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust, which runs the service, defended the review and its practices. The review was published in Spring 2019 after the Trust asked its medical director, Dr Dinesh Sinha, to investigate serious concerns about children's welfare raised by staff in an internal report. BBC Newsnighthas read transcripts of some of the interviews conducted with staff as part of the review. NHS gender clinic 'should have challenged me more' Transgender patients self-medicating over NHS waits The Trust said it had not identified any immediate issues in relation to patient safety or the overall approach taken by the gender identity service (GIDS), yet in the transcripts clinicians claim child protection and safeguarding concerns were ""shut down"". In the transcripts, staff are damning in their assessment of some parts of the service ""Let's pray that I am wrong because if I am not wrong, very many vulnerable children have been very poorly treated and will be left with, potentially, a lifetime of damage here,"" one says. ""The reality is, by not doing anything, children are potentially still being medically mismanaged."" The Tavistock - like other NHS organisations - has a named person clinicians can turn to discuss specific safety concerns. But staff allege they were discouraged by GIDS Director Polly Carmichael from going to see the Trust's safeguarding lead, and from referring cases to social services. Dr Polly Carmichael was interviewed on the BBC's The Victoria Derbyshire Show earlier this year According to the transcripts, these included cases where staff feared a child had suffered sexual abuse or trauma. ""In all of my previous work, if you had a concern, you refer them on,"" it's claimed. ""And that did not happen."" The Trust said a safeguarding lead was created specifically for GIDS in August 2018 to reflect the growth in the service. But in their interviews, staff didn't view this as adequate and argued there was wide variation in practice at GIDS. ""There was a very clear message from senior management about being really cautious about how we talk to the safeguarding team at the Tavi[stock], and specifically [the Trust's safeguarding lead]."" Staff have told Newsnight this approach felt unsafe. ""I would say that perhaps that's why more than 40 clinicians decided to leave the service within three years,"" one, who left GIDS last year, told the BBC. The review acknowledges staff had raised concerns over a period of years. But staff claim in the transcripts that when they did so, they were seen as the problem. ""People who raise concerns are seen as trouble making and difficult,"" one staff member argued. ""When I raised concerns I was told that I had to toe the line or I would never progress in my career,"" another said. It's unlikely all staff will have been as critical of GIDS as the ones whose interviews were read by Newsnight. But the number of transcripts seen by Newsnight amount to a sizeable proportion - albeit a minority - of the total number of frontline GIDS staff interviewed for the review. The Tavistock and Portman Trust said it ""stands by"" the 2019 review of GIDS and is ""confident that it fairly addressed the issues raised"". ""Safeguarding is of the utmost importance to the Trust,"" it added. The transcripts detail a range of worries about the service. Homophobia in families attending GIDS is mentioned in all the transcripts Newsnight has seen. As well as seeing young people struggling with their sexuality, staff say some parents appeared to prefer their children to be transgender and straight, rather than gay. In one example, a GIDS clinician describes a young person who had come out as a lesbian and faced homophobic bullying, ""within the family and quite openly in school"". ""Suddenly the young person changed their mind and they started identifying as trans."" In some of these cases, clinicians thought that it wouldn't be appropriate for the patient to be referred for puberty blockers, with one child apparently saying: ""My mum wants the hormone more than I do."" But staff could be overruled by GIDS director Polly Carmichael, the transcripts suggest. Puberty blockers stop a young person's body developing breasts, periods, facial hair or a deeper voice. Recently updatedNHS guidance,externalon puberty blockers acknowledges that little is known about their long-term effects, or what impact they might have on children's brains and bones NHS England says young people should only be referred for this treatment after a minimum of three sessions. Read more:What are puberty blockers? However, the review heard from several staff that one member of the GIDS leadership, Sarah Davidson, would sometimes refer children for treatment after only one or two appointments. ""Absolutely it should never happen because this is a pathway that will lead to huge, huge changes for this young person, potentially, infertility,"" one GIDS clinician said. Such a quick referral, staff claim, could risk putting young people on potentially life-changing medicines who may have been struggling with issues such as their mental health and sexuality. NHS use of puberty blockers legal challenge begins Transgender people face NHS waiting list 'hell' The Tavistock Trust said ""there are many pathways for patients using the service"" and many would not be referred on for consideration for hormone blocking drugs. ""GIDS is a safe and caring service which supports a wide range of children,' it said. ""[We] strongly refute the allegations put to us by Newsnight,"" it added. Newsnight showed some of the transcripts to the Children's Commissioner for England and contacted the healthcare regulator, the CQC. Both were interested in speaking to the people involved. The CQC encouraged anyone with specific concerns about safety or safeguarding at the trust to contact them directly. It had been due to inspect GIDS, though routine inspections are currently paused because of the coronavirus pandemic. You can watchNewsnighton BBC Two weekdays at 22:45 BST or oniPlayer.

How reliant is Australia on China?,"Australian farmer Chris Kelly has seen the rewards of trade with China Australia's relationship with China is not a happy one at the moment. Canberra's push for answers on the pandemic's origins has angered Beijing. In the past month it has put in place some bruising sanctions and travel warnings. Many have urged Australia to reduce its economic reliance on China, but is this really an option? ""I love the Chinese,"" says Chris Kelly, an Australian who's sown barley on his family farm for decades. ""Love them. Every barley grower in Australia loves the Chinese because they've made us wealthy."" Last year Australia produced over 8 million tonnes of the golden grain used in beer and pig feed. China bought more than half - at a premium price. But last month, China imposed an 80% tariff on Australian barley. It came after Canberra, echoing the US, called for an investigation into Covid-19's origins - a move that Beijing labelled ""politically motivated"". China has since suspended some major Australian beef imports, and warned students and tourists against travelling to the ""racist"" country. This week, in a secretive process,it sentenced an Australian man to deathfor drug smuggling. It's fuelled frenzied discussion in Australia: Is China retaliating againstaccusations it mishandled the coronavirus? Could this be the start of a trade warlike that seen between the US and China? The Chinese government has told its citizens to reconsider travel to Australia Like other liberal democracies, Australia is increasingly challenged by the need to balance its economic dependence on China and its own values and interests. In recent times, Canberra has raised concerns about human rights in Xinjiang and Hong Kong, banned Chinese firm Huawei from building Australia's 5G network, and debated allegations of Beijing interfering in domestic affairs. This friction isn't unique to Australia. Canada, Japan and South Korea - among others - have seen economic pushback from China, allegedly for political reasons. The Nobel prize that punished Norway's salmon South Korean food chain targeted by China China suspends Canadian beef, pork imports But Australia's economic dependence on China is greater than many nations. For the past decade, China has been Australia's largest trading partner and now accounts for 32.6% of its exports. Australia's mines have delivered iron ore, coal and gas to fuel China's growth - preferred to rivals in Brazil for their quality and geographic proximity. It's a deal that benefits both nations. Other sectors - education, tourism, agriculture, wine - have also flourished in the Chinese market. But like barley, they are not as exclusive to Australia and so more vulnerable to political tension, economists say. This has all intensified debate over whether Australia has become too reliant on China and should look to other trading partners. It needs to drastically strengthen relations with its Asian neighbours, says Dr Lai-Ha Chan, a political scientist at the University of Technology, Sydney. It has made efforts, she says, noting Prime Minister Scott Morrison had scheduled a trip to India this year and maderepeated entreaties to PM Narendra Modi,external. His visit to Vietnam last year - the first by an Australian leader in 25 years - was recognition of its rising star as a market economy, she adds. Australia's ecotourism and university sectors have been actively courting both nations. Dr Chan suggests Australia could rely on a combination of those countries - plus Indonesia, Japan and South Korea - to lessen reliance on China. Australia needs to strengthen its relationships in Asia, analysts say Scott Morrison with Vietnam's Prime Minister Nguyen Xuan Phuc last year Not all are among Australia's top 10 trading partners currently; in many cases, there is no existing free trade agreement. But economists dispute the idea that the Chinese market can easily be replaced. India is often cited for its potential. Australia has set a goal to send A$45bn (Â£25bn; $31bn) in annual exports to India by 2035. But last year, it sold more than A$160bn to China alone. ""There are no other options that come anywhere near to making up China's numbers,"" says Prof Jane Golley, a China economy specialist at the Australian National University. Government attempts at intervention (a practice seen in Japan), would just be a waste of money, economists say. ""It's a bit strange for the government to tell companies you can't sell to the Chinese or you have to sell more to other countries when other countries simply aren't trying to buy,"" Dr Shiro Armstrong, an East Asia specialist, told the BBC. Chinaâs new brand of tough-talking diplomats What's behind Trump's new strategy on China? US-China trade war in 300 words Australian companies are already working hard to reduce reliance on China, adds Dirk van der Kley, from policy research group China Matters, citing universities in particular. ""Sure, they've made a little difference on the edges. But it's the market which matters here."" Prof Golley says she finds calls by some security analysts to turn away from China - covered heavily by the media - ""depressing"". ""I wonder if the man on the street who reads the headline and thinks we need to diversify from China - I always wonder if they think through what that could mean and how it might lead to them or their children not having jobs in the future."" Australia would be better served looking at the bigger picture, she and others argue. It is far less reliant on exports (20% of GDP) than many nations. But those proceeds flow directly into jobs and welfare, making China a significant driver of Australian prosperity. Richard Maude, a former foreign policy head in the Australian government, says it is vital that Australia can co-operate with China on food security, energy and climate change. Mr Van Der Kley predicts others markets will also emerge for Australia as China's middle class ages, particularly in sectors such as health care and nursing. The significant Chinese diaspora in Australia should not be overlooked, others say. Australia is home to more than 1.2 million people of Chinese ancestry, many of whom only migrated in the last decade - ensuring deep community links.  Chinese consumers continue to favour Australia for education and tourism, partly for this reason. But on the political level, there's a consensus that Canberra-Beijing relations have sunk to their lowest ebb in decades. It has been three years since a bilateral meeting of leaders, despite Australia's repeated requests. Malcolm Turnbull was the last Australian PM to visit Beijing in 2016 Prof Golley says the government should work hard to help Australian businesses engage with Chinese counterparts, but fears this is being damaged by the ""deteriorating"" political relationship. Others say Australia needs to be more strategic in its diplomacy - for example it could criticise China from within a group of like-minded nations rather than striking out on its own. They also suggest hawks within the government should be reined in by Prime Minister Scott Morrison. Ultimately, though, slick diplomacy is just ""packaging"", says Mr Maude, the former diplomat: ""China will still often object to what's inside, no matter how well wrapped."" Mr Morrison has said: ""We're just being Australians. We have done nothing nor sought to do anything that is inconsistent with our values, or have sought to be in any way hostile to our partnership with China."" Australia hasn't changed but China fundamentally has, says Mr Maude. He argues that Beijing has become more assertive and authoritarian. Canberra - like other democracies - can no longer overlook political reality for economic gains. ""The risk of economic retaliation will be a permanent feature of the 'new normal' in the relationship,"" he says. ""We can't have our cake and eat it too."" But for Mr Kelly on his barley farm, he feels like the proverbial canary down a gold mine. ""We've been feeling anxious for years - this has been going on for a while,"" he says. ""It just feels like the worst-case scenario has arrived."" Is China retaliating against Lotte missile deal? China tariffs devastating, says US soybean farmer.

How does breakthrough coronavirus drug work?,"An anti-inflammatory drug called dexamethasone has been hailed as a ground-breaking treatment for hospital patients seriously ill with Covid-19. A UK trial showed the drug could save lives - the first internationally to do so - and it can be used in the NHS immediately. Dexamethasone is a steroid - a medicine that reduces inflammation by mimicking anti-inflammatory hormones produced by the body. This drug works by dampening down the body's immune system. Coronavirus infection triggers inflammation as the body tries to fight it off. But sometimes the immune system goes into overdrive and it's this reaction that can prove fatal - the very reaction designed to attack infection ends up attacking the body's own cells. Life-saving coronavirus drug 'major breakthrough' Dexamethasone calms this effect. It's only suitable for people who are already in hospital and receiving oxygen or mechanical ventilation - the most unwell. The drug does not work on people with milder symptoms, because suppressing their immune system at this point would not be helpful. According to the scientists who carried out the trials, one in three deaths could be prevented among patients on ventilators. For patients on oxygen, it could prevent one death in five. There was no significant benefit for patients who were not receiving respiratory support. The results come from the Recovery (Randomised Evaluation of Covid-19 therapy) trial, conducted by the University of Oxford. It's testing whether existing medicines used for other conditions could also be useful in treating Covid-19. About 2,100 patients received a 6mg daily dose of dexamethasone in the trial for 10 days. Their progress was compared with a random sample of just over 4,300 patients who received no additional treatment. Scientists hope dexamethasone could eventually be used as part of a suite of drugs which, together, could reduce deaths even further. It is now recommended for adults, not including those who are pregnant or breastfeeding. Dexamethasone is a low-cost drug which already exists and is in good supply. The UK government says it had already stockpiled enough of the drug to treat 200,000 people, in anticipation of a good result from the trial. The drug costs from Â£5.40 a day per patient and the treatment on Covid-19 patients lasts for up to 10 days. It was first made in 1957 and became available for use in the UK in the early 1960s. Because it's been around for such a long time, the drug is out of patent. That means lots of different companies can make the drug and it is widely available around the world. The Department of Health and Social Care says the drug has also been added to the government's parallel export list, which bans companies from buying medicines meant for UK patients and selling them on for a higher price in another country. The World Health Organization has welcomed the trial results, saying more therapies are now needed for milder symptoms. The findings are particularly good news for developing countries too. In many African nations, for example, the drug costs less than two dollars. In South Africa, where the drug is manufactured, the government has already been advised to use it to treat patients on oxygen or ventilation support. Data from the WHO shows that more than 5,000 people have died from Covid-19 in Africa, the majority of whom had underlying health conditions. The drug can help treat various illnesses involving inflammation or swelling in the body, or conditions where the immune system goes into overdrive - for example, severe asthma which can cause inflammation in the airways and lungs, severe allergic reactions or painful, inflamed joints. Dexamethasone is also useful in autoimmune conditions such as rheumatoid arthritis or lupus, which are caused by the immune system mistakenly attacking the body. Common side effects of dexamethasone used for non-Covid conditions include anxiety, difficulty sleeping, weight gain and fluid retention. Rarer side effects include eye disorders, blurred vision and haemorrhage. However, coronavirus patients only need a relatively low dose which should limit side effects. The Chief Medical Officer for England said there were ""no excess harms identified in using this dose of dexamethasone in this patient population"". Prof Peter Horby, who led the UK research on dexamethasone, said the use of steroids to treat viral respiratory infections, such as Covid-19, has been controversial. Trials of the drugs during other disease outbreaks, including Sars - another coronavirus-  were mixed with some showing a benefit, but others not. ""It's been a huge ongoing debate,"" says Prof Horby. Scientists are trialling other steroids, such as methylprednisolone, in coronavirus patients withsome promising early results,external.

Will universities open as normal this year?,"As students begin the new term, they'll find many Covid restrictions have been lifted. There will be more face-to-face teaching, but things won't be entirely normal. Thegovernment wants all students to get vaccinated,external, but won't exclude those who aren't. Universities are also calling on undergraduates to get jabbed and many have on-site vaccination centres. What do under-30s need to know about the vaccine? Only double-jabbed people will be allowed to go to nightclubs and some other venuesin Scotland from 1 October. I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? Freshers' Week events include parties, club nights, sports sessions and society fairs. Many universities will hold in-person events for the first time since 2019. But experts warn any sessions where people from across the country mix, could become ""super spreader"" events. UCL professor Susan Michie, a member of the Sage group of scientists which advises the government, saidfreshers' events are high risk,external, especially if they involve alcohol. Earlier this year, Scottish universitieswere advised to postpone ""mass activities"" for freshers,but events are going ahead. Universities will offer much more face-to-face teaching this year. The Russell Group of leading universities saysstaff are preparing for most seminars, small group classes and lab work to be taught in person.,externalHowever it sayssome online learning will continue- partly to minimise disruption in the event of future Covid spikes. Students should ask their institution about plans for their course. Students are likely to be askedto wear a face covering in crowded areassuch as libraries, and will be encouraged totake regular Covid tests. Staff will be asked to test twice a week.

The National Union of Students,externaland theStudent Minds mental health charity,externalwant the government to provide financial support for all students, with extra help for those on lower incomes. They also want universities to prioritise support for mental health. In July, England's Universities Minister Michelle Donelan said universities had access to up to Â£256m.
