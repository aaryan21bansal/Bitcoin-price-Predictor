From prison: 'I sold drugs as a dirty cop',"For the past four years, Jessica Lussenhop has been reporting on the rise and fall of a corrupt squad of Baltimore police officers. Just as she was completing her podcast series on the story, she got a very unexpected call from prison. I'm standing in my pandemic ""radio studio"" - aka the closet in my apartment - surrounded by hangers holding button-up shirts and dresses. I'm staring at my cell phone in the dark. It's propped up on top of a suitcase sitting on top of a plastic tub, and I'm holding my recorder and microphone at the ready. When the phone rings, I put the call on speaker and hear a robotic, pre-recorded female voice: ""You have a prepaid call. You will not be charged for this call. This call is from…"" A human voice breaks in: ""Wayne Jenkins."" ""...an inmate in a federal prison,"" the robot finishes. Former Baltimore Police Department Sergeant Wayne Jenkins, currently inmate number 62928-037 at a federal prison in Kentucky, is on the line. Until this point, I'd only heard Jenkins on secretly taped FBI recordings, wiretapped phone calls, body camera footage and at the hearing in June 2018 when a federal judge sentenced him to 25 years in prison. It was surreal hearing his voice, talking to me. I've been reporting on Jenkins, and the elite Gun Trace Task Force squad he once led, for nearly four years. He and six members of that unit now sit in federal prison for crimes including conspiracy, racketeering and robbery, all committed under the guise of legitimate police work. They stole drugs and cash, sold seized narcotics and guns back on the street, planted evidence on people, even committed home invasions. In 2018, Jessica wrote a piece which detailed the explosive trial at a Baltimore federal courthouse that revealed the unit's crimes She then turned that story into a new seven-part podcast series called Bad Cops which you can listen to in its entirety below Over the years, I wrote to all of these former officers in prison several times, asking them to help me understand their breathtaking crimes. My hope - maybe a naive one - was that hearing one of these men speak candidly about how he crossed over to the dark side would help the public better understand the casual, day-to-day corruption that can happen in policing. I hoped it could spur a more honest discussion about what it's going to take to reform or even redefine what it means to be a cop in the US. Of all seven men, the last person I thought would ever agree to an interview was Jenkins, the fallen ""golden boy"" of the Baltimore Police Department. As the leader of the unit, he received the longest prison sentence and the federal authorities who prosecuted the squad viewed him as its most culpable member. In the years since his arrest, he'd never given a public interview. And yet, here we are, me in my closet ""studio"" and him at the front of a line of 20 to 30 other inmates, all waiting for their turn on the prison phone. I have no idea what he wants to say, or why after four years, he's breaking his silence. ""Everything I tell you, I will take a polygraph,"" Jenkins says near the beginning of that first phone call. ""I'm in prison for 25 years, there's no reason to lie."" On 1 March, 2017, Sergeant Wayne Jenkins and six of his subordinate officers from the Gun Trace Task Force walked into the Baltimore Police Department's Internal Affairs building, believing they were there to clear up a minor complaint about a damaged vehicle. Prior to this, they'd been lauded as some of the best gun cops in the city - seizing dozens of illegal firearms every month, and demonstrating a ""a work ethic that is beyond reproach"", in the words of one supervisor. Jenkins was a rising star in the department, because of his ability to regularly bring in huge seizures of drugs and guns. But when the officers exited the elevators on the building's second floor, they were met by an FBI SWAT team. All seven members were soon in handcuffs. It turned out that federal agents had the unit under surveillance for months. Using wiretaps and hidden recording devices, they had accumulated a wealth of evidence showing the officers were robbing citizens, filing for hundreds of hours of overtime they never worked, stealing drugs and even selling illegal firearms back on the streets. Five of the former officers, including Jenkins, pleaded guilty. But two pronounced their innocence and went to trial, which I covered for the BBC. It was there that the full extent of the officers' misconduct became public. In January 2018, a long list of victims took the stand - many of whom had ties to the drug trade - and told harrowing stories of how they were robbed by the officers during car stops and searches of their homes. Some tried to complain, but were ignored. Shawn Whiting, a man whose house was robbed of $16,000 and a kilo-and-a-half of heroin, testified that he knew that as a drug dealer, his word counted for much less than the officers'. ""I ain't have a trial because the simple fact is I knew [the court] would believe them over top of me,"" he told the jury. Several of the former officers also took the stand - now wearing prison jumpsuits instead of uniforms - and detailed the tactics encouraged by their leader, Jenkins. They testified he told them to carry BB guns to plant if they ever injured or killed an unarmed person, that he often took large quantities of drugs off of suspects without submitting them to the police evidence room. Two officers said he spoke openly about doing home invasions on high-level drug dealers that he called ""monsters"", because of the amount of drugs and cash he hoped they'd have stashed in their houses. One of the most surprising witnesses was a man named Donald Stepp, a bail bondsman, who revealed that he'd been selling drugs Jenkins brought him from work. He said together, they'd sold about $1m worth of narcotics. ""It was a front for a criminal enterprise,"" Stepp said of the Gun Trace Task Force. ""It was obvious to me, when I'm taking millions of dollars worth of drugs from the Baltimore Police Department and selling them, that… this is not a normal police department."" Stepp testified that the arrangement was so lucrative, he stuck with it for years before getting arrested himself in December 2017. ""I'm here because of greed,"" he said. ""It's that simple."" Jenkins did not testify at the trial, but in a way, he was the star of the entire proceeding. After three weeks of astonishing testimony, the jury found the two remaining officers guilty. All seven now sit in federal prisons scattered across the country. The longest sentence was handed down to Jenkins: 25 years. He's due to be released in 2038. After he was sent to federal lock-up, I wrote Jenkins a letter once a year - along with many other journalists, book authors, producers and documentary filmmakers - requesting an interview. I never heard back, and he didn't seem to be responding to anyone else, either. I assumed he never would. This past summer, as I was wrapping up work on ""Bad Cops"", a strange email appeared in my inbox. The message read: ""Greetings. I am Agent and Representative as to Mr Jenkins. Contact me."" A strange back and forth with a man who used to be Jenkins' cell mate ultimately ended up with me in my closet waiting for that call. In the gloom I see the number of the bureau of prisons light up my cell phone screen. ""Hi, ma'am,"" Jenkins says when I pick up. ""This is Wayne."" In federal prison, inmates are only allowed to talk on the phone for 15 minutes before the line is automatically cut. I have so many questions to ask, and I'm not sure if this will be my one and only opportunity to speak to him. ""Especially because we're short on time, is there anything that you kind of want to just say right off the bat?"" I ask. ""Right off the bat, we wasn't living lavishly. I lived modest, we wasn't enriching ourselves,"" he answers. ""I never had [theft complaints] because I never took money off individuals. I did give drugs to Donny for the last couple of years I was police, but I didn't take people's money because then they would know you were dirty. So I kind of had a mental, like maybe a messed up moral code."" Right away I learn that Jenkins is an incredibly fast talker. I have to try to untangle his answers as he moves from subject to subject, sometimes so fast I can't keep up. The first 15 minutes are over in a flash. The line goes dead, and I feel like I've barely gotten anywhere. But then, about an hour later, the phone rings again. Jenkins tells me he traded some sausages with other inmates in the line, bartering his way to the front. Over the course of four phone calls (courtesy of some traded bags of crisps), Jenkins paints a picture of the Baltimore Police Department as a place where indoctrination into corruption starts almost immediately. He tells me that the first time he ever stole money, he was just a rookie. It took place as Jenkins and other officers were searching an apartment. In the bedroom, Jenkins says he and a veteran supervisor found a suitcase filled with tens of thousands of dollars in cash. Jenkins says that the veteran goaded him into taking money. ""He's like, 'I'm not telling you to do anything, I'm just saying it sure would be nice if we had $10,000 apiece to go up to Atlantic City,'"" Jenkins recalls. ""And I remember taking the $10,000."" A lot of what he told me was much more systematic. He claims that he was told early on to lie on police reports and warrant applications in order to make their arrests sound like they were done with proper probable cause, meaning a legal reason to stop someone. In reality, he says, they were making arrests by any means necessary. ""This is a saying we state: 'Don't let probable cause stand in the way of a good arrest,'"" Jenkins says. ""If you've got to lie about what you've seen or what you heard or what you witnessed, as long as he's dirty, he's got the drugs and he's got the guns and he did the crime - just get him."" He told me that frequently, when he or his fellow officers didn't feel like submitting the drugs they seized or doing arrest paperwork, they'd simply confiscate people's drug stashes and let them go. Later on, he claims, they'd throw the drugs out the window or down a sewer grate. ""Pills of heroin, bags of marijuana,"" he says. ""Seen it done, honest to god, 500 times."" Jenkins names two specific locations where he says the drugs get tossed: a train bridge near the Eastern District police station, and a wooded highway off-ramp on the way to the Northern District police station. Weeks later, I search these locations myself to see if I can find anything. On the off-ramp, I find four empty dime bags scattered along a section of sidewalk with no foot traffic. But nothing more. Jenkins also tells me that any time an officer's misconduct gets picked up by Internal Affairs or by an outside law enforcement agency, it was routine for the involved officers to meet up, to tailor their stories to avoid punishment. ""Immediately, we get together and you go over your story. 'You say this, you say that, right?' You're taught that - the second someone gets in trouble we meet up, and we talk face to face,"" he says. As Jenkins is telling me this, he is naming names. He names the veteran he says coached him into stealing for the first time. He also names two former supervisors who he says he complained to about his former subordinate officers, Momodu Gondo and Jemell Rayam, saying they had bad reputations for stealing money. He says he was told that because these officers were so successful at seizing guns, there was nothing to be done. The BBC is not naming these three former supervisors, since none of them has been charged with a crime in connection with this case. But I did call them, and the Baltimore Police Department, to see if anyone would respond to this laundry list of allegations. One former supervisor never responded. The second declined to comment. The spouse of the third left a message telling me I could take what Jenkins told me and ""stuff it"". I never heard back from the Baltimore Police Department. The conversation with Jenkins gets more complicated when we turn specifically to the crimes of the Gun Trace Task Force. Jenkins signed a plea agreement in 2017 that detailed seven robberies that he participated in along with other members of the unit, as well as his drug dealing partnership with Donald Stepp, the former bail bondsman and cocaine dealer who testified at trial. Jenkins admitted that he stole drugs from work and delivered them to Stepp, who would turn around and sell them. The pair also stole valuables, like high-end wrist watches, in break-ins. But Jenkins wanted to argue the details in his plea agreement, saying many of them weren't true. A plea agreement is a document that lists specific criminal acts that the defendant is agreeing to plead guilty to. Jenkins had to affirm under oath in front of a federal judge that what the document said was true. It was difficult for me to understand and parse all of Jenkins' denials, now. For example, I asked him about the robbery of a man who lived in a large mansion in the suburbs of Baltimore - a robbery he pled guilty to in his plea agreement. ""There was cameras everywhere, so I would never have took a dollar,"" he tells me. ""Later on that evening, Gondo did give me money, that means hours later, I'm talking hours later, he gave me money."" ""So you did take money, ultimately?"" I ask, slightly confused. ""I did, yes. Yes, I did,"" he says. He also acknowledged stealing the man's $4,000 (£2,956) watch, which he gave to Stepp to sell. In another man's house, the GTTF broke into a safe and stole hundreds of thousands of dollars. In our conversation, Jenkins says that that's not true - members of the squad did steal money that day, but from somewhere else in the house. It feels a little bit like splitting hairs. When I point out he already pleaded guilty to all these incidents, Jenkins tells me he only signed the agreement because he feared that if he went forward to trial, he could've wound up behind bars for life. He says he couldn't risk it as a father with a young family. ""Life in prison with three small children. Now I deserve 10 to 15 years... I sold drugs as a dirty cop,"" he says. ""I got 25 years. I got gangster charges, racketeering charges, things they usually give the mob, who were burying bodies in cement."" I also point out to him that it's a fairly common practice for prosecutors to level charges that are so serious that the defendant feels they have no choice but to plead guilty. In fact, it's highly likely - if not certain - that many of the people Jenkins' put in prison himself had those tactics used on them by prosecutors. ""Obviously I'm in here now, so I see both sides. If I could take everything back in my life, I would have been a prosecutor,"" he says. ""I'd rather be a prosecutor so I don't overkill people. You never know until you get on this side, including me, what you do to families."" One of the most shocking incidents from the plea agreement is an event that Jenkins now unequivocally denies. In the spring of 2015, the city of Baltimore was rocked by civil unrest after the in-custody death of 25-year-old Freddie Gray. At one point, dozens of pharmacies were looted and millions of dollars worth of medication went missing. In Jenkins' plea, it says that ""in April 2015 following the riots after the death of Freddie Gray, Jenkins brought DS prescription medicines that he had stolen from someone looting a pharmacy so that DS could sell the medications"". ""DS"" stands for Donald Stepp. ""I never took a thing. I was a hero,"" Jenkins says of his activity during the unrest. ""I never took nothing from a looter, so help me god. Donny made every piece of that up."" Donald Stepp was released from federal prison back in January of this year. He served 20 months of a five year sentence in connection with the Gun Trace Task Force case, before being granted a compassionate release. Stepp was on home confinement for six months with an ankle monitor until this summer. Today, he's a free man, living without restrictions with his spouse and young daughter in the eastern part of Baltimore County. He's doing, as he likes to say, ""rather swell"". But when I tell him that I've interviewed Wayne Jenkins, his one-time drug partner, Stepp is displeased, to put it mildly. There is no love lost between these two former friends. ""He's never been a true friend,"" Stepp says. ""I have no respect for him."" Stepp and Jenkins' history runs deep. They'd known one another's families as children. As adults, they ran into each other again at an underground card game frequented by Baltimore Police officers. It was during these games that Stepp heard Jenkins boasting about the large drug stashes he often came across during his work as a plainclothes police officer. At the time, Stepp was running his own bail bond company, Double D Bail Bonds. But he says he was also struggling with a gambling addiction and dealing large amounts of cocaine. That made it very tempting when, sometime around 2011, Jenkins approached Stepp and suggested they go into business together. Jenkins would stop bringing those big drug seizures to the evidence room, and instead give them to Stepp to sell. ""I felt comfortable with it because all the police officers that I met, which were many during the card games, in my opinion, they owned the city,"" Stepp would later tell the jury at the GTTF trial. ""I thought it was a winner."" Stepp says Jenkins started bringing over shipments of drugs on an almost daily basis, putting them in a locked shed behind Stepp's house. The drop-offs included marijuana, cocaine and MDMA, all of which Stepp did his best to sell. Jenkins started calling Stepp to the scenes of arrests, encouraging Stepp to try to get inside drug dealer's hideouts to steal whatever cash or narcotics he could find. They tracked other dealers and broke into their houses when no one was home. This partnership lasted for five years. In December 2017, eight months after Jenkins was arrested, the FBI and Baltimore County officers broke down Stepp's door and arrested him in his kitchen. It didn't take long before Stepp began to suspect that Jenkins ratted him out. But Stepp had an ace up his sleeve - for months, he'd been documenting their crimes on his cell phone. He took pictures of himself and Jenkins together inside the police department, where Stepp would sometimes pick up drugs. When Jenkins called him to a house the GTTF was investigating, Stepp took pictures of the officers going in and out. Later, Jenkins came out carrying two kilos of cocaine he tossed in Stepp's vehicle. Stepp turned everything over to the US prosecutors. In part due to his cooperation in the case, he received a much shorter sentence than the officers of the GTTF. ""He drew first blood,"" Stepp says of Jenkins. ""Now we're going to burn it down. And that's what I did."" Not long after Stepp flipped on his former friend, Jenkins pled guilty. In my conversation with Jenkins, he spent a lot of time disputing Stepp's account of their partnership. He claims that it was Stepp's idea to start selling drugs together, not the other way around. He says Stepp pressured him into it. He also says that he only made roughly $75,000 off of the narcotic sales, as opposed to the figure put on it by Stepp. He calls Stepp ""the biggest exaggerator I've ever met in my life"". When I tell this to Stepp, he's angry. He states flatly that Jenkins is lying to me. He points to the plea agreement, in which Jenkins agreed that his cut of their drug sales came to roughly $250,000. He reminds me that the US Attorney's office found him more credible than Jenkins. ""He's a pathological liar,"" Stepp says. ""I fear nothing he knows or anything. Because believe me, I'll stand my ground in a second."" Stepp's moving on with his life - in a sense. In March, HBO announced a new miniseries by David Simon, the creator of the classic Baltimore true crime series, 'The Wire'. Simon's new project will tell a fictionalised version of the Gun Trace Task Force saga, and began filming on the streets of Baltimore over the summer. Wayne Jenkins will be played by Jon Bernthal, the same actor who portrayed ""The Punisher"". HBO asked Stepp to be a consultant on the project, which he enthusiastically agreed to do. His fee will be donated to the victims of the Gun Trace Task Force. Meanwhile, his Twitter account is full of pictures of him on set, hamming it up with Bernthal and some of the other actors. He's opening a consulting service called Stepp Right Consultants, to give guidance and insight to men and women who are about to enter the federal penal system. He's also at work on a memoir, which he says will reveal the contents of videos and photos he took of Jenkins that were never released publicly. He's even got a clothing line coming out around his defunct bail bond business, Double D Bail Bonds. While he may not be ready to let go of his animus towards Jenkins, Stepp's strange journey seems - at least for now - to be heading towards a happy ending. ""It's a surreal story. But it's the big man upstairs,"" he says. ""I'm grateful, very grateful."" I asked Wayne Jenkins several times why he wanted to do the interview with me. He gave me a few reasons. One was that he felt he'd been railroaded into his plea agreement by the US prosecutors (the Maryland US Attorney's Office declined to comment). Another was to talk about how futile life inside the penal system is. ""I swear, I wish I would have known before I ever put anyone in here… I wish I would have known the other side,"" he says at one point. ""It's nothing I've ever imagined. It's no wonder people come out meaner than when they come in."" And of course, Jenkins is also hoping for a sentenced reduction of some kind. But I think he also spoke to me because he doesn't like the image of himself that's been in the media - as a sociopath, as someone almost inhumanly evil. Back before our interview, Jenkins' representative wanted me to speak to some of his old high school friends. They wanted to tell me that Jenkins was a dedicated father, a good football coach. A loyal friend. They told me they were disturbed that he was being portrayed as a ""monster"". It wasn't the first time I've heard that word to describe Jenkins. While no one should forget for an instant that Jenkins and his officers caused untold harm to Baltimore citizens, I don't find it helpful to try to write him off as a ""monster"". The idea that the Gun Trace Task Force went rogue simply because their sergeant was uniquely evil ignores all the systemic ways in which he was encouraged to operate the way he did, and the larger policing culture that supported him (it should also be noted that several of the squad's members started stealing money long before they joined the GTTF). To single him out as a flawed individual in an otherwise perfectly functioning system is a way to avoid change in the police department, to shirk the responsibility of actually preventing this from happening again. It's going to take an almost unimaginable kind of effort to dig out the roots of corruption in the department, and it's much easier to just lock up the cops who get caught, and carry on with business as usual. Yet another of Jenkins' friends said something I wasn't expecting. He acknowledged that he could tell something was off with Jenkins around the time of the GTTF crime spree. ""We're not stupid. We knew he wasn't the straight-and-narrow cop that all cops are supposed to be,"" he said. ""He always had large sums of money in his pocket. Used to tell me he won it playing poker."" I ask this friend why he didn't say anything to anyone. He says something that I've never heard anyone admit out loud. ""We said, 'You know, he's robbin' the pieces of shit of Baltimore that are the reason that me and my kids can't walk down the street and feel safe,"" he says. This kind of mindset assumes that the victims of the Gun Trace Task Force - many of them black and poor - deserved what happened to them. It's a depressing fact that this is a viewpoint likely shared by many in Baltimore, and is a part of the reason why the GTTF got away with what they did for so long. The GTTF did not hold a monopoly on harm, of course. Baltimore can be a complicated and dangerous place, and the men and women the officers targeted and abused may have caused harm and abuse themselves. Some of the most upsetting conversations I had were with people who felt victimised twice -- by both the officers and by the criminals. The important difference, however, is that the drug dealers never swore an oath to serve and protect. They weren't being paid by the taxpayers to keep the city safe, and weren't operating with all the power and protections that police have. I couldn't help thinking about the many victims of the squad that I'd met over the three years I've been working on this story. My thoughts return to Kenneth Bumgardner, a hard-working father who was chased by the squad when they suspected him of having marijuana. He woke up on a frigid city street with his jaw shattered, and couldn't eat solid food for months. ""I'm finally trying to get my life back on track,"" he told me. ""It's still hard though, because I get a lot of pain in my mouth at night…. I'm losing a lot of teeth, you know, they used to be nice and pretty."" I think about Shawn Whiting, a former heroin dealer who went to prison for years after the officers robbed him. He couldn't get anyone to believe him at the time, and to this day, he fears law enforcement. ""You have nightmares about police officers harassing you, beating you up, just locking you up, it's just a nightmare that I have and it basically hasn't gone away yet,"" he said. ""I just go through this on a daily basis, scared of police, wondering when they gonna stop you, trying to plant drugs on you or something like that. Or harm you or even kill you."" Victims like Bumgardner and Whiting had the courage to speak out. There's no telling how many other people were affected, but were too afraid to come forward. Someone once told me that it will take a generation for the direct impact of the Gun Trace Task Force to start to fade, and it will be impossible to measure how the victims' trauma will play out in the lives of their children, families and friends. The fallout of the squad's crimes is still rippling through the city and undoubtedly made Baltimore a less safe place for everyone who lives there. I continued working on this story for as long as I did out of some hope that the more the public learned about the corruption in the police department, the better chance there might be of some kind of true, systemic reform. But Whiting is not so optimistic. Four years after the Gun Trace Task Force officers were arrested, he says he sees no difference on the streets of Baltimore. ""How police act towards people ain't changed,"" he told me recently. ""I see some police officers harassing people, doing the same little tactics that the Gun Trace Task Force was doing."" I asked him if he thinks that another scandal is inevitable. ""Absolutely. It's going to happen again,"" he said. ""It ain't over. This just begun."" .

Coronavirus evening updateFive things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening.UK,"Here are five things you need to know about the coronavirus pandemic this Tuesday evening. We'll have another update for you tomorrow. Scotland's new vaccine passport systemwill not be enforced until more than two weeks after it is introduced. From 05:00 on Friday, people going to nightclubs and many other large events will need proof they have had two doses of vaccine. But First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says there will now be a ""grace period"" until 18 October. Meanwhile, in Northern Ireland health minister Robin Swann says a delay by the executive in agreeing a Covid vaccine certification policyhas ""significantly limited"" the options for easing restrictions. Boris Johnson has promised to appoint someone before Christmas to chair the official Covid inquiry, after meeting a campaign group. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice says the prime minister also pledged to involve them in the decision,during a meeting with them in Downing Street.The group has been campaigning for a public inquiry into the pandemic to begin immediately. It is due to begin in spring 2022. The families say they are pleased Mr Johnson had met them - but they are ""still disappointed by the lack of urgency"" over an inquiry start date. It will be a criminal offence to fake a lateral flow test for a mandatory Covid passunder Welsh government plans. The Welsh government says the Senedd will vote on the law for nightclubs and large events on 5 October. Labour ministers are likely to need support from Plaid Cymru to pass the regulations. But the party has not decided whether to support them, asking for more detail. Scotland is""nudging towards"" herd immunitydespite still having high levels of Covid in the population, a public health expert says. Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence at NHS Grampian, told the BBC that all groups need to be jabbed for population-wide protection. But she says the numbers vaccinated or already infected with the virus suggest ""we are nudging towards it"". A new factory making a million medical-grade face masks a daysays its workforce includes those who lost their former jobs in the coronavirus pandemic. Ultrafilter has spent Â£3.6m on the site in Ross-on-Wye, Herefordshire, which supplies the NHS. There are 67 workers, with plans to soon raise the figure to 90.

"I'll get Labour back in business, promises Starmer","This video can not be played Starmer's party conference message to PM: ""Get a grip or get out of the way"" Sir Keir Starmer has said Labour will never again go into an election without a ""serious plan for government"", in a speech to his party conference. He said the country faced a ""big moment"" that ""demands leadership"" - and as prime minister he would provide it. Sir Keir set out new policies on mental health, education and housing, but it was also a highly personal speech about his own background and values. He got a standing ovation, but was heckled by some left-wingers. Sir Keir told those barracking him in the Brighton Centre that he was about ""changing lives"" not ""shouting slogans"", to cheers from other delegates. Keir Starmer's Labour conference speech fact-checked Five things we learned from Labour conference Shadow cabinet member quits in protest at Starmer Labour members back Â£15 minimum wage amid row After a week dominated by rows with the left, Sir Keir urged activists to come together to beat the Conservatives, at a time when energy bills are rising, petrol supplies are running short and the economy is recovering from the pandemic. ""These are big issues, but our politics is so small,"" he told delegates. ""So our politics needs to grow to meet the scale of the challenge."" The 89-minute speech was Sir Keir's first chance to address a full Labour conference since becoming party leader 17 months ago, as last year's event was held largely online because of Covid. Addressing a packed auditorium, he said he would ""not stand for the record levels of knife crime that we have in this country today"" and called Labour a party of ""patriots"". He spoke at length about his background, focusing on his previous career as a human rights lawyer and his mother's years of suffering from Still's disease, a form of inflammatory arthritis which severely restricts mobility. Sir Keir described his parents as ""the two rocks of my life"", saying his father, a toolmaker, had given him a ""deep respect for the dignity of work"". He contrasted his life with that of Prime Minister Boris Johnson, whom he described as a ""trickster"", a ""trivial man"" and a ""showman with nothing left to show"". This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer is heckled as he delivers his speech With Labour having lost four general elections in a row, the last one by the biggest margin since the 1930s, Sir Keir attempted to distance himself from the policies of ex-leader Jeremy Corbyn. While he did not mention his more left-wing predecessor by name, he said: ""We will never under my leadership go into an election with a manifesto that is not a serious plan for government. ""It will not take another election defeat for the Labour Party to become an alternative government in which you can trust."" By contrast, Sir Keir paid tribute to the party's 13 years in power under prime ministers Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, saying they had cut child and pensioner poverty, taken on more teachers and nurses and reduced hospital waiting times. ""You want levelling up?,"" he asked. ""That's levelling up."" At the start of his speech Sir Keir was repeatedly shouted at by one woman in the audience, but replied: ""I normally get heckled by the Tories at this time of the week, so this doesn't bother me."" Sir Keir Starmer deliberately took his time to spell out his vision to voters that Labour has lost. In an effort to connect with them, he spoke in personal terms about his parents and their influence on his political beliefs, revealing more about what drives him. Persistent hecklers in the hall were a reminder that support for Sir Keir within Labour is far from unanimous, but they may not hurt his attempt to show he's closing the door on the Corbyn era. There were some policy announcements, but the main message to voters was an appeal to look again at Labour after four election defeats in a row. The speech was also a challenge from Sir Keir to his party to change if wants to win again. It was the longest, most detailed argument he has yet made that he is the man to lead it back into Downing Street. Moving on to policies, he announced that a Labour government would upgrade 19 million homes so that they reach a minimum ""Band-C"" energy efficiency level, providing grants for low-income households to achieve this and low-interest loans for others. The changes would include better insulation, double glazing and new heating systems, saving households Â£400 a year in bills on average, he promised. Other pledges in the speech included: Providing mental treatment within a month for all people in England who require it Creating 8,500 more specialist mental health staff, providing an extra million people a year with help Training ""thousands"" of extra teachers in England - his aides did not provide a more specific figure Reforming the inspection body Ofsted to focus more on improving struggling schools ""I can see the ways in which we can remake this nation and that's what we get to do when we win,"" Sir Keir said. ""So let's get totally serious about this - we can win the next election."" Sir Keir's speech ended a five-day conference which saw him get backing for changes to the way the party elects its leaders, against fierce opposition from the left, who feel they are being marginalised. On Monday, shadow employment secretary Andy McDonald quit Labour's front bench, saying he had been ordered to argue against raising the minimum wage to Â£15 an hour. The next day, the conference backed a motion calling for this to be party policy, although this is not binding on the leadership. And delegatesvoted in favour of nationalising the UK's energy industry,despite Sir Keir ruling this out. The leader also angered the left when he pushed throughchanges to the way Labour elects its leaders. Reacting to Sir Keir's speech, left-wing Labour activist group Momentum said it had ""identified a lot of problems but offered very few solutions"". ""We all know that the NHS crisis is bad, but what will our party do about it? We are no clearer on that than we were this morning,"" it added. The trade union Unite said there ""wasn't much"" in it about the cost of living and workers' rights. But Christina McAnea, general secretary of the union Unison, said the Labour leader had demonstrated ""vision"" and shown the party ""could bring hope to the many families forgotten by this government"", adding: ""This is a serious plan for change"". Conservative Party co-chairman Oliver Dowden said: ""As Labour's chaotic conference comes to an end, it is clear Sir Keir Starmer's party is more divided than ever and has no plan.

Southeastern rail franchise stripped by government,"Southeastern will hand over the running of its services on 17 October Rail operator Southeastern has been stripped of its franchise after failing to declare more than Â£25m of taxpayer funding. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the money had now been reclaimed. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the Operator of Last Resort would take over the running of rail services in the south east to protect taxpayers' interests. Passengers will see no change in day-to-day operations, Southeastern said. Further investigations are being conducted and the government said it would consider options for more action, including financial penalties. Mr Shapps said: ""We won't accept anything less from the private sector than a total commitment to their passengers, and transparency with taxpayers. ""Through the Operator of Last Resort we'll prioritise the punctual, reliable services passengers deserve."" Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""This is yet another example of the complete failure of the franchise model, which prioritises private company profits over passengers and service."" He called on the government to bring rail franchises back into public ownership, adding that ministers ""must acknowledge their previous approach just hasn't worked."" Passengers have been told that there will be ""no immediate changes"" to services Chair of the Transport Select Committee Huw Merriman said he understands that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) ""will be involved"", but the SFO said it would not deny or confirm an interest in the case. Mr Merriman, who is the MP for Bexhill and Battle, told the BBC: ""If this matter is serious enough that it is just beyond someone getting it wrong in terms of accounting, and there is evidence of wrongdoing [of] a criminal nature, of course that must be looked into. ""It's really important there is integrity in the railway system. ""We need confidence in our railways right now."" A statement from the DfT said it had found evidence that since October 2014 historical taxpayer funding of Â£25m, which should have been returned, had not been declared. The operation of all Southeastern services would transfer from London South Eastern Railway (LSER) to SE Trains Limited on 17 October, the DfT said. Robin Gisby, chair of SE Trains Limited, said: ""This decision doesn't affect the day-to-day operations of our train services, and we will continue to work hard to provide passengers with a great experience. ""I'd like to reassure all passengers that this is very much business as usual with no immediate changes."" ""All tickets will remain valid after transfer and new tickets can continue to be purchased in the usual way,"" astatement on Southeastern's website,externalsaid. Renationalising a line is not unheard of but to do it for a breach of trust is. Normally it is about whether services are good enough and concerns that an operator can financially honour the terms of the franchise. That's not the government's reasoning here. Contracts between operators and government were in effect ripped up during the pandemic and renegotiated. It looks like this issue was discovered when they were being closely scrutinised. The question many will have now is if this is viewed as a serious issue, why didn't the government notice it earlier? There are still ongoing investigations into what happened. Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""There now needs to be a forensic examination of all the private rail contracts with those caught cooking the books called to account. ""It's an outrage that this privatised rail system stumbles on when it could be taken directly into public ownership for public need. ""We have to ensure that the services continue to run and staff are transferred successfully."" Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, said: ""The days of rail franchising must now be well and truly over. Time and time again we see the private sector fail and taxpayers ride to the rescue. ""Our union will now be seeking assurances that this mess in no way impacts our members' jobs because so many of them have been true heroes on the frontline of the pandemic since day one"". Tony Clayton, chairman of the Sevenoaks Rail Travellers Association, voiced concerns about the long term impact for passengers. He said: ""The reaction was 'not again'. This is the second time this has happened to us where the Operator of Last Resort has taken over the service. The last time was in 2003 when Connex lost the service. ""What we'd really like to know is what are the government going to do to keep making steady improvements to the service. ""We thought Southeastern did a pretty good job getting the service back to normal and a fantastic job during the pandemic to keep things safe."" Southeastern, which runs services between London, Kent and East Sussex, is operated by Govia, a joint venture between transport operators Go-Ahead and Keolis. Go-Ahead shares fell more than 22% in morning trading. The firm announced Elodie Brian has resigned as group chief financial officer and will be standing down from the board with immediate effect. Go-Ahead's chairwoman Clare Hollingsworth said: ""We recognise that mistakes have been made and we sincerely apologise to the DfT. We are working constructively with the DfT towards a settlement of this matter"". Southeastern has been running services since 2006, operating one of the busiest networks in the country including the UK's first domestic high-speed service. In 2019 the government held a fresh competition to run the franchise, but this was cancelled over fears it would lead to additional costs ""incurred to the taxpayer"". It employs employs 4,000 workers and serves 180 stations using a fleet of almost 400 trains.

PM makes Covid inquiry pledge to bereaved families,"Some group members arrived in Downing Street carrying pictures of lost loved ones Boris Johnson has promised to appoint a chair for the official Covid inquiry before Christmas, after meeting a campaign group. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said he also pledged to involve them in the decision, during a meeting with them in Downing Street. The PM met the group earlier, having declined to do so since last year. It has been campaigning for a public inquiry into the pandemic, due to start in spring 2022, to begin immediately. Five families from the group met Mr Johnson on Tuesday for a private reception, to share stories of their loved ones lost due to Covid. Afterwards, they said they were pleased he had met them - but they were ""still disappointed by the lack of urgency"" over an inquiry start date. Tories reverse decision to ban Covid families group Covid families reject PM's reason for not meeting Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved families A No 10 spokesperson said the PM had promised the group the inquiry would ""get to the bottom of many of the questions that they, and thousands of others like them, have about the pandemic"". ""The prime minister gave a commitment that the chair of the inquiry would be appointed by Christmas,"" they added. ""He set out that for now, it is right that public servants continue to focus their efforts on tackling the pandemic before moving on to the inquiry in the spring of next year."" This video can not be played Hannah, who lost both her dad and grandmother to Covid, met with the prime minister. Speaking afterwards, Mr Johnson told reporters the meeting had been ""very emotional"". ""Obviously there's very little I could say to mitigate their own suffering,"" he added. ""But what I did say is we are determined to make sure the experience of the bereaved is something we took account of in the public inquiry."" The group, representing families with relatives who have died with the virus, has been asking for a meeting with Mr Johnson since last year. However, he has previously turned down a meeting with them, citing a threat of legal action over an official pandemic inquiry. The groupwrote to the government in August last year, saying it was considering a judicial review of the decision not to hold an immediate public inquiry. But the group denied that legal action had started - and labelled Mr Johnson's reason for not meeting them a ""poor excuse"". The PM gave his support to the National Covid Memorial Wall, suggesting it could become a permanent memorial In May, Mr Johnson announced a statutory public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic would begin in spring 2022. The group's meeting with the PM comes a week before it attends the Conservative Party annual conference, beginning in Manchester on Sunday. The group says it was initially denied permission to attend, before subsequently being told they could after ""the news broke in the media"". In a statement after the meeting, the group said families expect to be consulted on the appointment of a chair and the inquiry's terms of reference. It added Mr Johnson also gave his support to the National Covid Memorial Wall, suggesting it could become a permanent national memorial. ""Although we wish this meeting had taken place a long time ago, we're pleased that the prime minister has chosen to finally engage with us,"" the statement added. ""However, we are still disappointed by the lack of urgency the prime minister displayed, as we see no reason why preparations for the inquiry cannot begin now, particularly as nearly 1,000 people are still losing their lives each week.""

Energy bill struggle for life-support sisters,"This video can not be played The sisters need 38 machines running 24 hours a day to keep them alive The parents of two severely ill girls say soaring energy prices have left them struggling to meet bills for life-saving equipment. Pam and Mark Gleave, from Amlwch, on Anglesey, have three adopted children who all depend on 24-hour life support. Their energy bills have increased recently due to the children's medical needs becoming greater. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) said it would contact the family to see how it could help them. Gas and electricity prices have risen in the UK this yeardue to a number of factors. The couple, who have two grown-up biological children, adopted their children after some time fostering. Katie, 19, and Kelly, 14, have PEHO syndrome - a rare and degenerative neurological condition which means they cannot walk or talk, and need constant care. Mason, 12, has complex medical needs due to brain damage and is currently at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Kelly, Katie and Mason Gleave all rely on life-support machines which require a lot of electricity In the daughters' room alone there are more than 60 plugs for medical equipment. Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' Parents with learning disabilities 'set up to fail' Learning disability work 'barrier' Ms Gleave said: ""Our electricity bill alone is Â£776 a month - that doesn't include heating or anything else. ""It's not normal for a family to have 38 pieces of medical equipment running 24 hours a day. ""We see things are going up and up. Where are we going to find that money?"" Mr Gleave, 61, was made redundant two years ago and was planning to use the money he received to pay off the mortgage, but since then the children's health has deteriorated and all three are on life-support machines at their home. Pam Gleave said they are using her husband's redundancy pay to meet the costs The machines must be charged constantly and back-up batteries are needed in case of a power cut. ""It's extremely difficult,"" said Ms Gleave. ""When Mark worked it wasn't an issue, he used to work seven days a week, we never asked for anything from anybody."" The family said if the children were being cared for in hospital, it would cost the health service about Â£2,000. But Ms Gleave said while they has discussed the option of hospital care as the bills mount: ""That's never going to happen - we would never let that happen."" She toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We have got things that we would sell before that would even be a thought in my mind. ""We'd sell the house first."" All the carers and equipment are funded by Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board, but the equipment running costs are the parents' responsibility, and the couple fear they will not be able to cope without financial help. They have asked for guidance from health staff but feel lost and do not know who to turn to for help. Ms Gleave said: ""All we are asking for - is there some way we can get some support, because it's not normal to have that amount of bills just to keep the children at home. ""For us it's all about keeping the children at home. It's about giving them to good quality of life. ""We've got a wonderful social worker, and I do know they are trying to look into it. But they, I think, are in the same boat as us. It's not happened before - so where do we go?"" Kelly Gleave and her siblings are all on home life support Another concern is that the children's room in the conservatory is in poor condition and needs the roof replacing, but they do not want the move their children into separate rooms or into areas not adapted for them. She said: ""We seem to be fighting, and not getting the answers that we need. ""It's not about complaining or moaning, people have been wonderful, our social worker, our ventilator nurse. It's just we don't know where to turn, that's the honest truth, we don't know what to do. ""We don't know what the next few months is going to bring for the children, and that's a real worry. ""I would not in any way swap our lives with these beautiful children that are so amazing and keep you grounded. ""In a world that we live in today, honestly, they are amazing, wonderful children."" Dr Chris Stockport, executive director of primary and community care at BCUHB said he was very sorry to hear their concerns about their children's care. ""We are committed to working with them to provide the best possible care for their children and we will contact the family to see how we may be able to help further,"" he added.

"Christmas HGV driver visas exploitative, says FM","This video can not be played Dilys Hughes says the service station had to close to make sure local people were not hit by the rush Plans to give foreign lorry drivers temporary visas are ""exploitative"", Wales' first minister has said. A shortage of drivers has disrupted fuel deliveries, with some petrol stations closing, and queues forming. Mark Drakeford said UK governmentplans for visas ending on Christmas Evewere ""arrogant"" as ministers insisted there was no fuel shortage. In response, the UK government said the visas would provide ""short-term relief"" for the haulage industry. It comes as representatives for NHS staff, emergency service workers and councils, urged drivers to allow 999 and care workers to skip long queues to get to the pumps first. Supt Mark Williams, of North Wales Police, said the force had heard stories of key workers who had been ""verbally abused"" on garage forecourts. Several supermarkets closed petrol stations in Wales due to demand for fuel over the weekend Charities, key workers' unions and government officials have called for calmafter panic buying sparked huge queues outside petrol stations, with some pumps running dry at the weekend in parts of Wales. It comes after a shortage of lorry drivers led to some deliveries not being made to forecourts from refineries There have been fears of pending food shortagesdue to a lack of drivers in the run up to Christmas. Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers What's it like to be in the 1% of female lorry drivers? What is behind the driver shortage in Wales? On Saturday, plans to give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers, were announced by the UK government. However, speaking during First Minister's Questions in the Senedd on Tuesday, Mr Drakeford slated the three month visa offer, saying it showed breath-taking ""arrogance"". He said: ""The idea that people are going to be willing to uproot themselves and come back and work in this country for a matter of weeks, only to be told by the UK government they will be discarded again on Christmas Eve when they no longer have any use for them... the arrogance of it is breath-taking, but it just isn't going to work."" It is estimated that the UK needs about 100,000 HGV drivers - with existing shortages made worse by Covid-19, tax changes, Brexit, an ageing workforce, low wages and poor working conditions. Mr Drakeford accused the UK government of making a ""derisory attempt to solve a problem of their own creation"" due to Brexit.""When we were in a single market and customs union people were able to move freely across the continent of Europe, and to do jobs here in this country. Those people are no longer available to us,"" he said. In response the UK government said its package of measures, including putting the military on standby, temporary visas and training, would help ease supply chain issues and spikes in demand. ""The measure to make available 5,000 visas for HGV drivers for a three-month period will provide short-term relief for the haulage industry and is only temporary - visas will not be the long-term solution and reform within the industry is vital,"" a spokeswoman said. This video can not be played There is currently a shortage of about 100,000 drivers in the UK Finance Minister Rebecca Evans insisted there was ""plenty of fuel"" in Wales and urged people to stop panic buying to ensure key workers can refuel. Ms Evans urged people to behave ""responsibly"" while UK governments work to ease logistical issues around getting petrol from refineries to the pumps. Up to 150 military tanker drivers are on stand-by to deliver to UK forecourts, some of which have run dry due to panic buying. However UK Transport SecretaryGrant Shapps has said there are signs supply problems are stabilising. Speaking during a briefing on Tuesday, Ms Evans said that she understood people's anxiety, but there was no shortage and there was ""plenty of fuel"" in refineries and in storage. ""I know it can be stressful and worrying for people but we have to remember that there are people who work in the critical sectors who do need that petrol,"" she added. ""We do have a national fuel plan which could prioritise certain people or groups for access to fuel but we haven't invoked that because we understand the system will get itself back into kilter very shortly.""

Amazon announces Astro the home robot,"Amazon is launching Astro, its first household robot, powered by its Alexa smart home technology. The company said it can be remote-controlled when not at home, to check on pets, people, or home security. It can also patrol a home automatically and send owners a notification if it detects something unusual. Amazon said it was more than ""Alexa with wheels"" and had been programmed with a range of movements and expressions to give it personality. It demonstrated asking Astro to ""beatbox"" - and the robot bopped its head and made expressions while playing hip-hop beats. Amazon was also keen to pre-empt privacy concerns. It said Astro can be set with ""out of bounds"" zones, so it cannot go into certain areas, or could be set to ""do not disturb"". It also features buttons to turn off cameras and microphones - though it loses its ability to move around when they are switched off. The small robot also comes equipped with an extendable ""periscope"" camera that pops up from its head. Amazon showed an example of using it to check if a gas hob had been left on after leaving the house. In patrol mode, Astro uses its extendable periscope camera The technology and retail giant suggested that the $999.99 (Â£740) robot could be a help to the elderly. ""Astro is a bold move by Amazon, but a logical step given its expertise in robots and desire to become more integrated into consumers' daily lives,""said Ben Wood, chief analyst at CCS Insight. Unlike some rivals, Amazon ""is willing to bring highly experimental products to market"" and see how customers react, he said. Why Amazon knows so much about you Amazon pays Â£492m in UK tax as sales hit Â£20.6bn Older Kindles may lose internet connection ""Offering products resembling something from a science fiction novel positions Amazon as an innovative company in the eyes of consumers and investors,"" he said. The robot will ship later this year, Amazon said - but only in the US. And after the initial, limited run, its price will go up to $1,449.99, it said. ""I believe the Astro robot will sell out in minutes when it becomes available in the US market,"" Mr Wood said. ""I'm just gutted that it won't be shipping in the UK in the foreseeable future."" Amazon wants a slice of the robotics market, boldly stating that it believes all homes will have one in five to 10 years. It wants Astro to be that must-have new member of the household, and there is no denying that the little wheeled robot is pretty cute - although the periscope that pops out of its head is a little creepy. But we have seen other cute humanoid robots -such as Pepper- fail to make a mark. This is largely because the price tag means it will be a toy for the rich for some time to come. And while Amazon was keen to convince us that for that you get more than ""Alexa on wheels"", it was hard to see a compelling use case for this other than to curb that ever-present paranoia that you left the oven on. But building robots is hard. And if the home robotics market is ever going to take off, people will have to be convinced to spend a lot of money. This first foray offers Amazon a chance to hone its skills.  And arguably, there is no company already as firmly embedded in our homes as Amazon. The company is known for occasionally making unusual smart home tech such as itsAlexa-controlled microwavefrom 2018. At last year's event,Amazon turned heads with a flying indoor alarm drone. The Always Home Cam launches from its deployment bay if it detects a potential intrusion, and can fly around a home to check with a video feed. But it was not launched and no more details were released in the past year. Instead, Amazon on Tuesday said it was opening up the invite list for early adopters to buy the drone  on a limited basis - but did not give dates for widespread availability. The Always Home Cam covers up its camera when not in flight Among the other devices unveiled at the event was the the Amazon Glow: a video calling device that has the ability to project an interactive ""touchscreen"" on the floor or table in front of it. The idea is to engage children during long video calls, as they can play games or draw on the 19-inch projected ""screen"" while on the video call. Relatives on the other end can also interact with the projection through a tablet app. In one example, Amazon said children could ""scan"" a favourite toy using the Glow's camera, and turn it into a jigsaw puzzle to reassemble. The Amazon Glow's downward-firing projector creates an interactive ""touchscreen"" for play during family video calls Other new products announced included: a Disney-themed Alexa version, featuring the voices of Disney characters, to be rolled out next year updates to the Amazon Halo workout band, with a new model called Halo View. a new model of Ring smart alarm with a built-in wifi router a paid ""virtual security guard"" Ring subscription which allows a remote operator to check cameras triggered by motion detection The event also coincided with the launch of Amazon's much-delayed video game New World, its second attempt at a big-budget title after thehigh-profile failure of its shooter Crucible last year. Unlike Crucible, however, New World received some favourable feedback during a popular beta test in July which attracted hundreds of thousands of players.

"PM makes Covid inquiry pledge to bereaved familiesBoris Johnson says he will appoint an inquiry chair before Christmas, after meeting a campaign group.UK Politics","Some group members arrived in Downing Street carrying pictures of lost loved ones Boris Johnson has promised to appoint a chair for the official Covid inquiry before Christmas, after meeting a campaign group. Covid-19 Bereaved Families for Justice said he also pledged to involve them in the decision, during a meeting with them in Downing Street. The PM met the group earlier, having declined to do so since last year. It has been campaigning for a public inquiry into the pandemic, due to start in spring 2022, to begin immediately. Five families from the group met Mr Johnson on Tuesday for a private reception, to share stories of their loved ones lost due to Covid. Afterwards, they said they were pleased he had met them - but they were ""still disappointed by the lack of urgency"" over an inquiry start date. Tories reverse decision to ban Covid families group Covid families reject PM's reason for not meeting Start Covid-19 inquiry now, say bereaved families A No 10 spokesperson said the PM had promised the group the inquiry would ""get to the bottom of many of the questions that they, and thousands of others like them, have about the pandemic"". ""The prime minister gave a commitment that the chair of the inquiry would be appointed by Christmas,"" they added. ""He set out that for now, it is right that public servants continue to focus their efforts on tackling the pandemic before moving on to the inquiry in the spring of next year."" This video can not be played Hannah, who lost both her dad and grandmother to Covid, met with the prime minister. Speaking afterwards, Mr Johnson told reporters the meeting had been ""very emotional"". ""Obviously there's very little I could say to mitigate their own suffering,"" he added. ""But what I did say is we are determined to make sure the experience of the bereaved is something we took account of in the public inquiry."" The group, representing families with relatives who have died with the virus, has been asking for a meeting with Mr Johnson since last year. However, he has previously turned down a meeting with them, citing a threat of legal action over an official pandemic inquiry. The groupwrote to the government in August last year, saying it was considering a judicial review of the decision not to hold an immediate public inquiry. But the group denied that legal action had started - and labelled Mr Johnson's reason for not meeting them a ""poor excuse"". The PM gave his support to the National Covid Memorial Wall, suggesting it could become a permanent memorial In May, Mr Johnson announced a statutory public inquiry into the government's handling of the pandemic would begin in spring 2022. The group's meeting with the PM comes a week before it attends the Conservative Party annual conference, beginning in Manchester on Sunday. The group says it was initially denied permission to attend, before subsequently being told they could after ""the news broke in the media"". In a statement after the meeting, the group said families expect to be consulted on the appointment of a chair and the inquiry's terms of reference. It added Mr Johnson also gave his support to the National Covid Memorial Wall, suggesting it could become a permanent national memorial. ""Although we wish this meeting had taken place a long time ago, we're pleased that the prime minister has chosen to finally engage with us,"" the statement added. ""However, we are still disappointed by the lack of urgency the prime minister displayed, as we see no reason why preparations for the inquiry cannot begin now, particularly as nearly 1,000 people are still losing their lives each week.""

Petrol prices at eight-year high,"Petrol prices have hit an eight-year high, the RAC has said, due to a rise in the cost of wholesale fuel. The pump price spike also comes amid the current fuel supply problems and reports of profiteering at some petrol stations. This is adding up to a ""pretty bleak picture for drivers"", the RAC said. The government has put the army on standby to help ease fuel supply problems caused by a shortage of lorry drivers to make deliveries. The RAC said that the average price of a litre of petrol across the UK increased from 135.87p on Friday to 136.59p on Sunday, the highest level since September 2013. The motoring organisation warned that prices could rise further as retailers pass on the cost of rising wholesale prices. The wholesale price of petrol rose from 123.25p on Monday last week to 125.22p just four days later. Oil prices slumped at the start of the coronavirus pandemic, but demand has been rising in recent months as economies around the world have started to reopen. Global oil supplies have also taken a hit from hurricanes Ida and Nicholas passing through the Gulf of Mexico and damaging US oil infrastructure. The price of Brent crude oil rose above $80 a barrel on Tuesday for the first time since October 2018. Army put on standby to ease fuel crisis RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said: ""When it comes to pump prices, it's a pretty bleak picture for drivers. ""With the cost of oil rising and now near a three-year high, wholesale prices are being forced up which means retailers are paying more than they were just a few days ago for the same amount of fuel. ""This has led to the price of a litre of unleaded already going up by a penny since Friday. ""We might yet see higher forecourt prices in the coming days, irrespective of the current supply problems. ""We are also aware of a small number of retailers taking advantage of the current delivery situation by hiking prices, so we'd remind drivers to always compare the price they're being asked to pay with the current UK averages which are 136.69p for petrol and 138.58p for diesel."" There is a national shortage of lorry drivers, which haulage firms have blamed on factors including Covid and Brexit. The lack of drivers has been affecting businesses from food firms to petrol stations. Demand for fuel has been such that between 50% and 90% of pumps were dry in some areas of Britain, according the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA). The industry group represents independent fuel retailers who account for 65% of all the 8,380 UK forecourts. There have been claims on social media that some petrol stations are taking advantage of the surge in demand to inflate prices. Twitter user Trevor Lakin said,externalthat Shell was ""marking prices up and profiteering"" after charging 148.9p a litre at a petrol station. A Shell spokeswoman said that about half of Shell's UK network is owned by independent dealers who set their own prices. ""We are only able to control prices at the sites we own,"" she said, adding that ""Shell is prevented by law from telling dealer groups what to charge their customers for fuel."" Howard Cox, founder of campaign group FairFuelUK, said price rises of between 5p and 10p per litre have become ""the norm in the last few days"".

Why are there petrol queues?,"Only 127 petrol tanker drivers from the EU have applied for temporary visas to help tackle the petrol crisis, according to the prime minister. The government is offering 300 short-term visas for overseas drivers. Meanwhile, military personnel have started driving fuel tankers to help resupply petrol stations. The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) - which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 filling stations - says the worst-affected areas have seen a ""marginal"" improvement but still face a ""challenging"" time. It said about a fifth of forecourts in London and south-east England were out of fuel on Monday. But elsewhere in Britain, that figure was 8% and there had been a ""marked"" improvement, the association said. Last week the government said it would offertemporary visas for 5,000 overseas HGV drivers- including 300 immediate visas for tanker drivers. But Boris Johnson told BBC Breakfast that so faronly 127 European Union fuel drivers have appliedfor the scheme. He said the low number of applicants reflected a ""global"" issue causing ""a particular problem in the UK"". He blamed long-standing underinvestment in pay and driver facilities. Separately, about 200 Army and RAF personnel - including 100 drivers -will help deliver fuelto forecourts in the hardest-hit areas, including London and south-east England. They have been given training in safety procedures, equipment and forecourt driving manoeuvres. Other measures include: A suspension of competition law between oil firms, which the government said would make it easier for companies to share information and prioritise areas most in need The process for getting an HGV driver licence will be sped up,external, and nearly one million letters have been sent to existing HGV drivers to encourage them back into the industry, plus there are plans to train 4,000 others The doctors' body the BMA, the teachers' union NASUWT and some politicians including London Mayor Sadiq Khan wantedkey workers to be given priority accessto petrol stations to avoid disruption to essential services. However, the government hasn't announced plans to prioritise key workers as it didwith nursery and school places during the pandemic,external. Key workers struggling to travel amid fuel crisis The government has powers to limit how much fuel drivers can buy, and the hours when they can buy it, but hasn't used them so far. Some petrol stations have introduced a Â£30 cap on the amount of petrol people can buy. Petrol station worker: 'We're not trained for this' Driver 'pulls knife' during fuel dispute On 23 September,BP warned it would have to ""temporarily"" close a handful of its petrol stations, because of a lack of drivers. Long queues started to build up outside stations across Great Britain in the following days, amid fears that fuel might run out. Oil companies have stressed there is plenty of petrol available. However, the key issue is there aren't enough drivers to deliver it to forecourts. There's an estimated shortage of more than 100,000 HGV drivers, which has already caused problems for a range of retailers - from supermarkets to fast food chains. Fuel tanker driversneed additional safety qualifications,externalon top of their HGV licence to be able to transport chemicals such as petrol. There are a number of reasons - and many countries across Europe have been affected - but the UK has been especially badly hit. After Brexit, many European drivers returned to their home countries, or moved elsewhere, because working in the UK involved additional border bureaucracy which had an impact on their income. The pandemic saw even more drivers return to their home countries, with few coming back. Meanwhile, some older drivers have retired, and there's a huge backlog in HGV driver tests due to Covid. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? Petrol pricesare at an eight-year high,external. According to the latest weekly statistics, the average petrol price at UK forecourts on Monday was 136.1p a litre, up from 135.19p a week earlier. The price of a litre of diesel rose 137.95p to 139.2p over the same period. Simon Williams of the RAC said the increase was largely down to the rising price of oil rather than the recent supply problems.

What's in short supply and why?,"Turkey and pigs in blankets could be hard to find this Christmas Shortages are the only thing we don't seem to be running out of in the UK right now. If you can manage to buy a car, then you might have trouble filling it with petrol, although there are signs that the fuel supply crisis is easing. Drive to the shops, though,and you might find you can't get all the groceries you want. Christmas is coming, but times are getting lean: chocolates and pigs in blankets could be hard to find, just like toys, turkeys and trees. Here's a list of some of the worst shortages and the reasons for them. Let's start with one that has an easy explanation. Global vehicle production has been hit by a shortage of microchips. Now that every new car is practically a computer on wheels, semiconductor chips are essential to keeping those production lines running. But during the coronavirus pandemic, carmakers shut down, so microchip manufacturers diverted the chips that would normally go into those cars to the consumer electronics market. With fewer new cars for sale, sought-after second-hand motors have shot up in price. And car industry figures say the supply crisis is unlikely to end soon. Earlier this month, Ola KÃ¤llenius, the head of Germany's Daimler and Mercedes-Benz, told the BBC thatthe chip shortage could continueinto 2022 and even 2023. As for petrol, the government has been keen to stress that there never was an actual shortage of petrol in the UK - there were just problems with getting it from the refineries to the petrol stations. Those were caused by a shortage of heavy goods drivers to make deliveries, with the coronavirus pandemic, Brexit and tax changes all contributing to a lack of qualified drivers. Industry bodies estimatethere is a shortfall of about 100,000. But the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) now says availability has improved in London and the South East, where fuel was hardest to come by. In the run-up to Christmas, there is always a mad rush by parents to secure the latest must-have toy for their offspring. But this year, the hunt is likely to be even more frustrating, especially for kit that involves cutting-edge technology. For instance, the same chip shortage that is curbing car supplies has been keenly felt by video gamers desperate to get their hands on Sony's PlayStation 5 console. You might have to go to Hong Kong to get your hands on a PS5 The device has been hard to find all year. In theory, it retails at Â£449, but it is out of stock everywhere and can occasionally be glimpsed commanding far higher prices online. The PlayStation, along with about 70% of the world's toys, is made in China - and the cost of getting supplies to the UK has gone up hugely. Containers are scarce in Asia, because of the effects of the pandemic on international supply chains, so shipping charges are now 10 times higher. And if you can find containers, shipping times have doubled, meaning there is less time available to get toys into shops before the festive season. The Toy Retailers Association has said shoppers may struggle to find what they want, while John Lewis saysit is chartering a fleet of extra shipsto make sure it has Christmas stock on time. One of the UK's biggest toy retailers, The Entertainer, is warning that delays at UK ports will result in shortages this Christmas, because it will be harder to get stock to the right places at the right time. Barbie dolls and Paw Patrol toys are among the children's favourites that the firm expects to sell out fast. The poultry trade is also hard hit by the labour shortage, with the British Poultry Council estimating there are nearly 7,000 vacancies across the sector. Farmers are warning ofa Christmas turkey shortagebecause visa changes to allow labour recruitment from abroad have come too late. And the ""perfect storm"" of labour shortages, shipping costs and post-Brexit labour regulations could also lead to a scarcity of Christmas trees this year. Imported Christmas trees could be held up by shipping costs According to the British Christmas Tree Growers Association, between eight and 10 million real trees are sold in the UK each year. But between one million and three million of those are imported from elsewhere in Europe. Now those supplies could be set for the chop, pushing up prices for home-grown trees. The UK's shortage of lorry drivers means that supermarkets are getting fewer deliveries of everything than they used to, so when they sell out of a particular product, it now takes longer for them to fill that gap on the shelf. That includes chocolate and other confectionery. Large quantities of sweets are an essential indulgence for many families at Christmas, but some of the most popular selections might be absent from store shelves in the run-up to the festive season. Nestle, which makes Quality Street as well as Aero and KitKat, has said it is experiencing some supply chain problems - again caused by the UK's shortage of HGV lorry drivers and global shipping issues. The Swiss-based multinational is the world's largest producer of dairy products, but it's not the only firm in its sector that has been hit. Dairy giant Arla, which supplies milk to all major UK supermarkets, has been forced to cut back on its deliveries by the lack of lorry drivers. The firm has been experiencing driver shortages since early April and there is no end in sight to the problem. It normally delivers to 2,400 stores a day, but now cannot deliver to all of them every day. However, it says it is working closely with customers to make sure supplies get through. At the same time, at least one dairy farmer has saidhe was told to dump his milkafter the lorry driver shortage meant it could not be collected. Among other grocery items sometimes missing from supermarket shelves right now, shoppers are finding they can't always buy their favourite cuts of meat. Since the UK's departure from the European Union, the food sector, like many others, has been struggling to cope with a loss of workers after many eastern Europeans went home. Pig farmers have been particularly badly affected - they say they are worried they will not be able to sell their animals this year, because of staff shortages in abattoirs. Farmers have told the BBC they have slaughter-ready pigs waiting to be sent to butchers. However, a lack of trained staff to turn the pigs into food for customers means some risk being killed and sent to landfill instead. And not only is there a problem with pork supply, but the production of pigs in blankets - cocktail sausages wrapped in bacon - is suffering from a lack of seasonal EU labour. A number of food industry bodies have warned of panic-buying this Christmas unless action is taken to address those labour shortages. They include the British Meat Processors Association (BMPA), which says it has traditionally found it difficult to attract British workers. A BMPA spokesperson told the BBC that labour shortages were ""perennial"", but added: ""Since Brexit and following the pandemic, the problem has become much worse. ""Industries are now competing with each other for a dwindling pool of workers and the current labour crisis has seen workers in strategically important sectors like food manufacture and social care being enticed away by other sectors that can afford to hike wages 20% or 30%. ""To restore some balance in the labour market, every employer, including the public sector, may have to follow suit, but it will mean consumer price inflation."" Building materials have been running short in the UK, leaving DIY projects in doubt and putting construction firms under pressure. Timber prices in particular have been soaring, pushed up by shipping issues, supply chain problems and post-Brexit import rules. Meanwhile, supplies of cement, plasterboard and insulation are being rationed by manufacturers, according to builders' merchant Jewson. Despite the supply squeeze, the UK construction industry is literally building back after the worst of the pandemic, but the shortages are leading to massive delays and significant price rises. One builder told the BBCthat a home extension previously costing Â£20,000 currently costs about Â£26,000. But maybe your home is already big enough for you and you just want some new furniture. Even there, you could be out of luck. Ikea, the world's biggest furniture company, sources a quarter of its products from China, while raw materials for its furniture are also running short. So it too is facing supply chain problems, which it expects to continue into next year.

"Army put on standby to ease fuel crisisMilitary drivers will be trained up as a precaution, after days of long queues and pump closures.UK","There were queues at many petrol stations on Monday, including in Friern Barnet, north London The Army is ready to help ease fuel supply problems after a fourth day of long queues and pump closures. Up to 150 military tanker drivers will prepare to deliver to forecourts which have run dry because of panic buying. The surge in demand came amid fears a driver shortage would hit fuel supply - which is plentiful at refineries. The transport secretary said there were ""tentative signs"" of stabilisation in petrol stations and queues would start to reflect this in the coming days. Grant Shapps said: ""Once we all return to our normal buying habits... the quicker we get back to normality."" The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""early signs"" the pressure on petrol stations was starting to ease, The organisation, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said around 37% of its sites had run out of fuel. That is a big improvement on the situation on Sunday, when two-thirds had run dry. ""With regular restocks taking place, this percentage [of petrol stations with fuel] is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours,"" it added in a statement. Why are there long queues for petrol in the UK? Outlook bleak as petrol prices surge, says RAC 'I'm at an Airbnb this week to avoid fuel queues' UK visa plan will not fix lorry crisis, says boss The UK is estimated to be short of more than 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The government has said people needlessly buying fuel has led to queues at many forecourts, with fuel running out in some places. But there are growing calls for key workers, such as health and social care staff, to receive priority access to available fuel after some reported not being able to get to work due to the supply issues. Daniyal Ahsan, a junior doctor in London, told the BBC he went to 17 petrol stations after work on Monday in search of fuel - but wasn't able to get any, leaving him concerned about how this would affect his patients. He has since been able to fill up his car. Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of UK Homecare Association, warned that some people who depend on carers for tasks like taking pain medication could die if they are left without help. Roger Grosvenor, of the East of England Co-op petrol stations, told the BBC the group would create a daily priority hour for emergency workers if fuel supply problems had not eased by Thursday. Motoring group the RAC said the price of a litre of unleaded petrol had risen by a penny since Friday to an eight-year high - and knew a small number of retailers had been hiking prices amid the soaring demand. It added it had seen a ""sharp increase"" in the number of drivers who had broken down after running out of fuel - with engineers attending twice as many breakdowns on Monday than it would normally see over a whole week. The AA motoring organisation said it had seen a ""dramatic rise"" in motorists putting the wrong fuel in vehicles compared to last weekend. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the move to place the Army on standby was a ""sensible, precautionary step"" and if troops had to be deployed, they would temporarily ""provide the supply chain with additional capacity"" to ease the pressure caused by increased fuel demand. The BBC has been told that 75 military drivers are on standby initially, and another 75 could be added if needed. They require up to five days of specialised training. Huw Merriman, a Conservative MP and chairman of the transport select committee, said readying the army was a ""good example"" of ministers trying to use as many levers at their disposal as possible, and would be used as a ""last resort"" if the situation did not stabilise in the next couple of days. But Mr Merriman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the industry must explain how it planned to fix long-standing driver shortages rather than having the government constantly step in. ""These problems have been there for years because the average age of the driver is 55 years old, they're retiring, and the industry has not made this job attractive. For too long, working conditions have been poor, and those that are willing to tolerate it have been from abroad."" It is hoped that with many cars now holding more fuel than usual, demand will return to normal levels soon The government has also authorised an extension to special driver licences that allow drivers to transport goods such as fuel. ADR licences due to expire between 27 September and 31 December will have their validity extended until 31 January 2022, without refresher training or exams. Labour said the latest response to the fuel crisis was ""an admission of failure"" and that asking the Army to step up was ""a sticking plaster"". Leading fuel companies, including BP and Shell, have sought to reassure the public that supplies remain unaffected at source. In a joint statement, they said that given ""many cars are now holding more fuel than usual"" they expected demand would ""return to its normal levels in the coming days"". This video can not be played Key workers and essential trips affected by panic buying Doctors, nurses, and unions for teachers, prison and care staff have called for essential workers to be given priority for fuel. Some ambulance trusts have their own fuel pumps in depots and their supplies are expected to be prioritised - but essential workers can still be caught out. Unison urged ministers to ""designate fuel stations for the sole use of key workers"" while the NASUWT union called for teachers to be prioritised to safeguard children's education. But the headteachers' union NAHT said prioritising key workers for fuel was ""not a sensible solution as it would be impossible to enforce and could cause more chaos on the forecourts"". And Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said trying to decide who was and was not an emergency worker and how they would prove this in petrol stations was ""very complex"" and ""hopefully"" a last resort. Asked about the prospect of priority for key workers, Mr Shapps said he would keep a ""close eye"" on the situation and the government would do ""whatever it takes"". Elsewhere, Carol Curry, who needed fuel to drive her husband to a hospital appointment, said she blamed the media for frenzied scenes at the pumps. ""If nobody had said about this, the lorry drivers and everything, then this panic wouldn't have started,"" she said. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The government hastemporarily exempted fuel companies from competition law,allowing them to work together to target supplies at areas most in need. Temporary visas lasting until Christmas Eve for 5,000 foreign fuel tanker and food lorry drivers, and 5,500 poultry workers,have also been announced. Nearly one million drivers qualified to drive heavy goods vehicles are being encouraged to rejoin the sector, and some 3,000 new recruits are expected to undertake short, intensive driving courses. Factors including Brexit, the pandemic, pay levels and an aging workforce have all contributed to a shortage of lorry drivers. After the UK left the EU, many European drivers returned to their home countries, or decided to work elsewhere because of the additional border bureaucracy and the impact it had on their income. The pandemic also prompted many foreign drivers to return home and led to a huge backlog in HGV driver exams. Driver shortages have also been seen in EU countries, including Germany and Poland.

NHS Highland pays out millions to bullied staff,"NHS Highland says it expects to pay Â£3.4m in settlements to current and former staff who have complained of bullying. Whistleblowers exposed a ""culture of bullying"" at NHS Highland in 2018. A Scottish government-commissioned review suggested hundreds of health workers may have experienced inappropriate behaviour. So far 150 cases have been settled since the start of a ""healing process"", costing the health board more than Â£2m. The cost was detailed in a report to a meeting of NHS Highland's boardon Tuesday,external. The independent review panel which assessed the 150 complaints said two cases involved settlements of between Â£60,000 and Â£95,000, while 61 involved payments of between Â£5,000 and Â£15,000. Whistleblower Brian Devlin told BBC Scotland the scale of settlements made so far was ""heartening"", but he added that he continued to have concerns about bullying at the health board. Bullying 'remains a concern' at NHS Highland 'Bullied' worker was told job 'no longer existed' 'Healing process' offered to bullied NHS staff A group of Highlands GPs first complained of a culture of bullying at NHS Highlandin September 2018. An independent review by lawyer John Sturrock QC the following year found there werepotentially hundreds of people who had experienced bullying at the health board. The review was contacted by 340 people from most departments, services and occupations at NHS Highland. More than 280 took part in face-to-face meetings or made written submissions. The majority - 66% - reported bullying experiences. Staff said they had not felt valued, respected or supported in carrying out ""very stressful work"". Others told of not being listened to when raising matters regarding patient safety concerns and decisions being made ""behind closed doors"". The review also said that ""many described a culture of fear and of protecting the organisation when issues are raised"". Jeane Freeman, the health secretary at the time, apologised and said other health boards should learn lessons. She said the culture at the health board had been unacceptable, and she supported the review's recommendations. These included educating all staff on the effects of bullying and providing a ""properly functioning, clear, safe and respected wholly independent and confidential whistleblowing"" mechanism. Jeane Freeman ordered the independent review into allegation of bullying when she was health secretary In a report to Tuesday's board meeting, officials said the final settlement total was expected to run to Â£3.4m. They said this was lower than an earlier anticipated cost of Â£4.2m, and added that funding provided by Scottish government ""should be sufficient"" to cover the settlements. Mr Devlin, a former director of corporate affairs at NHS Highland and himself a victim of bullying in the organisation, said: ""What's heartening is that we are seeing the results of a healing process that was created by the Scottish government and victims of bullying. ""It came about because of the leadership of the then cabinet secretary for health, Jeane Freeman."" But Mr Devlin said he had heard some bullying ""persists"" at the health board. NHS Highland said it did not tolerate bullying and its healing process was a ""unique and bespoke process, developed to support people to in recovery"". It offers psychological therapies, apologies as well as financial payments. Almost 300 people have been supported through the process, according to the health board. Fiona Hogg, director of people and culture at NHS Highland, said: ""The nature of the process is that it hears the participants perspective and account only, it doesn't seek to allocate fault or blame, so it's entirely different to internal processes and tribunals, which seek to establish that. ""It's all about healing and what will best aid that process.""

Damaging levels of drugs in Glastonbury riverA study finds MDMA concentrations had quadrupled the week after the festival in July 2019.Somerset,"Festivalgoers are urged to use the official toilets provided Environmentally damaging levels of drugs have been found in the river running through the Glastonbury Festival site. Scientists have warned there are ""dangerous"" levels of MDMA and cocaine in the Whitelake River in Somerset. They suspect public urination has caused the increase and urged festival goers to use the toilets provided. Researchers fear it could derail the conservation efforts of rare European eels in the area. Measurements both upstream and downstream of the site were taken before, during and after the festival in 2019. The study found MDMA concentrations quadrupled the week after the festival, suggesting long-term release from the site. ""Peeing on the land"" is strongly discouraged, organisers said A spokesman for Glastonbury Festival said the Environment Agency had not raised any concerns with them on the matter following the 2019 event. He said: ""Protecting our local streams and wildlife is of paramount importance to us at Glastonbury Festival and we have a thorough and successful waterways sampling regime in place during each festival, as agreed with the Environment Agency. ""We are aware that the biggest threat to our waterways - and the wildlife for which they provide a habitat - comes from festivalgoers urinating on the land."" It does not condone the use of illegal drugs and continues to ""successfully strongly discourage"" public urination, he added. ""We are keen to see full details of this new research, and would be very happy to work with the researchers,"" the spokesman said. Dr Christian Dunn, from Bangor University, said: ""Our main concern is the environmental impact. This study identifies that drugs are being released at levels high enough to disrupt the lifecycle of the European eel. ""We [also] need to raise awareness around drug and pharmaceutical waste - it is a hidden, worryingly-understudied yet potentially devastating pollutant."" Dan Aberg, a Masters student in the School of Natural Sciences at the university, added: ""Illicit drug contamination from public urination happens at every music festival. ""Unfortunately, Glastonbury Festival's close proximity to a river results in any drugs released by festival attendees having little time to degrade in the soil before entering the fragile freshwater ecosystem."" Further studies into possible treatment via environmentally friendly methods in order to minimise the release and impact of illicit drugs from festivals have been suggested.

Starmer in row with left over minimum wage rise,"Labour members have voted in favour of a Â£15 per hour minimum wage amid a row over the policy at its conference. The vote is not binding, but comes after MP Andy McDonald resigned from shadow cabinet, saying he had been ordered to argue against the rise. The leadership did not encourage members to back or reject the motion. But earlier, Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News he stood by the party's current policy of raising the minimum wage to ""at least"" Â£10 an hour. Left-wingers - including former leader Jeremy Corbyn - had called on Sir Keir to back to larger rise. Mr Corbyn told the BBC it was something the party ""should be supporting and campaigning for"". Starmer: Winning more important than party unity Shadow cabinet member quits in protest at Starmer Labour promises to get more police on the beat Arguments between the left, including supporters of Mr Corbyn, and Labour members loyal to Sir Keir have dominated the party conference in Brighton. Sir Keir pushed through reforms to the party election rules,seen as unfavourable to left-wing members of Labour,in a vote on Sunday. This video can not be played Andy McDonald MP: ""Is it unreasonable to expect our key workers not to have that level of pay?"" The Unite union put forward a motion calling for the minimum wage to increase to Â£15 to a vote on Tuesday. The current minimum wage is Â£8.91 for those 23 and over, Â£8.36 for those aged 21 and 22, and Â£6.56 for 18 to 20-year olds. What is the minimum wage? The wide-ranging Unite motion also said that, for Labour to win the next election, it ""must be an anti-austerity party, defending jobs and improving living standards"". Labour pledges Â£28bn a year to make economy greener Labour: Has Starmer stood by his pledges? And it included demands for stronger union rights, higher taxes ""on the very wealthiest"", an end to zero-hour contracts and a ""better work-life balance"". But asked about the wage rise earlier, Sir Keir said: ""It should be a Â£10 minimum wage - that's a 12% increase [meaning] Â£2000 a year for working families."" Before the vote, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the party leadership was ""perfectly happy"" for conference delegates to back the Â£15 motion. However, he said Labour would only reassess its current policy closer to the next general election, adding this was the ""responsible thing to do"". But Mr Corbyn called for the party to commit to a Â£6 an hour rise in the minimum wage now. Speaking at a fringe event alongside Labour's conference, the former leader told the BBC: ""We live in a low-wage economy and a low-wage economy leads to poverty. We live in a society now with more food banks than branches of McDonald's. That's where we have got to."" Mr Corbyn also praised Mr McDonald, saying he had ""huge admiration"" for the MP, adding: ""He went through a lot of trauma [on Monday] because he did not in all conscience feel he could go and say that he was opposed to Â£15 minimum wage because he is not. ""He supports it, so he took the decision he did to resign. I fully support him."" Sir Keir was a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet during the run-up to the 2019 election Raising the minimum wage was not one of the 10 pledges Sir Keir made when running for the Labour leadership last year. But he supported a campaign in 2019 for fast food chain McDonald's to improve pay and conditions. At the time, he said: ""They're not asking for the Earth. They're asking for the basics - Â£15 an hour, the right to know their hours in advance and to have trade union recognition. That ought to be the norm in 21st Century Britain."" But on Tuesday, Sir Keir said his comments were in relation to ""particular industrial disputes at McDonald's"", adding: ""I backed them in that and I'd back them again today in relation to that the minimum wage, [but] across the whole of the economy is a completely different issue."" In a scathing resignation letter, Mr McDonald claimed the leader's office had instructed him go to a meeting at the party conference and ""argue against a national minimum wage of Â£15 an hour and against statutory sick pay at the living wage"". ""After many months of a pandemic when we made commitments to stand by key workers, I cannot now look those same workers in the eye and tell them they are not worth a wage that is enough to live on, or that they don't deserve security when they are ill,"" the former shadow employment secretary added. Mr Corbyn also backed the so-called ""McStrike"" in 2019, but his policy as leader was for at least Â£10 minimum wage - also Labour's current position.

Key workers struggling to travel,"Panic buying at petrol stations has led to some key workers struggling to get the fuel they need to travel to their work. The surge in demand for fuel came after fears lorry driver shortages would hit supplies of petrol and diesel. Doctors and unions representing teachers and carers have called for key workers to get priority at the pumps. One hospice in Oldhamtweeted,externalthat it was in ""urgent need"" of petrol for its cars. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Rosemary Botting, who runs Karosel Care and Domestic Services in West Sussex, told the BBC that if two of her carers were still unable to find a station with fuel ahead of their next shift, they would be unable to tend to ""vulnerable"" service users. Ms Botting said if the current crisis wasn't resolved by next week, then she envisaged her care company would be in breach of safeguarding guidelines to its 12 customers. ""We will be putting our service users at risk,"" she said. ""We would not be able to send a carer out to somebody."" Ms Botting said her staff helped people living in rural areas throughout west Sussex, which meant driving - and a tank full of fuel - was essential. One of her carers was half an hour late to her first call in because of traffic caused by queues at petrol stations, she said, which meant her first patient, who cannot get out of bed unaided, remained there until she arrived. ""I have got to inform all the other service users that their carer is running half an hour late. We pride ourselves on being on time,"" she said. ""We got through Covid. Not a single user in our care contracted Covid. The reason I do this job is because I care. It's just a bit of a nightmare at the moment."" Colin McDonald fears hospital appointments could be cancelled Colin McDonald, an orthopaedic registrar at a district general hospital in the East Midlands, told the BBC that if fuel supply issues continued, and he couldn't to travel to work, there could be delays to patient surgeries at the start of his shifts, which could then delay his fracture clinics in the afternoon. ""This could lead to cancellations,"" he said. ""If patients live far away from the clinic they may not be able to get in, staff may not be able to get in."" Mr McDonald said he had been worried about not being able to get fuel on Sunday, but managed to buy some petrol which had been kept aside for key workers at a petrol station on Monday. ""Seeing people fill up multiple jerry cans of fuel - I just don't understand what their mentality is,"" he said. ""I find it very difficult to comprehend. It appears very selfish... they are just looking after themselves and not really considering the needs of others and key workers."" Andrew Wagstaff, a civil servant from Nuneaton, Warwickshire, left his home at 04:45 BST to hunt for fuel to make his 57-mile trip to work. After finding all petrol stations closed in his area, he finally got fuel at Watford Gap service station. However, he said prices had been hiked to 157.9p per litre for diesel, which described as ""ridiculous"". ""It cost me Â£65 to fill up three quarters of a tank,"" he said. ""I do an essential job. It's frustrating that people - who are not essential workers - are just panicking for no reason."" Andrew Wagstaff said people were panicking for no reason Most bus and coach services have not been affected by the fuel supply issues, according to the Confederation of Passenger Transport. Meanwhile, the Petrol Retailers Association (PRA), which represents 5,500 out of the UK's 8,000 filling stations,said there were ""early signs"" the crisis was ""ending, with more of our members reporting that they are now taking further deliveries of fuel"". ""Fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, although deliveries have been reduced due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" said PRA executive director Gordon Balmer. ""We have conducted a survey of our members this morning and only 37% of forecourts have reported being out of fuel today. With regular restocks taking place, this percentage is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours"".

Why is there a driver shortage?,"The government is taking a number of steps to address the shortage of HGV drivers, amid concerns about deliveries of food, fuel and other items in the run-up to Christmas. It hasintroduced temporary visasfor 5,000 lorry drivers to work in the UK, although only just over 20 of the 300 applications have been approved so far, according to Conservative Party chairman Oliver Dowden. The shortage of HGV drivers is due to a combination of Covid, Brexit and other factors. A Road Haulage Association (RHA) survey of its members estimates there is now a shortage of more than 100,000 qualified drivers in the UK. That number includes thousands of drivers from European Union (EU) member states who were previously living and working in the UK. TheAnnual Population Survey,externalproduced by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) estimates that there were 16,000 fewer EU nationals working as HGV drivers in the year ending March 2021, than in the previous year. Even before Covid, the overall estimated shortage was about 60,000 drivers. Covid is certainly part of the problem. As travel became increasingly restricted last year, and large parts of the economy shut down, many European drivers went home. And haulage companies say very few have returned. The pandemic also created a large backlog in HGV driver tests, so it has been impossible to get enough new drivers up and running. The industrywarned the prime minister,externalin June that there were 25,000 fewer candidates passing their test in 2020 than in 2019. There are HGV driver shortages across Europe, but in the UK Brexit has made things worse. Many European drivers who went back to their home countries, or decided to work elsewhere, are unable to return. When the UK was part of the EU single market, they used to be able to come and go as they pleased. But new immigration rules mean that is no longer the case. There is also new bureaucracy, and the decline in the value of the pound against the euro since the Brexit vote has made working in the UK less attractive for EU nationals. The strain on the freight transport system comes before Britain imposes checks on goods coming in from the EU. They have now been delayed until next year - some in January, others in July. If they prove too intrusive, that could make it even more difficult to encourage European drivers to work in this country. Many drivers are paid by the mile or kilometre rather than by the hour, so delays cost them money. There have also been tax changes making it more expensive for drivers from elsewhere in Europe to work or be employed in the UK. The reform of the IR35 rules - on how people working off the payroll pay tax - are designed to prevent workers setting up limited companies and paying less tax and National Insurance while working, in effect, as an employee. Haulage companies say the average age of HGV drivers in the UK is 55, and they want more to be done to attract younger workers. Why is there a shortage of lorry drivers? Backlash against longer hours for lorry drivers That includes better terms and conditions, better facilities for long distance drivers to use, and a recognition that they are a vital part of the economy. One consequence of shortages, though, has been thatsome wages for driversare already going up. According to data collected by Transport Intelligence, Poland was short of more than 120,000 drivers last year, while in Germany between 45,000 and 60,000 were needed. New figures are expected in the coming weeks. But shortages in other countries are having less impact than in the UK. Other European countries can call upon a much larger pool of labour in the EU single market, with the guarantee of free movement. In the UK, that flexibility is no longer available, and the labour shortage is affecting other industries as well - from food processing to fruit picking. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Like other parts of the UK, Northern Ireland is short of HGV drivers but there haven't been fuel shortages because it is not experiencing the same acute problems with tanker drivers. Northern Ireland was less reliant on drivers from the EU so has been less impacted by those workers no longer being available. An industry source says tanker driving tends to have better pay and working hours, so it is sought after by local drivers. Geography also works in Northern Ireland's favour - it's not much more than 100 miles wide so supply chains can't get as stretched as they are in the rest of the UK. As well as allowing more foreign workers into the UK, Ministry of Defence examiners will be brought in to increase the number of HGV driving tests. There will befree intensive 'boot camps',externalto train 5,000 people to become HGV drivers, with another 1,000 to be trained through courses funded by the adult education budget. The government is also writing to nearly one million drivers who hold an HGV licence to encourage them to return to the industry. There have been warnings about fruit and vegetable deliveries because of driver shortages It has also slightly relaxed the Drivers' Hours rules, which means drivers will be able to increase their daily driving limit from nine hours to 11 hours twice a week. There is Â£7,000 per person funding for the Large Goods Vehicle Driver apprenticeship scheme. Andthe government is consultingon a temporary weakening of the rules on what is called cabotage. Cabotage refers to whether a foreign HGV driver arriving in the UK is allowed to make collections and deliveries in the country before returning to their own countries. It's proposing to allow unlimited deliveries in a 14-day period. The Road Haulage Associationopposes this,external, because it will mean non-UK haulage companies can take work in the UK, as opposed to foreign HGV drivers working for UK haulage companies.

Unlocking options 'limited' by jab passport delay,"Robin Swann is frustrated over plans to introduce a vaccine passport A delay by the executive in agreeing a Covid-19 vaccine certification policy has ""significantly limited"" the options for easing restrictions, the health minister has said. In a letter to the first and deputy first ministers, Robin Swann said he was frustrated by the lack of progress. He asked as a ""matter of urgency"" that the Executive Office brings forward a paper ""without further delay"". He said people would lose out if that did not happen. The absence of vaccine certification could leave them disadvantaged ""when they travel to neighbouring jurisdictions where such schemes are mandatory"", he said in the letter, which has been obtained by BBC News NI. On Monday, plans to end social distancing restrictions in a number of indoor settings were announced. While venues will be asked to put mitigations in place such as proof of vaccination, this will not be a legal requirement. ""Such provisions on a voluntary or mandatory basis could assist the relaxation of remaining restrictions on live entertainment and hospitality,"" said Mr Swann. In a statement on Tuesday, he said he wanted a ""domestic vaccine certification scheme to be in place, on the books, available for use as soon as necessary"". Mr Swann said he had asked as far back as 22 April for the Executive Office to create a cross-departmental working group to bring forward domestic vaccine certification. ""The parties that have been most vocal in recent days advocating for the introduction of domestic use certification had until then also shown no actual interest in helping me to pursue a policy decision,"" he said. ""How that tallies with their public pronouncements of recent days is a matter for them to explain."" What Covid rules remain in Northern Ireland? BBC News NI's economics and business editor John Campbell said Mr Swann wanted the option of domestic vaccine certificates in circumstances such as poor adherence levels or as an alternative to introducing fresh restrictions if there was a surge in Covid-19 cases. He added that the health minister, a member of the Ulster Unionist Party, felt there was ""ideological reluctance"" to introduce mandatory vaccine passes on the part of some of his ministerial colleagues.

The news comes as Scotland has announced its new vaccine passport system will not be enforced until two weeks after it is introduced. The new system, which would mean people going to nightclubs and other large events would have to provide proof of two vaccine doses, was due to start from 05:00 on Friday but a grace period until 18 October has been announced. Meanwhile it has emerged that the Department of Health has allocated Â£10.5m to cover costs related to vaccination certificates if such a policy was supported by the executive. Joanne Stuart, chief executive of Northern Ireland Tourism Alliance, told BBC News NI on Tuesday that dropping social distancing measures in indoor seated venues without making vaccine certification mandatory could be difficult. ""Taking a route of 'it's not legislation, this is guidance' is just confusing for everybody,"" she said. Colum Eastwood said vaccine passport legislation could have increased vaccine uptake SDLP leader Colum Eastwood said Monday's executive meeting, where it was decided to ease social distancing rules, had been a ""moment to act"" to introduce a vaccine certification scheme. Previously, Sinn FÃ©in said it would support a proposal for vaccine passports to gain access to pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland if it was recommended by Stormont health officials. Anne McReynolds, chief executive of the MAC theatre in Belfast, said all of her colleagues in the sector were pleased with Monday's announcement about social distancing. However, she said the move was ""just one step forward"" and it may be years before business as usual fully resumes. Thechanges will take effect from 18:00 BST on 30 September.

But pubs and restaurants will still have to enforce social distancing. Covid distancing in shops and theatres scrapped Big demand as high street voucher site opens Michael McAdam, managing director of Movie House Cinemas, said people who wanted to maintain social distancing ""can book the seat either side of them"" if they want to feel safer. He said the announcement was ""great news"", adding that social distancing ""has been an absolute financial nightmare for us"". Colin Neill, chief executive of Hospitality Ulster, said Monday's announcement was ""pragmatic and positive"", and that he hoped to see ""the same level of pragmatism applied to hospitality"". Michael McAdam says people can book extra seats if they want to be distant from other customers England abolished its mandatory social distancing measures on19 July, with a few exceptions for settings like hospitals, care homes and border control posts. Wales lifted its legal requirements on social distancing on7 August, leaving it to individual businesses to decide their own rules after risk assessments. Scotland dropped its social distancing requirements on9 August, but a 2m (6ft) rule remains in place for healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists. Ministers did not consider social distancing in the hospitality sector during Monday's virtual meeting, with First Minister Paul Givan tweeting that hospitality regulations would be discussed on 7 October.

Unionist leaders unite in NI Protocol opposition,"Getting goods across the Irish Sea border involves a range of new processes, checks and documentation The leaders of Northern Ireland's four main unionist parties have signed a joint declaration affirming their opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The UK and EU agreed the protocol in 2019, as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It prevents a hard border in Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. Unionist parties have previously voiced strong opposition to the protocol. Now the leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) and Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) have shared a platform to reinforce that opposition for the first time. Why are there tensions over the NI Brexit deal? Parties divided on UK call to amend NI Protocol The declaration states: ""We, the undersigned unionist political leaders, affirm our opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, its mechanisms and structures and reaffirm our unalterable position that the protocol must be rejected and replaced by arrangements which fully respect Northern Ireland's position as a constituent and integral part of the United Kingdom."" The leaders also appear together in a video. In response, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said there ""cannot be unilateralism"" with threats to invoke Article 16 of the protocol. Article 16 is a safeguard that allows either side to take action if applying the protocol ""leads to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist"". Mr Martin said this would be against the Good Friday Agreement and stressed ""there is a route to getting this resolved"". ""What's extremely important is that we don't do anything to further destabilise the situation,"" he told the DÃ¡il (lower house of the Irish parliament). This five line declaration contains no surprises, nor does it say anything new about how the protocol should be fought. Instead it's meant to affirm that while they disagree on much else the leaders of the DUP, the UUP, the TUV and the PUP are united in opposition to it. In a much longer explanatory note they say the union is both economic and political. Any agreement, they say, which fails to ensure a proportionate and equitable solution respecting the sovereignty of the UK and restoring its unfettered place within the internal market cannot command the support of the unionist community. There has been much talk this week of a unionist pact to fight the forthcoming assembly election but it gets no mention here. The UK has said the protocol's implementation has been ""unbalanced"" and is ""unsustainable"" in its current form and wants fundamental changes to it. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic has said the EU is looking for further flexibilities but will not renegotiate. Earlier in September, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its demands over the Northern Ireland Protocol are not met.

Scammers try to exploit high street voucher scheme,"No one will call at your door or contact you by phone or text about the scheme, said Supt Gerard Pollock Police have urged people to be on the lookout for scams as the Â£100 high street voucher scheme is rolled out. Reports have been received of cold callers arriving at peoples' homes alleging they can help them apply for a voucher. The instances reported so far have occurred in the North Down and Ards council area but are ""very small in number"", police said. Applications for the schemeopened on Monday morning. Supt Gerard Pollock said: ""What they [the scammers] are presenting as or what they are telling the member of the public is that they're going to apply to the scheme for them, take their details and then they will receive the Â£100 voucher to their home address. ""There is no process to do that and there will be no one officially from the Department for the Economy or any official person calling at your home address to take your details in order to register you for the scheme. ""If you're contacted out of the blue, either by phone or by text or by someone you don't know, seeking to get you enrolled for the scheme, that's a clear sign that it might be a scam."" There have been less than 10 reports to police of cold calls relating directly to the voucher scheme, however Supt Pollock said: ""We are conscious that throughout the pandemic we have seen scammers, as new things come online, exploit those as an opportunity to gain, not just financial details, but personal details."" Big demand as high street voucher site opens Q&A: How can I get Â£100 high street voucher card? Warning after 'huge rise' in Covid-19 scams Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said his department was aware this type of scam could happen. ""I will work with the police and my own department will continue with our communication plan to help prevent this and get that message out there that you do not have to give over bank details in any way,"" he said. Commissioner for older people Eddie Lynch warned people to ""be vigilant"" of anyone contacting them about the scheme. ""Nobody will call at your door about this, nobody will ask for bank details, so just ignore them,"" he said. Supt Pollock said all the reports received related to incidents that happened ""towards the end of last week"". ""We haven't received any reports in terms of scams over the weekend or indeed yesterday on the day of the launch,"" he said. Almost 500,000 applications have now been received for the scheme. Everyone aged 18 and over is eligible to apply for a card to use in shops before the end of November. Big demand as high street voucher site opens Q&A: How can I get Â£100 high street voucher card?

The company is investing Â£14m in the permanent base which will be operational early in 2022. Recruitment is already under way with a range of roles including in engineering and data science. Invest Northern Ireland said it had been working with Asos since 2017 and had offered almost Â£1.2m towards the new roles. Asos said the move was part of wider strategic plans for its tech team, which would support the continued expansion of the company. Nick Beighton, chief executive of Asos, said the company was ""continually investing in our technology capabilities"". ""Our new hub will provide us with cutting-edge tech expertise to support future growth. ""Belfast has a wealth of tech talent and we're excited to be establishing a permanent base in such a vibrant city."" Asos 'rips up the playbook' for pandemic boost Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said the announcement was a vote of confidence for Northern Ireland. He said the new jobs would contribute almost Â£6.5m in additional annual salaries to the economy. Mr Lyons said: ""Of the new roles, 130 will participate in my department's pre-employment Assured Skills training programme which will offer the company a pipeline of skilled people over the next three years."" The minister added that the first Assured Skills Academy with Asos, focusing on data engineering and being delivered by South Eastern Regional College, was open for applications. ""I urge anyone who is interested and eligible to apply for this exciting opportunity,"" he said.

Man admits stalking TV star Denise WelchToraq Wyngard set fire to a skip on the driveway of the Loose Women panellist's home in Cheshire.Manchester,"Denise Welch played Natalie Barnes in Coronation Street A man has admitted stalking Loose Women star Denise Welch and setting a fire on her driveway. Toraq Wyngard targeted the actor between 18 September 2020 and 11 February this year, Cheshire Police said. The 63-year-old admitted stalking the TV presenter on the first day of a trial at Chester Crown Court on Monday. He also pleaded guilty to possessing a knife, criminal damage and arson and will be sentenced on 26 October. Wyngard, of Cannon Street in Salford, was found near the home the star shares with her husband Lincoln Townley in Cheshire when police were called to a fire on her driveway on 19 September last year. The blaze had spread from the skip to the garage attached to the property, police said. Officers found Wyngard nearby with a knife in his backpack. In a statement released by police, Welch said she was ""very relieved"" that Wyngard had admitted the offences. ""This has been an incredibly terrifying and stressful time for me and our family,"" she added. ""We are grateful to the fire service for their prompt action saving our house and to the police for their amazing vigilance and support.""

LiveLiveTentative signs fuel situation stabilising - Shapps4 minutes ago,"There are ""early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending,"" according to the Petrol Retailers Association It says 37% of forecourts it represents around the UK are reporting being out of fuel today - and it hopes the rate will fall over the next 24 hours On Monday it had said as many as two-thirds of the 5,500 independent outlets it represents were out of fuel Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also says there are tentative signs the situation is stabilising Prime Minister Boris Johnson urges people to go about their business in the normal way and fill up when they need to The PM rules out giving key workers priority access to fuel - but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says that should happen Petrol prices have hit an eight-year high, the RAC says, due to a rise in the cost of wholesale fuel Edited by James Clarke Thanks for tuning in. Today's live page posts were written by Lauren Turner, Joseph Lee and Hazel Shearing. They were edited by James Clarke and John Hand. We'll be bringing our coverage of the fuel supply issues in Britain to a close for the day shortly. Here's what you need to know if you're just catching up: Parents and children with special needs in Brent, north-west London, felt the impact of the petrol supply issues when their school bus was cancelled this morning. A text message sent at 7:15 BST to parents at the Village School said the service could not run due to panic-buying in the area, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Burcu Akin said she was held up in an hour-long traffic jam, caused by motorists queuing at petrol stations, as she tried to get her autistic 10-year-old daughter to school. âItâs a huge deal for us. Itâs very disruptive for an autistic child. She thinks we are back in Covid,"" she said. âShe will be unsettled all day and will not know what is happening to her this afternoon. I donât even know if my child will get picked up today.â Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister is asked about the range of issues facing the UK - including gas price rises, HGV driver shortages, food shortages and the fuel supply problems - and whether the country was in a crisis. Boris Johnson says: ""What weâve got is a global economy that is recovering from a once-in-a-century pandemic that has caused some particular shortages."" He mentions gas and HGV drivers and says the issues are a ""function of huge global demand"", adding: ""But weâre meeting them."" ""We have all sorts of plans to make sure that as we go forward into the new year we have everything necessary to correct our supply chains and keep things moving,"" the prime minister says. The government didn't have a ""plan"" when it came to lorry drivers as the UK left the European Union, Starmer adds. Speaking about fuel supply issues to Channel 5 News in Brighton, where the Labour Party is holding its conference, he says: ""I wouldn't say that Brexit is to blame. What I would say is that it was inevitable as we exited the EU that we needed a plan to deal with drivers. ""That is obvious whether you voted Remain or voted Leave, and we took that decision years ago."" He adds: ""And here we are with a shortage of drivers which was completely predictable and predicted - and the government hasn't got a plan."" We've just heard from Boris Johnson who has rejected the idea of key workers getting priority access to fuel supplies. But the prime minister should prioritise fuel for key workers and begin issuing visas to lorry drivers from overseas, according to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. The opposition leader tells the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg the government ""is not gripping this"" and that businesses affected by the supply issues, who he spoke to earlier, are ""beyond frustrated"". Sir Keir criticises the government'smeasures to give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers - announced in a bid to limit disruption in the build-up to Christmas. ""At the moment, there aren't enough  visas, and there was some talk this morning on the discussions I had that the visas may not even begin until November,"" he says. ""The prime minister should take that action today, prioritise key workers and start issuing enough visas and for long enough."" Starmer adds: ""The strong view this morning was that the three month visas won't work, they're going to have to be six months visas. But this problem was predictable and predicted and the government has absolutely failed to plan."" Earlier, Labour said it agreed with health and social care workers that they should have priority for fuel supplies. But the prime minister rejects that idea, saying: ""With the situation now stabilising and things getting better on the forecourts, the best thing is that we stabilise it in the normal way."" He blames the apparent panic buying at the petrol pumps on a ""slightly misleading"" leak, which people responded to in a ""totally understandable"" way. Johnson says the shortage of HGV drivers in the fuel sector is ""not very big"". But he adds: ""I donât think people want to fix alll our problems with uncontrolled immigration again."" He says that leads to a ""low-wage, low-skill approach"". Boris Johnson urges the public to ""go about their business in the normal way"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he sympathises with people who have been unable to get fuel, calling it ""frustrating and infuriating"". But he says ""we now are starting to see the situation improve"" with deliveries coming on to the forecourts. He urges people to ""go about their business in the normal way and fill up in the normal way when you need it, and things will start to improve"". The crisis reflects ""shortages around the world"", he says, and says the government has ""got to make sure we have everything in place as the recovery continues"". The prime minister urges people to go about their business normally.  Mark BroadBusiness deployment editor A government source has confirmed reports that 16% of all petrol stations are now fully supplied with fuel, compared with 10% at the weekend during some of the worst of the fuel rush. The source said 40% of petrol stations being fully supplied was a more normal figure before the rush on fuel. While the figures seem to be going in the right direction, it is understood that there are other figures which donât paint a completely positive picture. Drivers who left the UK after Brexit will not be tempted back with the issuing of temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers, the German freight industry says. Frank Huster, chief executive of the German Freight Forwarding and Logistics Association, has told the Reuters news agency: ""The labour market on the European continent has gratefully accepted these workers - they are now lost to re-employment in the United Kingdom."" The shortage of drivers has contributed to the issues at petrol stations across the UK. ""The new UK visa regulations - especially the temporary ones - will not change this,"" says Huster. Mark Drakeford called Boris Johnson's government ""incompetent"" during a speech at the Labour Party conference in Brighton. Wales's first minister has called the UK government'splans to offer temporary visas to foreign lorry drivers""arrogant"" and ""exploitative"". On Saturday, the UK government announced measures to give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers in a bid to limit disruption in the build-up to Christmas. Speaking during First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford says the plan  ""won't work"". ""It is hard to imagine a government that has made a more derisory attempt to solve a problem of their own creation,"" he says, adding that there is a shortage of the drivers because the UK government ""took us out of the European Union where we were previously supplied by drivers"". ""The idea that people are going to be willing to uproot themselves and come back to this country for a matter of weeks only to be told by the UK government they will be discarded again on Christmas Eve when they no longer have a use for them is simply... the arrogance of it is breathtaking,"" he adds. Drakeford claims 800 people have been retrained as HGV drivers through the Welsh government's Redundancy Action Scheme (ReAct) programme since 2015, adding: ""That is not going to be a solution for the short-term problems but neither is a scheme that is so exploitative of others that there is no prospect at all that it can deliver what is needed."" Colin McDonald, a hospital doctor, says patients could miss out on appointments Hospital doctor Colin McDonald says he was worried he might not be able to travel to work because of the problems with fuel supplies on Sunday. But the next day he managed to fill up on petrol that had been set aside for key workers. It was hard to understand people who were stocking up with large amounts of fuel in cans,he tells the BBC. ""Seeing people fill up multiple jerry cans of fuel - I just don't understand what their mentality is,"" he says. ""It appears very selfish... they are just looking after themselves and not really considering the needs of others and key workers."" McDonald, who works in orthopaedics at a hospital in the East Midlands, says any delays in getting to work are likely to lead to cancellations of surgeries or fracture clinics. ""If patients live far away from the clinic they may not be able to get in, staff may not be able to get in,"" he says. Drivers queued for hours outside a Derbyshire petrol station without realising it was closed, police have said. Derbyshire Police were called after long queues at the Etwall Fuel Express station caused an obstruction on the A516 on Monday. Some had been at the garage for three hours despite the forecourt being shut following vandalism. An appeal to trace two men in a white van who threatened an officer at the scene is under way. On Facebook, the force's safer neighbourhood team said: ""With regret, officers, who were stood outside in pouring rain directing traffic, were subjected to abuse and a series of inexplicable excuses of why they needed to enter a closed garage that was unable to sell fuel."" Read more. There are ""early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending,"" according to the Petrol Retailers Association. The group, which represents independent forecourts across the UK, says more of its members are ""now taking further deliveries of fuel"". ""Fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, although deliveries have been reduced due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" it says in a statement. It adds that 37% of forecourts have reported being out of fuel today, but that percentage ""is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours"". Greg McKenzieBBC London I'm here in Ilford at K&S Fuels on Beehive Lane. They were fortunate - they managed to get a delivery of 18,000 litres of petrol and 18,000 litres of diesel at 4am this morning. It's meant they've been able to provide the local community with fuel - but they're worried it might run out. They think they've got another five hours left. The tailbacks behind me are visible, they've been here ever since 6am this morning. The average wait is half an hour but people are getting through and they are able to get their fuel here in Ilford. We know there's about 150 army personnel on standby to help drive HGV vehicles to deliver petrol or fuel to different stations up and down the country. We know there isn't a fuel shortage. The problem is not enough HGV drivers to deliver the fuel to petrol stations up and down the country. Many people I've been speaking to here today say that is simply not good enough.  The head of a home care service in West Sussextells the BBCthat if the fuel supply crisis isn't resolved by next week, her company will be in breach of safeguarding guidelines for its 12 customers. Rosemary Botting, who runs Karosel Care and Domestic Services, says: ""We will be putting our service users at risk. We would not be able to send a carer out to somebody."" Two of her carers were currently searching for fuel ahead of their next shift in order to reach vulnerable people. Many of the people they work with live in rural areas, making a tank full of fuel essential, she says. Queues at petrol pumps meant one carer had already been half an hour late for her first call, a patient who cannot get out of bed unaided. ""We got through Covid. Not a single user in our care contracted Covid. The reason I do this job is because I care. It's just a bit of a nightmare at the moment,"" Botting says. Private hire taxi drivers are ""on their knees"" over the fuel issue and need help, a union says. The GMB is calling for taxis to be classed as an essential service and has written to the Department for Transport calling for help. National officer Mick Rix says: ""The private hire industry has been hammered by the pandemic. ""Just as it begins to recover from the devastating effects of lockdowns, drivers are unable to work because they cannot get fuel. ""These drivers take patients to hospital, take children to school and are often the only way people with disabilities can get around. ""Private hire drivers are on their knees. They need help."" Some vulnerable people say they are still facing difficulties with getting the support they need due to fuel supply issues. Sarah Jane Barnes, from Berkshire, tells the BBC that she's worried for her elderly mother, who has missed two out of three dialysis appointments because renal technicians have been unable to get enough fuel to reach her. The dialysis treatment for Sarah's mother takes place at home overnight - when she is hooked up to a machine that removes waste products from her blood because her kidneys no longer function properly. The first missed appointment was on Saturday. Then the technician cancelled again on Sunday, so Sarah called the hospital who were able to send someone out on that occasion. Sarah says: ""My mum is elderly and she's not well if she misses a session. But she's missed two out of three. I'm very worried."" Health and council bosses in Dorset say empty petrol pumps could lead to staff being unable to deliver care to ""sick, vulnerable and dying people"". NHS Dorset CCG says increasing numbers of its health, social and hospital staff are struggling to refuel. The council covering Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole says there is a ""very serious risk"" critical staff will not be able to get to work. It's urging people to buy fuel normally and only take what they actually need. Read more. Food banks in Wales could struggle if fuel supply problems continue, a charity group is warning. FareShare Cymru, which organises food donations to more than 150 groups, says it is facing major transport issues. For the people who depend upon community groups and food banks across south Wales, FareShare is a ""lifeline"", the charity says. Made up of 18 independent organisations, it takes surplus food from across the food industry and distributes it to front-line charities such as food banks. ""It's been a double whammy for us - transport into us with food is proving difficult and is either late or doesn't turn up, but also not having petrol to get food out,"" says operations manager Gerry Molan.

"Army put on standby to ease fuel crisisMilitary drivers will be trained up as a precaution, after days of long queues and pump closures.","There were queues at many petrol stations on Monday, including in Friern Barnet, north London The Army is ready to help ease fuel supply problems after a fourth day of long queues and pump closures. Up to 150 military tanker drivers will prepare to deliver to forecourts which have run dry because of panic buying. The surge in demand came amid fears a driver shortage would hit fuel supply - which is plentiful at refineries. The transport secretary said there were ""tentative signs"" of stabilisation in petrol stations and queues would start to reflect this in the coming days. Grant Shapps said: ""Once we all return to our normal buying habits... the quicker we get back to normality."" The Petrol Retailers Association (PRA) said there were ""early signs"" the pressure on petrol stations was starting to ease, The organisation, which represents nearly 5,500 of the UK's 8,000 stations, said around 37% of its sites had run out of fuel. That is a big improvement on the situation on Sunday, when two-thirds had run dry. ""With regular restocks taking place, this percentage [of petrol stations with fuel] is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours,"" it added in a statement. Why are there long queues for petrol in the UK? Outlook bleak as petrol prices surge, says RAC 'I'm at an Airbnb this week to avoid fuel queues' UK visa plan will not fix lorry crisis, says boss The UK is estimated to be short of more than 100,000 lorry drivers - causing problems for a range of industries, including food suppliers and supermarkets, in recent months. The government has said people needlessly buying fuel has led to queues at many forecourts, with fuel running out in some places. But there are growing calls for key workers, such as health and social care staff, to receive priority access to available fuel after some reported not being able to get to work due to the supply issues. Daniyal Ahsan, a junior doctor in London, told the BBC he went to 17 petrol stations after work on Monday in search of fuel - but wasn't able to get any, leaving him concerned about how this would affect his patients. He has since been able to fill up his car. Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of UK Homecare Association, warned that some people who depend on carers for tasks like taking pain medication could die if they are left without help. Roger Grosvenor, of the East of England Co-op petrol stations, told the BBC the group would create a daily priority hour for emergency workers if fuel supply problems had not eased by Thursday. Motoring group the RAC said the price of a litre of unleaded petrol had risen by a penny since Friday to an eight-year high - and knew a small number of retailers had been hiking prices amid the soaring demand. It added it had seen a ""sharp increase"" in the number of drivers who had broken down after running out of fuel - with engineers attending twice as many breakdowns on Monday than it would normally see over a whole week. The AA motoring organisation said it had seen a ""dramatic rise"" in motorists putting the wrong fuel in vehicles compared to last weekend. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng said the move to place the Army on standby was a ""sensible, precautionary step"" and if troops had to be deployed, they would temporarily ""provide the supply chain with additional capacity"" to ease the pressure caused by increased fuel demand. The BBC has been told that 75 military drivers are on standby initially, and another 75 could be added if needed. They require up to five days of specialised training. Huw Merriman, a Conservative MP and chairman of the transport select committee, said readying the army was a ""good example"" of ministers trying to use as many levers at their disposal as possible, and would be used as a ""last resort"" if the situation did not stabilise in the next couple of days. But Mr Merriman told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the industry must explain how it planned to fix long-standing driver shortages rather than having the government constantly step in. ""These problems have been there for years because the average age of the driver is 55 years old, they're retiring, and the industry has not made this job attractive. For too long, working conditions have been poor, and those that are willing to tolerate it have been from abroad."" It is hoped that with many cars now holding more fuel than usual, demand will return to normal levels soon The government has also authorised an extension to special driver licences that allow drivers to transport goods such as fuel. ADR licences due to expire between 27 September and 31 December will have their validity extended until 31 January 2022, without refresher training or exams. Labour said the latest response to the fuel crisis was ""an admission of failure"" and that asking the Army to step up was ""a sticking plaster"". Leading fuel companies, including BP and Shell, have sought to reassure the public that supplies remain unaffected at source. In a joint statement, they said that given ""many cars are now holding more fuel than usual"" they expected demand would ""return to its normal levels in the coming days"". This video can not be played Key workers and essential trips affected by panic buying Doctors, nurses, and unions for teachers, prison and care staff have called for essential workers to be given priority for fuel. Some ambulance trusts have their own fuel pumps in depots and their supplies are expected to be prioritised - but essential workers can still be caught out. Unison urged ministers to ""designate fuel stations for the sole use of key workers"" while the NASUWT union called for teachers to be prioritised to safeguard children's education. But the headteachers' union NAHT said prioritising key workers for fuel was ""not a sensible solution as it would be impossible to enforce and could cause more chaos on the forecourts"". And Brian Madderson, chairman of the Petrol Retailers Association, said trying to decide who was and was not an emergency worker and how they would prove this in petrol stations was ""very complex"" and ""hopefully"" a last resort. Asked about the prospect of priority for key workers, Mr Shapps said he would keep a ""close eye"" on the situation and the government would do ""whatever it takes"". Elsewhere, Carol Curry, who needed fuel to drive her husband to a hospital appointment, said she blamed the media for frenzied scenes at the pumps. ""If nobody had said about this, the lorry drivers and everything, then this panic wouldn't have started,"" she said. How serious is the HGV driver shortage? 50,000 more lorry driver tests promised a year Temporary visa plan to ease lorry driver shortage Visas won't solve petrol supply issues - retailers The government hastemporarily exempted fuel companies from competition law,allowing them to work together to target supplies at areas most in need. Temporary visas lasting until Christmas Eve for 5,000 foreign fuel tanker and food lorry drivers, and 5,500 poultry workers,have also been announced. Nearly one million drivers qualified to drive heavy goods vehicles are being encouraged to rejoin the sector, and some 3,000 new recruits are expected to undertake short, intensive driving courses. Factors including Brexit, the pandemic, pay levels and an aging workforce have all contributed to a shortage of lorry drivers. After the UK left the EU, many European drivers returned to their home countries, or decided to work elsewhere because of the additional border bureaucracy and the impact it had on their income. The pandemic also prompted many foreign drivers to return home and led to a huge backlog in HGV driver exams. Driver shortages have also been seen in EU countries, including Germany and Poland.

LiveLiveTentative signs fuel situation stabilising - ShappsLess than a minute ago,"There are ""early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending,"" according to the Petrol Retailers Association It says 37% of forecourts it represents around the UK are reporting being out of fuel today - and it hopes the rate will fall over the next 24 hours On Monday it had said as many as two-thirds of the 5,500 independent outlets it represents were out of fuel Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also says there are tentative signs the situation is stabilising Prime Minister Boris Johnson urges people to go about their business in the normal way and fill up when they need to The PM rules out giving key workers priority access to fuel - but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says that should happen Petrol prices have hit an eight-year high, the RAC says, due to a rise in the cost of wholesale fuel Edited by James Clarke Thanks for tuning in. Today's live page posts were written by Lauren Turner, Joseph Lee and Hazel Shearing. They were edited by James Clarke and John Hand. We'll be bringing our coverage of the fuel supply issues in Britain to a close for the day shortly. Here's what you need to know if you're just catching up: Parents and children with special needs in Brent, north-west London, felt the impact of the petrol supply issues when their school bus was cancelled this morning. A text message sent at 7:15 BST to parents at the Village School said the service could not run due to panic-buying in the area, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Burcu Akin said she was held up in an hour-long traffic jam, caused by motorists queuing at petrol stations, as she tried to get her autistic 10-year-old daughter to school. âItâs a huge deal for us. Itâs very disruptive for an autistic child. She thinks we are back in Covid,"" she said. âShe will be unsettled all day and will not know what is happening to her this afternoon. I donât even know if my child will get picked up today.â Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister is asked about the range of issues facing the UK - including gas price rises, HGV driver shortages, food shortages and the fuel supply problems - and whether the country was in a crisis. Boris Johnson says: ""What weâve got is a global economy that is recovering from a once-in-a-century pandemic that has caused some particular shortages."" He mentions gas and HGV drivers and says the issues are a ""function of huge global demand"", adding: ""But weâre meeting them."" ""We have all sorts of plans to make sure that as we go forward into the new year we have everything necessary to correct our supply chains and keep things moving,"" the prime minister says. The government didn't have a ""plan"" when it came to lorry drivers as the UK left the European Union, Starmer adds. Speaking about fuel supply issues to Channel 5 News in Brighton, where the Labour Party is holding its conference, he says: ""I wouldn't say that Brexit is to blame. What I would say is that it was inevitable as we exited the EU that we needed a plan to deal with drivers. ""That is obvious whether you voted Remain or voted Leave, and we took that decision years ago."" He adds: ""And here we are with a shortage of drivers which was completely predictable and predicted - and the government hasn't got a plan."" We've just heard from Boris Johnson who has rejected the idea of key workers getting priority access to fuel supplies. But the prime minister should prioritise fuel for key workers and begin issuing visas to lorry drivers from overseas, according to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. The opposition leader tells the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg the government ""is not gripping this"" and that businesses affected by the supply issues, who he spoke to earlier, are ""beyond frustrated"". Sir Keir criticises the government'smeasures to give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers - announced in a bid to limit disruption in the build-up to Christmas. ""At the moment, there aren't enough  visas, and there was some talk this morning on the discussions I had that the visas may not even begin until November,"" he says. ""The prime minister should take that action today, prioritise key workers and start issuing enough visas and for long enough."" Starmer adds: ""The strong view this morning was that the three month visas won't work, they're going to have to be six months visas. But this problem was predictable and predicted and the government has absolutely failed to plan."" Earlier, Labour said it agreed with health and social care workers that they should have priority for fuel supplies. But the prime minister rejects that idea, saying: ""With the situation now stabilising and things getting better on the forecourts, the best thing is that we stabilise it in the normal way."" He blames the apparent panic buying at the petrol pumps on a ""slightly misleading"" leak, which people responded to in a ""totally understandable"" way. Johnson says the shortage of HGV drivers in the fuel sector is ""not very big"". But he adds: ""I donât think people want to fix alll our problems with uncontrolled immigration again."" He says that leads to a ""low-wage, low-skill approach"". Boris Johnson urges the public to ""go about their business in the normal way"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he sympathises with people who have been unable to get fuel, calling it ""frustrating and infuriating"". But he says ""we now are starting to see the situation improve"" with deliveries coming on to the forecourts. He urges people to ""go about their business in the normal way and fill up in the normal way when you need it, and things will start to improve"". The crisis reflects ""shortages around the world"", he says, and says the government has ""got to make sure we have everything in place as the recovery continues"". The prime minister urges people to go about their business normally.  Mark BroadBusiness deployment editor A government source has confirmed reports that 16% of all petrol stations are now fully supplied with fuel, compared with 10% at the weekend during some of the worst of the fuel rush. The source said 40% of petrol stations being fully supplied was a more normal figure before the rush on fuel. While the figures seem to be going in the right direction, it is understood that there are other figures which donât paint a completely positive picture. Drivers who left the UK after Brexit will not be tempted back with the issuing of temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers, the German freight industry says. Frank Huster, chief executive of the German Freight Forwarding and Logistics Association, has told the Reuters news agency: ""The labour market on the European continent has gratefully accepted these workers - they are now lost to re-employment in the United Kingdom."" The shortage of drivers has contributed to the issues at petrol stations across the UK. ""The new UK visa regulations - especially the temporary ones - will not change this,"" says Huster. Mark Drakeford called Boris Johnson's government ""incompetent"" during a speech at the Labour Party conference in Brighton. Wales's first minister has called the UK government'splans to offer temporary visas to foreign lorry drivers""arrogant"" and ""exploitative"". On Saturday, the UK government announced measures to give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers in a bid to limit disruption in the build-up to Christmas. Speaking during First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford says the plan  ""won't work"". ""It is hard to imagine a government that has made a more derisory attempt to solve a problem of their own creation,"" he says, adding that there is a shortage of the drivers because the UK government ""took us out of the European Union where we were previously supplied by drivers"". ""The idea that people are going to be willing to uproot themselves and come back to this country for a matter of weeks only to be told by the UK government they will be discarded again on Christmas Eve when they no longer have a use for them is simply... the arrogance of it is breathtaking,"" he adds. Drakeford claims 800 people have been retrained as HGV drivers through the Welsh government's Redundancy Action Scheme (ReAct) programme since 2015, adding: ""That is not going to be a solution for the short-term problems but neither is a scheme that is so exploitative of others that there is no prospect at all that it can deliver what is needed."" Colin McDonald, a hospital doctor, says patients could miss out on appointments Hospital doctor Colin McDonald says he was worried he might not be able to travel to work because of the problems with fuel supplies on Sunday. But the next day he managed to fill up on petrol that had been set aside for key workers. It was hard to understand people who were stocking up with large amounts of fuel in cans,he tells the BBC. ""Seeing people fill up multiple jerry cans of fuel - I just don't understand what their mentality is,"" he says. ""It appears very selfish... they are just looking after themselves and not really considering the needs of others and key workers."" McDonald, who works in orthopaedics at a hospital in the East Midlands, says any delays in getting to work are likely to lead to cancellations of surgeries or fracture clinics. ""If patients live far away from the clinic they may not be able to get in, staff may not be able to get in,"" he says. Drivers queued for hours outside a Derbyshire petrol station without realising it was closed, police have said. Derbyshire Police were called after long queues at the Etwall Fuel Express station caused an obstruction on the A516 on Monday. Some had been at the garage for three hours despite the forecourt being shut following vandalism. An appeal to trace two men in a white van who threatened an officer at the scene is under way. On Facebook, the force's safer neighbourhood team said: ""With regret, officers, who were stood outside in pouring rain directing traffic, were subjected to abuse and a series of inexplicable excuses of why they needed to enter a closed garage that was unable to sell fuel."" Read more. There are ""early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending,"" according to the Petrol Retailers Association. The group, which represents independent forecourts across the UK, says more of its members are ""now taking further deliveries of fuel"". ""Fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, although deliveries have been reduced due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" it says in a statement. It adds that 37% of forecourts have reported being out of fuel today, but that percentage ""is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours"". Greg McKenzieBBC London I'm here in Ilford at K&S Fuels on Beehive Lane. They were fortunate - they managed to get a delivery of 18,000 litres of petrol and 18,000 litres of diesel at 4am this morning. It's meant they've been able to provide the local community with fuel - but they're worried it might run out. They think they've got another five hours left. The tailbacks behind me are visible, they've been here ever since 6am this morning. The average wait is half an hour but people are getting through and they are able to get their fuel here in Ilford. We know there's about 150 army personnel on standby to help drive HGV vehicles to deliver petrol or fuel to different stations up and down the country. We know there isn't a fuel shortage. The problem is not enough HGV drivers to deliver the fuel to petrol stations up and down the country. Many people I've been speaking to here today say that is simply not good enough.  The head of a home care service in West Sussextells the BBCthat if the fuel supply crisis isn't resolved by next week, her company will be in breach of safeguarding guidelines for its 12 customers. Rosemary Botting, who runs Karosel Care and Domestic Services, says: ""We will be putting our service users at risk. We would not be able to send a carer out to somebody."" Two of her carers were currently searching for fuel ahead of their next shift in order to reach vulnerable people. Many of the people they work with live in rural areas, making a tank full of fuel essential, she says. Queues at petrol pumps meant one carer had already been half an hour late for her first call, a patient who cannot get out of bed unaided. ""We got through Covid. Not a single user in our care contracted Covid. The reason I do this job is because I care. It's just a bit of a nightmare at the moment,"" Botting says. Private hire taxi drivers are ""on their knees"" over the fuel issue and need help, a union says. The GMB is calling for taxis to be classed as an essential service and has written to the Department for Transport calling for help. National officer Mick Rix says: ""The private hire industry has been hammered by the pandemic. ""Just as it begins to recover from the devastating effects of lockdowns, drivers are unable to work because they cannot get fuel. ""These drivers take patients to hospital, take children to school and are often the only way people with disabilities can get around. ""Private hire drivers are on their knees. They need help."" Some vulnerable people say they are still facing difficulties with getting the support they need due to fuel supply issues. Sarah Jane Barnes, from Berkshire, tells the BBC that she's worried for her elderly mother, who has missed two out of three dialysis appointments because renal technicians have been unable to get enough fuel to reach her. The dialysis treatment for Sarah's mother takes place at home overnight - when she is hooked up to a machine that removes waste products from her blood because her kidneys no longer function properly. The first missed appointment was on Saturday. Then the technician cancelled again on Sunday, so Sarah called the hospital who were able to send someone out on that occasion. Sarah says: ""My mum is elderly and she's not well if she misses a session. But she's missed two out of three. I'm very worried."" Health and council bosses in Dorset say empty petrol pumps could lead to staff being unable to deliver care to ""sick, vulnerable and dying people"". NHS Dorset CCG says increasing numbers of its health, social and hospital staff are struggling to refuel. The council covering Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole says there is a ""very serious risk"" critical staff will not be able to get to work. It's urging people to buy fuel normally and only take what they actually need. Read more. Food banks in Wales could struggle if fuel supply problems continue, a charity group is warning. FareShare Cymru, which organises food donations to more than 150 groups, says it is facing major transport issues. For the people who depend upon community groups and food banks across south Wales, FareShare is a ""lifeline"", the charity says. Made up of 18 independent organisations, it takes surplus food from across the food industry and distributes it to front-line charities such as food banks. ""It's been a double whammy for us - transport into us with food is proving difficult and is either late or doesn't turn up, but also not having petrol to get food out,"" says operations manager Gerry Molan.

Ford plans $11.4bn investment in electric car plants,"Ford has announced a major investment in electric vehicle (EV) production in the US, promising to build its biggest ever factory in Tennessee, and two battery parks in Kentucky. Under the $11.4bn (Â£8.3bn) plan, the carmaker said it will build zero-emission cars and pickups ""at scale"" for American customers. It will also create 11,000 jobs. Like rivals GM and Stellantis, Ford hopes around half of the cars it sells by 2030 will be zero emission. Yet the additional government investment required to make it happen is still in question. ""This is our moment - our biggest investment ever - to help build a better future for America,"" said Jim Farley, Ford's president and chief executive in a statement. ""We are moving now to deliver breakthrough electric vehicles for the many rather than the few."" Ford said its Tennessee factory - called Blue Oval City - will cover a 6-square-mile area and build next-generation electric pickup trucks and batteries from 2025. Its battery parks in Kentucky will power a new line-up of Ford and Lincoln EVs. 'I'm just not ready to buy an electric car' Why electric cars will take over sooner than you think Ford has already ramped up investment in EV production at its Texas and Michigan plants. It said it would be making the new investments in partnership with SK Innovation, a South Korean battery maker. Outside of a few major metropolitan areas, EVs still aren't very common in the US and the country accounted for just 2% of new EV sales globally last year. The Biden administration hopes to change this with tougher tailpipe emissions rules from 2026 and billions of dollars of spending on new charging points and consumer incentives. However, the cash is tied up in two spending bills that Democrat leaders must get through a divided Senate. On Thursday, lawmakers will vote on the first - a $1tn infrastructure plan - which appears to have enough bi-partisan support to pass. But a second, $3.5tn bill - which focuses on widening America's social safety net -  is opposed by every Republican and some moderate Democrats, who say it is too expensive in its current form. Ford told the BBC its announcement was not timed to coincide with this week's voting on Capitol Hill. But it said it supports the passage of both bills, which would ""help more Americans get into electric vehicles, while at the same time supporting American manufacturing and union jobs"".

Man admits stalking TV star Denise Welch,"Denise Welch played Natalie Barnes in Coronation Street A man has admitted stalking Loose Women star Denise Welch and setting a fire on her driveway. Toraq Wyngard targeted the actor between 18 September 2020 and 11 February this year, Cheshire Police said. The 63-year-old admitted stalking the TV presenter on the first day of a trial at Chester Crown Court on Monday. He also pleaded guilty to possessing a knife, criminal damage and arson and will be sentenced on 26 October. Wyngard, of Cannon Street in Salford, was found near the home the star shares with her husband Lincoln Townley in Cheshire when police were called to a fire on her driveway on 19 September last year. The blaze had spread from the skip to the garage attached to the property, police said. Officers found Wyngard nearby with a knife in his backpack. In a statement released by police, Welch said she was ""very relieved"" that Wyngard had admitted the offences. ""This has been an incredibly terrifying and stressful time for me and our family,"" she added. ""We are grateful to the fire service for their prompt action saving our house and to the police for their amazing vigilance and support."" Det Sgt Dave Thomason said: ""I'd like to thank Denise for her bravery in coming forward and I hope this reassures other victims that we do listen and take action against those who carry out such distressing crimes in our communities."" Welch, 63, who played Natalie Barnes in Coronation Street, is a regular panellist on Loose Women and has also appeared on Waterloo Road.

The problem is not enough HGV drivers to deliver the fuel to petrol stations up and down the country. Many people I've been speaking to here today say that is simply not good enough.  The head of a home care service in West Sussextells the BBCthat if the fuel supply crisis isn't resolved by next week, her company will be in breach of safeguarding guidelines for its 12 customers. Rosemary Botting, who runs Karosel Care and Domestic Services, says: ""We will be putting our service users at risk. We would not be able to send a carer out to somebody."" Two of her carers were currently searching for fuel ahead of their next shift in order to reach vulnerable people. Many of the people they work with live in rural areas, making a tank full of fuel essential, she says. Queues at petrol pumps meant one carer had already been half an hour late for her first call, a patient who cannot get out of bed unaided. ""We got through Covid. Not a single user in our care contracted Covid. The reason I do this job is because I care. It's just a bit of a nightmare at the moment,"" Botting says. Private hire taxi drivers are ""on their knees"" over the fuel issue and need help, a union says. The GMB is calling for taxis to be classed as an essential service and has written to the Department for Transport calling for help. National officer Mick Rix says: ""The private hire industry has been hammered by the pandemic. ""Just as it begins to recover from the devastating effects of lockdowns, drivers are unable to work because they cannot get fuel. ""These drivers take patients to hospital, take children to school and are often the only way people with disabilities can get around. ""Private hire drivers are on their knees. They need help."" Some vulnerable people say they are still facing difficulties with getting the support they need due to fuel supply issues. Sarah Jane Barnes, from Berkshire, tells the BBC that she's worried for her elderly mother, who has missed two out of three dialysis appointments because renal technicians have been unable to get enough fuel to reach her. The dialysis treatment for Sarah's mother takes place at home overnight - when she is hooked up to a machine that removes waste products from her blood because her kidneys no longer function properly. The first missed appointment was on Saturday. Then the technician cancelled again on Sunday, so Sarah called the hospital who were able to send someone out on that occasion. Sarah says: ""My mum is elderly and she's not well if she misses a session. But she's missed two out of three. I'm very worried."" Health and council bosses in Dorset say empty petrol pumps could lead to staff being unable to deliver care to ""sick, vulnerable and dying people"". NHS Dorset CCG says increasing numbers of its health, social and hospital staff are struggling to refuel. The council covering Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole says there is a ""very serious risk"" critical staff will not be able to get to work. It's urging people to buy fuel normally and only take what they actually need. Read more. Food banks in Wales could struggle if fuel supply problems continue, a charity group is warning. FareShare Cymru, which organises food donations to more than 150 groups, says it is facing major transport issues. For the people who depend upon community groups and food banks across south Wales, FareShare is a ""lifeline"", the charity says. Made up of 18 independent organisations, it takes surplus food from across the food industry and distributes it to front-line charities such as food banks. ""It's been a double whammy for us - transport into us with food is proving difficult and is either late or doesn't turn up, but also not having petrol to get food out,"" says operations manager Gerry Molan.

LiveLiveFuel prices up as Army put on standby1 minute ago,"There are ""early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending,"" according to the Petrol Retailers Association It says 37% of forecourts it represents around the UK are reporting being out of fuel today - and it hopes the rate will fall over the next 24 hours On Monday it had said as many as two-thirds of the 5,500 independent outlets it represents were out of fuel Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also says there are tentative signs the situation is stabilising Prime Minister Boris Johnson urges people to go about their business in the normal way and fill up when they need to The PM rules out giving key workers priority access to fuel - but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says that should happen Petrol prices have hit an eight-year high, the RAC says, due to a rise in the cost of wholesale fuel Edited by James Clarke Thanks for tuning in. Today's live page posts were written by Lauren Turner, Joseph Lee and Hazel Shearing. They were edited by James Clarke and John Hand. We'll be bringing our coverage of the fuel supply issues in Britain to a close for the day shortly. Here's what you need to know if you're just catching up: Parents and children with special needs in Brent, north-west London, felt the impact of the petrol supply issues when their school bus was cancelled this morning. A text message sent at 7:15 BST to parents at the Village School said the service could not run due to panic-buying in the area, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Burcu Akin said she was held up in an hour-long traffic jam, caused by motorists queuing at petrol stations, as she tried to get her autistic 10-year-old daughter to school. âItâs a huge deal for us. Itâs very disruptive for an autistic child. She thinks we are back in Covid,"" she said. âShe will be unsettled all day and will not know what is happening to her this afternoon. I donât even know if my child will get picked up today.â Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister is asked about the range of issues facing the UK - including gas price rises, HGV driver shortages, food shortages and the fuel supply problems - and whether the country was in a crisis. Boris Johnson says: ""What weâve got is a global economy that is recovering from a once-in-a-century pandemic that has caused some particular shortages."" He mentions gas and HGV drivers and says the issues are a ""function of huge global demand"", adding: ""But weâre meeting them."" ""We have all sorts of plans to make sure that as we go forward into the new year we have everything necessary to correct our supply chains and keep things moving,"" the prime minister says. The government didn't have a ""plan"" when it came to lorry drivers as the UK left the European Union, Starmer adds. Speaking about fuel supply issues to Channel 5 News in Brighton, where the Labour Party is holding its conference, he says: ""I wouldn't say that Brexit is to blame. What I would say is that it was inevitable as we exited the EU that we needed a plan to deal with drivers. ""That is obvious whether you voted Remain or voted Leave, and we took that decision years ago."" He adds: ""And here we are with a shortage of drivers which was completely predictable and predicted - and the government hasn't got a plan."" We've just heard from Boris Johnson who has rejected the idea of key workers getting priority access to fuel supplies. But the prime minister should prioritise fuel for key workers and begin issuing visas to lorry drivers from overseas, according to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. The opposition leader tells the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg the government ""is not gripping this"" and that businesses affected by the supply issues, who he spoke to earlier, are ""beyond frustrated"". Sir Keir criticises the government'smeasures to give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers - announced in a bid to limit disruption in the build-up to Christmas. ""At the moment, there aren't enough  visas, and there was some talk this morning on the discussions I had that the visas may not even begin until November,"" he says. ""The prime minister should take that action today, prioritise key workers and start issuing enough visas and for long enough."" Starmer adds: ""The strong view this morning was that the three month visas won't work, they're going to have to be six months visas. But this problem was predictable and predicted and the government has absolutely failed to plan."" Earlier, Labour said it agreed with health and social care workers that they should have priority for fuel supplies. But the prime minister rejects that idea, saying: ""With the situation now stabilising and things getting better on the forecourts, the best thing is that we stabilise it in the normal way."" He blames the apparent panic buying at the petrol pumps on a ""slightly misleading"" leak, which people responded to in a ""totally understandable"" way. Johnson says the shortage of HGV drivers in the fuel sector is ""not very big"". But he adds: ""I donât think people want to fix alll our problems with uncontrolled immigration again."" He says that leads to a ""low-wage, low-skill approach"". Boris Johnson urges the public to ""go about their business in the normal way"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he sympathises with people who have been unable to get fuel, calling it ""frustrating and infuriating"". But he says ""we now are starting to see the situation improve"" with deliveries coming on to the forecourts. He urges people to ""go about their business in the normal way and fill up in the normal way when you need it, and things will start to improve"". The crisis reflects ""shortages around the world"", he says, and says the government has ""got to make sure we have everything in place as the recovery continues"". The prime minister urges people to go about their business normally.  Mark BroadBusiness deployment editor A government source has confirmed reports that 16% of all petrol stations are now fully supplied with fuel, compared with 10% at the weekend during some of the worst of the fuel rush. The source said 40% of petrol stations being fully supplied was a more normal figure before the rush on fuel. While the figures seem to be going in the right direction, it is understood that there are other figures which donât paint a completely positive picture. Drivers who left the UK after Brexit will not be tempted back with the issuing of temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers, the German freight industry says. Frank Huster, chief executive of the German Freight Forwarding and Logistics Association, has told the Reuters news agency: ""The labour market on the European continent has gratefully accepted these workers - they are now lost to re-employment in the United Kingdom."" The shortage of drivers has contributed to the issues at petrol stations across the UK. ""The new UK visa regulations - especially the temporary ones - will not change this,"" says Huster. Mark Drakeford called Boris Johnson's government ""incompetent"" during a speech at the Labour Party conference in Brighton. Wales's first minister has called the UK government'splans to offer temporary visas to foreign lorry drivers""arrogant"" and ""exploitative"". On Saturday, the UK government announced measures to give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers in a bid to limit disruption in the build-up to Christmas. Speaking during First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford says the plan  ""won't work"". ""It is hard to imagine a government that has made a more derisory attempt to solve a problem of their own creation,"" he says, adding that there is a shortage of the drivers because the UK government ""took us out of the European Union where we were previously supplied by drivers"". ""The idea that people are going to be willing to uproot themselves and come back to this country for a matter of weeks only to be told by the UK government they will be discarded again on Christmas Eve when they no longer have a use for them is simply... the arrogance of it is breathtaking,"" he adds. Drakeford claims 800 people have been retrained as HGV drivers through the Welsh government's Redundancy Action Scheme (ReAct) programme since 2015, adding: ""That is not going to be a solution for the short-term problems but neither is a scheme that is so exploitative of others that there is no prospect at all that it can deliver what is needed."" Colin McDonald, a hospital doctor, says patients could miss out on appointments Hospital doctor Colin McDonald says he was worried he might not be able to travel to work because of the problems with fuel supplies on Sunday. But the next day he managed to fill up on petrol that had been set aside for key workers. It was hard to understand people who were stocking up with large amounts of fuel in cans,he tells the BBC. ""Seeing people fill up multiple jerry cans of fuel - I just don't understand what their mentality is,"" he says. ""It appears very selfish... they are just looking after themselves and not really considering the needs of others and key workers."" McDonald, who works in orthopaedics at a hospital in the East Midlands, says any delays in getting to work are likely to lead to cancellations of surgeries or fracture clinics. ""If patients live far away from the clinic they may not be able to get in, staff may not be able to get in,"" he says. Drivers queued for hours outside a Derbyshire petrol station without realising it was closed, police have said. Derbyshire Police were called after long queues at the Etwall Fuel Express station caused an obstruction on the A516 on Monday. Some had been at the garage for three hours despite the forecourt being shut following vandalism. An appeal to trace two men in a white van who threatened an officer at the scene is under way. On Facebook, the force's safer neighbourhood team said: ""With regret, officers, who were stood outside in pouring rain directing traffic, were subjected to abuse and a series of inexplicable excuses of why they needed to enter a closed garage that was unable to sell fuel."" Read more. There are ""early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending,"" according to the Petrol Retailers Association. The group, which represents independent forecourts across the UK, says more of its members are ""now taking further deliveries of fuel"". ""Fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, although deliveries have been reduced due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" it says in a statement. It adds that 37% of forecourts have reported being out of fuel today, but that percentage ""is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours"". Greg McKenzieBBC London I'm here in Ilford at K&S Fuels on Beehive Lane. They were fortunate - they managed to get a delivery of 18,000 litres of petrol and 18,000 litres of diesel at 4am this morning. It's meant they've been able to provide the local community with fuel - but they're worried it might run out. They think they've got another five hours left. The tailbacks behind me are visible, they've been here ever since 6am this morning. The average wait is half an hour but people are getting through and they are able to get their fuel here in Ilford. We know there's about 150 army personnel on standby to help drive HGV vehicles to deliver petrol or fuel to different stations up and down the country. We know there isn't a fuel shortage.

Government takes over running of Southeastern,"Southeastern will hand over the running of its services on 17 October Rail operator Southeastern has been stripped of its franchise after failing to declare more than Â£25m of taxpayer funding. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the money had now been reclaimed. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the Operator of Last Resort would take over the running of rail services in the south east to protect taxpayers' interests. Passengers will see no change in day-to-day operations, Southeastern said. Further investigations are being conducted and the government said it would consider options for more action, including financial penalties. Mr Shapps said: ""We won't accept anything less from the private sector than a total commitment to their passengers, and transparency with taxpayers. ""Through the Operator of Last Resort we'll prioritise the punctual, reliable services passengers deserve."" Labour's shadow transport secretary Jim McMahon said: ""This is yet another example of the complete failure of the franchise model, which prioritises private company profits over passengers and service."" He called on the government to bring rail franchises back into public ownership, adding that ministers ""must acknowledge their previous approach just hasn't worked."" Passengers have been told that there will be ""no immediate changes"" to services Chair of the Transport Select Committee Huw Merriman said he understands that the Serious Fraud Office (SFO) ""will be involved"", but the SFO said it would not deny or confirm an interest in the case. Mr Merriman, who is the MP for Bexhill and Battle, told the BBC: ""If this matter is serious enough that it is just beyond someone getting it wrong in terms of accounting, and there is evidence of wrongdoing [of] a criminal nature, of course that must be looked into. ""It's really important there is integrity in the railway system. ""We need confidence in our railways right now."" A statement from the DfT said it had found evidence that since October 2014 historical taxpayer funding of Â£25m, which should have been returned, had not been declared. The operation of all Southeastern services would transfer from London South Eastern Railway (LSER) to SE Trains Limited on 17 October, the DfT said. Robin Gisby, chair of SE Trains Limited, said: ""This decision doesn't affect the day-to-day operations of our train services, and we will continue to work hard to provide passengers with a great experience. ""I'd like to reassure all passengers that this is very much business as usual with no immediate changes."" ""All tickets will remain valid after transfer and new tickets can continue to be purchased in the usual way,"" astatement on Southeastern's website,externalsaid. Renationalising a line is not unheard of but to do it for a breach of trust is. Normally it is about whether services are good enough and concerns that an operator can financially honour the terms of the franchise. That's not the government's reasoning here. Contracts between operators and government were in effect ripped up during the pandemic and renegotiated. It looks like this issue was discovered when they were being closely scrutinised. The question many will have now is if this is viewed as a serious issue, why didn't the government notice it earlier? There are still ongoing investigations into what happened. Rail, Maritime and Transport union general secretary Mick Lynch said: ""There now needs to be a forensic examination of all the private rail contracts with those caught cooking the books called to account. ""It's an outrage that this privatised rail system stumbles on when it could be taken directly into public ownership for public need. ""We have to ensure that the services continue to run and staff are transferred successfully."" Manuel Cortes, general secretary of the Transport Salaried Staffs Association, said: ""The days of rail franchising must now be well and truly over. Time and time again we see the private sector fail and taxpayers ride to the rescue. ""Our union will now be seeking assurances that this mess in no way impacts our members' jobs because so many of them have been true heroes on the frontline of the pandemic since day one"". Tony Clayton, chairman of the Sevenoaks Rail Travellers Association, voiced concerns about the long term impact for passengers. He said: ""The reaction was 'not again'. This is the second time this has happened to us where the Operator of Last Resort has taken over the service. The last time was in 2003 when Connex lost the service. ""What we'd really like to know is what are the government going to do to keep making steady improvements to the service. ""We thought Southeastern did a pretty good job getting the service back to normal and a fantastic job during the pandemic to keep things safe."" Southeastern, which runs services between London, Kent and East Sussex, is operated by Govia, a joint venture between transport operators Go-Ahead and Keolis. Go-Ahead shares fell more than 22% in morning trading. The firm announced Elodie Brian has resigned as group chief financial officer and will be standing down from the board with immediate effect. Go-Ahead's chairwoman Clare Hollingsworth said: ""We recognise that mistakes have been made and we sincerely apologise to the DfT. We are working constructively with the DfT towards a settlement of this matter"". Southeastern has been running services since 2006, operating one of the busiest networks in the country including the UK's first domestic high-speed service. In 2019 the government held a fresh competition to run the franchise, but this was cancelled over fears it would lead to additional costs ""incurred to the taxpayer"". It employs employs 4,000 workers and serves 180 stations using a fleet of almost 400 trains.

Drakeford claims 800 people have been retrained as HGV drivers through the Welsh government's Redundancy Action Scheme (ReAct) programme since 2015, adding: ""That is not going to be a solution for the short-term problems but neither is a scheme that is so exploitative of others that there is no prospect at all that it can deliver what is needed."" Colin McDonald, a hospital doctor, says patients could miss out on appointments Hospital doctor Colin McDonald says he was worried he might not be able to travel to work because of the problems with fuel supplies on Sunday. But the next day he managed to fill up on petrol that had been set aside for key workers. It was hard to understand people who were stocking up with large amounts of fuel in cans,he tells the BBC. ""Seeing people fill up multiple jerry cans of fuel - I just don't understand what their mentality is,"" he says. ""It appears very selfish... they are just looking after themselves and not really considering the needs of others and key workers."" McDonald, who works in orthopaedics at a hospital in the East Midlands, says any delays in getting to work are likely to lead to cancellations of surgeries or fracture clinics. ""If patients live far away from the clinic they may not be able to get in, staff may not be able to get in,"" he says. Drivers queued for hours outside a Derbyshire petrol station without realising it was closed, police have said. Derbyshire Police were called after long queues at the Etwall Fuel Express station caused an obstruction on the A516 on Monday. Some had been at the garage for three hours despite the forecourt being shut following vandalism. An appeal to trace two men in a white van who threatened an officer at the scene is under way. On Facebook, the force's safer neighbourhood team said: ""With regret, officers, who were stood outside in pouring rain directing traffic, were subjected to abuse and a series of inexplicable excuses of why they needed to enter a closed garage that was unable to sell fuel."" Read more. There are ""early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending,"" according to the Petrol Retailers Association. The group, which represents independent forecourts across the UK, says more of its members are ""now taking further deliveries of fuel"". ""Fuel stocks remain normal at refineries and terminals, although deliveries have been reduced due to the shortage of HGV drivers,"" it says in a statement. It adds that 37% of forecourts have reported being out of fuel today, but that percentage ""is likely to improve further over the next 24 hours"". Greg McKenzieBBC London I'm here in Ilford at K&S Fuels on Beehive Lane. They were fortunate - they managed to get a delivery of 18,000 litres of petrol and 18,000 litres of diesel at 4am this morning. It's meant they've been able to provide the local community with fuel - but they're worried it might run out. They think they've got another five hours left. The tailbacks behind me are visible, they've been here ever since 6am this morning. The average wait is half an hour but people are getting through and they are able to get their fuel here in Ilford. We know there's about 150 army personnel on standby to help drive HGV vehicles to deliver petrol or fuel to different stations up and down the country. We know there isn't a fuel shortage. The problem is not enough HGV drivers to deliver the fuel to petrol stations up and down the country. Many people I've been speaking to here today say that is simply not good enough.  The head of a home care service in West Sussextells the BBCthat if the fuel supply crisis isn't resolved by next week, her company will be in breach of safeguarding guidelines for its 12 customers. Rosemary Botting, who runs Karosel Care and Domestic Services, says: ""We will be putting our service users at risk. We would not be able to send a carer out to somebody."" Two of her carers were currently searching for fuel ahead of their next shift in order to reach vulnerable people. Many of the people they work with live in rural areas, making a tank full of fuel essential, she says. Queues at petrol pumps meant one carer had already been half an hour late for her first call, a patient who cannot get out of bed unaided. ""We got through Covid. Not a single user in our care contracted Covid. The reason I do this job is because I care. It's just a bit of a nightmare at the moment,"" Botting says. Private hire taxi drivers are ""on their knees"" over the fuel issue and need help, a union says. The GMB is calling for taxis to be classed as an essential service and has written to the Department for Transport calling for help. National officer Mick Rix says: ""The private hire industry has been hammered by the pandemic. ""Just as it begins to recover from the devastating effects of lockdowns, drivers are unable to work because they cannot get fuel. ""These drivers take patients to hospital, take children to school and are often the only way people with disabilities can get around. ""Private hire drivers are on their knees. They need help."" Some vulnerable people say they are still facing difficulties with getting the support they need due to fuel supply issues. Sarah Jane Barnes, from Berkshire, tells the BBC that she's worried for her elderly mother, who has missed two out of three dialysis appointments because renal technicians have been unable to get enough fuel to reach her. The dialysis treatment for Sarah's mother takes place at home overnight - when she is hooked up to a machine that removes waste products from her blood because her kidneys no longer function properly. The first missed appointment was on Saturday. Then the technician cancelled again on Sunday, so Sarah called the hospital who were able to send someone out on that occasion. Sarah says: ""My mum is elderly and she's not well if she misses a session. But she's missed two out of three. I'm very worried."" Health and council bosses in Dorset say empty petrol pumps could lead to staff being unable to deliver care to ""sick, vulnerable and dying people"". NHS Dorset CCG says increasing numbers of its health, social and hospital staff are struggling to refuel. The council covering Bournemouth, Christchurch and Poole says there is a ""very serious risk"" critical staff will not be able to get to work. It's urging people to buy fuel normally and only take what they actually need. Read more. Food banks in Wales could struggle if fuel supply problems continue, a charity group is warning. FareShare Cymru, which organises food donations to more than 150 groups, says it is facing major transport issues. For the people who depend upon community groups and food banks across south Wales, FareShare is a ""lifeline"", the charity says. Made up of 18 independent organisations, it takes surplus food from across the food industry and distributes it to front-line charities such as food banks. ""It's been a double whammy for us - transport into us with food is proving difficult and is either late or doesn't turn up, but also not having petrol to get food out,"" says operations manager Gerry Molan.

LiveLiveFuel prices up as Army put on standby4 minutes ago,"There are ""early signs that the crisis at pumps is ending,"" according to the Petrol Retailers Association It says 37% of forecourts it represents around the UK are reporting being out of fuel today - and it hopes the rate will fall over the next 24 hours On Monday it had said as many as two-thirds of the 5,500 independent outlets it represents were out of fuel Transport Secretary Grant Shapps also says there are tentative signs the situation is stabilising Prime Minister Boris Johnson urges people to go about their business in the normal way and fill up when they need to The PM rules out giving key workers priority access to fuel - but Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says that should happen Petrol prices have hit an eight-year high, the RAC says, due to a rise in the cost of wholesale fuel Edited by James Clarke Thanks for tuning in. Today's live page posts were written by Lauren Turner, Joseph Lee and Hazel Shearing. They were edited by James Clarke and John Hand. We'll be bringing our coverage of the fuel supply issues in Britain to a close for the day shortly. Here's what you need to know if you're just catching up: Parents and children with special needs in Brent, north-west London, felt the impact of the petrol supply issues when their school bus was cancelled this morning. A text message sent at 7:15 BST to parents at the Village School said the service could not run due to panic-buying in the area, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Burcu Akin said she was held up in an hour-long traffic jam, caused by motorists queuing at petrol stations, as she tried to get her autistic 10-year-old daughter to school. âItâs a huge deal for us. Itâs very disruptive for an autistic child. She thinks we are back in Covid,"" she said. âShe will be unsettled all day and will not know what is happening to her this afternoon. I donât even know if my child will get picked up today.â Speaking to broadcasters, the prime minister is asked about the range of issues facing the UK - including gas price rises, HGV driver shortages, food shortages and the fuel supply problems - and whether the country was in a crisis. Boris Johnson says: ""What weâve got is a global economy that is recovering from a once-in-a-century pandemic that has caused some particular shortages."" He mentions gas and HGV drivers and says the issues are a ""function of huge global demand"", adding: ""But weâre meeting them."" ""We have all sorts of plans to make sure that as we go forward into the new year we have everything necessary to correct our supply chains and keep things moving,"" the prime minister says. The government didn't have a ""plan"" when it came to lorry drivers as the UK left the European Union, Starmer adds. Speaking about fuel supply issues to Channel 5 News in Brighton, where the Labour Party is holding its conference, he says: ""I wouldn't say that Brexit is to blame. What I would say is that it was inevitable as we exited the EU that we needed a plan to deal with drivers. ""That is obvious whether you voted Remain or voted Leave, and we took that decision years ago."" He adds: ""And here we are with a shortage of drivers which was completely predictable and predicted - and the government hasn't got a plan."" We've just heard from Boris Johnson who has rejected the idea of key workers getting priority access to fuel supplies. But the prime minister should prioritise fuel for key workers and begin issuing visas to lorry drivers from overseas, according to Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer. The opposition leader tells the BBC's Laura Kuenssberg the government ""is not gripping this"" and that businesses affected by the supply issues, who he spoke to earlier, are ""beyond frustrated"". Sir Keir criticises the government'smeasures to give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers - announced in a bid to limit disruption in the build-up to Christmas. ""At the moment, there aren't enough  visas, and there was some talk this morning on the discussions I had that the visas may not even begin until November,"" he says. ""The prime minister should take that action today, prioritise key workers and start issuing enough visas and for long enough."" Starmer adds: ""The strong view this morning was that the three month visas won't work, they're going to have to be six months visas. But this problem was predictable and predicted and the government has absolutely failed to plan."" Earlier, Labour said it agreed with health and social care workers that they should have priority for fuel supplies. But the prime minister rejects that idea, saying: ""With the situation now stabilising and things getting better on the forecourts, the best thing is that we stabilise it in the normal way."" He blames the apparent panic buying at the petrol pumps on a ""slightly misleading"" leak, which people responded to in a ""totally understandable"" way. Johnson says the shortage of HGV drivers in the fuel sector is ""not very big"". But he adds: ""I donât think people want to fix alll our problems with uncontrolled immigration again."" He says that leads to a ""low-wage, low-skill approach"". Boris Johnson urges the public to ""go about their business in the normal way"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he sympathises with people who have been unable to get fuel, calling it ""frustrating and infuriating"". But he says ""we now are starting to see the situation improve"" with deliveries coming on to the forecourts. He urges people to ""go about their business in the normal way and fill up in the normal way when you need it, and things will start to improve"". The crisis reflects ""shortages around the world"", he says, and says the government has ""got to make sure we have everything in place as the recovery continues"". The prime minister urges people to go about their business normally.  Mark BroadBusiness deployment editor A government source has confirmed reports that 16% of all petrol stations are now fully supplied with fuel, compared with 10% at the weekend during some of the worst of the fuel rush. The source said 40% of petrol stations being fully supplied was a more normal figure before the rush on fuel. While the figures seem to be going in the right direction, it is understood that there are other figures which donât paint a completely positive picture. Drivers who left the UK after Brexit will not be tempted back with the issuing of temporary visas for 5,000 foreign truck drivers, the German freight industry says. Frank Huster, chief executive of the German Freight Forwarding and Logistics Association, has told the Reuters news agency: ""The labour market on the European continent has gratefully accepted these workers - they are now lost to re-employment in the United Kingdom."" The shortage of drivers has contributed to the issues at petrol stations across the UK. ""The new UK visa regulations - especially the temporary ones - will not change this,"" says Huster. Mark Drakeford called Boris Johnson's government ""incompetent"" during a speech at the Labour Party conference in Brighton. Wales's first minister has called the UK government'splans to offer temporary visas to foreign lorry drivers""arrogant"" and ""exploitative"". On Saturday, the UK government announced measures to give temporary visas, lasting until Christmas Eve, to 5,000 fuel tanker and food lorry drivers and 5,500 poultry workers in a bid to limit disruption in the build-up to Christmas. Speaking during First Minister's Questions, Mark Drakeford says the plan  ""won't work"". ""It is hard to imagine a government that has made a more derisory attempt to solve a problem of their own creation,"" he says, adding that there is a shortage of the drivers because the UK government ""took us out of the European Union where we were previously supplied by drivers"". ""The idea that people are going to be willing to uproot themselves and come back to this country for a matter of weeks only to be told by the UK government they will be discarded again on Christmas Eve when they no longer have a use for them is simply... the arrogance of it is breathtaking,"" he adds.

"North Korea fires missile, says South","South Korean television broadcast news of the latest launch with file footage North Korea has fired a short-range missile towards the sea off its east coast early on Tuesday, said South Korea's military. The test happened as North Korea's ambassador said at the UN that no-one could deny Pyongyang's right to self-defence and to test weapons. Earlier this month Pyongyang test-fired both ballistic and cruise missiles. But several days ago North Korea had also expressed willingness to engage in talks with the South. The US military said in a statement on Tuesday that it was aware of the missile launch but that it posed no immediate threat to US personnel or its allies. However, the US Indo-Pacific Command said that the launch ""highlighted the destabilising impact of [North Korea's] illicit weapons program"". On Tuesday, Japanese media quoted the defence ministry as saying that the projectile may have been a ballistic missile, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has ordered Seoul's National Security Council to analyse any intentions behind Pyongyang's latest missile launch and recent statements from Kim Jong-un's powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong. Ms Kim had days earlier saidthey were open to Mr Moon's proposal to formally declare an end to the Korean War, but added that the South needed to stop its ""hostile policies"" first. This video can not be played Why does North Korea keep launching missiles? Shortly after the latest launch, North Korea's envoy Kim Song spoke at the annual UN General Assembly in New York. He said the North had a right to ""develop, test, manufacture and possess"" weapons systems. Mr Kim added that the country was ""building up our national defence in order to defend ourselves and reliably safeguard the security and peace of the country"", according to an AFP report. North Korea has repeatedly accused the South of double standards over military activities. South Korea recentlytested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, which it said was needed as deterrence against North Korea's ""provocations"". EXPLAINER:North Korea's missile and nuclear programme WATCH:Why North Korea keeps launching missiles REALITY CHECK:Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? Separately, North Korea is scheduled to hold a Supreme People's Assembly session on Tuesday. Issues like youth education and changes to the country's economic plans are expected to be brought up at this year's annual session of the rubber-stamp legislature. North Korea is facing food shortages, and has spent more than a year in isolation. It has shut its borders to keep out Covid-19, in the process cutting off trade with its closest ally China. However this has not stopped it from continuing with its weapons programme. In August, the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a ""deeply troubling"" development.

Dangerous levels of drugs in Glastonbury riverA study finds MDMA concentrations had quadrupled the week after the festival in July 2019.,"Festivalgoers are urged to use the official toilets provided Environmentally damaging levels of drugs have been found in the river running through the Glastonbury Festival site. Scientists have warned there are ""dangerous"" levels of MDMA and cocaine in the Whitelake River in Somerset. They suspect public urination has caused the increase and urged festival goers to use the toilets provided. Researchers fear it could derail the conservation efforts of rare European eels in the area. Measurements both upstream and downstream of the site were taken before, during and after the festival in 2019. The study found MDMA concentrations quadrupled the week after the festival, suggesting long-term release from the site. ""Peeing on the land"" is strongly discouraged, organisers said A spokesman for Glastonbury Festival said the Environment Agency had not raised any concerns with them on the matter following the 2019 event. He said: ""Protecting our local streams and wildlife is of paramount importance to us at Glastonbury Festival and we have a thorough and successful waterways sampling regime in place during each festival, as agreed with the Environment Agency. ""We are aware that the biggest threat to our waterways - and the wildlife for which they provide a habitat - comes from festivalgoers urinating on the land."" It does not condone the use of illegal drugs and continues to ""successfully strongly discourage"" public urination, he added. ""We are keen to see full details of this new research, and would be very happy to work with the researchers,"" the spokesman said. Dr Christian Dunn, from Bangor University, said: ""Our main concern is the environmental impact. This study identifies that drugs are being released at levels high enough to disrupt the lifecycle of the European eel. ""We [also] need to raise awareness around drug and pharmaceutical waste - it is a hidden, worryingly-understudied yet potentially devastating pollutant."" Dan Aberg, a Masters student in the School of Natural Sciences at the university, added: ""Illicit drug contamination from public urination happens at every music festival. ""Unfortunately, Glastonbury Festival's close proximity to a river results in any drugs released by festival attendees having little time to degrade in the soil before entering the fragile freshwater ecosystem."" Further studies into possible treatment via environmentally friendly methods in order to minimise the release and impact of illicit drugs from festivals have been suggested.

Unionist leaders unite in NI Protocol oppositionThe leaders of Northern Ireland's four main unionist parties have signed a joint declaration.Northern Ireland,"Getting goods across the Irish Sea border involves a range of new processes, checks and documentation The leaders of Northern Ireland's four main unionist parties have signed a joint declaration affirming their opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol. The UK and EU agreed the protocol in 2019, as part of the Brexit withdrawal agreement. It prevents a hard border in Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods. Unionist parties have previously voiced strong opposition to the protocol. Now the leaders of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), Ulster Unionist Party (UUP), Traditional Unionist Voice (TUV) and Progressive Unionist Party (PUP) have shared a platform to reinforce that opposition for the first time. Why are there tensions over the NI Brexit deal? Parties divided on UK call to amend NI Protocol The declaration states: ""We, the undersigned unionist political leaders, affirm our opposition to the Northern Ireland Protocol, its mechanisms and structures and reaffirm our unalterable position that the protocol must be rejected and replaced by arrangements which fully respect Northern Ireland's position as a constituent and integral part of the United Kingdom."" The leaders also appear together in a video. In response, Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said there ""cannot be unilateralism"" with threats to invoke Article 16 of the protocol. Article 16 is a safeguard that allows either side to take action if applying the protocol ""leads to serious economic, societal or environmental difficulties that are liable to persist"". Mr Martin said this would be against the Good Friday Agreement and stressed ""there is a route to getting this resolved"". ""What's extremely important is that we don't do anything to further destabilise the situation,"" he told the DÃ¡il (lower house of the Irish parliament). This five line declaration contains no surprises, nor does it say anything new about how the protocol should be fought. Instead it's meant to affirm that while they disagree on much else the leaders of the DUP, the UUP, the TUV and the PUP are united in opposition to it. In a much longer explanatory note they say the union is both economic and political. Any agreement, they say, which fails to ensure a proportionate and equitable solution respecting the sovereignty of the UK and restoring its unfettered place within the internal market cannot command the support of the unionist community. There has been much talk this week of a unionist pact to fight the forthcoming assembly election but it gets no mention here. The UK has said the protocol's implementation has been ""unbalanced"" and is ""unsustainable"" in its current form and wants fundamental changes to it. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic has said the EU is looking for further flexibilities but will not renegotiate. Earlier in September, DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said his party may quit Stormont ""within weeks"" if its demands over the Northern Ireland Protocol are not met.

"North Korea fires missile, says SouthIt came as North Korea's ambassador to the UN said no-one could deny its right to test weapons.Asia","South Korean television broadcast news of the latest launch with file footage North Korea has fired a short-range missile towards the sea off its east coast early on Tuesday, said South Korea's military. The test happened as North Korea's ambassador said at the UN that no-one could deny Pyongyang's right to self-defence and to test weapons. Earlier this month Pyongyang test-fired both ballistic and cruise missiles. But several days ago North Korea had also expressed willingness to engage in talks with the South. The US military said in a statement on Tuesday that it was aware of the missile launch but that it posed no immediate threat to US personnel or its allies. However, the US Indo-Pacific Command said that the launch ""highlighted the destabilising impact of [North Korea's] illicit weapons program"". On Tuesday, Japanese media quoted the defence ministry as saying that the projectile may have been a ballistic missile, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has ordered Seoul's National Security Council to analyse any intentions behind Pyongyang's latest missile launch and recent statements from Kim Jong-un's powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong. Ms Kim had days earlier saidthey were open to Mr Moon's proposal to formally declare an end to the Korean War, but added that the South needed to stop its ""hostile policies"" first. This video can not be played Why does North Korea keep launching missiles? Shortly after the latest launch, North Korea's envoy Kim Song spoke at the annual UN General Assembly in New York. He said the North had a right to ""develop, test, manufacture and possess"" weapons systems. Mr Kim added that the country was ""building up our national defence in order to defend ourselves and reliably safeguard the security and peace of the country"", according to an AFP report. North Korea has repeatedly accused the South of double standards over military activities. South Korea recentlytested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, which it said was needed as deterrence against North Korea's ""provocations"". EXPLAINER:North Korea's missile and nuclear programme WATCH:Why North Korea keeps launching missiles REALITY CHECK:Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? Separately, North Korea is scheduled to hold a Supreme People's Assembly session on Tuesday. Issues like youth education and changes to the country's economic plans are expected to be brought up at this year's annual session of the rubber-stamp legislature. North Korea is facing food shortages, and has spent more than a year in isolation. It has shut its borders to keep out Covid-19, in the process cutting off trade with its closest ally China. However this has not stopped it from continuing with its weapons programme. In August, the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a ""deeply troubling"" development.

Afghanistan bank boss warns sector near collapse,"A Taliban fighter walks in front of people waiting outside a bank in Kabul Afghanistan's banking system is near to collapse, the boss of one of the nation's biggest lenders has told the BBC. Syed Moosa Kaleem Al-Falahi, the Chief Executive of the Islamic Bank of Afghanistan, said the country's financial industry is in the grip of an ""existential crisis"" as customers panic. ""There's huge withdrawals happening at the moment"", he said, speaking from Dubai, where he is temporarily based because of the chaos in Kabul. ""Only withdrawals are happening, most of the banks are not functioning, and not providing full services,"" he added. Afghanistan's economy was already on shaky ground even before the Taliban took control in August. It is hugely dependent on foreign aid - about 40% of its gross domestic product (GDP) comes from international aid, according to the World Bank. But since the Taliban takeover, the West has frozen international funds, including assets Afghanistan could have accessed with the World Bank and International Monetary Fund (IMF). Islamic Bank of Afghanistan's head office in Kabul Mr Al Falahi says this is encouraging the Taliban to look for other sources of financial support. ""They are looking forward to China and Russia, and some other countries as well. ""...it seems that sooner or later, they will be successful in dialogue,"" he said. China has already talked about its desire to help rebuild Afghanistan, and work with the Taliban. A recenteditorial in the Chinese state-controlled Global Times,externalsaid there is ""huge potential for cooperation in rebuilding Afghanistan"", adding that China is ""definitely a leading player"". China has already pledged 200 million Chinese yuan ($31m, Â£22m) worth of aidincluding food supplies and coronavirus vaccines. Still, the Taliban is under pressure to fix Afghanistan's economic problems now. Inflation is soaring, the Afghani, the country's currency, is plummeting and people are desperate as many have lost their jobs and are short of cash. The United Nations World Food Programme has warned that only 5% of households in Afghanistan have enough to eat every day. Half of those surveyed said they have run out of food altogether at least once in the last two weeks. So accessing international funds and foreign assistance is key to Afghanistan's survival. But countries like the US have said that while they are willing to consider working with the Taliban - it will depend on some pre-conditions - including the regime's treatment of women and minorities. Mr Al Falahi insists that despite statements from the Taliban thatwomen are not allowed to workfor ""a while"", women in his bank are returning to work. Women wait in front of a bank to withdraw money in Kabul ""There was sort of... fear among the women, they were not coming to the offices, but now gradually they started coming to the office,"" he said. Mr Al Falahi comments also chimed with recent statements by the Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan. In a BBC interview Mr Khan said the Taliban are trying to show a more modern and reformed face to the world, in comparison to how they behaved the last time they were in power - a sort of Taliban 2.0. ""At the moment, they are more flexible, they are very cooperative. ""They're not imposing any strict rules and regulations for the time being,"" Mr Khan said. However, women's groups and human rights organisations have pointed to a huge difference between what the Taliban have said and the reality on the ground, with reports of many women and girls now not being allowed to go to school or work.

Starmer faces showdown with left over minimum wage,"Labour members have voted in favour of a Â£15 per hour minimum wage amid a row over the policy at its conference. The vote is not binding, but comes after MP Andy McDonald resigned from shadow cabinet, saying he had been ordered to argue against the rise. The leadership did not encourage members to back or reject the motion. But earlier, Sir Keir Starmer told Sky News he stood by the party's current policy of raising the minimum wage to ""at least"" Â£10 an hour. Left-wingers - including former leader Jeremy Corbyn - had called on Sir Keir to back to larger rise. Mr Corbyn told the BBC it was something the party ""should be supporting and campaigning for"". Starmer: Winning more important than party unity Shadow cabinet member quits in protest at Starmer Labour promises to get more police on the beat Arguments between the left, including supporters of Mr Corbyn, and Labour members loyal to Sir Keir have dominated the party conference in Brighton. Sir Keir pushed through reforms to the party election rules,seen as unfavourable to left-wing members of Labour,in a vote on Sunday. This video can not be played Andy McDonald MP: ""Is it unreasonable to expect our key workers not to have that level of pay?"" The Unite union put forward a motion calling for the minimum wage to increase to Â£15 to a vote on Tuesday. The current minimum wage is Â£8.91 for those 23 and over, Â£8.36 for those aged 21 and 22, and Â£6.56 for 18 to 20-year olds. What is the minimum wage? The wide-ranging Unite motion also said that, for Labour to win the next election, it ""must be an anti-austerity party, defending jobs and improving living standards"". Labour pledges Â£28bn a year to make economy greener Labour: Has Starmer stood by his pledges? And it included demands for stronger union rights, higher taxes ""on the very wealthiest"", an end to zero-hour contracts and a ""better work-life balance"". But asked about the wage rise earlier, Sir Keir said: ""It should be a Â£10 minimum wage - that's a 12% increase [meaning] Â£2000 a year for working families."" Before the vote, shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said the party leadership was ""perfectly happy"" for conference delegates to back the Â£15 motion. However, he said Labour would only reassess its current policy closer to the next general election, adding this was the ""responsible thing to do"". But Mr Corbyn called for the party to commit to a Â£6 an hour rise in the minimum wage now. Speaking at a fringe event alongside Labour's conference, the former leader told the BBC: ""We live in a low-wage economy and a low-wage economy leads to poverty. We live in a society now with more food banks than branches of McDonald's. That's where we have got to."" Mr Corbyn also praised Mr McDonald, saying he had ""huge admiration"" for the MP, adding: ""He went through a lot of trauma [on Monday] because he did not in all conscience feel he could go and say that he was opposed to Â£15 minimum wage because he is not. ""He supports it, so he took the decision he did to resign. I fully support him."" Sir Keir was a member of Mr Corbyn's shadow cabinet during the run-up to the 2019 election Raising the minimum wage was not one of the 10 pledges Sir Keir made when running for the Labour leadership last year. But he supported a campaign in 2019 for fast food chain McDonald's to improve pay and conditions. At the time, he said: ""They're not asking for the Earth. They're asking for the basics - Â£15 an hour, the right to know their hours in advance and to have trade union recognition. That ought to be the norm in 21st Century Britain."" But on Tuesday, Sir Keir said his comments were in relation to ""particular industrial disputes at McDonald's"", adding: ""I backed them in that and I'd back them again today in relation to that the minimum wage, [but] across the whole of the economy is a completely different issue."" In a scathing resignation letter, Mr McDonald claimed the leader's office had instructed him go to a meeting at the party conference and ""argue against a national minimum wage of Â£15 an hour and against statutory sick pay at the living wage"". ""After many months of a pandemic when we made commitments to stand by key workers, I cannot now look those same workers in the eye and tell them they are not worth a wage that is enough to live on, or that they don't deserve security when they are ill,"" the former shadow employment secretary added. Mr Corbyn also backed the so-called ""McStrike"" in 2019, but his policy as leader was for at least Â£10 minimum wage - also Labour's current position.

Big demand as high street voucher site opens,"This video can not be played ""It's their dream and their livelihoods"" Almost 500,000 requests have been made for Northern Ireland's high street voucher scheme - but  some people complained that they could not access the website used for the process. Everyone aged 18 and over can apply for a Â£100 ""spend local"" card to use in shops before the end of November. There were problems withthe application page on the NI Direct site,externalafter it opened on Monday morning. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said ""not everybody has to rush at once"" to it. Some people complained on social media that the website had crashed on them while others said they had not received a verification message after entering their email address. Speaking to BBC News NI's Evening Extra programme on Monday, Mr Lyons acknowledged there was ""huge demand"". By Monday evening, there had been 475,081 requests for an applications link, 200,994 links issued and almost 97,000 applications completed, he said. Mr Lyons said the verification messages were being sent ""in a staged process just to make sure the website isn't overwhelmed all at once"". He added that almost 15% of the population had started their applications. ""There is a card available for everyone that is eligible so I would encourage people to apply for that over the coming weeks,"" he said. Economy Minister Gordon Lyons has been promoting the voucher scheme in recent weeks The cards are expected to arrive between seven and 10 days after you apply. They can be used in any shop with a card machine but cannot be used online or for gambling or legal services like penalties. A phone application service will open on 11 October for anyone who does not have access to the internet. The online and phone application processes will remain open until 25 October. Q&A: How can I get a high street voucher card? The Â£145m scheme is designed to boost activity in businesses hit hardest by the coronavirus pandemic, like non-essential retail and hospitality. High streets and town centres were already facing a tough time before the pandemic began with the rise in online shopping. It is hoped the voucher scheme will encourage more people to go out to shops, which could help the economic recovery. There has been a warning, however, that fraudsters may attempt to target the scheme. Eddie Lynch, the commissioner for older people, said there had been reports of cold callers in Newtownards attempting to scam people out of handing over their bank details after promising to help with their applications. ""We have seen this all too often over many years where people latch on to issues and try to target older people and others to scam them from their money,"" he said. ""It's about raising the awareness of that and making sure people are vigilant. ""If anyone does call you to help you with this scheme that you don't know, just either close the door or put down the phone."" It's finally here after almost a year - the high street voucher scheme was first suggested last November. Timing is key for this policy in order to make sure it has the maximum economic impact. But as we head into this winter, the wider economic conditions mean consumers are facing a ""cost-of-living crunch"". Things like rising energy bills as well as an end to both the furlough scheme and uplift in universal credit mean many consumers won't be able to afford to spend their Â£100 on a treat. They may instead be forced to spend it on essentials, for example a weekly grocery shop in one of the big supermarkets which were never forced to close. The scheme's success will depend on how and where shoppers choose to spend their Â£100. Linda McHenry, who owns a women's clothes shop in Ballymoney, County Antrim, said she hoped people would think of the card as a bonus. ""Support your local independent shops - this is their dream, it's their livelihood,"" she said. ""Come out and experience again what it's like to physically shop for the day."" Some businesses are already working on incentives and offers to try to encourage people to choose to spend with them. One shop owner said: ""If they don't come and support independents, there won't be any."" For example, one electronics retailer is already offering customers an additional 10% discount. Shop owner Andy Kilpatrick said: ""We want to help shoppers make their voucher go that little bit further. ""We appreciate it's also tough times for people out there looking for Christmas presents and things so by giving an extra 10% that could help improve people's shopping budgets."" President of Ballymoney Chamber of Commerce Winifred Mellett said the town's independent retailers were providing ""brilliant promotions"". ""I'm not going to tell you what they are at the moment because we are going to wait for a few days and then surprise everybody,"" she said. Ms Mellett also owns a women's clothes shop in the town, and has worked on the shop floor for decades. ""We felt that shoppers were drifting away from independent shops and now, all of a sudden, they are coming back and that's a feeling that's come from Covid,"" she said. ""If they don't come and support independents there won't be any and what would the high street be like? ""Everybody loves a wee bit of shopping."" Some businesses are working on offers to try to encourage people to choose to spend with them Londonderry Chamber of Commerce chief, Paul Clancy, said the voucher scheme has been ""badly needed"". ""It is great to have a real positive story for the High Street, to get people back on the High Street and increase the footfall. ""We would love to see it spent in the local, smaller shops that have really struggled, that would be great. But at the end of the day money going back anywhere into the local economy is good for everybody,"" he said. The trade organisation Retail NI has urged shoppers to spend their voucher cards in locally-owned, independent shops. Its chief executive Glyn Roberts also expressed some concern that the online portal could be overwhelmed if everyone tries to apply as soon as it opens to the public. ""With a scheme of this ambition and size we are bound to experience some problems and would urge shoppers to be patient,"" he said. ""If people can wait a few days before making their application, hopefully we can avoid any delays or problems with a rush on the online portal and they will receive their voucher on a timely basis."" Mr Roberts also said that 70p in every Â£1 spent with an independent retailer ""is recycled around the economy, supporting local producers and manufacturers"". ""As the scheme opens and consumers are thinking about how to spend their voucher, we would strongly encourage them to use with local independent retailers,"" he added. AodhÃ¡n Connolly, director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said the voucher scheme would provide a ""welcome boost"" during a ""lull time in retail and hospitality"". ""For me, the main thing about this is to get people back on the high streets, to get them to rediscover the high streets and actually one of the knock-ons from this is that people can see it is safe and welcoming to return to high streets across Northern Ireland,"" he told BBC News NI. ""As long as they are spending it on bricks and mortar retail, that's all that we can ask."" Q&A: How can I get Â£100 high street voucher card?

Energy costs could see sisters have to leave home,"This video can not be played The sisters need 38 machines running 24 hours a day to keep them alive The parents of two severely ill girls say soaring energy prices have left them struggling to meet bills for life-saving equipment. Pam and Mark Gleave, from Amlwch, on Anglesey, have three adopted children who all depend on 24-hour life support. Their energy bills have increased recently due to the children's medical needs becoming greater. Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board (BCUHB) said it would contact the family to see how it could help them. Gas and electricity prices have risen in the UK this yeardue to a number of factors. The couple, who have two grown-up biological children, adopted their children after some time fostering. Katie, 19, and Kelly, 14, have PEHO syndrome - a rare and degenerative neurological condition which means they cannot walk or talk, and need constant care. Mason, 12, has complex medical needs due to brain damage and is currently at Alder Hey Children's Hospital in Liverpool. Kelly, Katie and Mason Gleave all rely on life-support machines which require a lot of electricity In the daughters' room alone there are more than 60 plugs for medical equipment. Gas prices: 'I'm just watching the meter go up' Parents with learning disabilities 'set up to fail' Learning disability work 'barrier' Ms Gleave said: ""Our electricity bill alone is Â£776 a month - that doesn't include heating or anything else. ""It's not normal for a family to have 38 pieces of medical equipment running 24 hours a day. ""We see things are going up and up. Where are we going to find that money?"" Mr Gleave, 61, was made redundant two years ago and was planning to use the money he received to pay off the mortgage, but since then the children's health has deteriorated and all three are on life-support machines at their home. Pam Gleave said they are using her husband's redundancy pay to meet the costs The machines must be charged constantly and back-up batteries are needed in case of a power cut. ""It's extremely difficult,"" said Ms Gleave. ""When Mark worked it wasn't an issue, he used to work seven days a week, we never asked for anything from anybody."" The family said if the children were being cared for in hospital, it would cost the health service about Â£2,000. But Ms Gleave said while they has discussed the option of hospital care as the bills mount: ""That's never going to happen - we would never let that happen."" She toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""We have got things that we would sell before that would even be a thought in my mind. ""We'd sell the house first."" All the carers and equipment are funded by Betsi Cadwaladr Health Board, but the equipment running costs are the parents' responsibility, and the couple fear they will not be able to cope without financial help. They have asked for guidance from health staff but feel lost and do not know who to turn to for help. Ms Gleave said: ""All we are asking for - is there some way we can get some support, because it's not normal to have that amount of bills just to keep the children at home. ""For us it's all about keeping the children at home. It's about giving them to good quality of life. ""We've got a wonderful social worker, and I do know they are trying to look into it. But they, I think, are in the same boat as us. It's not happened before - so where do we go?"" Kelly Gleave and her siblings are all on home life support Another concern is that the children's room in the conservatory is in poor condition and needs the roof replacing, but they do not want the move their children into separate rooms or into areas not adapted for them. She said: ""We seem to be fighting, and not getting the answers that we need. ""It's not about complaining or moaning, people have been wonderful, our social worker, our ventilator nurse. It's just we don't know where to turn, that's the honest truth, we don't know what to do. ""We don't know what the next few months is going to bring for the children, and that's a real worry. ""I would not in any way swap our lives with these beautiful children that are so amazing and keep you grounded. ""In a world that we live in today, honestly, they are amazing, wonderful children.""

Call for Â£60m a year to keep Wales' coal tips safe,"This video can not be played In February, 60,000 tonnes slipped down the hillside at Tylorstown The UK government should provide an extra Â£60m a year to keep Wales' coal tips safe, Welsh ministers have said. Finance Minister Rebecca Evans said the UK government had a ""moral responsibility"" to provide long-term funding. Almost 300 tipswere revealed this year to be at ""high-risk"" by an investigation prompted by a landslip in Tylorstown caused by Storm Dennis. The UK government said it had provided funding in the wake of the storms. But a spokesman added the management of the tips was devolved, and the Welsh government was ""more than adequately funded"" to meet its responsibilities. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said last October said that it was the Welsh government's job toremediate old tips. However, the Welsh government said reclamation costs are on a scale in excess of anything anticipated when devolution began in 1999, and is urging the UK government to share responsibility. For its part,the UK government provided Â£2.5mto clear 60,000 tonnes of collapsed spoil from the tip at Tylorstown, in Rhondda, and has provided Â£9m overall. But the Welsh government said Â£500m to Â£600m was needed over the next 10 to 15 years, and asked for its budget to be raised by Â£60m a year annually. Securing 2,000 coal tips 'could cost over Â£500m' Almost 300 old coal tips classed as 'high-risk' Plans to overhaul 'outdated' Aberfan coal tip laws Ms Evans called for Chancellor Rishi Sunak to use his autumn spending review to allocate long-term funding. ""Wales is disproportionately affected by the legacy of coal mining, and climate impacts are increasing the risks disused coal tips pose to our communities,"" she said. ""As a pre-devolution issue, we need the UK government to share responsibility and prevent another landslip from happening. ""The UK government has a legal and moral responsibility to work with the Welsh government to address this issue and fund these long-term costs."" Wales has more than 2,000 coal tips - most are around the south Wales valleys At a briefing, she sought to reassure people living near high-risk tips - saying councils had been told they won't have to worry about where the money will come from if urgent work is needed. Ms Evans said the classification of high-risk did not mean a tip posed an ""imminent risk"". ""What it does mean is that those coal tips will require more frequent inspections to ensure safety,"" she told a press briefing. Later she said the next round of inspections of higher-risk tips will start next week, and she said there is a free helpline residents can call if they are concerned about a coal-tip in their locality. She warned other parts of the Welsh government's budget like school building could have to be ""cut"" if extra money is not forthcoming from Westminster. Ms Evans said there would be some ""really difficult choices to be made"". Wales has more than 2,000 coal tips. Most are on private land and most are around the south Wales valleys. Of those, 294 are categorised as ""high-risk"", meaning they could endanger life or property. Seventy are in Caerphilly, 64 in Rhondda Cynon Taf, 59 in Merthyr Tydfil, 42 in Bridgend, 35 in Neath Port Talbot, 16 in Blaenau Gwent and eight in Swansea. An investigation, conducted by the Welsh and UK governments, the Coal Authority, local councils and other bodies, concluded current legislation surrounding tips was ""neither sufficiently robust or fit for purpose in relation to inspection and maintenance"". A consultation has been looking at new Welsh laws to set up a new system toinspect coal tips. In response, a UK government spokesman said it had given Â£31m of additional funding to the Welsh government to help with the impact of Storm Dennis, of which Â£9m was to repair coal tips. ""Ultimately, however, the management of coal tips in Wales is a devolved matter and therefore not one the UK government would expect to provide additional funding for,"" he said. ""The Welsh government is more than adequately funded to manage the costs of devolved responsibilities. ""Their 2021-22 spending review settlement provides around Â£123 per person for every Â£100 of equivalent funding in England. This is around Â£1bn more than the agreed level of fair funding for Wales relative to England as set out in the fiscal framework."" In a Senedd debate on the subject on Tuesday afternoon Plaid Cymru's Delyth Jewell accused Westminster politicians of squabbling about the cost. ""Should it really fall to the local authorities of communities that were plundered for their coal and saw none of the profits invested back."" But Welsh Conservative shadow minister for climate change Janet Finch Saunders said it is ""down to the Welsh government to manage any long-term costs"". Rishi Sunak's spending review is scheduled for 27 October, and will set out the funding available to the Welsh government for three years to 2024-25. The UK government provides much of the Welsh government's Â£17bn annual budget. The Welsh government said it would also be asking the UK government to address ""historic underfunding"" in rail infrastructure and ""replace EU farm funding in full"".

Distancing in Northern Ireland shops and theatres scrapped,"Theatres have said they are at breaking point because of the 1m social distancing rule Stormont ministers have agreed to end social distancing restrictions for shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings in Northern Ireland. The executive has asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. But this will be advice and not legally enforceable. Ministers did not consider social distancing in the hospitality sector during Monday's virtual meeting. Instead, this will be further discussed on 7 October, First Minister Paul Givansaid in a social media post,external. He added that the changes for indoor seated venues, indoor visitor attractions and retail settings will take effect from 18:00 BST on 30 September.That is the date when the UK-wide furlough scheme ends. Social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) has been a legal requirement in many indoor premises in Northern Ireland. However, those who run venues hosting concerts, conferences and theatres in Northern Ireland have said they are at  breaking point because of the rule. While social distancing measures are to be removed, the executive agreed that face coverings will remain a legal requirement in retail settings and for indoor attractions. They also called for people ""to utilise all other available mitigations such as hand sanitising, good ventilation, and using one-way systems where possible"". Hospitality businesses like pubs and cafes have to serve fewer customers because of social distancing rules BBC News NI's Political Editor Enda McClafferty said it is understood venues will be under no legal obligations to put mitigation measures in place, rather, this will be on an ""opt-in"" basis. On proof of Covid status for entry, he said: ""Venues have been asked to put in place a number of mitigations including proof of being fully vaccinated, proof of a negative lateral flow test or proof of natural immunity through a positive Covid PCR test within the previous six months."" Business groups have previously asked for the law to be relaxed as it is affecting trade. Hospitality businesses are having to serve fewer customers in order to adhere to social distancing rules and venues cannot operate to their full capacity, meaning a drop in revenue from ticket sales. For weeks, Northern Ireland's First Minister Paul Givan has been urging his executive colleagues to relax the rules, previously saying that he wanted to see all Covid-19 restrictions lifted by the end of September. His party colleague, Economy Minister Gordon Lyons said on Monday that he ""wanted to see movement"" on social distancing rules ""as soon as we can"". ""I have been contacted by a number of people who work in that industry who are concerned about the impact that these restrictions continue to have on the viability of their events and on their businesses as well,"" he added. However, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has previously argued for a more ""cautious approach"", expressing concern about infection rates and the knock-on effect on hospitals. England, Scotland and Wales have already lifted a number of social distancing requirements England abolished its mandatory social distancing measures on19 July, with a small number of exceptions for settings like hospitals, care homes and border control posts. Wales lifted its legal requirements on social distancing on7 August, leaving it to individual businesses to decide their own rules after risk assessments. Scotland dropped its social distancing requirements on9 August, but a 2m (6ft) rule remains in place for Scottish healthcare settings such as hospitals, doctors' surgeries and dentists. The business group Hospitality Ulster has been a vocal critic of Stormont's social distancing rules. After last Thursday's executive meeting, Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said he was ""hugely disappointed by the lack of movement"" on Covid-19 restrictions. The EU's Digital Covid Certificate is being rolled out across EU member states Meanwhile, the SDLP said Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon had been ""blocked"" in her efforts to introduce a vaccine certification scheme for entry to some venues where social distancing measures will soon be removed. Ms Mallon argued against a proposal from the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in which will see social distancing measures dropped in indoor seated venues without the requirement of vaccine certification. Speaking after the executive's announcement, her party leader Colum Eastwood said it had been a ""moment to act"" and such a programme could have increased vaccine uptake, ""particularly in younger age groups"". ""It is astounding and reckless that DUP and Sinn FÃ©in ministers have kicked the can down the road instead of bringing certainty and clarity,"" he explained. ""Not only does this offer no incentive for vaccination it puts the onus entirely on businesses themselves. ""This is a cop out and another failure of leadership."" Previously, Sinn FÃ©in said it would support a proposal for vaccine passports to gain access to pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland if it was recommended by Stormont health officials.

"North Korea fires projectile, says South","South Korean television broadcast news of the latest launch with file footage North Korea has fired a short-range missile towards the sea off its east coast early on Tuesday, said South Korea's military. The test happened as North Korea's ambassador said at the UN that no-one could deny Pyongyang's right to self-defence and to test weapons. Earlier this month Pyongyang test-fired both ballistic and cruise missiles. But several days ago North Korea had also expressed willingness to engage in talks with the South. The US military said in a statement on Tuesday that it was aware of the missile launch but that it posed no immediate threat to US personnel or its allies. However, the US Indo-Pacific Command said that the launch ""highlighted the destabilising impact of [North Korea's] illicit weapons program"". On Tuesday, Japanese media quoted the defence ministry as saying that the projectile may have been a ballistic missile, which is banned under United Nations sanctions. South Korean President Moon Jae-in has ordered Seoul's National Security Council to analyse any intentions behind Pyongyang's latest missile launch and recent statements from Kim Jong-un's powerful sister, Kim Yo-jong. Ms Kim had days earlier saidthey were open to Mr Moon's proposal to formally declare an end to the Korean War, but added that the South needed to stop its ""hostile policies"" first. This video can not be played Why does North Korea keep launching missiles? Shortly after the latest launch, North Korea's envoy Kim Song spoke at the annual UN General Assembly in New York. He said the North had a right to ""develop, test, manufacture and possess"" weapons systems. Mr Kim added that the country was ""building up our national defence in order to defend ourselves and reliably safeguard the security and peace of the country"", according to an AFP report. North Korea has repeatedly accused the South of double standards over military activities. South Korea recentlytested its first submarine-launched ballistic missile, which it said was needed as deterrence against North Korea's ""provocations"". EXPLAINER:North Korea's missile and nuclear programme WATCH:Why North Korea keeps launching missiles REALITY CHECK:Why doesn't North Korea have enough food? Separately, North Korea is scheduled to hold a Supreme People's Assembly session on Tuesday. Issues like youth education and changes to the country's economic plans are expected to be brought up at this year's annual session of the rubber-stamp legislature. North Korea is facing food shortages, and has spent more than a year in isolation. It has shut its borders to keep out Covid-19, in the process cutting off trade with its closest ally China. However this has not stopped it from continuing with its weapons programme. In August, the UN atomic agency said North Korea appeared to have restarted a reactor which could produce plutonium for nuclear weapons, calling it a ""deeply troubling"" development.
