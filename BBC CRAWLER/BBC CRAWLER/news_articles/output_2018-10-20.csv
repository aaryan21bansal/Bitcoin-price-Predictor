Blanchett defends straight actors' gay roles,"Cate Blanchett has defended straight actors playing gay roles in film and TV. Hollywood has been criticised for giving LGBT roles to straight actors and earlier this year Scarlett Johanssonpulled out of playing a trans characterfollowing a backlash. Blanchett played a lesbian in 2015's Carol. She said: ""I will fight to the death for the right to suspend disbelief and play roles beyond my experience."" The Australian actress disagrees with the idea that a performer only really knows a character if they have shared experiences. Rooney Mara and Cate Blanchett played lesbians in Carol, based on a novel about forbidden love between two women ""Reality television and all that that entails had an extraordinary impact, a profound impact on the way we view the creation of character,"" she said during a Q&A at the Rome Film Festival. ""I think it provides a lot of opportunity, but the downside of it is that we now, particularly in America, we expect and only expect people to make a profound connection to a character when it's close to their experience."" When Scarlett Johansson was announced as the lead actor in a film about 1970s Pittsburgh crime boss Dante ""Tex"" Gill, who was born Jean Gill, some said it showed the limited opportunities given to transgender actors. Pointing to other actors who've played trans roles, Johansson said of her critics: ""Tell them that they can be directed to Jeffrey Tambor, Jared Leto, and Felicity Huffman's reps for comment.""

TV to get its first transgender superhero Trace Lysette, who stars in the Amazon series Transparent, said it was representative of a wider problem in Hollywood. ""I wouldn't be as upset if I was getting in the same rooms as Jennifer Lawrence and Scarlett for cis roles, but we know that's not the case,"" she tweeted. ""A mess."" Cisgender describes someone who is not transgender. It applies to an individual whose gender matches their ""assigned"" sex at birth. In her second statement announcing she'd no longer be playing the role, Johansson said she'd ""learned a lot"" from the trans community and was glad there had been a ""larger conversation about diversity and representation in film"". ""While I would have loved the opportunity to bring Dante's story and transition to life, I understand why many feel he should be portrayed by a transgender person."" Sir Ian McKellen has criticised Hollywood's record on gay actors Sir Ian McKellen is an actor who's been critical of Hollywood's attitude to gay actors in the past. He's pointed out that no openly gay man has ever won the Academy Award for best actor, but straight actors have taken home the prize for playing LGBT roles. Tom Hanks won it for Philadelphia and Sean Penn scooped it for Milk. In total, 52 straight people have been Oscar-nominated for playing gay characters, including Cate Blanchett for her portrayal in Carol.

Bid to stop NI officials acting on backstop,"Steve Baker urged the prime minister to change her Brexit plan earlier this month A Tory ex-minister is trying to put a block on the EU's controversial proposals for a ""backstop"" to guarantee no hard Irish border after Brexit. Steve Baker has put down amendments to the Northern Ireland bill, which is to be discussed in Parliament next week. He wants to make it a legal requirement to get the Stormont Assembly's approval for any plan to treat Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK. But the devolved government has not sat since power-sharing collapsed in 2017. The bill aims to give its civil servants greater flexibility in making decisions, in the absence of government. However, it has drawn the attention of those arguing over plans for the UK's future trading relationship with the EU. Politicians criticise NI secretary's bill Brexit: All you need to know Q&A: The Irish border Brexit backstop Both the EU and UK are signed up to the need for a ""backstop"" - effectively an insurance policy to avoid the introduction of checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic - which is an EU member - after Brexit. During the ""transition period"" after the UK leaves the EU in March 2019 until 31 December 2020, the UK's relationship with the EU will stay largely the same - something designed to smooth the path to a future permanent relationship between them. But if there is a gap between the transition period ending, and the ""future relationship"" coming into force, the backstop would ensure no hard border in the meantime. The EU and UK are agreed there can be no return to a hard border - but disagree over how the backstop should operate. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The government has proposed a backstop which would effectively keep the whole of the UK in the EU customs union for a limited period, until a comprehensive agreement is reached. Under the EU's idea of a contingency plan, Northern Ireland would remain in the EU's customs union, large parts of the single market and the EU VAT system - something the UK says is unacceptable as it would create a new border down the Irish Sea, between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. Mr Baker, the Tory MP for Wycombe and deputy chairman of the Conservative pro-Brexit European Research Group of Tory MPs. said his amendments would ensure that ""emergency powers"" could not be used to implement measures in the absence of an assembly. ""Northern Ireland is an integral part of the UK."" ""Creating barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, creating a separate regulatory regime or imposing EU laws on Northern Ireland via emergency legislation does not respect Northern Ireland's status in the UK."" Karen Bradley will table the Northen Ireland bill and believes it will provide an opportunity to restart political talks BBC political correspondent Jessica Parker said it was unclear what level of support there was for the amendments. ""But negotiators may not welcome any attempt to impose legal limits on the talks which are already at an impasse,"" she added. A government statement said the Northern Ireland bill is intended to provide civil servants with the ""certainty and clarity"" they needed to deliver public services. ""It enables key appointments that cannot currently be made in the absence of Northern Ireland ministers to be made during the period before an executive is next formed,"" the statement added. ""The bill also creates the necessary time and space to restart political talks with the aim of restoring devolved government as soon as possible.""

Sturgeon boycotts event in far-right row,"Steve Bannon left his White House job amid reports of a power struggle Nicola Sturgeon has pulled out of a conference in Edinburgh next month because Donald Trump's ex-strategist Steve Bannon was also due to speak. The first minister had been scheduled to take part in the three-day News Xchange event, which is being co-hosted by the BBC, on 13 November. However, she said that giving Mr Bannon a platform risked ""legitimising or normalising far-right, racist views"". Steve Bannon was one of Donald Trump's most trusted aides until August 2017. He left the US government after losing his seat on the National Security Council amid claims of a power struggle among President Trump's top team. Since leaving the White House, Mr Bannon has continued to champion right-wing political causes, although his appearance at events has proved controversial. In September he was disinvited from the New Yorker Festivalafter a high-profile backlash by actor Jim Carrey, producer Judd Apatow and presenter Jimmy Fallon. Nicola Sturgeon said Steve Bannon's inclusion in the event risked normalising far-right views. Nicola Sturgeon was due to be introduced by the BBC's Scotland editor Sarah Smith on the opening evening of the conference on 13 November. Steve Bannon is expected to take part in a session the next morning, which is also due to be moderated by Sarah Smith at the Edinburgh International Conference Centre. In a tweet, Ms Sturgeon said she regretted the position she had been put in by the BBC. She said: ""I believe passionately in free speech but as @ScotGovFM I have to make balanced judgments - and I will not be part of any process that risks legitimising or normalising far right, racist views. I regret that the BBC has put me and others in this position."" She also attacked the event's description of Mr Bannon as a ""powerful and influential figure...promoting an anti-elite movement."" She added: ""This kind of language to describe views that many would describe as fascist does seem to me to run the risk of normalisation."" The event is due to be moderated by BBC Scotland editor Sarah Smith In a statement the BBC said Steve Bannon had been invited on behalf of the European Broadcasting Union's (EBU) News Xchange committee. They added: ""Good journalism in a world of fake news and disinformation is more vital than ever. ""Journalism is about asking tough questions and understanding what is happening in the world and why. ""A conference designed to analyse the big issues impacting that world isn't an endorsement of anyone or anything - it is a function of what journalism is."" Event organisers, the EBU, said Mr Bannon was a ""key influencer"" in the rise of populism. ""We also consider it our journalistic responsibility to share and scrutinise a range of relevant viewpoints within the framework of a balanced debate"", they added.

Prince Harry launches Invictus Games,"Prince Harry has praised the dedication of those taking part in the Invictus Games for injured service personnel. Speaking at the opening ceremony, he said those taking part had turned the games into a ""symbol of... honour and optimism for a new generation"". He also told the crowd outside Sydney Opera House that he and Meghan were happy to share the ""personal joy"" of her pregnancy while in Australia. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on a 16-day tour of Australasia. Closing the ceremony, which was delayed for an hour by thunderstorms, Prince Harry said: ""Be inspired. Get excited. Allow the example of service and determination you will see, to change something big or small in your own lives."" The duke said: ""I have been so proud to be able to introduce my wife to you and we have been so happy to be able to celebrate the personal joy of our newest addition with you all."" It comes a year after the couple made their first official public appearance at the event when it was held in Toronto. The Invictus Games were started by Prince Harry in 2014. Prince Harry and Meghan were greeted by huge cheers at the opening ceremony Kensington Palace shared a picture of Meghan watching Prince Harry practising his opening ceremony speech The Invictus Games will see athletes from 18 countries compete in 11 sports over eight days. The duke, who served in the Army for 10 years, founded the Invictus Games in 2014 with the aim of helping wounded service personnel and veterans with their physical and psychological rehabilitation. That year the games were held in London, before heading to Florida in 2016 and Toronto last year. Last year's Invictus Games saw Prince Harry and Meghan make their first official public appearance together Twelve months on from their first official appearance together, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have since married and announced they are expecting a child in spring. By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent This was not the barnstormingspeech that Harry delivered in Toronto last year.This was something different. This was a speech for the head as well as the heart. This was redefining the Invictus Games and those who participated as a new generation - what the duke called the Invictus generation. Their dedication, said the duke, had been for too long overlooked. He spoke of the topic closest to his heart - what he called ""hidden emotional and mental wounds"". And he told the audience that the Invictus generation were not to be pitied, but to be respected and admired, ""an antidote to the narrative of division and despair we too often allow to define our era"". No longer wounded warriors, but exemplars of the highest ideals of sacrifice, courage and achievement - the duke's Invictus generation. Earlier, they paid their respects to Australia and New Zealand's war heroes. They were joined by the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for the opening of a memorial which commemorates those who fell in World War One, as well as conflicts including Korea, Afghanistan and Iraq. Harry and Meghan joined the Australian prime minister for the opening of the Anzac memorial Harry and Meghan later laid a wreath - their first as a married couple Harry and Meghan then took in the first event of the Invictus Games - the Jaguar Land Rover Driving Challenge at the city's Cockatoo Island. The duke presented medals to the winning teams, as well as testing his driving skills on the children's remote control car course.

Anonymous Pro-Brexit ads say 'bin Chequers',"Political groups have been spending increasing amounts of money on Facebook adverts An anonymous website has been using Facebook adverts to encourage British voters to email their MP and urge them ""to bin Chequers"" and back Brexit. Evidence given to the government's fake news inquiry found that a site called Mainstream Network had spent more than Â£250,000 on the pro-Brexit campaign. No information is available to say who owns or funds Mainstream Network. It comes asFacebook announced new rules around political advertising- and its funding - earlier this week. The site now requires political advertisers to prove their identity and that they are based in the UK, before they can run political adverts. It also requires them to publicly declare who paid for the adverts before they can run. Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons culture select committee, said: ""Here we have an example of a clearly sophisticated organisation spending lots of money on a political campaign, and we have absolutely no idea who is behind it."" ""The only people who know who is paying for these adverts is Facebook,"" added Mr Collins, whose committee has been investigating so-called fake news. Facebook hires Sir Nick Clegg Fake news 'crowding out' real news On the verge of a nervous Brexit breakdown? Mr Collins, and fellow committee member Paul Farrelly, are among many MPs whose constituents have been targeted by the Facebook ads. Campaign group 89up, which uncovered the digital adverts and shared their analysis with the select committee, say the adverts are designed ""to specifically influence MPs"". When clicked on, the advert takes users to a page on their local constituency and MP. Another click generates a pre-written email to their MP, demanding they ""tell the prime minister to bin the Chequers deal"" - Theresa May's Brexit proposal set out at her country residence Chequers - and to ""deliver full Brexit"". The email also adds Mainstream Network into the blind address field, meaning the website receives a copy of the user's message. Researchers at 89up estimate that the Mainstream Network has spent up to Â£257,000 to promote posts across the social network, potentially reaching almost 11 million people in the process. It also suggests the practice of copying in Mainstream Network to the emails may result in a GDPR breach. Analysis by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent Last week, Facebook launched its new transparency code for political advertising in the UK. Now that code, which is meant to show just how ads are targeted and who is paying for them, faces its first test. The system also requires any organisation wanting to place a political advert to provide proof of their identity and location. But here's the problem - the ""chuck Chequers"" ads were posted before the code came into effect. Search the new Facebook archive of UK political ads and you won't find anything from the Mainstream Network. But even in the future the identity of organisations paying for ads could remain murky to Facebook users - a label saying ""Paid for by the Mainstream Network"" will not reveal much about the origins of the money spent. The ""chuck Chequers"" campaign could however be of interest to two regulators. The Electoral Commission may see this as further evidence that it needs more powers to force political advertisers to reveal their identities, and the Information Commissioner will want to examine any breach of the new GDPR data rules. And for one man with a great interest in both politics and social media this all comes at a tricky time. Former deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg starts his new job as Facebook's global communications chief on Monday - instead of escaping the politics of Brexit he will find it on the top of his in-tray. ""While debate on one of the central issues facing our country is part of a thriving democracy, there is an important question of where campaigning stops and political advertising starts,"" said Mr Collins. ""Facebook has recently announced a set of changes to increase transparency around political advertising on its platform. ""This example offers Facebook an opportunity to show it is committed to making that change happen - if you are targeted with a message or asked to lobby your MP, you should know exactly who is behind the organisation asking you to do it."" Facebook's Rob Leathern said ""new requirements"" would be coming into effect on 7 November, meaning political adverts on the site would be obliged to carry a message saying who paid for it. ""Advertisers will need to confirm their identity and location through an authorisations process and accurately represent the organization or person paying for the ad in a disclaimer. ""These steps must happen or the advertiser will be prevented from running ads related to politics on Facebook,"" said Mr Leathern, director of product management. ""We know we can't prevent election interference alone and offering more ad transparency allows journalists, researchers and other interested parties to raise important questions.""

Flight abandoned after bird strike,"The bird strike happened during take-off from Sumburgh Airport A flight carrying 40 passengers and three crew was forced to return to Sumburgh Airport in Shetland after being hit by birds at 1,500ft. Loganair flight LM438 was en-route to Glasgow when the incident happened on Friday shortly after take-off. Passengers reported seeing flames and onboard crew received an alert about the aircraft's left-hand engine. Loganair said the Saab 2000 landed safely and aid from standby emergency vehicles was not required. The affected plane has been removed from service for further tests to be carried out. Passengers on board the flight reported hearing a bang and smelling fuel moments after the aircraft left the runway. Mia Sutherland, 15, who was travelling with her parents, told the BBC she saw flames on the outside of the plane. She said: ""Just when we were levelling out there was a bang followed by a short outburst of flames and then a horrible fuelly smell came into where the passengers were. ""Everyone was panicking and going 'what was that?'"". ""Everyone was looking out windows and probably about 10 or 15 minutes later the pilot came on and said that we were going back to Sumburgh because of a technical fault and then when we got back they said they had hit a bird.

Turkey 'to reveal all' on Khashoggi death,"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Turkey has vowed to reveal all details about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after Saudi Arabia admitted for the first time he had been killed in its consulate in Istanbul. ""Turkey will never allow a cover-up,"" a ruling party spokesperson said. Saudi Arabia suggested on Friday Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi critic, had died in a ""fist fight"". Turkish officials previously said he had been deliberately killed inside the consulate, and his body dismembered. Earlier this week, unnamed Turkish officials told media outlets they had audio and visual evidence to prove this. The Saudi kingdom has come under intense pressure to explain Mr Khashoggi's disappearance after he entered the Istanbul consulate on 2 October to seek paperwork for his forthcoming marriage. Until Friday, it had denied knowledge of his whereabouts and insisted he had left the building alive. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Khashoggi suspect had 'cyber spy' training Turkish police and prosecutors have been searching the consulate as well as the consul's residence this week for evidence of what unfolded. On Friday they widened their search to a nearby forest, where unnamed officials believe his body may have been disposed of. The kingdom says a fight broke out between Mr Khashoggi, who had fallen out of favour with the Saudi government, and people who met him in the consulate - ending with his death. It says investigations are under way, and so far 18 Saudi nationals have been arrested. Unnamed officials speaking to Reuters news agency and the New York Times say the Saudis did not know the whereabouts of the body after it was handed to a ""local collaborator"" to dispose of. In addition to the arrests, two senior officials have been sacked over the affair - deputy intelligence chief Ahmad al-Assiri and Saud al-Qahtani, senior aide to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Saud al-Qahtani, an adviser to Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has over a million Twitter followers The Saudi authorities have yet to give evidence to support this version of events. Observers are questioning whether Saudi Arabia's Western allies will find their account of a ""botched rendition"" convincing - and whether it will persuade them not to take punitive action against them. US President Donald Trump said what had happened was ""unacceptable"" but that the arrests were an important ""first step"". The UK Foreign Office said it was considering its next steps after hearing the report. ""Turkey will reveal whatever had happened,"" said Omer Celik of Turkey's ruling AKP party, according to Anadolu news agency. ""Nobody should ever doubt about it. We are not accusing anyone in advance but we don't accept anything to remain covered [up]."" Publicly Turkey has so far stopped short of blaming Saudi Arabia for the killing. Turkish investigators, however, say they have audio and video evidence which shows Mr Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents inside the consulate and dismembered. Reports in Turkish media this week gave gruesome details of what are said to be his final minutes. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Turkish media said earlier this week they had identified a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents,externalwho flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of the disappearance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Saudi King Salman on Friday evening, and the two agreed to continue co-operating in the investigation. Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner The Saudi leadership will now be hoping that its belated admission that Khashoggi did die, after all, inside its consulate - coupled with a handful of sackings and arrests - will be enough to draw a line under this affair. It will not. This is only a first step towards publicising the truth of what really happened. Given the days of indignant denials by the Saudi leadership it's doubtful we would have even got this far without sustained international pressure. There can only be one of two possible alternatives here: either - as many suspect - the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman was to blame or he had lost control of his inner circle, something most observers find hard to believe. MBS, as he is known, has a huge following amongst young patriotic Saudis who see him as a visionary reformer. If that support were now to ebb away then the crown prince could find himself dangerously isolated at court. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has condemned the killing ""in the strongest terms"", calling the explanations given of the circumstances of Mr Khashoggi's death ""inadequate"". The UK Foreign Office described it as ""a terrible act"" and said the people behind the killing ""must be held to account"". President Trump praised the kingdom for acting quickly,externaland said the official explanation was ""credible"", despite many US lawmakers expressing disbelief over the Saudi account. Mr Trump stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia as a counterbalance to Iran in the Middle East, and pushed back against the need for sanctions against the country in light of the new information, talking about the effect of such a move on the US economy. Earlier this week he warned of ""very severe"" consequences if Saudi Arabia was proved to have killed the journalist. A number of US lawmakers, including a Republican highly critical of the Saudis, Senator Lindsey Graham, said they were sceptical about the report on the journalist's death. Allow Twitter content?

US to leave key Russia arms control treaty,"Russia denies building missiles that violate the accord The US will withdraw from a landmark nuclear weapons treaty with Russia, President Donald Trump has confirmed. Speaking to reporters, Mr Trump said Russia had ""violated"" the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces (INF) treaty. The deal banned ground-launched medium-range missiles, with a range of between 500 and 5,500km (310-3,400 miles). The US would not let Russia ""go out and do weapons [while] we're not allowed to"", Mr Trump said. ""I don't know why President [Barack] Obama didn't negotiate or pull out,"" the president said after a campaign rally in Nevada. ""They've been violating it for many years."" In 2014,President Obama accused Russia of breaching the INFafter it allegedly tested a ground-launched cruise missile. He reportedly chose not to withdraw from the treaty under pressure from European leaders, who said such a move could restart an arms race. A Russian foreign ministry source said the US move was motivated by a ""dream of a unipolar world"" where it is the only global superpower, state news agency RIA Novosti reported. Russia denies breaking missile treaty Tensions rise as US threatens to 'take out' Russian missiles Analysis by BBC defence and diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus Concern about Russia's development and deployment of a missile system that breaches the INF treaty predates the Trump administration. But the president's decision to walk away from the agreement marks a significant setback for arms control. Many experts believe that negotiations should have continued to try to bring the Russians back into compliance. It is, they fear, part of the wider unravelling of the whole system of arms control treaties that helped to curb strategic competition during the Cold War. Other factors too may have played into President Trump's decision. This was a bilateral treaty between Washington and Moscow. China was free to develop and deploy intermediate range nuclear missiles. Some in the Trump administration feel that the INF treaty places them at a growing disadvantage in their developing  strategic rivalry with Beijing . The US insists the Russians have, in breach of the deal, developed a new medium-range missile called the Novator 9M729 - known to Nato as the SSC-8. It would enable Russia to launch a nuclear strike at Nato countries at very short notice. Russia has said little about its new missile other than to deny that it is in breach of the agreement. Analysts say Russia sees such weapons as a cheaper alternative to conventional forces. The New York Times reported on Fridaythe US was considering withdrawing from the treaty in a bid to counter China's expanding military presence,externalin the western Pacific. The country was not a signatory of the deal, allowing it to develop medium-range missiles without restraint. National Security Adviser John Bolton is expected to tell the Russians of the withdrawal during talks in Moscow later this week. Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev and US President Ronald Reagan signed the INF treaty in 1987 Signed by the US and the USSR in 1987,the arms control deal banned all nuclear and non-nuclear missiles with short and medium ranges,external, except sea-launched weapons The US had been concerned by the Soviet deployment of the SS-20 missile system and responded by placing Pershing and Cruise missiles in Europe - sparking widespread protests By 1991, nearly 2,700 missiles had been destroyed. Both countries were allowed to inspect the others installations In 2007, Russian president Vladimir Putin declared the treaty no longer served Russia's interests. The move came after the US withdrew from the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty in 2002 The last time the US withdrew from a major arms treaty was in 2002, when President George W Bush pulled the US out of the Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, which banned weapons designed to counter ballistic nuclear missiles. His administration's move to set up a missile shield in Europe alarmed the Kremlin, and was scrapped by the Obama administration in 2009. It was replaced by a modified defence system in 2016.

Trump 'not satisfied' over Saudi's death,"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death US President Donald Trump says he is ""not satisfied"" with Saudi Arabia's account of the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi - a critic of the Saudi government - was murdered and his body dismembered. ""I'm not satisfied until we find the answer,"" Mr Trump said, adding that sanctions were a possibility, but that halting an arms deal would ""hurt us more than it would hurt them"".

Westminster 'paedophile ring' accuser in court,"A man who alleged there was a paedophile ring at the heart of Westminster has appeared in court charged with lying to police. He was in court in Newcastle accused of 12 counts of perverting the course of justice and one count of fraud. His claims sparked a police inquiry into allegations he was sexually assaulted by public figures and witnessed the murder of three boys. The man, 50, known as Nick, is not being named for legal reasons. He had claimed he was systematically abused and tortured by senior politicians, members of the armed forces, intelligence figures and a TV presenter during the 1970s and 1980s. One of the perverting the court of justice charges says he made a false allegation of witnessing the murder of an unnamed boy by former Conservative MP Harvey Proctor. His allegations were investigated by a Metropolitan Police investigation - codenamed Operation Midland. In September last year, Northumbria Police passed a file of evidence to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) which led to Nick being charged. The fraud charge alleges that in September 2013 he dishonestly made representations to the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. He appeared in custody on Saturday at Newcastle Crown Court, which was sitting as a magistrates' court. He has been remanded in custody and his next appearance will be at the same court - sitting as a crown court - on 19 November.

Facebook ads urge voters 'to bin Chequers',"Political groups have been spending increasing amounts of money on Facebook adverts An anonymous website has been using Facebook adverts to encourage British voters to email their MP and urge them ""to bin Chequers"" and back Brexit. Evidence given to the government's fake news inquiry found that a site called Mainstream Network had spent more than Â£250,000 on the pro-Brexit campaign. No information is available to say who owns or funds Mainstream Network. It comes asFacebook announced new rules around political advertising- and its funding - earlier this week. The site now requires political advertisers to prove their identity and that they are based in the UK, before they can run political adverts. It also requires them to publicly declare who paid for the adverts before they can run. Damian Collins, chairman of the Commons culture select committee, said: ""Here we have an example of a clearly sophisticated organisation spending lots of money on a political campaign, and we have absolutely no idea who is behind it."" ""The only people who know who is paying for these adverts is Facebook,"" added Mr Collins, whose committee has been investigating so-called fake news. Facebook hires Sir Nick Clegg Fake news 'crowding out' real news On the verge of a nervous Brexit breakdown? Mr Collins, and fellow committee member Paul Farrelly, are among many MPs whose constituents have been targeted by the Facebook ads. Campaign group 89up, which uncovered the digital adverts and shared their analysis with the select committee, say the adverts are designed ""to specifically influence MPs"". When clicked on, the advert takes users to a page on their local constituency and MP. Another click generates a pre-written email to their MP, demanding they ""tell the prime minister to bin the Chequers deal"" - Theresa May's Brexit proposal set out at her country residence Chequers - and to ""deliver full Brexit"". The email also adds Mainstream Network into the blind address field, meaning the website receives a copy of the user's message. Researchers at 89up estimate that the Mainstream Network has spent up to Â£257,000 to promote posts across the social network, potentially reaching almost 11 million people in the process. It also suggests the practice of copying in Mainstream Network to the emails may result in a GDPR breach. Analysis by Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent Last week, Facebook launched its new transparency code for political advertising in the UK. Now that code, which is meant to show just how ads are targeted and who is paying for them, faces its first test. The system also requires any organisation wanting to place a political advert to provide proof of their identity and location. But here's the problem - the ""chuck Chequers"" ads were posted before the code came into effect. Search the new Facebook archive of UK political ads and you won't find anything from the Mainstream Network. But even in the future the identity of organisations paying for ads could remain murky to Facebook users - a label saying ""Paid for by the Mainstream Network"" will not reveal much about the origins of the money spent. The ""chuck Chequers"" campaign could however be of interest to two regulators. The Electoral Commission may see this as further evidence that it needs more powers to force political advertisers to reveal their identities, and the Information Commissioner will want to examine any breach of the new GDPR data rules. And for one man with a great interest in both politics and social media this all comes at a tricky time. Former deputy PM Sir Nick Clegg starts his new job as Facebook's global communications chief on Monday - instead of escaping the politics of Brexit he will find it on the top of his in-tray. ""While debate on one of the central issues facing our country is part of a thriving democracy, there is an important question of where campaigning stops and political advertising starts,"" said Mr Collins. ""Facebook has recently announced a set of changes to increase transparency around political advertising on its platform. ""This example offers Facebook an opportunity to show it is committed to making that change happen - if you are targeted with a message or asked to lobby your MP, you should know exactly who is behind the organisation asking you to do it.""

Gwenno 'sparks Cornish exams record',"Gwenno Saunders says it's ""exciting"" how casually people are using Cornish A record number of people have taken Cornish language exams in 2018 sparked by an interest in singer Gwenno Saunders, examiners say. The Cornish Language Board said 77 people sat the exam this year - a rise of 15% on the previous year. Exams secretary Tony Hak said the spike is partly down to Saunders, whose Cornish language concept album hasseen her play live on 6Music. More than 1,200 people have taken the exams since they began in 1992. The language is designated ""critically endangered"" by the United Nations group Unescoand is recognised as aminority language,externalby the Council of Europe. The Cornish identify strongly with their heritage and have their own flag ""Gwenno's album is a fantastic boost for the language,"" said Mr Hak. ""So people are seeing it a lot more around them and they have become interested. ""It's also because Cornish people are becoming more aware of their identity and sense of place. ""There's a growing awareness of the language from businesses who want Cornish branding."" Dydh da: Hello Kernow a'gas Dynnergh: Welcome to Cornwall Ha sos: Right mate Myttin da: Good morning Dohajydh da: Good afternoon Gorthuher da: Good evening Fatla genes?: How are you? Pur dha, meur ras: Very well, thanks Da lowr, meur ras: Ok, thanks Gwenno, who recorded her second album Le Kov (A sense of place) in Cornish, said it was exciting that use of the language was becoming more ""casual"". ""It's quite incredible that the language is alive. That shows its resilience because there hasn't been really any support."" The Welsh Music Prize winner said her native tongue was the perfect way to tell stories about the region. ""It has this huge rich history that not many people are aware of,"" she says. ""But [the language] offers another perspective and another narrative on Cornwall. ""It's something the wider population in Cornwall feel an ownership over. ""People are saying, 'let's just use it in the way its interesting or us or makes sense to us.'""

"Blasphemy, Stephen Fry and a referendum","In October, the Republic of Ireland will not only decide on its next President, it will also decide whether to scrap its laws on blasphemy. It is the second referendum this year to strip away another law in its constitution. In May, the country voted overwhelmingly to change the constitution to liberalise abortion laws. Four months later, voters are being asked to remove a reference to blasphemy from the Constitution. Yes. The Irish constitution says the publication or utterance of ""blasphemous, seditious, or indecent matter is an offence which shall be punishable in accordance with law"". Assistant professor of law at Trinity College Dublin, David Kenny explains that although blasphemy was constitutionally illegal since 1937, only since the 2009 Defamation Act was blasphemy defined in law. To be convicted of blasphemy, the court must prove that what is said or published is grossly abusive or insulting, causing outrage to a religion and that the person or publisher intended to cause outrage. If found guilty, you could face a â¬25,000 fine. (Â£22k) This video can not be played Stephen Fry on religion comments: ""I was astonished that it has caused so viral an explosion"" Stephen Fry was interviewed on the RTÃ programme 'The meaning of life' in 2015. When asked what he would say if he ever confronted god in an afterlife, he said: ""Why should I respect a capricious, mean-minded, stupid god who creates a world so full of injustice and pain?"" ""The god that created this universe, if it was created by a god, is quite clearly a maniac, utter maniac, totally selfish."" A member of the public complained to gardaÃ­ (Irish police) about Mr Fry's comments. GardaÃ­ subsequently carried out an investigation under the 2009 blasphemy laws, but later dropped the investigation. Not since 1703 (pre-dating Irish independence). According to court documents, in 1703 Thomas Emlyn, a Unitarian pastor in Dublin, was convicted of blasphemy, fined Â£1,000 and sentenced to one year's imprisonment. Emlyn published a book arguing that Jesus Christ was not the equal of God the Father. The book caused considerable outrage. This illustration from the Acts of the Apostles in the New Testament depicts pagan books being burned at Ephesus The last known prosecution was in 1855 (again pre-dating Irish independence). Vladimir Petcherine was a redemptorist priest in Kingstown (now called DÃºn Laoghaire). He asked people to collect ""evil"" literature so he could burn the books on a bonfire. Unknown to Fr Petcherine, a bible was among the books. He was subsequently prosecuted for blasphemy for burning the bible. Yet, the court found that Fr Petcherine was not guilty as he did not intend to burn the bible. The offence of blasphemy came before the courts again in the aftermath of Ireland's referendum to legalise divorce in 1995 In 1995, the Sunday Independent newspaper printed a cartoon which depicted three government ministers refusing communion from a priest. The cartoon was published two days after a controversial referendum on divorce. Mr Corway, a member of the public, was offended by the cartoon and sought a private prosecution against the newspaper for blasphemy. But, Mr Kenny explained that in 1999 the supreme court held that there was ""no sufficiently clear offence of blasphemy in law that the paper could be convicted of and the case couldn't go ahead"". The problem was that while blasphemy was prohibited by the constitution, there was no legislation that defined the offence. Yes. In 2010,Paul Gill trekked 625km from Mizen Head in Cork to Malin Head in Donegal,external. He was protesting against new blasphemy laws in the 2009 Defamation Act. Dermot Ahern was the Fianna FÃ¡il justice minister in 2009 and he oversaw the inclusion of blasphemy in the Defamation Act of the same year In2012, a constitutional convention was established to go through the 1937 constitution and make recommendations for changes. In 2014, it published its report. Among its recommendations was to hold a referendum on whether to remove blasphemy from the constitution. Canvassers campaigning for a 'yes' vote in the blasphemy referendum There are no clear official campaign groups, however some bodies have expressed their views. Atheist Ireland is advocating for a yes vote and both the Catholic Church and the Church of Ireland believe the laws are ""obsolete"". Minister for Justice Charlie Flanagan was campaigning for a yes vote in Dublin on Thursday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Senator Ronan Mullen said the referendum is ""entirely unnecessary and it ignores the legal historical context"" of the constitution. He added that the proposal to repeal ""does nothing to protect or promote free speech"" and that the cost of running the referendum is a waste of taxpayers' money. Ali Selim from the Islamic Cultural Centre of Ireland said the inclusion of blasphemy in the constitution protects ""the cohesiveness"" of communities in Ireland and guarantees their rights and freedoms. The question on blasphemy hasn't tapped into any national feeling like the same-sex marriage and abortion referendums did. Theresa Reidy is a political scientist at University College Cork, she says it is ""fairly likely"" that the referendum will pass, but added there ""isn't a huge clamour to have it removed or kept in"". She also points out that blasphemy doesn't impact people directly like the referendums on same-sex marriage and abortion. The reference to blasphemy will be removed from the constitution and the government will amend the Defamation Act to remove blasphemy from legislation. David Kenny explains that even if blasphemy is removed from the constitution religious freedoms will remain protected under other laws. Blasphemy will remain as an offence in the constitution and in legislation. Reality Check: Do referendums bring about change?

Afghans defy deadly poll violence,"This video can not be played Lyse Doucet: 'This is not the face of a people cowed by the Taliban' Voters in Afghanistan have defied deadly attacks to cast ballots in large numbers in the nation's long-awaited parliamentary elections. Several explosions targeted polling stations, with dozens of people killed or injured in scores of incidents across the country. Voters unable to cast ballots on Saturday turned out on Sunday as polling was extended in some areas. A new biometric verification system had caused technical problems. Violence also marred the election campaigning, with 10 candidates killed in the run-up to the polls. Both the Taliban and the Islamic State group had vowed to disrupt them. Kandahar vote delayed after Gen Raziq killed What's at stake in the parliament vote? More than 2,500 candidates, including many women, are vying for 250 seats in the legislative elections, which are being held more than three years late. Saturday saw dozens of incidents of violence, with at least 36 people killed and 130 injured across the country, but this was still a lower figure than some had feared. Among the incidents: At least 15 people were killed when a suicide bomber tried to enter a Kabul polling station Three people were killed and more than 50 injured in the northern city of Kunduz, while another two people died in explosions in Nangarhar AFP reports Insurgents killed four men heading to a polling station in northern Balkh province, local officials said Police officers were ambushed in central Ghor province. At least four were killed The defence ministry has deployed 70,000 members of the security forces to try to ensure the elections pass off peacefully. But nearly a third of all polling stations were closed because of security concerns. Security was not the only issue threatening the vote. Past elections have been marred by corruption and fraud, with cases of ballot box stuffing, multiple voting and voter intimidation all documented. Voting in Kandahar province had already been put off by a week after the assassination of a top police chief, Gen Abdul Raziq, on Thursday, in an attack claimed by Taliban militants. Polling in Ghazni province has also been delayed. The biometric devices have not led to quick voting On Saturday, technical and organisational problems stopped voters from casting their ballots at a number of polling stations. There have been technical hitches with Afghanistan's new biometric voter registration equipment and in the central province of Uruzgan, 15 men were reportedly arrested for trying to break biometric devices because of delays. The Independent Election Commission says most stations opened their doors late because teachers employed to supervise the voting process failed to turn up on time, according to AFP news agency. Turnout was still good, with three million out of 8.8 million registered voters casting ballots on Saturday. Some 253 polling centres opened on Sunday, although similar technical problems were being reported. The results process will not be quick. Preliminary results are not expected until 20 days after the election, on 10 November. BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, in Kabul It is an act of bravery to vote in Afghan elections. We went back to the same polling station we visited in 2014 and crowds were even larger this time. The queue of male voters kept getting longer. There was a crush of voters in the women's section. So many Afghans told us, ""We won't let the Taliban win."" But explosions are killing and injuring voters. Turnout will be low in the most insecure areas. Bad organisation is an enemy too.  Afghans are angrily complaining about polling stations opening hours late, election material not showing up. But many believe even holding this election is an achievement: to show that Afghan officials and security forces can do it, and to usher in a more legitimate parliament to replace a discredited assembly and try to move toward presidential elections next year and Taliban peace talks. But if it is seen as a ""bad election,"" it could be more consequential than not holding one at all. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Most Afghans are desperate for a better life, jobs, education and an end to the war with the Taliban. For the country's foreign partners, seeing a flourishing democracy would be the return they're seeking after many years of investment, billions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost in more than a decade of fighting. This video can not be played Afghan ""war on terror"" generation votes Many candidates are young and well-educated. They are promising to help deliver change in the conflict-torn country. But many Afghans have come to view all politicians as corrupt and ineffective, correspondents say. The polls should have been held when the current assembly's five-year term ended in 2015. But the standoff after the disputed 2014 presidential election changed all that, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. This video can not be played Naheed Farid, Afghan MP: ""Some women want to wear make-up"" However, although parliament reviews and ratifies laws, real power lies with the presidency, and this election will be seen as a key test ahead of the all-important presidential elections due in April 2019.

Prized fossil found in Rio museum debris,"This video can not be played Drone footage shows the National Museum totally gutted. Most of the skull from a prized 12,000-year-old fossil nicknamed Luzia has been recovered from the wreckage of a fire in Brazil's National Museum. The 200-year-old building in Rio de Janeiro burned down in September, destroying almost all of its artefacts. But on Friday the museum's director announced that 80% of Luzia's skull fragments had been identified. The human remains - the oldest ever found in Latin America - were viewed as the jewel of the museum's collection. The museum staff said they were confident they could recover the rest of Luzia's skull and attempt reassembly. ""They've suffered alterations, damage but we're very optimistic at the find and all it represents,"" archaeologist Claudia Rodrigues was quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. The remains saved from the rubble were presented to press on Friday The skull is understood to have been stored in a metal box inside a cabinet, described as a ""strategic place"", which helped it resist fire damage. Museum artefacts saved from Brazil fire The key treasures at risk from museum fire In pictures: Museum destroyed in blaze Structural work to secure the historical palace in the Brazilian city is still being carried out almost 50 days on from the fire. The cause of the blaze - which tore through hundreds of rooms containing more than 20 million artefacts - is still under investigation. The 2 September fire sparked criticism and protests of the country's government in its aftermath. The museum is managed by Federal University of Rio de Janeiro,whose rector said they had known the building was vulnerable because of financial cuts. Luzia's face was reconstructed by a team at Manchester University in 1999 Luzia's remains were found in a cave in the 1970s in the state of Minas Gerais, north of Rio, by French archaeologist Annette Laming-Emperaire. Tests suggest the skull and bones belonged to a woman in her 20s who was just under 1.5m (5ft tall) - and they were believed to be the oldest recovered on the continent. Experts had produced a digital image of her face using her skull, which was used as the basis for a sculpture that was also in display on the building. Luzia was named in homage toLucy - the famous and important 3.2 million-year-old human remains found in Africa in 1974. In pictures: Brazil museum in flames National museum consumed by fire.

House front ripped off in gas explosion,"A woman was taken to hospital with minor injuries after being treated at the scene in Haynt Walk Two people were hurt when the front of a house in south-west London was ripped off in a gas explosion. Both floors and half of the roof of the terraced house in Haynt Walk, Wimbledon, were damaged by the explosion on Friday evening, London Fire Brigade (LFB) said. No one was in the house at the time but London Ambulance Service (LAS) took one woman to hospital with minor injuries. The cause of the explosion is not thought to be suspicious, police said. Officers were called at about 18:25 BST and a cordon was put in place. Police said two people were treated at the scene for minor injuries before LAS took the woman to hospital. Officers remain on scene but 18 neighbours who were temporarily evacuated have returned home. The cause of the explosion is yet to be established.

Marchers call for 'people's vote' on Brexit,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows crowds covering roads in the city centre Protesters seeking a referendum on the final Brexit deal have attended a rally which organisers say was the biggest demonstration of its kind. Young voters led the People's Vote march to London's Parliament Square, which supporters say attracted approximately 700,000 protesters. It also had support from a number of MPs who want a fresh vote. This is something which has already been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May. The People's Vote campaign said stewards on the route estimated 700,000 were taking part. The Metropolitan Police said it was not able to estimate the size of the crowd. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who started the march - was among those who addressed Parliament Square, along with representatives from the main political parties. Celebrity speakers included Steve Coogan, Delia Smith and Deborah Meaden. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan on 'march for the future' London Mayor Mr Khan told the crowd:,external""What's really important is that those that say that a public vote is undemocratic, is unpatriotic, realise that in fact, the exact opposite is the truth. ""What could be more democratic, what could be more British, than trusting the judgement of the British people."" How will Parliament vote on a final deal? People's Vote march in pictures All you need to know about Brexit Tories 'must be as united as EU' - Hunt Thousands arrived at the meeting point on London's Park Lane for the march The march was held at the same time as a pro-Brexit rally in Harrogate, organised by the group Leave Means Leave and led by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Mr Farage said: ""The evidence suggests about a third of those that voted remain now say we're democrats and think the government should simply get on with it. ""And that's our message - get on with it, fulfil your promises to us, you said if we voted to leave it would happen, it needs to."" People gathered on Park Lane for hours before the march.  Many held home-made signs and banners with slogans like ""the wrexiteers"", ""Brexit stole my future"" and ""Even Baldrick had a plan"". As the crowds began to form, the sheer scale of the protest became clear. Thousands of people stretched filled the street, some were singing, others were playing instruments, while many plastic whistles blared out. There were lots of young families there, some with children wrapped in EU flags. Many told me they'd gone because they were worried about their families' future. Some people marched in groups - there were NHS staff, political parties, members of the LGBT community and dog owners. Many took the opportunity to dress up their pets for the protest. The start of the march was delayed due to the number of people there.  It was a good natured and friendly march through some of London's most famous streets before the hundreds of thousands of people arrived at Parliament Square. By that stage the march was so large that not everyone could fit in the square and demonstrators spilled out onto nearby streets. The marchers are hoping people power will persuade the British government to hold a referendum on the final Brexit deal. They will have to wait and see if the government was listening. The British public voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016. The UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the two-year Article 50 process. This video can not be played Protesters explain why they joined the People's Vote march to London's Parliament Square Labour's Lord Adonis, a campaigner for People's Vote - which wants a referendum on the outcome of the negotiations with the EU - said: ""Brexit's becoming a dog's dinner. ""This week's fresh chaos and confusion over Brexit negotiations has exposed how even the best deal now available will be a bad one for Britain."" A young boy holding a sign proclaiming support for the EU Richard Tice, founder of Leave Means Leave and former co-chair of Leave.EU, told BBC Breakfast: ""The idea that you should have a second referendum would be incredibly damaging - most of all to the trust in democracy from people up and down this country."" Some 150 coach loads of people from across the UK - including as far away from London as Orkney - travelled to the March for the Future, which started in Park Lane. TV chef Delia Smith told the crowds that Brexit was ""the most important issue in our lifetime"", adding: ""My message to MPs is please sort this out. Let the people you serve have their say."" Delia Smith addressed anti-Brexit campaigners at the rally Lord of the Rings star Andy Serkis attended with his wife Lorraine Ashbourne and 14-year-old son Louis. ""The will of the people is now, it's people expressing their points of view in a more informed state,"" he said. And First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon sent a message of support to the rally, saying the SNP would support a vote that would give the option of staying in the EU. #PeoplesVoteMarch was trending on Twitter on Saturday, with lots of young people - some of those who were not eligible to vote in the 2016 referendum - heading on the march. Emily Longman, 20, one of the students leading the march behind a People's Vote banner, was four months too young to vote in the 2016 referendum. She studies Spanish and is due to study abroad next year, but said ""no-one knows what will happen with Erasmus funding"". Aleta Doyle and her son Leo travelled from Peterborough Aleta Doyle, 46, from Peterborough, who attended with her 12-year-old son Leo, said she was marching ""for my children's future and European unity"". And Leo Buckley, 16, from Hampshire, said: ""Young people stand to lose the most. I'm going to be poorer and not have the same career opportunities."" At the other end of the age spectrum, Joe Trickey from Croydon celebrated his 83rd birthday at the march. He said: ""I believe very strongly in the EU as a place of peace and strength."" Dr Mike Galsworthy, from NHS Against Brexit, told BBC News: ""Whether you voted leave, or whether you voted remain - when a contract comes back, you do have the right to read the small print and say actually 'no, no. no, this isn't what we want to be signing up for'."" Campaign supporter Alastair Campbell, former Downing Street director of communications, said: ""The Brexit that was promised, and the Brexit that was campaigned successfully for, doesn't exist."" He added: ""I don't think you can re-run the referendum. I think we have to accept that we lost that debate. I think the question has to be on the nature of the deal.""

Flight abandoned after bird strikeThe Glasgow-bound flight from Shetland was carrying 40 passengers when it was struck by birds.Highlands & Islands,"The bird strike happened during take-off from Sumburgh Airport A flight carrying 40 passengers and three crew was forced to return to Sumburgh Airport in Shetland after being hit by birds at 1,500ft. Loganair flight LM438 was en-route to Glasgow when the incident happened on Friday shortly after take-off. Passengers reported seeing flames and onboard crew received an alert about the aircraft's left-hand engine. Loganair said the Saab 2000 landed safely and aid from standby emergency vehicles was not required. The affected plane has been removed from service for further tests to be carried out. Passengers on board the flight reported hearing a bang and smelling fuel moments after the aircraft left the runway. Mia Sutherland, 15, who was travelling with her parents, told the BBC she saw flames on the outside of the plane. She said: ""Just when we were levelling out there was a bang followed by a short outburst of flames and then a horrible fuelly smell came into where the passengers were. ""Everyone was panicking and going 'what was that?'"". ""Everyone was looking out windows and probably about 10 or 15 minutes later the pilot came on and said that we were going back to Sumburgh because of a technical fault and then when we got back they said they had hit a bird. Loganair said passengers were able to continue their journey on Saturday The incident resulted in passengers being unable to continue their journey to Glasgow on Friday evening because the airport was closed overnight. They were instead offered overnight accommodation. A spokesman said customers were able to resume their journey on Saturday and left on an alternative aircraft at about 09:00. He added: ""Safety is always our first priority, and as always, our pilots responded immediately and appropriately to the warning that they received on the flightdeck following the bird strike - an eventuality for which every pilot is extensively trained. ""The aircraft made a normal landing back at Sumburgh and our customers were able to disembark as they normally would. ""We arranged hotel accommodation overnight and a replacement flight at the earliest possible opportunity, and we'd like to offer our sincere apologies for this disruption to our customers' journeys.""

Collapse death families 'await answers',"This video can not be played Wall collapse families query time taken to get inquest Relatives of five African men crushed by a wall in 2016 say they would have answers by now if they had been white and British, the BBC has been told. All five, from The Gambia and Senegal, died when 15ft of concrete fell on them at a scrap metal plant in Birmingham. A spokesman for their families said the two-year wait for an inquest, due to take place next month, had ""taken a toll"" on those left behind. The health and safety watchdog's investigation has yet to conclude. Ousmane Kaba Diabi, 39, who was from Senegal, Alimamo Kinteh Jammeh, 45, Bangally Tunkara Dukureh, 55, Saibo Sumbundu Sillah, 42, and Muhamadou Jagana Jagana, 49, died in the incident. The men were all Spanish citizens with dual Gambian nationality. They had come to the UK to work, some with their families, and were employed alongside other Gambians at the scrap metal plant in Nechells. The site was closed for six weeks after the incident. No criminal prosecutions have been brought over the deaths. The men were all confirmed dead at the scene Lamin Yaffa, chairman of the Gambian Islamic Centre, said relatives are frustrated and upset at not knowing what happened to their loved ones. Speaking to the BBC on their behalf, he said: ""It is really hard to say, but sometimes it might be that you feel okay, this is me, I'm a foreigner in this country, is it going to be the same thing as a British man, born and bred in this country...? ""How long will it take for them to come to a conclusion, to tell the families how their loved ones died? It has taken a toll."" When asked if the families believed that, had they been white and British, investigations would have concluded, Mr Yaffa said: ""This is what the families, and this is what many people are saying within the community. ""Even if, say, I don't believe that, you can't just take that out of their minds... what else can you say?"" ""I think it would have been different."" Alimamo Jammeh (l) Bangally Tunkara Dukureh both died in the incident In December, the investigation was handed over to the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) following discussions with the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS). The CPS told the BBC it gave the force early investigative advice and and no file of evidence had been passed to them. In August, the HSE confirmed its investigation would not be concluded until after the inquest, to be held on 7 November in Birmingham, and ""any directions from the coroner, and any other relevant information from the inquest, can be taken into account"". Responding to the timescale of their investigation, a spokesman said: ""HSE assumed primacy of the investigation in December 2017. ""It is perfectly normal for us to allow the inquests to run their course before our inquiry concludes. This also allows us to carefully monitor any evidence heard by the inquest which may be relevant to our investigation, ensuring our work has been as thorough as possible. ""Following the inquests, we will make decisions on whether criminal proceedings can be brought."" The men had come to the UK to work and were employed along with other Gambians at the plant in Nechells The BBC understands the families have been refused legal aid for an inquest next month. A crowd-funding page has been set up to help cover legal costs. In a statement, Francis Blain, High Commissioner for Gambia, said the tragedy would have an ""everlasting negative impact"" on the families and Gambian community. He said the they were ""eager to draw a conclusion to this matter and to seek redress"" but could not do anything until ""investigations into this tragic disaster"" had concluded. The commissioner hoped any outcome would be ""reflective of a thorough and impartial investigation"", he added. Harriett Baldwin, Minster for Africa and Mid-Worcestershire MP, said she was ""very sad...to hear"" the families were still waiting for answers. ""I will be more than happy to find out using my channels as minister for Africa what is taking so long and find out what the latest is, although a full and thorough investigation should take place,"" she added.

Afghan vote extended amid poll delays,"This video can not be played Lyse Doucet: 'This is not the face of a people cowed by the Taliban' Voters in Afghanistan have defied deadly attacks to cast ballots in large numbers in the nation's long-awaited parliamentary elections. Several explosions targeted polling stations, with dozens of people killed or injured in scores of incidents across the country. Voters unable to cast ballots on Saturday turned out on Sunday as polling was extended in some areas. A new biometric verification system had caused technical problems. Violence also marred the election campaigning, with 10 candidates killed in the run-up to the polls. Both the Taliban and the Islamic State group had vowed to disrupt them. Kandahar vote delayed after Gen Raziq killed What's at stake in the parliament vote? More than 2,500 candidates, including many women, are vying for 250 seats in the legislative elections, which are being held more than three years late. Saturday saw dozens of incidents of violence, with at least 36 people killed and 130 injured across the country, but this was still a lower figure than some had feared. Among the incidents: At least 15 people were killed when a suicide bomber tried to enter a Kabul polling station Three people were killed and more than 50 injured in the northern city of Kunduz, while another two people died in explosions in Nangarhar AFP reports Insurgents killed four men heading to a polling station in northern Balkh province, local officials said Police officers were ambushed in central Ghor province. At least four were killed The defence ministry has deployed 70,000 members of the security forces to try to ensure the elections pass off peacefully. But nearly a third of all polling stations were closed because of security concerns. Security was not the only issue threatening the vote. Past elections have been marred by corruption and fraud, with cases of ballot box stuffing, multiple voting and voter intimidation all documented. Voting in Kandahar province had already been put off by a week after the assassination of a top police chief, Gen Abdul Raziq, on Thursday, in an attack claimed by Taliban militants. Polling in Ghazni province has also been delayed. The biometric devices have not led to quick voting On Saturday, technical and organisational problems stopped voters from casting their ballots at a number of polling stations. There have been technical hitches with Afghanistan's new biometric voter registration equipment and in the central province of Uruzgan, 15 men were reportedly arrested for trying to break biometric devices because of delays. The Independent Election Commission says most stations opened their doors late because teachers employed to supervise the voting process failed to turn up on time, according to AFP news agency. Turnout was still good, with three million out of 8.8 million registered voters casting ballots on Saturday. Some 253 polling centres opened on Sunday, although similar technical problems were being reported. The results process will not be quick. Preliminary results are not expected until 20 days after the election, on 10 November. BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, in Kabul It is an act of bravery to vote in Afghan elections. We went back to the same polling station we visited in 2014 and crowds were even larger this time. The queue of male voters kept getting longer. There was a crush of voters in the women's section. So many Afghans told us, ""We won't let the Taliban win."" But explosions are killing and injuring voters. Turnout will be low in the most insecure areas. Bad organisation is an enemy too.  Afghans are angrily complaining about polling stations opening hours late, election material not showing up. But many believe even holding this election is an achievement: to show that Afghan officials and security forces can do it, and to usher in a more legitimate parliament to replace a discredited assembly and try to move toward presidential elections next year and Taliban peace talks. But if it is seen as a ""bad election,"" it could be more consequential than not holding one at all. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Most Afghans are desperate for a better life, jobs, education and an end to the war with the Taliban. For the country's foreign partners, seeing a flourishing democracy would be the return they're seeking after many years of investment, billions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost in more than a decade of fighting. This video can not be played Afghan ""war on terror"" generation votes Many candidates are young and well-educated. They are promising to help deliver change in the conflict-torn country. But many Afghans have come to view all politicians as corrupt and ineffective, correspondents say. The polls should have been held when the current assembly's five-year term ended in 2015. But the standoff after the disputed 2014 presidential election changed all that, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. This video can not be played Naheed Farid, Afghan MP: ""Some women want to wear make-up"" However, although parliament reviews and ratifies laws, real power lies with the presidency, and this election will be seen as a key test ahead of the all-important presidential elections due in April 2019.

Two in court over father's deathMichael Swan and Gary Beech are charged with the murder of Ian Tomlin in Battersea.London,"Ian Tomlin was described as a ""great father"" Two men have appeared in court charged with murdering a father-of-two who was beaten to death outside his home in Battersea, south-west London. Ian Tomlin, 46, was killed outside flats on Charlotte Despard Avenue on Wednesday. Gary Beech, 48, who lives on the same street, and Michael Swan, 45, from Wandsworth, appeared at Wimbledon Magistrates' Court on Saturday. Mr Tomlin's cause of death was a head injury caused by blunt force trauma. A post-mortem examination was carried out on Friday. Magistrate Kevin Hearn remanded Mr Beech and Mr Swan in custody ahead of a hearing at the Old Bailey on 24 October. A fundraising page has been set up to raise money for the victim's funeral. A local councillor said Mr Tomlin's death had caused ""deep upset"" in the community Mr Tomlin died about 45 minutes after police arrived at the scene The GoFundMe page was set up on Saturday and aims to raise Â£60,000 towards a memorial and a boxing academy in memory of him. ""Ian was passionate about his boxing and fitness, he also trained as a boxer many years ago,"" the page said. ""Our family want to give Ian Tomlin a send-off that stays with the community and the general public."" Mr Tomlin's father, Cecil Tomlin, told the Evening Standard his son was a ""a great father"". The victim had worked for a waste company contracted to Wandsworth Council. Leader Ravi Govindia described the killing as ""truly shocking"". The Metropolitan Police said extra patrols would be carried out around the estate where Mr Tomlin was killed. More than 100 murder investigations have been launched across London so far in 2018.

"Gwenno 'sparks Cornish exams record'The spike in people taking the test is partly down to the singer, examiners say.Cornwall","Gwenno Saunders says it's ""exciting"" how casually people are using Cornish A record number of people have taken Cornish language exams in 2018 sparked by an interest in singer Gwenno Saunders, examiners say. The Cornish Language Board said 77 people sat the exam this year - a rise of 15% on the previous year. Exams secretary Tony Hak said the spike is partly down to Saunders, whose Cornish language concept album hasseen her play live on 6Music. More than 1,200 people have taken the exams since they began in 1992. The language is designated ""critically endangered"" by the United Nations group Unescoand is recognised as aminority language,externalby the Council of Europe. The Cornish identify strongly with their heritage and have their own flag ""Gwenno's album is a fantastic boost for the language,"" said Mr Hak. ""So people are seeing it a lot more around them and they have become interested. ""It's also because Cornish people are becoming more aware of their identity and sense of place. ""There's a growing awareness of the language from businesses who want Cornish branding.""

""It's quite incredible that the language is alive. That shows its resilience because there hasn't been really any support."" The Welsh Music Prize winner said her native tongue was the perfect way to tell stories about the region. ""It has this huge rich history that not many people are aware of,"" she says. ""But [the language] offers another perspective and another narrative on Cornwall. ""It's something the wider population in Cornwall feel an ownership over.

Twitchers flock to man's home to see bird,"Stephen Leake said more than 150 birdwatchers have visited his home to see the starling A man's living room has been besieged with birdwatchers trying to get a glimpse of a rarely-seen bird. Stephen Leake first saw the rose-coloured starling in the back garden of his house near Norwich on 7 October. He reported the sighting to bird groups online and logged his postcode, thinking it was for recording purposes. Mr Leake has since had more than 150 people visit his home, including some who had travelled from north England. He said they were ""wowed"" by the bird. The starling should be migrating from eastern Europe to tropical Asia, where it winters, according to theBritish Trust for Ornithology.,external Mr Leake, a teacher from Costessey, said it was a ""mystery"" as to why it had decided to settle in the back garden of a new-build home. Mr Leake phoned the RSPB which confirmed the bird, pictured here in his garden, was a rose-coloured starling He said he first thought it was a woodpecker or a juvenile magpie until he contacted the RSPB, which confirmed it was a rose-coloured starling. Mr Leake said that 24 hours after reporting the bird online, he noticed a group of people outside his house. He said he spoke to a couple of them and asked if they were there for the starling and they said they were. ""I thought I'd invite them in off the street and let them have a look to get a positive identification. ""I'm quite a kind guy and off work with a lung condition. I thought 'why not?' They called it a lifer - a once in a life time event."" The starling should be migrating from eastern Europe to tropical Asia, where it winters, according to the British Trust for Ornithology The bird is also known as the rosy pastor It has a pink body and black head In their native Asia, rose-coloured starlings will gather in big flocks About 50 sightings are recorded in the UK each year, with between five and 10 in Norfolk The bird may settle in the UK until spring and is ""not fussy"" about eating classic bird seeds Source: RSPB Road workers dig up woolly mammoth bones Sweetheart beech wins Tree of the Year Man who 'dislikes cows' in dairy fight He said up to 30 people had visited his house at a time, including a man who had travelled from Burnley and another from Huddersfield, over the past two weeks. ""They were wowed by it. One woman even welled up,"" Mr Leake said. ""The birdwatchers are drawn towards the bird so why not give them the opportunity to see it. ""I am a bird fan, but not a twitcher. I'm a big fan of nature."" Mr Leake said they had been staying for about 20 minutes, ""satisfied with a sighting or photographs"".

Joint mission blasts skyward to Mercury,"This video can not be played BepiColombo left Earth on an Ariane rocket that launched out of South America. Two satellites developed in Europe and Japan are on their way to Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun. The joint endeavour, known as BepiColombo,external, left Earth on an Ariane rocket that launched out of South America. It will take the probes seven years to reach their destination. But when they do finally arrive, it is hoped their parallel observations can finally resolve the many puzzles about the hot little world. One of the key ones concerns the object's oversized iron core, which represents 60% of Mercury's mass. Science cannot yet explain why the planet only has a thin veneer of rocks. Bepi's high-resolution data should bring us nearer to an answer. This video can not be played Messenger compiled this coloured map of Mercury during its first year in orbit ""Mercury doesn't really fit with our theories for how the Solar System formed, and we can't understand our planet fully unless we're able to explain Mercury as well,"" said Prof Dave Rothery, a Bepi scientist from the UK's Open University. The probes, which have been stacked together for their long journey into the inner Solar System, lifted clear of the Kourou spaceport at 22:45 local time, Friday (02:45 BST; 03:45 CEST; 10:45 JST Saturday). Mission controllers based in Darmstadt, Germany, will spend much of Saturday talking to the spacecraft, to confirm they are properly configured for the long cruise ahead. It's the first time the European and Japanese space agencies (Esa & Jaxa) have gone to Mercury. The Americans have already been there, briefly with the Mariner 10 probe in the 1970s, and withthe Messenger orbiter earlier this decade. The BepiColombo spacecraft will take seven years to get to Mercury The latter provided remarkable new insights that included the amazing discoveries thatwater-ice is held inside some of baking Mercury's shadowed craters, and thatits crust contains a lot of graphite (pencil lead). Bepi will build on Messengers' investigations. The new mission carries twice as much instrumentation and will get closer for longer, giving scientists much more detailed information. Europe's Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and Japan's Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) have different roles. The MMO will make as its priority the study of the planet's magnetic field. It will investigate the field's behaviour and its interaction with the ""solar wind"", the billowing mass of particles that stream away from the Sun. This wind interacts with Mercury's super-tenuous atmosphere, whipping atoms into a tail that reaches far into space. Europe's MPO will map the terrain, generate height profiles, sense the interior, and collect data on the surface structure and composition. The stack is unpacked at Mercury to enable complementary observations The origin of Mercury is the question most people want answered. Today's dense body very probably does not reflect the initial form. It's possible Mercury began life much further from the Sun and only later migrated inwards, perhaps colliding with something else on the way. This might explain the loss of those outer layers: they got stripped away in the impact. But Messenger observedlarge abundances of sulphur- and potassium-containing compounds at the surface, and these should have been burnt off in a giant impact. It's a fascinating world, says mission scientist Dr Suzie Imber from Leicester University. ""It's also got huge cliffs, many kilometres tall. And those cliffs formed as Mercury shrank. We call them wrinkle ridges."" This video can not be played BepiColombo: Mission to uncover mysteries of Mercury It is possible to go direct to Mercury in a matter of months, but the speed picked up by a spacecraft falling into the Sun's deep gravity well would make it very hard to stop at the planet. Bepi will take a more circuitous route. It will fly past Earth, Venus and Mercury itself, using the tug of their gravity to bleed off speed, so that by 2025 the mission can gently slot into position next to the diminutive world. The toughest prospect ahead is the heat. At just 58 million km from the Sun, working at Mercury is like being in a pizza oven. The sides of the probes in direct sunlight will have to cope with temperatures over 400C. Even those surfaces facing away from the Sun have to be protected from the radiant heat coming up from the ""hot potato"" planet below. Coping strategies include covering the MMO in thick blankets of insulation material made from titanium and ceramics. ""The environment is extremely hostile,"" explains Esa mission controller Elsa Montagnon. ""At Mercury, we get 10 times the solar energy we get at Earth. But then from the illuminated side of Mercury, we get about four times what we get on the Earth. So, the spacecraft are continually in a heat sandwich."" This video can not be played Elsa Montagnon will ""drive"" Bepi to Mercury The major UK instrument onboard the MPO is the Mercury Imaging X-Ray Spectrometer (MIXS). It will observe the abundance of chemical elements in the planet's outer layers. This information will be integral to solving the origin puzzle. Airbus in the UK built large parts of the MPO and the mission's propulsion unit, called the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM). The MTM hosts ""electric engines"" developed by QinetiQ. Two of these engines will be fired in the direction of travel, providing a gentle force to help control Bepi's fall into the inner Solar System. ""Each of our thrusters operates at 125 millinewtons, and one way to visualise that is that it's the same as the weight of a two-pound coin,"" said QinetiQ's Peter Randall. This video can not be played UK Space Agency CEO Graham Turnock details the British contribution It's expensive. Engineers have had a torrid time developing the technologies to keep Bepi safe so close to the Sun. Delays have added to the final ticket price. It's estimated the costs borne by the European Space Agency and the Japanese space agency amount to about â¬1.65bn. Additionally, national space agencies in Europe have paid for the instrumentation on the MMO, taking the overall budget above â¬3bn. This number covers the full lifecycle of the mission, from its approval (2007) to its termination (late 2020s). By way of comparison, the cost of Bepi would pay the salaries of the top seven football teams in the English Premier League for a couple of seasons.

Online sellers 'pay for positive reviews',"Some online sellers are offering people free goods in return for positive product reviews, an investigation by consumer group Which? has found. Its investigator joined several ""rewards for reviews"" groups and was hired to write high-rated reviews in return for free items. Paid-for, or fake, reviews flout rules set by platforms such as Amazon and Facebook. A similar investigation by BBC 5 live uncovered the trade in false reviews. Fake five-star reviews being bought and sold online The Which? investigator found five sellers who gave instructions to order an item through Amazon, write a review and share the link, with the promise of a refund. The investigator gave an honest review of the items, but in three out of five cases was not refunded because the reviews were not positive enough or the seller could no longer be contacted. The consumer group said that in one example the investigator gave a smartwatch a two-star review. They were told by the seller to rewrite it because the product was free, so it ""is the default to give five-star evaluation"". In another, the investigator was told that a ""refund will be done after a good five-star review with some photo"" after receiving some wireless bluetooth headphones. But after posting a three-star review with photos they were told they would not be refunded unless they wrote a five-star review. Do not rely on ratings - delve deeper and read the reviews Check the dates - look at when the reviews were posted. If many of them were posted in a short time period, it might mean there has been a push for reviews on Facebook groups or other platforms Impartial reviews - click on some reviewers and check their history. Do they give everything five stars? Pattern of ratings - are the ratings at different ends of the scale with very little in between? It is rare that people are completely polarised about a product Source: Which? Alex Neill, Which? managing director of home products and services, said the sellers were effectively ""ripping people off"" with paid-for reviews. Responding to Which?, Facebook said: ""Facilitating or encouraging the trade of fake user reviews is not permitted on Facebook. We urge people to use our reporting tools to flag content they suspect may violate our standards so that we can take swift action."" Amazon told Which?: ""We do not permit reviews in exchange for compensation of any kind, including payment. Customers and sellers must follow our review guidelines and those that don't will be subject to action including potential termination of their account."" In April, BBC 5 live Investigates described how it was able to buy a false, five-star recommendation placed on one of the world's leading review websites, Trustpilot. It also uncovered online forums where Amazon shoppers were offered full refunds in exchange for product reviews. Both companies said they do not tolerate false reviews.

Khashoggi died in consulate fight - Saudis,"This is the first time Saudi Arabia has admitted the death of Jamal Khashoggi Journalist Jamal Khashoggi was killed in a fight in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul, the country's state TV reports, quoting an initial inquiry. Deputy intelligence chief Ahmad al-Assiri and Saud al-Qahtani, senior aide to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman, were sacked over the affair, it says. US President Donald Trump said what had happened was ""unacceptable"" but added that Saudi Arabia was a ""great ally"". This is the first time the kingdom has admitted Mr Khashoggi is dead. The acknowledgement follows two weeks of denials that Saudi Arabia had any involvement in the disappearance of the prominent Saudi critic when he entered the consulate in Istanbul on 2 October to seek paperwork for his forthcoming marriage. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Khashoggi suspect had 'cyber spy' training The Saudi kingdom had come under increased pressure to explain Mr Khashoggi's disappearance after Turkish officials said he had been deliberately killed inside the consulate, and his body dismembered. Turkish forensic investigators have already searched the Saudi consulate and consul's residence On Friday, Turkish police widened their search from the consulate groundsto a nearby forest where unnamed officials believe his body may have been disposed of. Observers are questioning whether Riyadh's Western allies will find the Saudis' account of a ""botched rendition"" convincing - and whether it will persuade them not to take punitive action against Saudi Arabia. The UK Foreign Office said it was considering its next steps after hearing the report. Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner The Saudi leadership will now be hoping that its belated admission that Khashoggi did die, after all, inside its consulate - coupled with a handful of sackings and arrests - will be enough to draw a line under this affair. It will not. This is only a first step towards publicising the truth of what really happened. Given the days of indignant denials by the Saudi leadership it's doubtful we would have even got this far without sustained international pressure. There can only be one of two possible alternatives here: either - as many suspect - the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman was to blame or he had lost control of his inner circle, something most observers find hard to believe. MBS, as he is known, has a huge following amongst young patriotic Saudis who see him as a visionary reformer. If that support were now to ebb away then the crown prince could find himself dangerously isolated at court. A statement from Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor,externalsays a fight broke out between Mr Khashoggi, who had fallen out of favour with the Saudi government, and people who met him in the consulate - ending with his death. Investigations are still under way, it says, and 18 Saudi nationals have been arrested. The Saudi authorities have yet to give evidence to support this version of events. Unnamed officials speaking to Reuters news agency and the New York Times say the Saudis did not know the whereabouts of the body after it was handed to a ""local collaborator"" to dispose of. Saud al-Qahtani is a prominent member of the Saudi Royal Court and adviser to Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Saud al-Qahtani has over a million followers on Twitter Major-General Ahmed al-Assiri has acted as the top spokesman for the kingdom about the war in Yemen. He spoke to the BBC in 2017 about the conflict, defending Saudi Arabia's actions. This video can not be played Nawal Al-Maghafi speaks to Major-General Ahmed al-Assiri King Salman has also reportedly ordered the formation of a ministerial committee, headed by Crown Prince Mohammed, to restructure the intelligence services. Saudi Arabia says it acted on information provided by Turkish authorities as part of its inquiry, investigating a number of suspects. US President Donald Trump said the arrests were an important ""first step"",external, and praised the kingdom for acting quickly. He said the official explanation was ""credible"", despite many US lawmakers expressing disbelief over the Saudi account. He stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia as a counterbalance to Iran in the Middle East, and pushed back against the need for sanctions against the country in light of the new information, talking about the effect of such a move on the US economy. Earlier this week President Trump had warned of ""very severe"" consequences if Saudi Arabic was proved to have killed the journalist. A number of US lawmakers, including a Republican highly critical of the Saudis, Senator Lindsey Graham, said they were sceptical about the report on the journalist's death. Allow Twitter content?

Turkey has vowed to reveal all of the details of the killing, according to a spokesman for the ruling Justice and Development party quoted by Anadolu news agency. Meanwhile, Australia is the latest country to announce it is withdrawing from an investment summit in Saudi Arabia later this month - joining a growing boycott that includes the US, UK, Dutch and French finance ministers over the Khashoggi killing. Dutch Prime Minister  Mark Rutte has called for a ""thorough investigation"" to make sure ""all relevant facts will be clear as soon as possible"". Mr Khashoggi's fiancÃ©e, Hatice Cengiz, questioned in a tweet what had happened to his body, saying: ""The heart grieves, the eye tears, and with your separation we are saddened, my dear Jamal."" Turkish officials believe Mr Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents inside the consulate, and his body then removed - and they say they have video and audio evidence to back this up. Saudi Arabia has denied this, and initially insisted Mr Khashoggi had freely left the embassy. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Turkish newspapers with close links to the government have published gruesome details of the alleged audio, including what they describe as the sounds of screams and Mr Khashoggi being interrogated and tortured.

Turkey 'to reveal all' on Khashoggi killing,"This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi: What we know about the journalist's disappearance and death Turkey has vowed to reveal all details about the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, after Saudi Arabia admitted for the first time he had been killed in its consulate in Istanbul. ""Turkey will never allow a cover-up,"" a ruling party spokesperson said. Saudi Arabia suggested on Friday Mr Khashoggi, a prominent Saudi critic, had died in a ""fist fight"". Turkish officials previously said he had been deliberately killed inside the consulate, and his body dismembered. Earlier this week, unnamed Turkish officials told media outlets they had audio and visual evidence to prove this. The Saudi kingdom has come under intense pressure to explain Mr Khashoggi's disappearance after he entered the Istanbul consulate on 2 October to seek paperwork for his forthcoming marriage. Until Friday, it had denied knowledge of his whereabouts and insisted he had left the building alive. The Jamal Khashoggi story so far Who's who in alleged Saudi 'hit squad' Khashoggi suspect had 'cyber spy' training Turkish police and prosecutors have been searching the consulate as well as the consul's residence this week for evidence of what unfolded. On Friday they widened their search to a nearby forest, where unnamed officials believe his body may have been disposed of. The kingdom says a fight broke out between Mr Khashoggi, who had fallen out of favour with the Saudi government, and people who met him in the consulate - ending with his death. It says investigations are under way, and so far 18 Saudi nationals have been arrested. Unnamed officials speaking to Reuters news agency and the New York Times say the Saudis did not know the whereabouts of the body after it was handed to a ""local collaborator"" to dispose of. In addition to the arrests, two senior officials have been sacked over the affair - deputy intelligence chief Ahmad al-Assiri and Saud al-Qahtani, senior aide to Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman. Saud al-Qahtani, an adviser to Prince Mohammed bin Salman, has over a million Twitter followers The Saudi authorities have yet to give evidence to support this version of events. Observers are questioning whether Saudi Arabia's Western allies will find their account of a ""botched rendition"" convincing - and whether it will persuade them not to take punitive action against them. US President Donald Trump said what had happened was ""unacceptable"" but that the arrests were an important ""first step"". The UK Foreign Office said it was considering its next steps after hearing the report. ""Turkey will reveal whatever had happened,"" said Omer Celik of Turkey's ruling AKP party, according to Anadolu news agency. ""Nobody should ever doubt about it. We are not accusing anyone in advance but we don't accept anything to remain covered [up]."" Publicly Turkey has so far stopped short of blaming Saudi Arabia for the killing. Turkish investigators, however, say they have audio and video evidence which shows Mr Khashoggi was killed by a team of Saudi agents inside the consulate and dismembered. Reports in Turkish media this week gave gruesome details of what are said to be his final minutes. This video can not be played CCTV footage shows missing Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi entering the Saudi consulate in Istanbul Turkish media said earlier this week they had identified a 15-member team of suspected Saudi agents,externalwho flew into and out of Istanbul on the day of the disappearance. Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan spoke to Saudi King Salman on Friday evening, and the two agreed to continue co-operating in the investigation. Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Frank Gardner The Saudi leadership will now be hoping that its belated admission that Khashoggi did die, after all, inside its consulate - coupled with a handful of sackings and arrests - will be enough to draw a line under this affair. It will not. This is only a first step towards publicising the truth of what really happened. Given the days of indignant denials by the Saudi leadership it's doubtful we would have even got this far without sustained international pressure. There can only be one of two possible alternatives here: either - as many suspect - the powerful Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman was to blame or he had lost control of his inner circle, something most observers find hard to believe. MBS, as he is known, has a huge following amongst young patriotic Saudis who see him as a visionary reformer. If that support were now to ebb away then the crown prince could find himself dangerously isolated at court. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has condemned the killing ""in the strongest terms"", calling the explanations given of the circumstances of Mr Khashoggi's death ""inadequate"". The UK Foreign Office described it as ""a terrible act"" and said the people behind the killing ""must be held to account"". President Trump praised the kingdom for acting quickly,externaland said the official explanation was ""credible"", despite many US lawmakers expressing disbelief over the Saudi account. Mr Trump stressed the importance of Saudi Arabia as a counterbalance to Iran in the Middle East, and pushed back against the need for sanctions against the country in light of the new information, talking about the effect of such a move on the US economy. Earlier this week he warned of ""very severe"" consequences if Saudi Arabia was proved to have killed the journalist. A number of US lawmakers, including a Republican highly critical of the Saudis, Senator Lindsey Graham, said they were sceptical about the report on the journalist's death. Allow Twitter content?

March to call for 'people's vote' on Brexit,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows crowds covering roads in the city centre Protesters seeking a referendum on the final Brexit deal have attended a rally which organisers say was the biggest demonstration of its kind. Young voters led the People's Vote march to London's Parliament Square, which supporters say attracted approximately 700,000 protesters. It also had support from a number of MPs who want a fresh vote. This is something which has already been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May. The People's Vote campaign said stewards on the route estimated 700,000 were taking part. The Metropolitan Police said it was not able to estimate the size of the crowd. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who started the march - was among those who addressed Parliament Square, along with representatives from the main political parties. Celebrity speakers included Steve Coogan, Delia Smith and Deborah Meaden. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan on 'march for the future' London Mayor Mr Khan told the crowd:,external""What's really important is that those that say that a public vote is undemocratic, is unpatriotic, realise that in fact, the exact opposite is the truth. ""What could be more democratic, what could be more British, than trusting the judgement of the British people."" How will Parliament vote on a final deal? People's Vote march in pictures All you need to know about Brexit Tories 'must be as united as EU' - Hunt Thousands arrived at the meeting point on London's Park Lane for the march The march was held at the same time as a pro-Brexit rally in Harrogate, organised by the group Leave Means Leave and led by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Mr Farage said: ""The evidence suggests about a third of those that voted remain now say we're democrats and think the government should simply get on with it. ""And that's our message - get on with it, fulfil your promises to us, you said if we voted to leave it would happen, it needs to."" People gathered on Park Lane for hours before the march.  Many held home-made signs and banners with slogans like ""the wrexiteers"", ""Brexit stole my future"" and ""Even Baldrick had a plan"". As the crowds began to form, the sheer scale of the protest became clear. Thousands of people stretched filled the street, some were singing, others were playing instruments, while many plastic whistles blared out. There were lots of young families there, some with children wrapped in EU flags. Many told me they'd gone because they were worried about their families' future. Some people marched in groups - there were NHS staff, political parties, members of the LGBT community and dog owners. Many took the opportunity to dress up their pets for the protest. The start of the march was delayed due to the number of people there.  It was a good natured and friendly march through some of London's most famous streets before the hundreds of thousands of people arrived at Parliament Square. By that stage the march was so large that not everyone could fit in the square and demonstrators spilled out onto nearby streets. The marchers are hoping people power will persuade the British government to hold a referendum on the final Brexit deal. They will have to wait and see if the government was listening. The British public voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016. The UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the two-year Article 50 process. This video can not be played Protesters explain why they joined the People's Vote march to London's Parliament Square Labour's Lord Adonis, a campaigner for People's Vote - which wants a referendum on the outcome of the negotiations with the EU - said: ""Brexit's becoming a dog's dinner. ""This week's fresh chaos and confusion over Brexit negotiations has exposed how even the best deal now available will be a bad one for Britain."" A young boy holding a sign proclaiming support for the EU Richard Tice, founder of Leave Means Leave and former co-chair of Leave.EU, told BBC Breakfast: ""The idea that you should have a second referendum would be incredibly damaging - most of all to the trust in democracy from people up and down this country."" Some 150 coach loads of people from across the UK - including as far away from London as Orkney - travelled to the March for the Future, which started in Park Lane. TV chef Delia Smith told the crowds that Brexit was ""the most important issue in our lifetime"", adding: ""My message to MPs is please sort this out. Let the people you serve have their say."" Delia Smith addressed anti-Brexit campaigners at the rally Lord of the Rings star Andy Serkis attended with his wife Lorraine Ashbourne and 14-year-old son Louis. ""The will of the people is now, it's people expressing their points of view in a more informed state,"" he said. And First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon sent a message of support to the rally, saying the SNP would support a vote that would give the option of staying in the EU. #PeoplesVoteMarch was trending on Twitter on Saturday, with lots of young people - some of those who were not eligible to vote in the 2016 referendum - heading on the march. Emily Longman, 20, one of the students leading the march behind a People's Vote banner, was four months too young to vote in the 2016 referendum. She studies Spanish and is due to study abroad next year, but said ""no-one knows what will happen with Erasmus funding"". Aleta Doyle and her son Leo travelled from Peterborough Aleta Doyle, 46, from Peterborough, who attended with her 12-year-old son Leo, said she was marching ""for my children's future and European unity"". And Leo Buckley, 16, from Hampshire, said: ""Young people stand to lose the most. I'm going to be poorer and not have the same career opportunities."" At the other end of the age spectrum, Joe Trickey from Croydon celebrated his 83rd birthday at the march. He said: ""I believe very strongly in the EU as a place of peace and strength."" Dr Mike Galsworthy, from NHS Against Brexit, told BBC News: ""Whether you voted leave, or whether you voted remain - when a contract comes back, you do have the right to read the small print and say actually 'no, no. no, this isn't what we want to be signing up for'."" Campaign supporter Alastair Campbell, former Downing Street director of communications, said: ""The Brexit that was promised, and the Brexit that was campaigned successfully for, doesn't exist."" He added: ""I don't think you can re-run the referendum. I think we have to accept that we lost that debate. I think the question has to be on the nature of the deal.""

Prince Harry to launch Invictus Games,"Prince Harry has praised the dedication of those taking part in the Invictus Games for injured service personnel. Speaking at the opening ceremony, he said those taking part had turned the games into a ""symbol of... honour and optimism for a new generation"". He also told the crowd outside Sydney Opera House that he and Meghan were happy to share the ""personal joy"" of her pregnancy while in Australia. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on a 16-day tour of Australasia. Closing the ceremony, which was delayed for an hour by thunderstorms, Prince Harry said: ""Be inspired. Get excited. Allow the example of service and determination you will see, to change something big or small in your own lives."" The duke said: ""I have been so proud to be able to introduce my wife to you and we have been so happy to be able to celebrate the personal joy of our newest addition with you all."" It comes a year after the couple made their first official public appearance at the event when it was held in Toronto. The Invictus Games were started by Prince Harry in 2014. Prince Harry and Meghan were greeted by huge cheers at the opening ceremony Kensington Palace shared a picture of Meghan watching Prince Harry practising his opening ceremony speech The Invictus Games will see athletes from 18 countries compete in 11 sports over eight days. The duke, who served in the Army for 10 years, founded the Invictus Games in 2014 with the aim of helping wounded service personnel and veterans with their physical and psychological rehabilitation. That year the games were held in London, before heading to Florida in 2016 and Toronto last year. Last year's Invictus Games saw Prince Harry and Meghan make their first official public appearance together Twelve months on from their first official appearance together, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have since married and announced they are expecting a child in spring. By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent This was not the barnstormingspeech that Harry delivered in Toronto last year.This was something different. This was a speech for the head as well as the heart. This was redefining the Invictus Games and those who participated as a new generation - what the duke called the Invictus generation. Their dedication, said the duke, had been for too long overlooked. He spoke of the topic closest to his heart - what he called ""hidden emotional and mental wounds"". And he told the audience that the Invictus generation were not to be pitied, but to be respected and admired, ""an antidote to the narrative of division and despair we too often allow to define our era"". No longer wounded warriors, but exemplars of the highest ideals of sacrifice, courage and achievement - the duke's Invictus generation. Earlier, they paid their respects to Australia and New Zealand's war heroes. They were joined by the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for the opening of a memorial which commemorates those who fell in World War One, as well as conflicts including Korea, Afghanistan and Iraq. Harry and Meghan joined the Australian prime minister for the opening of the Anzac memorial Harry and Meghan later laid a wreath - their first as a married couple Harry and Meghan then took in the first event of the Invictus Games - the Jaguar Land Rover Driving Challenge at the city's Cockatoo Island. The duke presented medals to the winning teams, as well as testing his driving skills on the children's remote control car course.

The moving inside story of an adoption," One true story. Two young children. A family is being shattered; can a new one be created? For National Adoption Week, we present an adaptation of the BBC's award-winning podcast The Adoption, offering a rare insight into the process through the eyes of those affected. One by one, Ruth is taking her photographs down from the shelves to show me the smiling faces of her children. “She was just learning to walk,” she recalls, as she looks at one of them. Ruth reaches for another picture. “He was always a smiler.” Her youngest is just a few months old. But when I visit, the house is really quiet. There is no crying or gurgling to be heard. “That’s Bethany with her arm right around Ben’s neck, looking very happy and cheeky all at the same time,” she says looking at another photo. “She’s trying to say, ‘You're going nowhere, you’re staying right next to my side’. And Ben’s got his cheeky eyes.” Bethany is three years old and Ben, the second youngest, is two. But it will be years before she will be allowed to see the two of them again - if ever. By the time all the photos have been put away, I have seen pictures of all of Ruth’s children. There are six in total. The oldest is a teenager. But they are no longer in her care. “It was all good fun then. It’s good fun to remember these days,” she says. “That’s why I like to have the photos about. You can’t forget the good old days.” Three of her children have been subject to court orders that have ruled they should be adopted. Two others are in the care of Ruth’s parents, and one is living with his father. But Ruth is still hopeful for the future. “My kids have gone into care and are going up for adoption, but it won’t put me off having any more children. I know I can care for them, I know I can prove it. Give me the chance.” Ruth is not this woman’s real name but this is a real story. It is about two of her six children – the two who we are calling Bethany and Ben. In March 2016, a court ruled that the two young siblings should be adopted. Every year, thousands of children are the subject of such rulings around the United Kingdom. This means it has been decided they can no longer be brought up by their parents. The search is now on to find Bethany and Ben a new parent or parents.This usually happens away from the public eye but in this case, I was allowed to follow what happened. Most of their names have been changed but you are going to be reading their own words. By the time the family court had ruled the two children should be placed for adoption, Bethany and Ben had already been removed from their home. When I first started to follow their story, they had been with their foster carer, Lucy, for six months. They were brought to her straight from their nursery school. Bethany had refused to get into the car with the social workers. She was too upset, so one of her grandfathers had to bring her to the foster home instead. “Bethany did cry for her mummy for about an hour,” says Lucy. “I sat her on my knee and I cuddled her, and I reassured her. I said, ‘At the moment you’re not able to go home and I’m going to look after you’.” She says each of them was holding a teddy bear. “They’d got dummies in their mouths and that’s all they had. And the dummies, although they’re three and two [years old], are very important to them - their big comfort.” Lucy says both Bethany and Ben were not as distressed as she probably would have expected them to have been. “You’d think that they’d be really crying out and wanting mummy, but no. You don’t know what sort of emotional attention they got at home. We don’t know what went on, so probably getting all the attention here was something they were thriving on.” She remembers that at first, both children were fairly wary.“I ran them a bath and filled it with bubbles. They thought that was amazing, to go into a bath full of bubbles - they loved that. So that sort of broke the ice.” For now, Lucy’s house is their home. Just like Ruth, Lucy has many photos to show me – but hers are of the children she has looked after on behalf of the local authority. Her photo album is the story of 19 years as a foster carer. Including Bethany and Ben, at this point she has had 76 children stay with her. She decided to become a foster carer after she had adopted two children herself. “I thought,  ‘What am I going to do when they’ve gone to school?’ I became very friendly with the foster carer that looked after my two boys and I thought that was something that I could do.” Listen to the multi-award winning podcast“The Adoption” from BBC Radio 4’s The World at One. The facts are up to date as of November 2017. Her job is to look after children in her home on behalf of the local council. Sometimes it is just for a few days, but it is often for weeks or months. Occasionally, it is for even longer. Lucy gets an allowance to cover the cost of each child's care, which varies depending on how old they are. For Bethany and Ben, the allowance is around £130* each per week, plus allowances to pay for clothing and things like presents for birthdays and Christmas. She says money is not a consideration for her. She tries her best to prevent the children getting confused about her role – she is their foster carer, not a parent – so they call her by her first name. However, she can’t help but get emotionally attached. “They become part of your family and I always say that as each child leaves, they take a part of me with them. And I can’t talk about it for a few days after they’ve gone because it brings a lump to my throat.” She admits she will cry again when Bethany and Ben move on. “These children do have a lot on their shoulders. They’re dealing with things that they shouldn’t be dealing with. I mean, these little children shouldn’t be going through all this - they should be leading a happy life like ordinary children, but they’re not.” Adoption would mean permanent change for Bethany and Ben. Adopted children are given a new family – even their birth certificates are changed so they only contain details of their new parents. “They have been loved and wanted, there’s no doubt about that, but their parents haven’t always put their needs first,” says Sharon Clarke, the social worker in charge of Bethany and Ben’s case. “They’ve seen a lot of adults who are angry with each other, a lot of shouting. They’ve not always had their birth parents available to them when they’ve needed [that], so they’ve had to be quite self-sufficient,” she says. “They’ve got older siblings who have perhaps done a lot of their care because their parents haven’t been available.” It is not safe for the pair to be in their home any longer, she says. Sharon has been a social worker for more than 23 years. She works for Lincolnshire Children’s Services, which is part of the local council and is responsible for working with the families of children considered at risk of coming to harm. All of the children Sharon works with are in the social care system and either have been, or are expected to be, the subject of court rulings which order that they should be adopted. “The ones who come to adoption are the ones where nothing else will do and it is the last resort,” she says. A very small number of children in the UK are voluntarily given up for adoption - or “relinquished” - by their parents. Sharon says there can be several reasons for this. “If a parent has had a child removed previously,” she says, “or they maybe feel they can’t financially cope with another child.” She says parents with a “learning difficulty or a mental health problem might recognise that they need help and support and ask for that child to be adopted.” Before starting the search for potential adopters, social workers are encouraged to see whether members of the children’s family could take on that role. In Bethany and Ben’s case, this included their maternal grandparents, Patricia and Geoff. They tell me their family had not had any previous contact with social services and, understandably, it has been a very difficult time. “It became apparent that the parenting skills of my daughter - their mother - was well below what might be expected,” says Geoff. “My daughter’s responsibilities were completely lacking. Children aren't supposed to look after themselves, they’re not supposed to look after their siblings, they’re supposed to have what’s considered a normal life - you know, where they are children and they do children things.” He says Ruth was given a lot of help from care workers, but he tells me he and Patricia feel frustrated about how the situation developed. “How come we weren’t told, instead of waiting until it had gone down the line a bit further?” Patricia asks. “Maybe we might have been able to change something, I just don’t know. And I just feel angry.” The social workers say there is always the need for confidentiality when they are dealing with cases like these. But they say that “as the case became more worrying, the grandparents were brought on board. This was through the use of a family group conference, which is basically bringing the whole support network of a family together to come up with a plan to support and protect the family who are struggling”. We had to make a heart-rending decision. We had to choose two out of four children Patricia and Geoff say they would love to bring up Bethany and Ben. But they say they can’t because they are already caring for Bethany and Ben’s older brothers and sisters.“Because of physical constraints, we could only take two children,” says Geoff. As incredible as it sounds, he says he and his wife had to make a choice between their grandchildren. “We had to make a heart-rending decision - we had to choose two out of four children.” Geoff says if they had chosen the younger children, it would have meant that the older two would have gone into foster care and stayed there because it is harder to find families to adopt older children. He hopes, when they are old enough, Bethany and Ben will appreciate the choice they made. “Given all the facts, it can only be the right thing for them,” he says. “And hopefully they’ll understand that. It’ll get them on a course where they’ll live a normal life.” Having made that decision, Geoff and Patricia know sooner or later, they will be seeing them for the last time. “You realise that the time is getting close,” Patricia says. “You think, ‘Oh, I'm going to miss them’. I can’t judge what it’s doing to the rest of the family but I know how I feel.” For now, they are being allowed to see Bethany and Ben – but only every three weeks. This is because there are strict controls on when and how the children can spend time with their family. Social workers call the hours they have together “contact time”. This is seen as being very important – both for the children and their families. Patricia and Geoff’s contact time is unsupervised, as it has been decided they do not pose a risk to the children. This means no social workers are with them when they meet. They like going on days out and taking them to the park. They are given six hours before they then have to take their grandchildren back to the foster carer. It is now down to Sharon, the social worker, to try to find Bethany and Ben a new home. The clock is ticking, as Sharon’s manager, Anne Johnson, is only too aware. “We aim to place all of our children within the government timescale,” she says. “[That’s] presently 121 days, which is nearly four months.” The search for new parents is not straightforward. Sharon and her colleagues had identified potential adopters - she thought they “could be the ones” – but they have said no. “Unfortunately, on this occasion, I think probably [faced with] the reality of hearing about real-life children rather than case studies, this particular adoptive family felt that the children were a little bit too old for them, so we’re now back to the drawing board and looking again.” In the meantime, while the search for a new family continues, contact time for what is now being referred to by social workers as “the birth family” is allowed to carry on. I can’t see I’ve done anything wrong. All I tried to do was the best for my children For the children’s birth parents, this is just two hours once a fortnight. Their sessions are supervised by social workers at a local contact centre run specifically for that purpose and to provide support. After seeing his children, Bethany and Ben’s father, Stephen, tells me he feels he should have been given the chance to bring up his children and should have been given the opportunity to go on parenting courses. “I can’t see I’ve done anything wrong,” he says. “All I tried to do was the best for my children.” Lincolnshire Children’s Services says its staff had many concerns about how the children were being cared for and that Stephen was offered a full parenting assessment as part of the care proceedings. Social workers say he was supported, encouraged and his parenting skills assessed, but there remained numerous and serious concerns over his ability to safely parent his children. Stephen is no longer with Bethany and Ben’s birth mother Ruth. Back in his flat, he shows me his selection of mugs. One has the words World’s Greatest Dad written on the side, while another says Number One Daddy. “I’ve got some more in the cupboard,” he says. He says when he and Ruth lived together, the children were getting fed all the time because he was doing all the cooking and housework. “I was also going out to work. I was coming home lunchtimes when I could to feed the youngest children,” he says. For her part, Ruth has accepted the fact that her children are going to be adopted, but that doesn’t make it any easier for her. “I like to think I’m a good mum,” she says. “Obviously people can say different. I did and do what I think I’m good at – which is being a mum.” Social services have been involved in Ruth’s life since before Bethany and Ben were born. The social workers acknowledge she loves them but they believe – despite many attempts to help her – she hasn’t kept them safe. “When they are babies,” she says, “[it’s] easier. Obviously as they get older, it does get a bit tougher because they’re more active. I still gave them all the love and attention. There were the tough times and, well, the easier times.” Ruth feels social services were unfair on her. “They felt I wasn’t making sure that the kids were safe. They say, ‘Well you’ve got to sort this out, you’ve got to sort that out’. But at that time, I didn’t. To me it didn’t really sink in because I think I’ve had depression for years. It rears its head every now and again. I’m on tablets now for it.” According to Lincolnshire Children’s Services, Bethany and Ben were on the register for emotional and physical abuse, as well as neglect, and Ruth’s home was unsafe. Ruth says her case has not been helped by having to get used to more than one social worker. She says she has had three because the first two left their jobs. Lincolnshire Children’s Services says at times “unfortunately there is the need for a change of social worker. This can be difficult for birth families and children, who feel that they have built a good working relationship.” Ruth says social services have made a big mistake - her children were safe and were not being neglected. As they approach the halfway point in the period set by the government to successfully place Bethany and Ben, Sharon Clarke and another colleague think they have managed to find a couple who will want to adopt them. We are calling the potential adopters Julie and Robert. They have been told about the children and want to hear more. “We need to meet face-to-face because I will have questions for them about how I feel they can meet the children’s needs,” says Sharon. “And presumably they’ll have a big list of questions for me and issues and things they might be worried or concerned about.” Julie and Robert have been shown a report about the children, called the Child Permanence Report. This contains all of their background information - their medical information, all their history and a lot of details about the birth family. Having read it, they have decided they want to proceed. There is still much in this rigorous process that will need to happen first, but looking around their home, you wouldn’t think that. “I don’t want to jump ahead too much,” Julie says, yet she and Robert have already decorated one room in blue and the other in pink. “Blue is the traditional colour, but if our son wants to change the room, then we’ll oblige and consider it,” says Robert. “Ikea delivered 48 packages,” Julie says, showing me the other room, “so we had to work out which bit went with which. There’s quite a lot of pink in here."" We want them to be happy and we want them to be happy to be with us Julie says the choice of colours was as a result of talking to the social workers. Pink is apparently Bethany’s favourite colour. “We’ll wait and see what our new daughter would like [her room] to look like,”  she says. As he talks about the children, Robert has a smile that stretches from ear to ear. “We want them to be happy and we want them to be happy to be with us,”  he says. Julie is in her late 30s and Robert is in his early 40s. They only embarked on the adoption process seven months ago. “I just didn’t want to be pregnant,” Julie says. “The whole idea of it was completely horrific to me. I thought as I got older that would disappear and it didn’t - it didn’t go away - but then I realised that I did want to have a family."" Robert then suggested they should adopt. “We just feel that we'd like to give children the chance to live their life and grow up and be happy,” he says. They were assigned a social worker, who visited them once a week until what is known as a “home study” – a report all about the couple – was completed. That was presented to a panel of people appointed by the council which considers who should be put on the list of approved adopters. The recommendation was made that Julie and Robert should be approved, and the area’s assistant director of children’s services – who is ultimately responsible for these decisions – did just that. Julie and Robert have had to make difficult decisions about the number, the ages and the backgrounds of the children they want adopt. “We discussed children [who] had learning difficulties, maybe some physical difficulties, the ages of children that we might consider to adopt, and that’s a really difficult process because you know that there are children out there who are looking for what we call a forever home and you don’t want to say no to anybody,” says Julie. “But realistically you have to consider what, as brand-new parents, we are going to be able to cope with when our life changes completely when we adopt.” Social workers want Julie and Robert to know as much about Bethany and Ben – and their backgrounds – as they possibly can. They have been invited to hear directly from a group of people who know a lot about them and their parents. They are about to attend what social workers call an “information sharing meeting”. They are joined around a large table by nine others, including social workers, the foster carer and a teacher from the children’s nursery school. The meeting lasts more than two hours. It is a chance for all the professionals involved in the case to tell them what they know, and for Julie and Robert to ask any questions they want. They hear some serious concerns about the way the children were being brought up. They are told Stephen “was the authority figure in the home”.“In his own way, he was trying to provide some sort of structure but his approach was very inflexible and it wasn't appropriate a number of times, going over to becoming unsafe,” they are told. Robert and Julie hear that “some of his parenting, as the court reports will say, was quite cruel - locking children away from toilets and things like that”. Drug and alcohol misuse can often be factors in cases like these, but the social workers explain that they have “never been an issue in this family”. The children, they’re told, “were pretty much found looking after themselves”. Both Ruth and Stephen deny they were cruel or neglectful. For Julie and Robert, the two-hour session was all they needed to make up their minds. “We’re going to go through with it for definite, 100%,” Robert says afterwards. That means they will now have to face a second adoption panel – this time in the hope that they will be approved specifically to adopt Bethany and Ben. This might come as a surprise but they will not actually meet the children until this process has been completed. Julie and Robert are going through the approval process to adopt two children based purely on what they have been told about them. They will have to wait to see them in real life until after they have been accepted as suitable to adopt them. The social workers explain that the process is created “from the child’s perspective as much as possible”. They do everything they can to stop children going through the trauma of meeting potential new parents who might then change their minds. With social workers increasingly confident that new parents have been found, it is now time to bring the subject up with Bethany and Ben for the first time. But how do you go about telling children – especially when they are aged just two and three – that they are to be given a new mum and dad? Sharon is nervous. She is seeing the children straight after they have seen their birth mother, followed by their birth father, at supervised contact sessions. “I have absolutely no idea how they’re going to take to this idea about moving again and a new mummy and daddy, when they have a mummy and daddy who they’ve just seen and who they’ve had a nice time with,” she tells me. Sharon is going to read them new stories, which have been written especially for them – Bethany and Ben’s Teddy Bear Adventure books. “This is the first tool that I’ll be using to talk about the reasons why they’re not living at home with mummy or daddy,” she says, “and to explain my special job of trying to find them a special forever family and to help them remember who’s important in their lives.” There is a slightly different book for each of them but both feature two bears - brother and sister bears called Ben and Bethany. One is wearing a pink T-shirt with “I’m the big sister” written on it and the other is wearing a blue one which reads “I’m the little brother”. And so the story begins… “Once upon a time there were two teddy bears, one teddy bear was called Bethany and one was called Ben.” “You are the bear,” Sharon tells Bethany “who loves baking cakes and painting her nails all the pretty colours of the rainbow.” “I’m the bear,” says Bethany back. “They live with a lovely foster bear family.” “I wonder who’s next? Who else do you think will be a bear?” Sharon asks them. “Who have you seen today?” “Mummy and daddy,” Bethany replies. “Mummy bear and daddy bear don’t know how to keep little bear safe and the wise bear judge one day said, ‘You need a new bear family’.” “A new teddy bear family,” Sharon repeats. Sharon leaves the books with Lucy, the foster carer, so the children can continue to have their new stories read to them. While the children are listening to the bear stories, their potential new parents are about to be questioned. Usually, an adoption panel takes place behind closed doors, but I was allowed to watch much of what happened. The panel comprises a number of independent people who have relevant backgrounds, often in social work. There is also a medical advisor, as well as former adopters and adoptees. The panel considers a lot of confidential information. The social workers are asked a wide range of questions, and Julie and Robert are quizzed for about 20 minutes. Adopters are usually advised by their social workers that they are only put in front of the panel once they are considered to be ready, and that the outcome is likely to be positive. However, Julie and Robert found it tougher than they had expected. “You get asked lots of questions that you can’t answer because you’ve not been a parent,” says Julie. She says she and Robert were asked, “How would you cope with this?” and, “How would you do this?” and, “What would you do if this happened?” “I don’t know,” she says. “Ask me in six months’ time and I’ll be able to tell you, but at the moment you can’t be any more prepared than you try to be.” Despite being tough, the outcome is exactly what the couple have been hoping for. The panel recommends that the children should be placed with Robert and Julie, and once again, this is approved by the area’s assistant director of children’s services. This process does not finalise an adoption – a court will have to decide whether or not to do that later – but it means Julie and Robert can now be introduced to Bethany and Ben for the first time. First though, the children need to be told another story. Sharon, the social worker has to return with Teddy Bear Adventure Book Two. “Remember my special job,” she reminds them, “is to help find you a new family.” “A new family?” Bethany asks. Pointing at a photograph in the new book, Sharon says, “This lady is your new...” “Family!” Bethany says. “That’s right, that’s your new mummy. And this is daddy,” Sharon tells them. After seeing pictures of what will be their new home, including their bedrooms and garden, the children tell Sharon they want to take their scooters with them. “That’s mummy, that’s daddy!” Bethany says looking at the pictures in her latest book. Sharon tells the children, “And they’ll say, ‘We want you to be our little boy and girl, to come and live at our house and be a big family, all together’.” Before Bethany and Ben can meet their new parents, something very important has to happen. With the adoption process progressing quickly, their contact sessions with members of their birth family have already started to become less frequent. With Ruth and Stephen, the fortnightly intervals have been increased to four weeks. Now they are to come to an end altogether. Social workers have had to arrange what will be the final meetings - or at least their last for a very long time. Words, of course, cannot adequately sum up the emotions. Please look after them with all your heart. I know I couldn’t do it. You’ve got the chance, so just please look after them “It feels as though you are losing a part of your body,” Patricia, their grandmother, says. “We've just got to remember all the things that we've done, so just keeping them in our minds and our hearts.” Ruth has a message for the adopters. “Please look after them with all your heart. I know I couldn’t do it. You’ve got the chance, so just please look after them,” she says. And she wishes she knew more about these new parents. “I’m not saying I want to know where they live or anything like that – it’s just nice to have that little bit of information. I know the kids will be safe – they wouldn’t put them with someone that isn’t safe, but it’s just a bit of general information on the adopters.” Stephen later tells me what he said to his children. “Daddy will see you again some other time. And [I] said to them, ‘Love you,’ and gave them kisses and hugs. And then I went.” He says he would give his life for his kids. “I’d do anything for them and I’m really going to miss them,” he says. While the goodbyes were taking place, the children still had not met the couple chosen to become their new parents. Now, finally, it is time for that to happen. Ten months after being placed in a foster home and five months after a court decided they should be adopted, that day has finally arrived. Bethany and Ben are about to come face-to-face with their new mum and dad in person for the first time. Lucy the foster carer is reading the Teddy Bear Adventure books with the children again, when people arrive at the door. “I looked up at the window and I saw new mummy and daddy coming,” Lucy recalls later. “I said, ‘Ooh, it’s new mummy and daddy’.” Bethany and Ben get off the chairs and run to the door. Julie and Robert do not even have time to knock. Bethany and Ben are standing in front new mummy and daddy, whose pictures they have just been looking at. “That’s daddy and mummy,” says Bethany. “It is. It is. Yes,” Julie replies. Soon Bethany and Ben are blowing the bubbles that their new parents have brought with them. And then they make cakes together. “They opened the door and they said, ‘Are you my mummy, are you my daddy?’” Julie tells me a few weeks later. “So, we all sat around the kitchen table and had a chat and they talked to us and they sat on our knee. We played with them for a little while.” “Sitting there with them at the table, I felt like a daddy then - on the first day we met them,” says Robert. “It’s what we’ve been wanting, what we’ve planned for. When we met them, I was a bit emotional after going home.” The introductions are meticulously planned. The children and new parents gradually spend more time together and, after a few days, the children get to visit their new home for the first time. Bethany insists she wants to take her teddy bear book with her, so that she can look at the pictures again in the car on the way. For the new parents, it is intense and exhausting. “You want to know that you’ve done the right thing and you’ve made the right decision,” says Julie. “You want them to like you, but you also don’t want to be soft. It’s a bit like a crash-course in parenting for two weeks.” Bethany and Ben move in with Robert and Julie exactly a fortnight after they first meet. Five weeks later I ask Julie whether they had fallen in love with them. “I don’t know,” she laughs. “I’ve never had children before. I don’t think I can answer that question at the minute. The attachments are growing each day. We’re really happy - really, really happy.” And the couple are keen to stress they have no regrets. “No regrets whatsoever,” says Robert. Six months after Bethany and Ben move into their new home, they are taken to a family court. The children are dressed in their smartest clothes. The judge speaks to both of them in turn. He even allows them to sit in his seat, on their new parents’ laps. There are photos to prove it. Then the new family goes out to dinner. That was the day Bethany and Ben found out that “wise bear judges” are not only there to rule that mummy and daddy bears cannot keep little bears safe, they also have the power to officially confirm the bringing together of brand new “bear families”. Their visit to court was for a special hearing to celebrate the granting of the adoption order. As a result, Julie and Robert are now Bethany and Ben’s legal parents. New birth certificates have been issued with Julie down as mum and Robert as dad. “Our children are both very affectionate and love cuddles and hugs,” says Julie. “We have lots of fun days out - both children love being outdoors and getting messy.  We grow vegetables in the garden, tend the plants, play with water, ride bikes, go for walks and bounce on trampolines.  Ben particularly likes helping to cook meals.” Julie and Robert say their children’s favourite toys are now teddy bears they were given on the day they met. They look just like the bears in their special teddy bear books. They take the cuddly toys with them everywhere they go – for all car journeys, on the sofa to cuddle up to and, of course, they have them to fall asleep with at night. They are called simply Pink Bear and Blue Bear. The new family has conversations about the adoption, and Julie and Robert expect a lot more questions as their children get older. Apparently Ben “is still very boisterous and struggles to concentrate, needing firm boundaries in order to stay safe”.  Bethany gets very upset with any change in routine and “likes to know what is happening next and likes ‘order’”. Robert and Julie tell me they are very happy and have fallen deeply in love with their children. When contacted a few months later, Stephen, the birth father, said it had been a difficult time and he had been unwell but was getting better with medication. The birth mother’s parents, Patricia and Geoff, were still fostering two of their daughter’s older children. Lucy, the foster carer, told me she cried when Bethany and Ben left, just as she had anticipated. There have been many more goodbyes since, as she continues to foster children for the local authority. Having contested the original decision that their children should be put up for adoption, Ruth and Stephen did not contest the adoption order. Meanwhile, in the house where this story began, new photographs have appeared. Ruth had not intended for it to happen so soon, but she had become pregnant again. It was her seventh child. But none of them are living with her. *Since the BBC interviewed Lucy, the foster parent allowance that she would have received for Bethany and Ben has increased to £138.67. Built with Shorthand"
Disqualified race winner 'can run again',"Jack Gray said he knew of others who had swapped places, but thinks he was singled out because he won A half marathon winner, who was then disqualified, has been invited back for next year's event - as long as he does not run under his boss's name again. Jack Gray, 25, took the place of his injured boss Andrew Rawlings at March's Cambridge Half Marathon and finished first,but fell foul of the rules. Race director Adam Moffat said they would ""welcome"" Mr Gray back. But Mr Gray said he was ""undecided"" and may prioritise other races as he seeks international selection. The transport planner beat more than 7,000 runners to win in his first half marathon, and came within a minute of the course record with a time of 66 minutes and 52 seconds. Jack Gray (circled in red), won the race but was disqualified, and Will Mycroft (in green) was declared the winner When he finished he heard the name ""Andrew Rawlings"" ringing out over the public address system, and told organisers who he really was. Sheffield student William Mycroft, who came second, was then declared the winner. Mr Gray said there were two different races he was considering next year - one on the same weekend as the Cambridge race and one the week after - that were ""important for international selection"". He said his aim was to run the marathon at the Commonwealth Games in his home city of Birmingham in 2022. ""It's a long shot but it's too tempting not to have a crack,"" he said. Having a leg amputated 'like Christmas' Motorway traffic stopped to save dog Man who 'dislikes cows' in dairy fight Mr Moffat said he would encourage Mr Gray to sign up for Cambridge when the application process opened on Thursday. Next year's race is on 3 March. He said: ""Although disappointed by the outcome of last year's race we would welcome Jack back to see if he can repeat last year's feat.

Meghan and Harry to launch Invictus Games,"Prince Harry has praised the dedication of those taking part in the Invictus Games for injured service personnel. Speaking at the opening ceremony, he said those taking part had turned the games into a ""symbol of... honour and optimism for a new generation"". He also told the crowd outside Sydney Opera House that he and Meghan were happy to share the ""personal joy"" of her pregnancy while in Australia. The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are on a 16-day tour of Australasia. Closing the ceremony, which was delayed for an hour by thunderstorms, Prince Harry said: ""Be inspired. Get excited. Allow the example of service and determination you will see, to change something big or small in your own lives."" The duke said: ""I have been so proud to be able to introduce my wife to you and we have been so happy to be able to celebrate the personal joy of our newest addition with you all."" It comes a year after the couple made their first official public appearance at the event when it was held in Toronto. The Invictus Games were started by Prince Harry in 2014. Prince Harry and Meghan were greeted by huge cheers at the opening ceremony Kensington Palace shared a picture of Meghan watching Prince Harry practising his opening ceremony speech The Invictus Games will see athletes from 18 countries compete in 11 sports over eight days. The duke, who served in the Army for 10 years, founded the Invictus Games in 2014 with the aim of helping wounded service personnel and veterans with their physical and psychological rehabilitation. That year the games were held in London, before heading to Florida in 2016 and Toronto last year. Last year's Invictus Games saw Prince Harry and Meghan make their first official public appearance together Twelve months on from their first official appearance together, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex have since married and announced they are expecting a child in spring. By Jonny Dymond, BBC royal correspondent This was not the barnstormingspeech that Harry delivered in Toronto last year.This was something different. This was a speech for the head as well as the heart. This was redefining the Invictus Games and those who participated as a new generation - what the duke called the Invictus generation. Their dedication, said the duke, had been for too long overlooked. He spoke of the topic closest to his heart - what he called ""hidden emotional and mental wounds"". And he told the audience that the Invictus generation were not to be pitied, but to be respected and admired, ""an antidote to the narrative of division and despair we too often allow to define our era"". No longer wounded warriors, but exemplars of the highest ideals of sacrifice, courage and achievement - the duke's Invictus generation. Earlier, they paid their respects to Australia and New Zealand's war heroes. They were joined by the Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison for the opening of a memorial which commemorates those who fell in World War One, as well as conflicts including Korea, Afghanistan and Iraq. Harry and Meghan joined the Australian prime minister for the opening of the Anzac memorial Harry and Meghan later laid a wreath - their first as a married couple Harry and Meghan then took in the first event of the Invictus Games - the Jaguar Land Rover Driving Challenge at the city's Cockatoo Island. The duke presented medals to the winning teams, as well as testing his driving skills on the children's remote control car course.

Migrants storm Guatemala-Mexico border,"This video can not be played Migrant caravan: 'May God soften Trump's heart' Thousands of people travelling across Central America en masse to the US are stuck on Mexico's southern border after a failed attempt to enter the country. Some of them broke through Guatemalan border fences but then clashed with Mexican riot police in no man's land. On Friday, US President Donald Trump thanked Mexico for its efforts in stopping the caravan of migrants. The migrants, mostly from Honduras, say they are fleeing violence and poverty, and include women and children. In Pictures: Migrants face border tear gas President Trump, who has threatened to close down the US border and cut aid to countries allowing the caravan to pass, said the military would be called upon if needed. ""They might as well turn back, they're not coming into this country,"" he told reporters on Friday. Some of the migrants took drastic measures to try to avoid the border checkpoint After talks on border security in Mexico, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the situation was reaching ""a moment of crisis"". Many of the migrants temporarily broke through barriers on a bridge which crosses the river border between Guatemala and Mexico. Dozens of Mexican police in riot gear fired tear gas to force them to retreat into no-man's land after being attacked with stones. They forced open a gate on the Guatemalan side and crossed the bridge to Mexico before being pushed back by police A number of migrants jumped into the Suchiate river to reach rafts, while others either turned back towards Guatemala or simply sat down on the bridge. Several people were reportedly injured in the clash, including migrants, police and journalists. Pompeo: Migrant flow 'a moment of crisis' Trump threatens Honduras aid over migrants One woman nursing a baby told AFP she had lost two of her children in the chaos. ""We're running away from violence, and we arrive here and they just hit us more,"" Marta Ornelas Cazares, 28, said. ""I don't know what happened, I thought we were going to cross peacefully and then suddenly there were rocks flying and tear gas."" Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' Who decided to separate illegal immigrant families? Good news for Honduras' murder capital? The Mexican authorities said those with valid passports and visas would be allowed in immediately, though this is believed to apply to only a minority of the migrants. They warned that anyone without papers would have to apply for refugee status or turn back, and anyone who crossed illegally would be detained and deported. A number of injuries were reported in the clashes on Friday According to AFP, they started to allow a small number of people - including women and children - who were seeking refugee status to pass the border late on Friday. They were put on to trucks and taken into shelters. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said he had spoken to his Guatemalan counterpart and asked permission to send his country's civil protection force to the area to help the migrants. ""I also asked for authorisation to hire ground transportation for anyone who wants to return and an air bridge for special cases of women, children, the elderly and the sick,"" Hernandez tweeted. Families in the migrant caravan celebrated the breach of a gate on the Guatemala-Mexico border The two leaders are due to meet later on Saturday to discuss the situation. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the border clash was ""unprecedented"" and accused some of the migrants of attacking police. Human rights groups have criticised the US and Mexican response to the caravan. Erika Guevara-Rosas of Amnesty International said in a statement: ""These families deserve dignity and respect to ensure that no-one is illegally returned to situations where they could risk serious harm due to violence."" Since his campaign days, Mr Trump has lambasted illegal immigrants, and this latest caravan comes after a major immigration crackdown. Women, children and elderly are amongst the thousands of people trying to get to the US Changes to detention rules sawthousands of migrant children detainedand separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation. Mr Trump's threats come weeks before the mid-term elections on 6 November, which could see Democrats unseating Republicans in the House of Representatives. According to a Kaiser Foundation poll,external, immigration is the most important issue for 15% of all voters, though the number jumps to 25% among Republican voters. While Mr Trump has sent National Guard troops to the border before, it is unclear what he means by shutting it down entirely, and whether that would affect businesses or people with legitimate visas. This video can not be played The migrant caravan Trump keeps referencing And according to international law, the US cannot deport asylum seekers without first determining the validity of their claim. An estimated 10% of the population of Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras have fled danger, forced gang recruitment and dismal economic opportunities. The region has one of the highest murder rates in the world. The UN reported murder rates in 2015 in Honduras standing at 63.75 deaths per 100,000 and El Salvador at 108.64 deaths. Jari Dixon, an opposition politician in Honduras, tweeted on Monday that the caravan was not ""seeking the American dream"" but ""fleeing the Honduras nightmare"".

March to call for People's Vote on Brexit,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows crowds covering roads in the city centre Protesters seeking a referendum on the final Brexit deal have attended a rally which organisers say was the biggest demonstration of its kind. Young voters led the People's Vote march to London's Parliament Square, which supporters say attracted approximately 700,000 protesters. It also had support from a number of MPs who want a fresh vote. This is something which has already been ruled out by Prime Minister Theresa May. The People's Vote campaign said stewards on the route estimated 700,000 were taking part. The Metropolitan Police said it was not able to estimate the size of the crowd. Mayor of London Sadiq Khan - who started the march - was among those who addressed Parliament Square, along with representatives from the main political parties. Celebrity speakers included Steve Coogan, Delia Smith and Deborah Meaden. This video can not be played Sadiq Khan on 'march for the future' London Mayor Mr Khan told the crowd:,external""What's really important is that those that say that a public vote is undemocratic, is unpatriotic, realise that in fact, the exact opposite is the truth. ""What could be more democratic, what could be more British, than trusting the judgement of the British people."" How will Parliament vote on a final deal? People's Vote march in pictures All you need to know about Brexit Tories 'must be as united as EU' - Hunt Thousands arrived at the meeting point on London's Park Lane for the march The march was held at the same time as a pro-Brexit rally in Harrogate, organised by the group Leave Means Leave and led by former UKIP leader Nigel Farage. Mr Farage said: ""The evidence suggests about a third of those that voted remain now say we're democrats and think the government should simply get on with it. ""And that's our message - get on with it, fulfil your promises to us, you said if we voted to leave it would happen, it needs to."" People gathered on Park Lane for hours before the march.  Many held home-made signs and banners with slogans like ""the wrexiteers"", ""Brexit stole my future"" and ""Even Baldrick had a plan"". As the crowds began to form, the sheer scale of the protest became clear. Thousands of people stretched filled the street, some were singing, others were playing instruments, while many plastic whistles blared out. There were lots of young families there, some with children wrapped in EU flags. Many told me they'd gone because they were worried about their families' future. Some people marched in groups - there were NHS staff, political parties, members of the LGBT community and dog owners. Many took the opportunity to dress up their pets for the protest. The start of the march was delayed due to the number of people there.  It was a good natured and friendly march through some of London's most famous streets before the hundreds of thousands of people arrived at Parliament Square. By that stage the march was so large that not everyone could fit in the square and demonstrators spilled out onto nearby streets. The marchers are hoping people power will persuade the British government to hold a referendum on the final Brexit deal. They will have to wait and see if the government was listening. The British public voted to leave the EU by a margin of 51.89% to 48.11% in a referendum in June 2016. The UK is scheduled to leave on 29 March 2019, under the terms of the two-year Article 50 process. This video can not be played Protesters explain why they joined the People's Vote march to London's Parliament Square Labour's Lord Adonis, a campaigner for People's Vote - which wants a referendum on the outcome of the negotiations with the EU - said: ""Brexit's becoming a dog's dinner. ""This week's fresh chaos and confusion over Brexit negotiations has exposed how even the best deal now available will be a bad one for Britain."" A young boy holding a sign proclaiming support for the EU Richard Tice, founder of Leave Means Leave and former co-chair of Leave.EU, told BBC Breakfast: ""The idea that you should have a second referendum would be incredibly damaging - most of all to the trust in democracy from people up and down this country."" Some 150 coach loads of people from across the UK - including as far away from London as Orkney - travelled to the March for the Future, which started in Park Lane. TV chef Delia Smith told the crowds that Brexit was ""the most important issue in our lifetime"", adding: ""My message to MPs is please sort this out. Let the people you serve have their say."" Delia Smith addressed anti-Brexit campaigners at the rally Lord of the Rings star Andy Serkis attended with his wife Lorraine Ashbourne and 14-year-old son Louis. ""The will of the people is now, it's people expressing their points of view in a more informed state,"" he said. And First Minister of Scotland Nicola Sturgeon sent a message of support to the rally, saying the SNP would support a vote that would give the option of staying in the EU. #PeoplesVoteMarch was trending on Twitter on Saturday, with lots of young people - some of those who were not eligible to vote in the 2016 referendum - heading on the march. Emily Longman, 20, one of the students leading the march behind a People's Vote banner, was four months too young to vote in the 2016 referendum. She studies Spanish and is due to study abroad next year, but said ""no-one knows what will happen with Erasmus funding"". Aleta Doyle and her son Leo travelled from Peterborough Aleta Doyle, 46, from Peterborough, who attended with her 12-year-old son Leo, said she was marching ""for my children's future and European unity"". And Leo Buckley, 16, from Hampshire, said: ""Young people stand to lose the most. I'm going to be poorer and not have the same career opportunities."" At the other end of the age spectrum, Joe Trickey from Croydon celebrated his 83rd birthday at the march. He said: ""I believe very strongly in the EU as a place of peace and strength."" Dr Mike Galsworthy, from NHS Against Brexit, told BBC News: ""Whether you voted leave, or whether you voted remain - when a contract comes back, you do have the right to read the small print and say actually 'no, no. no, this isn't what we want to be signing up for'."" Campaign supporter Alastair Campbell, former Downing Street director of communications, said: ""The Brexit that was promised, and the Brexit that was campaigned successfully for, doesn't exist."" He added: ""I don't think you can re-run the referendum. I think we have to accept that we lost that debate. I think the question has to be on the nature of the deal.""

Macedonia votes to start name change,"Protests were held in both Greece and Macedonia earlier this year against a compromise on the name Macedonia's parliament has voted to start the constitutional procedure formally changing the country's name to the Republic of North Macedonia. Two-thirds of the chamber - 80 of 120 deputies - backed the start of the process, the requisite majority to start the move. Several more votes will follow before the switch is confirmed. In June, the country reached a deal with Greece on the name after 27 years of talks. Greece had vetoed Macedonia's bids to join Nato and the European Union, fearing claims on its northern region of the same name. The country said it would no longer block such moves if the name change went ahead. Greece must also back the name change should Macedonia formally change its constitution. By Guy Delaunay, BBC Balkans correspondent This vote may not guarantee that Macedonia will eventually become North Macedonia. But it does go a long way to reversing the damage caused by last month's referendum. More than 90% of those who voted then were in favour of the name change. But a successful boycott campaign kept the turnout well below the 50% threshold which would have made parliamentary votes a formality. Now eight members of the party behind the boycott - VMRO-DPMNE - have joined forces with the governing coalition to create the two-thirds majority necessary to start the process of constitutional changes. A process which had been on life support now seems remarkably healthy. It is not clear how the government brought the VMRO MPs on board. Numerous members are facing criminal charges from the party's increasingly corrupt decade in power. The road to becoming North Macedonia still looks bumpy. There will be more votes in the coming weeks before constitutional changes can be confirmed - and the Greek parliament still has to ratify the deal. Defence minister Panos Kammenos has vowed to withdraw his small right-wing party from the governing coalition in opposition. Greece ends 27-year Macedonia name row The M word: Why the row over Macedonia's name runs so deep Macedonia's Prime Minister Zoran Zaev had vowed to push ahead with the change aftera referendum last month was rendered invalid owing to low turnout. Contention over the name dates back to 1991, when Macedonia declared independence during the break-up of Yugoslavia. The present-day country and the region in north Greece were both part of a Roman province called Macedonia. Both claim the heritage of Alexander the Great. Alexander the Great ruled over Greece and created a vast empire in the ancient world Raw memories from Bulgaria's occupation of the Greek region and Yugoslav Macedonia in World War Two also play a role in the debate. Greece's objections forced the UN to refer to the new country as ""the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia"". A makeover that divided a nation The man who has focused on one word for 23 years Athens also vetoed Macedonia's attempt to join Nato in 2008 - and blocked its efforts at EU membership. If the constitutional change is eventually approved and the country adds the word ""north"", Macedonia could see those ambitions realised.

Australia government faces by-election woeThe ruling coalition's one-seat majority could evaporate if it loses the Wentworth by-election.,"Independent candidate Dr Kerryn Phelps pictured after her poll victory in Sydney Australia's governing coalition has lost its one-seat parliamentary majority after a by-election in Sydney. Kerryn Phelps, a local doctor and popular independent candidate, comfortably won the Wentworth seat. ""This win tonight should signal a return of decency, integrity and humanity to the Australian government,"" she told supporters. Australia has had six prime ministers in eight years, and now faces further uncertainty. Prime Minister Scott Morrison's ruling Liberal Party had been fighting to hold Wentworth, which was vacated by his predecessor, Malcolm Turnbull.

The people of Wentworth have sent a blunt message to Australia's political class that back-stabbing and party dysfunction won't be tolerated. The defeat of Dave Sharma, the governing Liberal candidate in the Sydney by-election, is an act of retribution by voters furious and frustrated at the ruthless ousting as prime minister of their beloved former MP, Malcolm Turnbull. Scott Morrison has failed his first electoral test as PM and more trouble is brewing. Liberal Party candidate Dave Sharma could not fight off independent Kerryn Phelps The lightning and thunder that jolted Bondi Beach and other parts of Wentworth as the polls closed are a sign of a wild political ride that lies ahead. The Morrison government has lost its narrow parliamentary majority, but it should survive, for now at least, with the support of independent MPs. However, with an election due next May its longer-term prospects appear increasingly grim. Controversy was stoked during the by-election race by the prime minister's proposal thatAustralia could follow the US and move its embassy to Jerusalem. Mr Sharma is the former Australian ambassador to Israel and first proposed such a move. Around 13% of Wentworth's voters are Jewish, compared to less than 0.5% of the Australian population as a whole.

Afghans go to polls amid heavy security,"This video can not be played Lyse Doucet: 'This is not the face of a people cowed by the Taliban' Voters in Afghanistan have defied deadly attacks to cast ballots in large numbers in the nation's long-awaited parliamentary elections. Several explosions targeted polling stations, with dozens of people killed or injured in scores of incidents across the country. Voters unable to cast ballots on Saturday turned out on Sunday as polling was extended in some areas. A new biometric verification system had caused technical problems. Violence also marred the election campaigning, with 10 candidates killed in the run-up to the polls. Both the Taliban and the Islamic State group had vowed to disrupt them. Kandahar vote delayed after Gen Raziq killed What's at stake in the parliament vote? More than 2,500 candidates, including many women, are vying for 250 seats in the legislative elections, which are being held more than three years late. Saturday saw dozens of incidents of violence, with at least 36 people killed and 130 injured across the country, but this was still a lower figure than some had feared. Among the incidents: At least 15 people were killed when a suicide bomber tried to enter a Kabul polling station Three people were killed and more than 50 injured in the northern city of Kunduz, while another two people died in explosions in Nangarhar AFP reports Insurgents killed four men heading to a polling station in northern Balkh province, local officials said Police officers were ambushed in central Ghor province. At least four were killed The defence ministry has deployed 70,000 members of the security forces to try to ensure the elections pass off peacefully. But nearly a third of all polling stations were closed because of security concerns. Security was not the only issue threatening the vote. Past elections have been marred by corruption and fraud, with cases of ballot box stuffing, multiple voting and voter intimidation all documented. Voting in Kandahar province had already been put off by a week after the assassination of a top police chief, Gen Abdul Raziq, on Thursday, in an attack claimed by Taliban militants. Polling in Ghazni province has also been delayed. The biometric devices have not led to quick voting On Saturday, technical and organisational problems stopped voters from casting their ballots at a number of polling stations. There have been technical hitches with Afghanistan's new biometric voter registration equipment and in the central province of Uruzgan, 15 men were reportedly arrested for trying to break biometric devices because of delays. The Independent Election Commission says most stations opened their doors late because teachers employed to supervise the voting process failed to turn up on time, according to AFP news agency. Turnout was still good, with three million out of 8.8 million registered voters casting ballots on Saturday. Some 253 polling centres opened on Sunday, although similar technical problems were being reported. The results process will not be quick. Preliminary results are not expected until 20 days after the election, on 10 November. BBC's chief international correspondent, Lyse Doucet, in Kabul It is an act of bravery to vote in Afghan elections. We went back to the same polling station we visited in 2014 and crowds were even larger this time. The queue of male voters kept getting longer. There was a crush of voters in the women's section. So many Afghans told us, ""We won't let the Taliban win."" But explosions are killing and injuring voters. Turnout will be low in the most insecure areas. Bad organisation is an enemy too.  Afghans are angrily complaining about polling stations opening hours late, election material not showing up. But many believe even holding this election is an achievement: to show that Afghan officials and security forces can do it, and to usher in a more legitimate parliament to replace a discredited assembly and try to move toward presidential elections next year and Taliban peace talks. But if it is seen as a ""bad election,"" it could be more consequential than not holding one at all. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Most Afghans are desperate for a better life, jobs, education and an end to the war with the Taliban. For the country's foreign partners, seeing a flourishing democracy would be the return they're seeking after many years of investment, billions of dollars spent and thousands of lives lost in more than a decade of fighting. This video can not be played Afghan ""war on terror"" generation votes Many candidates are young and well-educated. They are promising to help deliver change in the conflict-torn country. But many Afghans have come to view all politicians as corrupt and ineffective, correspondents say. The polls should have been held when the current assembly's five-year term ended in 2015. But the standoff after the disputed 2014 presidential election changed all that, bringing the country to the brink of civil war. This video can not be played Naheed Farid, Afghan MP: ""Some women want to wear make-up"" However, although parliament reviews and ratifies laws, real power lies with the presidency, and this election will be seen as a key test ahead of the all-important presidential elections due in April 2019.

Migrants storm Guatemala-Mexico borderA caravan of hundreds of Central American migrants faces Mexican riot police as they try to cross.,"This video can not be played Migrant caravan: 'May God soften Trump's heart' Thousands of people travelling across Central America en masse to the US are stuck on Mexico's southern border after a failed attempt to enter the country. Some of them broke through Guatemalan border fences but then clashed with Mexican riot police in no man's land. On Friday, US President Donald Trump thanked Mexico for its efforts in stopping the caravan of migrants. The migrants, mostly from Honduras, say they are fleeing violence and poverty, and include women and children. In Pictures: Migrants face border tear gas President Trump, who has threatened to close down the US border and cut aid to countries allowing the caravan to pass, said the military would be called upon if needed. ""They might as well turn back, they're not coming into this country,"" he told reporters on Friday. Some of the migrants took drastic measures to try to avoid the border checkpoint After talks on border security in Mexico, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the situation was reaching ""a moment of crisis"". Many of the migrants temporarily broke through barriers on a bridge which crosses the river border between Guatemala and Mexico. Dozens of Mexican police in riot gear fired tear gas to force them to retreat into no-man's land after being attacked with stones. They forced open a gate on the Guatemalan side and crossed the bridge to Mexico before being pushed back by police A number of migrants jumped into the Suchiate river to reach rafts, while others either turned back towards Guatemala or simply sat down on the bridge. Several people were reportedly injured in the clash, including migrants, police and journalists. Pompeo: Migrant flow 'a moment of crisis' Trump threatens Honduras aid over migrants One woman nursing a baby told AFP she had lost two of her children in the chaos. ""We're running away from violence, and we arrive here and they just hit us more,"" Marta Ornelas Cazares, 28, said. ""I don't know what happened, I thought we were going to cross peacefully and then suddenly there were rocks flying and tear gas."" Honduran migrants: 'We left because we had to' Who decided to separate illegal immigrant families? Good news for Honduras' murder capital? The Mexican authorities said those with valid passports and visas would be allowed in immediately, though this is believed to apply to only a minority of the migrants. They warned that anyone without papers would have to apply for refugee status or turn back, and anyone who crossed illegally would be detained and deported. A number of injuries were reported in the clashes on Friday According to AFP, they started to allow a small number of people - including women and children - who were seeking refugee status to pass the border late on Friday. They were put on to trucks and taken into shelters. Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernandez said he had spoken to his Guatemalan counterpart and asked permission to send his country's civil protection force to the area to help the migrants. ""I also asked for authorisation to hire ground transportation for anyone who wants to return and an air bridge for special cases of women, children, the elderly and the sick,"" Hernandez tweeted. Families in the migrant caravan celebrated the breach of a gate on the Guatemala-Mexico border The two leaders are due to meet later on Saturday to discuss the situation. Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto said the border clash was ""unprecedented"" and accused some of the migrants of attacking police. Human rights groups have criticised the US and Mexican response to the caravan. Erika Guevara-Rosas of Amnesty International said in a statement: ""These families deserve dignity and respect to ensure that no-one is illegally returned to situations where they could risk serious harm due to violence."" Since his campaign days, Mr Trump has lambasted illegal immigrants, and this latest caravan comes after a major immigration crackdown. Women, children and elderly are amongst the thousands of people trying to get to the US Changes to detention rules sawthousands of migrant children detainedand separated from their parents at the US-Mexico border earlier this year, sparking national and international condemnation. Mr Trump's threats come weeks before the mid-term elections on 6 November, which could see Democrats unseating Republicans in the House of Representatives. According to a Kaiser Foundation poll,external, immigration is the most important issue for 15% of all voters, though the number jumps to 25% among Republican voters.

BepiColombo blasts skyward to Mercury,"This video can not be played BepiColombo left Earth on an Ariane rocket that launched out of South America. Two satellites developed in Europe and Japan are on their way to Mercury, the planet closest to the Sun. The joint endeavour, known as BepiColombo,external, left Earth on an Ariane rocket that launched out of South America. It will take the probes seven years to reach their destination. But when they do finally arrive, it is hoped their parallel observations can finally resolve the many puzzles about the hot little world. One of the key ones concerns the object's oversized iron core, which represents 60% of Mercury's mass. Science cannot yet explain why the planet only has a thin veneer of rocks. Bepi's high-resolution data should bring us nearer to an answer. This video can not be played Messenger compiled this coloured map of Mercury during its first year in orbit ""Mercury doesn't really fit with our theories for how the Solar System formed, and we can't understand our planet fully unless we're able to explain Mercury as well,"" said Prof Dave Rothery, a Bepi scientist from the UK's Open University. The probes, which have been stacked together for their long journey into the inner Solar System, lifted clear of the Kourou spaceport at 22:45 local time, Friday (02:45 BST; 03:45 CEST; 10:45 JST Saturday). Mission controllers based in Darmstadt, Germany, will spend much of Saturday talking to the spacecraft, to confirm they are properly configured for the long cruise ahead. It's the first time the European and Japanese space agencies (Esa & Jaxa) have gone to Mercury. The Americans have already been there, briefly with the Mariner 10 probe in the 1970s, and withthe Messenger orbiter earlier this decade. The BepiColombo spacecraft will take seven years to get to Mercury The latter provided remarkable new insights that included the amazing discoveries thatwater-ice is held inside some of baking Mercury's shadowed craters, and thatits crust contains a lot of graphite (pencil lead). Bepi will build on Messengers' investigations. The new mission carries twice as much instrumentation and will get closer for longer, giving scientists much more detailed information. Europe's Mercury Planetary Orbiter (MPO) and Japan's Mercury Magnetospheric Orbiter (MMO) have different roles. The MMO will make as its priority the study of the planet's magnetic field. It will investigate the field's behaviour and its interaction with the ""solar wind"", the billowing mass of particles that stream away from the Sun. This wind interacts with Mercury's super-tenuous atmosphere, whipping atoms into a tail that reaches far into space. Europe's MPO will map the terrain, generate height profiles, sense the interior, and collect data on the surface structure and composition. The stack is unpacked at Mercury to enable complementary observations The origin of Mercury is the question most people want answered. Today's dense body very probably does not reflect the initial form. It's possible Mercury began life much further from the Sun and only later migrated inwards, perhaps colliding with something else on the way. This might explain the loss of those outer layers: they got stripped away in the impact. But Messenger observedlarge abundances of sulphur- and potassium-containing compounds at the surface, and these should have been burnt off in a giant impact. It's a fascinating world, says mission scientist Dr Suzie Imber from Leicester University. ""It's also got huge cliffs, many kilometres tall. And those cliffs formed as Mercury shrank. We call them wrinkle ridges."" This video can not be played BepiColombo: Mission to uncover mysteries of Mercury It is possible to go direct to Mercury in a matter of months, but the speed picked up by a spacecraft falling into the Sun's deep gravity well would make it very hard to stop at the planet. Bepi will take a more circuitous route. It will fly past Earth, Venus and Mercury itself, using the tug of their gravity to bleed off speed, so that by 2025 the mission can gently slot into position next to the diminutive world. The toughest prospect ahead is the heat. At just 58 million km from the Sun, working at Mercury is like being in a pizza oven. The sides of the probes in direct sunlight will have to cope with temperatures over 400C. Even those surfaces facing away from the Sun have to be protected from the radiant heat coming up from the ""hot potato"" planet below. Coping strategies include covering the MMO in thick blankets of insulation material made from titanium and ceramics. ""The environment is extremely hostile,"" explains Esa mission controller Elsa Montagnon. ""At Mercury, we get 10 times the solar energy we get at Earth. But then from the illuminated side of Mercury, we get about four times what we get on the Earth. So, the spacecraft are continually in a heat sandwich."" This video can not be played Elsa Montagnon will ""drive"" Bepi to Mercury The major UK instrument onboard the MPO is the Mercury Imaging X-Ray Spectrometer (MIXS). It will observe the abundance of chemical elements in the planet's outer layers. This information will be integral to solving the origin puzzle. Airbus in the UK built large parts of the MPO and the mission's propulsion unit, called the Mercury Transfer Module (MTM). The MTM hosts ""electric engines"" developed by QinetiQ. Two of these engines will be fired in the direction of travel, providing a gentle force to help control Bepi's fall into the inner Solar System. ""Each of our thrusters operates at 125 millinewtons, and one way to visualise that is that it's the same as the weight of a two-pound coin,"" said QinetiQ's Peter Randall. This video can not be played UK Space Agency CEO Graham Turnock details the British contribution It's expensive. Engineers have had a torrid time developing the technologies to keep Bepi safe so close to the Sun. Delays have added to the final ticket price. It's estimated the costs borne by the European Space Agency and the Japanese space agency amount to about â¬1.65bn. Additionally, national space agencies in Europe have paid for the instrumentation on the MMO, taking the overall budget above â¬3bn. This number covers the full lifecycle of the mission, from its approval (2007) to its termination (late 2020s). By way of comparison, the cost of Bepi would pay the salaries of the top seven football teams in the English Premier League for a couple of seasons.

Khan or Maguire: Who could be the face of the Â£50?Blind Brit climbs Europe's highest mountainWould you eat slaughter-free meat?,"The Â£50 note is getting a plastic redesign - and a new famous face. Steam engine pioneers James Watt and Matthew Boulton appear on the current Â£50, issued in 2011. The Bank of England will be seeking nominations from the public for figures to feature on the note. So who are the contenders? Princess Anne unveiled a statue of Noor Inayat Khan in London's Gordon Square Gardens on 2012 Who:Raised in Britain and France and a descendant of Indian royalty, Noor Inayat Khan was a secret agent for Britain during World War Two. Records show she was the first female wireless operator sent to Nazi-occupied France during the war, aged just 29. She evaded capture for three months but was eventually arrested and imprisoned by the Nazis. Despite suffering months of torture she refused to reveal any information and was transferred to Dachau concentration camp in Germany, where she was killed in 1944. The Indian royal who became a spy Why:A petition supporting Noor Inayat Khan has already attracted more than 1,300 signatures, with supporters including Conservative MP and former Army officer Tom Tugendhat and historian and BBC presenter Dan Snow. No UK banknote has ever featured a person from an ethnic minority and the petition calls for the ""remarkable"" woman's bravery to be recognised as an example of the ""positive contributions"" of Muslims to Britain. Odds:16/1 Who:Mary Seacole was a Jamaican-born nurse who cared for wounded British soldiers during the Crimean War. In 1854 she travelled to England and approached the War Office, asking to be sent as an Army nurse to the Crimea, but was refused. Undaunted, Seacole funded the trip herself and established the British Hotel near Balaclava to provide food, supplies and medicines to troops as well as nursing the wounded on the battlefield. Why:Many have argued that in the past Mary Seacole's work has been overshadowed by her contemporary Florence Nightingale, who was also a nurse during the Crimean War. However in 2004, Seacole was voted the greatest black Briton and her achievements against a backdrop of discrimination in the 19th Century are becoming more widely recognised.In 2016 a memorial statue was unveiledin London in her honour and Labour MP David Lammy praised the fact her ""pioneering work"" had ""finally been recognised"". Odds:10/1 Who:The British physicist died earlier this year aged 76 and is widely regarded as one of the most important scientists of his generation. At the age of 22 Hawking was given only a few years to live after being diagnosed with a rare form of motor neurone disease. But despite his illness he completed groundbreaking work on black holes and relativity throughout his career. Obituary: Stephen Hawking Why:Hawking's book A Brief History of Time was an unlikely best-seller and he became a popular ambassador for science. He was even depicted in an episode of The Simpsons. The physicist's achievements have been recognised with numerous medals and awards, and following his death in March, he is among the favourites to be given the posthumous honour. Odds:16/1 Who:Clement Attlee was leader of the Labour Party from 1935 to 1955. He served as deputy prime minister in Winston Churchill's coalition government and was then prime minister from 1945 to 1951. His government introduced the National Health Service, nationalised one-fifth of the British economy, including the coal and steel industry, and granted independence to India. Why:His administration is often credited with founding the modern welfare state, and in the NHS's 70th birthday year, a tribute to the man who oversaw its introduction may seem fitting. Odds:10/1 Who:Margaret Thatcher occupied 10 Downing Street as Conservative leader and prime minister from 1979 to 1990. She was both the UK's first female PM and the country's longest-serving leader of the 20th Century. Her policies gave thousands of people the chance to buy their council houses and snap up shares in newly-privatised industries like British Gas and BT. She died in 2013 after suffering a stroke. Obituary: Margaret Thatcher Why:Despite being a divisive figure, Margaret Thatcher is widely considered one of the most influential political figures of the 20th Century. A petition calling for her to be chosen as the new face of the Â£50 note has attracted more than 12,000 signatures. With just one of the UK's banknotes featuring a woman other than the Queen, the petition argues there would be no-one more appropriate to feature than the country's first female prime minister. Odds?16/1 Among the more original suggestions isa picture of England defender Harry Maguire riding an inflatable unicorn. The idea was proposed by sports journalist Jonny Sharples and a petition has already reached more than 25,000 signatures. Sadly for fans, it seems an unlikely option - the Bank of England has said that apart from the Queen, living Britons cannot feature on currency.

Blind Brit climbs Europe's highest mountainWould you eat slaughter-free meat?,"This video can not be played Watch Jack reach the summit of Mount Elbrus A 23-year-old is thought to have become the first blind British man to reach the summit of Europe's highest mountain. Jack Garner faced winds of more than 50mph, -37C wind chill and a longer stay than usual on Mount Elbrus due to extreme weather conditions. In 2007, at the age of 11, Jack, from Scunthorpe, lost his sight over the course of a few months due to a genetic condition. It was ""traumatic"", he says, but he was a sporty boy and challenges helped him cope, so he set his sights on Elbrus - all 5,642m of it. Jack, aged 6 in this photo, lost his sight when he was 11 Jack got involved seriously in mountaineering in 2015. He climbed Mount Kilimanjaro over a six-day trip. Then in 2016 he took part in an 11-day Everest base camp trek. Eventually, in 2018, he decided to take on Mount Elbrus. ""My parents were concerned when I told them what I was going to do,"" he said. Elbrus is known to be a particularly technical and challenging climb, but Jack has always been a thrill seeker - completing sky dives and bungee jumps to raise money for charity - so he was undaunted. He reached the summit with four other climbers and two guides from the company Adventure Peaks. In total, he spent eight exhausting days on the mountain. ""It was my first time walking on snow and ice. It took a bit of getting used to,"" he said. He learned the basics from guide Paul Etheridge - how to use crampons as well as an ice axe. Jack said he formed close friendships with his other team members He needed to follow Paul very closely up the mountain and they found a method which worked for them. Paul held the rope taut at all times so Jack knew there was always the same distance of two metres between them. ""Paul coiled the rope around his hand,"" Jack said. ""I had to be careful not to walk too close to him because I didn't want my crampons to dig into his heels."" Jack said when they got to a high altitude he found it difficult to communicate with Paul. Even though they were walking a lot slower, he felt his heart rate increase and, as a result, he was more breathless. How did he feel when he reached the summit? ""It's the best feeling there is."" 'I'm no victim' - Strictly star's girlfriend Under-25s 'turning their backs on booze' WATCH: The Russian village home to Novichok suspect Stu Peacock, from Adventure Peaks, told the BBC: ""We think he is the first blind British person to successfully reach the summit. ""It's a fantastic achievement, in challenging conditions, at this colder time of year. ""As one of the strongest members of the team, Jack is certainly capable of going on to bigger climbs if he chooses to."" Straddling the Russia-Georgia border and bulging above the Caucasus Ridge, Elbrus is a daunting prospect. It is nearly 1,000m higher than any of the peaks around it, and glaciers chew at its edges. There is a chairlift to 3,800m, where most climbs begin. However, Jack started his climb at 2,000m. A short distance above the chairlift is Camp 11; from here it is usually aneight-hour push to the summit. Jack completed the climb in less than six hours. Paul describes him as an ""understated young man who doesn't give himself enough credit"". Jack and Paul reach the summit of Europe's highest mountain Paul said he had contacted Guinness World Records who confirmed there was currently no record of a blind British climber ascending Elbrus, so Jack looks to be the first. He and his group were the first summiteers that day, beating Russian and Korean teams. ""Jack and I summited at 10:05,"" said Paul, ""before any other parties on the mountain. ""This was an amazing feat by any person, but Jack is fully blind. ""Since the age of 11 Jack endured and fought against all odds.""

Would you eat slaughter-free meat?,"This video can not be played These chicken nuggets were grown in a lab from cells taken from a living animal There's a looming crisis over the world's growing appetite for meat. Could a chicken running around a farmyard in San Francisco hold the key to a solution? In 1931, Winston Churchill predicted that the human race would one day ""escape the absurdity of growing a whole chicken in order to eat the breast or wing, by growing these parts separately under a suitable medium"". Eighty-seven years later, that day has come as we discovered at Just, a food company in San Francisco where we tasted chicken nuggets grown from the cells of a chicken feather. The chicken - which tasted like chicken - was still alive, reportedly roaming on a farm not far from the laboratory. This meat is not to be confused with the vegetarian plant-based burgers and other meat-substitute products which are gaining popularity in supermarkets. No, this is actual meat grown from animal cells and variously described as cultured, synthetic, in-vitro, lab-grown or even ""clean"" meat. t took about two days to grow our chicken nugget in a small bioreactor, using a protein to encourage the cells to multiply, some type of scaffold to give structure to the product and a culture, or growth, medium to feed the meat as it develops. Those two days in the bioreactor came after years of work identifying the best cell lines, cell isolation and cell bank development, using cells from feathers or harmless biopsies on live animals. Billions of animals are slaughtered annually for meat Our chicken nugget was still in the prototype phase. Other prototypes can take days or weeks to grow. Just and other companies will need to speed up the process to mass produce the cellular meat. The result is not yet commercially available anywhere on earth but Just's chief executive Josh Tetrick says it will be on the menu in a handful of restaurants by the end of this year. ""We make things like eggs or ice cream or butter out of plants and we make meat just out of meat. You just don't need to kill the animal,"" Tetrick says. We were given a rare taste and the results were impressive. The skin was crisp and the meat flavoursome although its internal texture was slightly softer than you would expect from a nugget at, say, McDonalds or KFC. Tetrick and other entrepreneurs working on cellular meat say they want to stop the slaughter of animals and protect the environment from the degradation of industrial factory farming. They say they are solving the problem of how to feed a crowded earth without destroying the planet, pointing out that their meat is not genetically-modified and does not require antibiotics to grow. If the world suddenly went vegetarian... What will we be eating in 20 years' time? The United Nations says raising animals for food is one of the major causes of global warming and air and water pollution. Even as the conventional livestock industry strives to become more efficient and environmentally friendly, many doubt it will be able to keep up with the rising global appetite for protein. We slaughter 70 billion animals each year to feed seven billion people, says Dr Uma Valeti, a cardiologist who founded California-based Memphis Meats, a leading cell-based meat company. He says the global demand for meat is doubling as more people rise out of poverty and that humanity won't be able to raise enough cattle and chicken to sate the appetite of nine billion people by 2050. ""So we could just literally grow any meat, poultry or seafood directly from those animal cells,"" Dr Valeti says. ""I think that is probably much bigger than sliced bread."" Many Americans say they are eating less meat but US Department of Agriculture (USDA) figures suggest the average consumer will still consume more than 222lbs (100kg) of red meat and poultry this year - about 20lb more than they ate in the 1970s. The demand for meat is growing worldwide The pioneer of cellular agriculture is Dutch scientist Mark Post. His first lab-grown hamburger, grilled in 2013, cost $300,000 (Â£228,000). No company has yet scaled-up production to serve a cell-based patty commercially but Post estimates that if he started mass producing his burgers, he could get the cost of making them down to about $10 each. ""That's of course still way too high,"" he said. If Just does manage to produce enough chicken nuggets to sell this year, it is unlikely to be in an American restaurant as the US government is still deciding how to proceed. Most food in the US is regulated by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA). But some - mostly conventionally raised meat - is regulated by the USDA. So if you're buying a frozen pizza in the US, the USDA handles the pepperoni version and the FDA handles the cheese. ""There are a number of countries in Asia and Europe that we're talking to,"" Tetrick says. ""There's a lack of clarity"" about regulations in the US while the USDA and FDA hold public hearings, he explains. ""I think countries want to take the lead in this. Whether it's food scarcity, whether it's sustainability issues or they just want to build an entirely new economy, they want to take the lead in doing this,"" Tetrick said. The eventual aim is to move cellular meat out of the laboratory and into large manufacturing plants. There are now dozens of companies working in the field and they're attracting venture capitalist investment from across Silicon Valley and beyond. Billionaires Bill Gates and Richard Branson are among those who have ploughed money into the technology. Lab-grown meat on your table The product also has a more surprising benefactor in Tyson Foods, which has invested an undisclosed amount in Memphis Meats. Tyson is the biggest meat processor in the US, processing around 424,000 pigs, 130,000 cows and 35 million chickens every week. So why is it investing in cellular meat? The firm decided ""to shift from being a meat company to a protein company,"" said Tom Mastrobuoni, chief financial officer for Tyson's venture capital arm, Tyson Ventures. ""We've made the conscious decision that we're going to be the biggest protein company,"" he added. The cutting edge technology of Silicon Valley may be synonymous with the freewheeling, entrepreneurial spirit of the United States but this is still a country where tradition runs deep. The Cattlemen's Association has a powerful lobby and there's arguably no symbol more revered or romanticised in the nation's history than the cowboy. And so the ranchers of the mid-west are stepping into the debate about how this new product will be marketed - as clean meat, cellular meat, slaughter-free meat, ethical protein, or just meat? On their ranch in the Ozarks, a mountainous region extending from Missouri into Arkansas, Kalena and Billy Bruce are feeding their herd of black Angus cattle, helped by their four-year-old daughter Willa. Kalena and Billy Bruce, with Willa ""I think it needs to be labelled accordingly - a lab-produced protein,"" says Billy Bruce. ""When I think of meat I think of what's standing behind us, a live breathing animal,"" he adds. The state of Missouri agrees. At the urging of farmers, the legislature has decreed that meat labels may only be applied to the product of livestock. It is a hint of the disruption which traditional agriculture feels could be on the way. ""From a transparency standpoint for consumers, so that they know what they're purchasing and what they're feeding their families, we think that it needs to be called something different,"" says Kalena Bruce. Lia Biondo, the director of policy and outreach with the US Cattlemen's association, based in Washington, DC, says she expects the Missouri law could be replicated in other states. ""We will let those companies decide what to call their products just as long as they don't call it beef or meat,"" says Biondo. 'Flexitarian' diets can limit future risks Fifth of meat tests reveal unspecified DNA But in any case, will anyone actually eat it, especially here in cattle country? Diners at Lamberts, a traditional Midwest restaurant in Ozark, Missouri, are going to take some convincing. ""Meat oughta be growed on a farm, out in the fields,"" declares Jerry Kimrey, a construction worker from Lebanon, Missouri. Teacher Ashley Pospisil, also from Lebanon, says she would prefer not to eat cell-based meat. ""I like to know where it came from and that it's natural and not processed from a lab,"" she says. Linda Hilburn, who is tucking into a (cow) steak before heading home to Guthrie, Oklahoma agrees. ""I kind of like it having four feet in the beginning,"" she says. ""There's just something about man's creation that scares me. We've created havoc here. I kind of like the idea of God's creation."" While Ms Hilburn is far from alone in feeling squeamish about the idea of ""Frankenstein food"" as critics have labelled it, Josh Tetrick insists that cell-based meat is entirely free from the many animal diseases which plague traditional meat production. And he is betting on human experience favouring progress. ""At the end of the day whether you're talking about a move from picking ice to refrigerator or from slaughtering a whale to refining oil into kerosene and moving from kerosene to a light bulb... even though people called the light bulb the Devil's current... humanity managed to embrace something new. ""It always happens and if I had to bet it'll happen for this too.""
