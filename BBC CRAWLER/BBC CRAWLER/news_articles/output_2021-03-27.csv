'Heart-breaking' wait for couple to travel for IVF,"Kevin and Nicci had a second round of IVF treatment in 2017 A couple who wanted to travel abroad for IVF since the first UK lockdown say they are in a ""heart-breaking"" wait for travel rules to change. Kevin and Nicci Button from Tonyrefail, Rhondda Cynon Taf, won a free round of IVF in California in 2020. They are calling for more support for those seeking fertility treatment abroad during Covid. The UK government said what constituted essential medical travel was ""judged on an individual clinical basis"". Foreign Office guidance currently advises British nationals against all but essential international travel. The couple said they had been trying for a child for more than four years, having gone through two unsuccessful rounds of IVF in the UK. 'Clock ticking' for woman's IVF treatment abroad Why a single man turned to IVF for fatherhood Mrs Button, 36, said Covid restrictions on international travel and the isolation period on return had become a ""massive boulder"" in their way of starting a family. ""The longer this goes on, the harder it is for the chances we have of it working and being successful,"" she said. ""At 36, 37, it is not long before I'll be classed as a geriatric mother. ""It is a race against time now."" The couple have been trying for a child for more than four years Mr Button said initially they felt ""chuffed to bits"" at winning the free treatment in a competition run by the California IVF Fertility Center during the first national lockdown. They have since had to cancel plans to travel to the United States in March, and now hope to go in May this year. The couple said their main problem was because IVF treatment was not classed as essential medical travel, the isolation rule period, on entering a foreign country and re-entering the UK, would apply to them. She said they would also have to travel to California twice in six-week window as part of the treatment - which could mean eight weeks spent in isolation. ""We wouldn't have enough annual leave or enough unpaid annual leave, and we can't afford to take that much time off work,"" Mrs Button said. The couple estimate their travel and accommodation in the US for treatment would cost between Â£4,000 and Â£6,000. However, they said the same IVF treatment in the UK could cost up to Â£10,000. Mrs Button said: ""We're not looking to go out there for a jolly, it is not about going over there for a good time, it is about going over there to start a family."" Mrs Button said couples in their situation should have more support from the UK government, such as being prioritised to have the vaccine sooner, or for isolation restrictions to be changed, or for financial support with those isolation rules. How AI could increase IVF treatment success rates 'No reason' for egg freezing 10-year storage limit Kevin and Nicci Button were married in 2019 The couple also want to raise more awareness around the impact of fertility issues, which led Mr Button to dedicate an Instagram platform tospeaking out about male infertility and mental health,external. Gwenda Burns, chief executive of Fertility Network UK, said the pandemic added ""to an already complex situation"" for patients choosing to go abroad for fertility treatment. ""In the UK, we have seen travel bans come into place at relatively short notice, which of course will add extra stress and costs for those trying to make their appointments,"" she said. ""If they are able to travel safely, patients will also need to quarantine, which can be especially distressing and lonely at a time when they need support more than ever."" The Human Fertilisation and Embryology Authority, which regulates fertility clinics in the UK, said treatment at some clinics may be affected by the pandemic due to local circumstances. ""Patients should keep in contact with their clinic who can update them on any changes to their services,"" it said.

Wales becomes first UK nation to lift travel ban,"People were enjoying the seaside at Barry Island on the first day of Wales' Easter school holidays. Wales has become the first UK nation to lift travel restrictions within its borders. The ""stay local"" rule has been scrapped,externalfrom Saturday in favour of unlimited travel within the country. But travel outside Wales will not be allowed until a Welsh government review on Thursday, which could see it permitted from 12 April. Tourism operators offering self-contained accommodation are expecting a busy weekend after a winter lockdown. Six people from two households are able to meet outside, an increase from the current four-person limit. 'Shock' and joy as Welsh beauty spot visits resume Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? England lockdown easing still on course, says PM Organised outdoor activities and sports for under-18s can resumeand libraries and archives can reopen their doors. Rules also allow a limited opening of outdoor areas of some historical places and gardens. Police forces across Wales urged people to ""play their part and follow the Welsh government regulations"". Scotland's stay-at-home rules become ""stay local"" on Good Friday and Northern Ireland's stay-at-home message is to be relaxed on 12 April. England's stay-at-home rule will end on Monday, although the UK government is urging people to stay local as much as possible, but one walker from England travelled to north Wales on Saturday and said he knew he was breaking the rules. George made the more than 200 mile (320km) trip to Snowdonia from Somerset on Saturday to walk up Wales' highest mountain Snowdon. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. George travelled from Somerset to walk up Snowdon on the popular Pen-y-Pass track When asked if he knew that the rulesban people from travelling to Wales from England unless for essential reasons,George, from Weston-super-Mare replied: ""I know."" He added: ""It's outdoors, so I would not meet that many people so I thought it's not bad."" With warmer weather forecast and the Easter school holidays starting in Wales, one ice cream seller was enjoying her first day back in business in the south Wales seaside resort of Porthcawl ""It's been very busy, but people have been good with the social distancing and some people have been wearing a mask,"" said Pamela Davies, who owns Holly's Lollies on Newton Bay Beach. Pamela Davies said her Holly's Lollies ice cream had been busy in Porthcawl ""I like to see people enjoying themselves. Porthcawl is a very busy place, but I think people have taken notice of this virus and they are keeping to the rules."" While beaches were busier than they had been, so were some of Wales' famous hillsides - and Sean Orton was glad to get out hiking again after being in strict lockdown for more than three months. ""I've spent the last 12 months in, stuck to the rules, just going to work,"" said Mr Orton, who travelled from Wrexham to Snowdonia for a walk. Cars queue outside Trecco Bay Holiday Park in Porthcawl on Saturday ""So it's finally nice to be able to get out, go up there and be at one with nature."" Ministers eased Wales' restrictions further on Saturday as the Covid case rate is below 40 per 100,000 people and the test positivity rate is lower than 4% - both below World Health Organisation lockdown guidance thresholds. Another consideration behind lifting restrictions was the number of coronavirus patients in Welsh hospitals was at its lowest since October whilea third of the population have been vaccinated. Wales' outdoor spaces had been ready for visitors as Brecon Beacons National Park Authority said it was prepared for ""significant numbers of people"" so there were extra staff at hotspots. But Mr Orton, who arrived in Snowdonia at 05:30 GMT on Saturday, said Snowdon was the ""quietest I've seen it in years, it's quite odd"". Families said it felt ""like Christmas Day"" as they prepared to visit loved ones or to enjoy a much-needed trip away from home. Ed Pugh, 55, and his wife Tracey, 56, have not seen their daughter Alys, 23, since December - and said meeting her again is ""like Christmas Day"". Ed and Tracey Pugh (pictured before the Covid pandemic), are looking forward to seeing daughter Alys, 23, for the first time in three months The couple are making the two-hour journey from their home in Abergavenny in Monmouthshire to meet Alys for a walk on the beach near her home in Aberystwyth. ""We're a close family... but in the last year we've hardly seen her at all, which has been really tough,"" said Mr Pugh. ""We can FaceTime each other, but it's not quite the same as sharing that space, enjoying her company, sitting down and having a meal together. ""We've all been responsible citizens. We've all played our part. We knew this day would come and it's been building up to it and thank God, here we are now."" For all the joyful reunions and increased freedom, there was a message of caution for those travelling. Walkers described Snowdon, a popular spot tourist spot, as quiet on the first day of lockdown easing Public health experts warned the easing of travel restrictions could lead to a ""resurgence"" of the community transmission, despitemore than a third of Wales' population getting at least their first Covid jab. ""You'd expect people to go out and meet people, but everyone shares a responsibility of being cautious,"" said epidemiologist Dr Philip Anyanwu of Cardiff University. He said the factvaccine supplies could be delayed by ""up to four weeks""gave him cause for ""concern"". ""Ideally vaccination should be increased or at least maintained around lockdown easing,"" he added. ""But reports of a shortage of vaccine supply coinciding with restrictions being lifted makes me worried if this is the right time to ease lockdown."" Wales' road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales UK reports 6,187 cases on Friday Wales' first minister said the relaxations were ""part of our careful and phased approach to unlocking the restrictions and enabling people and businesses to resume their activities in the safest possible way"". ""We're only able to do this because of the sacrifices everyone across Wales has made over the last few months - everything you are doing to keep your loved ones safe is also keeping Wales safe,"" added Mark Drakeford. ""The public health position remains stable - our incredible vaccination programme goes from strength to strength - we have headroom to make these changes."" Non-essential travel to and from other UK nationswill be banned for at least two weeksunder the remaining restrictions. People were pictured spread out on the beach at Barry Island on the first day of Wales' lockdown easing Transport for Wales urged people to follow guidelines, adhere to social distancing and plan their journeys in advance. It also issued a reminder that there are still restrictions in place cross-border between Wales and England. Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were working to ""educate those living along the border on the regulations relevant to them"", but would not be actively patrolling the border with England. A Gwent Police spokesman said: ""We're continuing to engage with our communities and explain the importance of keeping Wales safe and we ask that people play their part and follow the Welsh government regulations. ""We all have a part to play, we have been and will continue to take enforcement action against those who are blatantly flouting the rules."" Are you in Wales?

Green Homes Grant scheme to insulate houses axed,"A much-promoted grants scheme to help householders in England insulate their home is to be scrapped within days. The Green Homes Grant (GHG) reached just 10% of the 600,000 homes the chancellor promised would be improved. The scheme will be stopped on Wednesday and the cash allocated to a separate insulation fund run by councils. The Â£300m previously allocated for the GHG will now go into a programme administered by local authorities, targeted at lower income households. Don't raid home insulation scheme, MPs urge ministers Government home insulation programme criticised Green plan to upgrade homes was 'botched', say MPs Some 19 million homes in the UK need to be insulated or the emissions from gas boilers will wreck the UK's chances of achieving its climate change targets. But the GHG scheme, which launched in September in a bid to tackle that, has struggled from the start. The government said many households were reluctant to apply for the grants - up to Â£10,000 - because they feared catching Covid from contractors coming into their homes. However, in some parts of the country installers were actually overwhelmed with demand, and families could not even get firms to answer the phone. Then checks on the way the money was spent were so stringent that some installers went out of business because payments were so badly delayed. And despite the checks, some builders appear to have hugely overcharged for their work. One joiner told me he had witnessed an installer carry out work worth Â£3,000 at most, then deliver an invoice for Â£5,000. It seems clear there is frustration in Whitehall at the American consultants brought in to manage the scheme for able-to-pay families. The parallel insulation scheme administered by local authorities is running much more smoothly but ministers still need to create a new programme to nudge able-to-pay home owners into improving their insulation for the UK to hit its climate change targets. There is no sign yet what that new programme might look like, or when it might happen. A government source pointed out that the Conservatives promised in their manifesto to spend Â£9bn on insulation - and insisted that this cash would definitely be made available. Campaigners, industry figures, and MPs saidthe current scheme was botchedand called for the Chancellor Rishi Sunak to create an insulation programme stretching for decades, so that installers and suppliers have the chance to build up stocks and expertise. Previously many firms have been driven out of the sector following stop-start government funding. On announcing the move, Energy Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng chose to focus on the transfer of cash to the local authority fund, rather than the scrapping of the GHG. He said: ""Upgrading the country's homes with energy efficiency measures means we can cut emissions and save people money on their energy bills. ""Today's funding boost will mean even more households across England are able to access these vital grants through their local authority. ""This latest announcement takes our total energy efficiency spending to over Â£1.3bn in the next financial year, giving installers the certainty they need to plan ahead, create new jobs and train the next generation of builders, plumbers and tradespeople."" First announced last summer, the GHG scheme wasextended in November,externalfor another year until the end of March 2022. Greenpeace UK described the rollout of the GHG scheme as ""shambolic"". The organisation's Kate Blagojevic said the ""biggest hole"" in England's energy efficiency was private households and you can't ""boost the situation with a smaller pot of money"". She added: ""The government is plain wrong to try and frame it as such."" Ed Matthew, from climate change think tank E3G said: ""The end of the government's flagship green homes scheme is a tragedy that was avoidable. ""There was plenty of demand for the grants but the scheme was plagued by incompetent administration. The reality is that we can't get to net-zero without decarbonising our homes."" He called for a new grant scheme to replace it - but said it was key to get the grants out quickly. The demise of the GHG follows theprevious failure of the government's Green Dealwhich flopped because householders could get cheaper finance through their bank. Matthew Pennycook, the shadow minister for climate change, said: ""The funding announced today doesn't even come close to plugging the investment gap created by the government's decision to slash more than Â£1bn from its Green Homes Grant scheme and then scrap it altogether. ""Ministers might talk a good game on energy efficiency but their staggering ineptitude when it comes to decarbonising the country's housing stock speaks for itself"".

Worker injured in 'serious incident' at firing range,"A civilian contractor was injured on a live firing range in Pendine on Thursday Investigations are under way after a worker was injured in a ""serious incident"" on a live firing range in Carmarthenshire. A civilian contractor was injured at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) facility in Pendine on Thursday at about 11:00 GMT. Dyfed-Powys Police and the Health and Safety Executive are carrying out inquiries. It is understood the casualty was airlifted to hospital. The defence and technology company QinetiQ, which operates the site on a 25-year contract with the MoD, said it was also carrying out an internal inquiry. A spokesperson for QinetiQ said the ""serious incident"" resulted in ""injury to a member of QinetiQ personnel"". ""We are cooperating fully with the emergency services and a full investigation is under way. ""It is too early to comment further at this stage, but additional information will be made available in due course once all investigations have been completed."" The MoD Pendine range on the Carmarthenshire coast covers 20.5 sq km (5065 acres) and is used for testing, evaluation, and training with firearms and other weapons. Warnings published by QinetiQ on its website show the facility was carrying out activities with ""local gunfire and explosions"" on Thursday. Members of the armed forces use the site, alongside engineers and scientists employed by QinetiQ. A danger area extends out to sea and for aircraft up to 23,000ft. It is also the home of Nato's European test centre for small arms ammunition.

Fresh effort to refloat ship stuck in Suez Canal,"The Ever Given, operated by Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine, does not appear to have been damaged A fresh effort is under way to refloat a giant container ship blocking Egypt's Suez Canal. Canal authorities say 14 tugboats are trying to take advantage of Saturday's high tide and more will arrive on Sunday if the latest attempt fails. The Ever Given became wedged in the canal - one of the world's busiest trade channels - on Tuesday. More than 300 ships are stuck on either side of the blockage. Some have had to reroute around Africa. By late Friday, dredgers had moved about 20,000 tonnes of sand from around the Ever Given's bow, which was stuck deep into the canal's bank. The chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Osama Rabie, told a news conference on Saturday that 9,000 tonnes of ballast water - which is stored in tanks to stabilise the ship - had been removed to help lighten the vessel. He said the stern had begun to move on Friday night, and that the rudder and propeller had started working again. Strong tides and winds had made freeing the ship more difficult, he added. Mr Rabie could not say how soon the ship might be refloated but said the SCA would ""work around the clock"" to get other ships through once the Ever Given was free. 'Our customers are worried about the Suez blockage' How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal Initial reports said the 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel ran aground in high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. However, Mr Rabie said weather conditions were ""not the main reasons"" for the ship's grounding. ""There may have been technical or human errors,"" he told reporters, without giving details. ""All of these factors will become apparent in the investigation."" Dredgers and tugs are trying to free the ship The Ever Given is operated by the Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine and owned by Shoei Kisen of Japan. Yukito Higaki, president of Shoei Kisen, said on Friday that the ship did not appear to be damaged. ""The ship is not taking water. Once it refloats, it should be able to operate,"" he said. If digging the sand away and pulling the ship with tugs fails to move it, Mr Rabie said rescue teams might have to remove some containers to lighten the load. He said he hoped that would not be needed. John Denholm, president of the UK Chamber of Shipping, earlier told the BBC that transferring the cargo to another vessel or the canal bank would involve bringing in specialist equipment, including a crane that would need to stretch more than 60m (200ft) high. ""If we go through the lightering process, I suspect we're talking weeks,"" he said. This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. According to data from Lloyd's List, the blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day - or $400m an hour. Mr Rabie estimated that Egypt was losing up to $14m in revenue each day that the canal was closed. He said Egypt was grateful to the US, China and the United Arab Emirates for offers of help.

"Different ceremony, same pride for Wales","This video can not be played Wales coach Wayne Pivac says it's been a special Six Nations for Wales There were no wild celebrations, no opportunity for Wales' players to share the moment with their supporters. But that did not diminish Wales captain Alun Wyn Jones' pride at lifting the 2021 Six Nations trophy. Jones and the majority of his team-mates gathered at their training base a day after Scotland's win over France in Paris ensured Wales won the title. ""Hopefully there will be a chance for fans to have their time with the trophy further down the line,"" said Jones. It was very different from the scenes prompted by the four other Six Nations titles Jones has won since 2008. The intimate celebration pictures were indicative of Covid-19 times as Wales clinched their sixth Six Nations trophy since the tournament expanded in 2000, thanks to Scotland's 27-23 victory against France in Paris on Friday ""It's funny because in a way it's very special because this is where we spend a lot of our time,"" said Jones. ""This is where I've been coming since I was part of the programme in under-16s to full senior. How Wales won the 2021 Six Nations Pivac delighted with Six Nations success ""To have the opportunity to do it here is special, but not to be able to share it with the fans is disappointing."" Jones said that due to domestic duties, he had not seen much of Scotland's win over France, which secured the title for Wales. ""It was a normal night, putting the kids to bed and then there was the small matter of a rugby match I caught the last 20 minutes of,"" said Jones. ""The last 12 months has been very different not only in the sporting world but everywhere. ""It's been a long week in not preparing for a game which has a bearing on where you finish."" Wales received a lot of criticism after only three wins in 2020, but their form has transformed spectacularly in the 2021 showpiece tournament. ""I'm proud of the attitude on the field, but also the discipline off it,"" said Jones. ""We've had our blips like most environments have, but to come through it like we have makes me proud not just in a rugby sense but an off-field sense. ""Considering the state of things and what was said going into the campaign, I'm proud to be associated with this group of players, staff and management."" Pivac had received the most intense scrutiny after his opening season in charge had resulted in wins over Italy and Georgia only. ""It's not about me. It's about the team,"" said Pivac. ""Genuinely, this group is a team and we put them first in every aspect. ""The board have been very supportive. We laid out a plan to the Rugby World Cup at the start of this tenure and we've stuck to that, and I've been regularly updating my board. ""It's just knowing you have the support and that's been evident. ""I know the rugby public hurt when we don't win a test match, just like how we hurt. That's expected - it goes with the territory. But moments like this make up for the bad times."" Wales coach Wayne Pivac with his first Six Nations title and captain Alun Wyn Jones with his fifth Pivac has had to make some difficult choices, with defence coach Byron Hayward departing and Gethin Jenkins taking on the role. He also made some inspired decisions with George North moving to centre from wing, which in turn allowed Louis Rees-Zammit to flourish. ""There are some tough decisions that have to be made at times, and we haven't shied away from those,"" added Pivac. ""We stuck with our plan and made sure we were true to ourselves."" Pivac admitted it had been a strange week. Wales had to overcome the disappointment of missing out on a Grand Slam with a last-gasp defeat to France before waiting seven days to be presented with the Six Nations silverware. ""We watched ourselves win a championship from our individual lounges,"" said Pivac. ""We didn't know if it was good enough to win the championship, waiting six days for that match between France and Scotland and then going through that match with so many moments that kept us on our toes. ""It has been an emotional rollercoaster because we put in by far our best performance against the French and thought we had done enough to have won that game, but it wasn't to be. ""To lose it in the last play of the game was devastating, the boys wanted that Grand Slam, so we had the lows of not achieving that. ""It probably took me until Wednesday or Thursday to want to come out of the house, purely from the sickening feeling for the players who had worked so hard. ""We desperately wanted that Grand Slam for so many reasons. The hard the work that went in, the style of rugby and winning it for the people of Wales.

More than 90 killed in Myanmar 'day of terror',"This video can not be played Violent scenes were seen on the streets of Myanmar during its deadliest day Dozens of people have been killed by security forces in Myanmar, on the deadliest day since last month's military takeover of the country. More than 90 deaths, including children, were confirmed by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group. ""They are killing us like birds or chickens, even in our homes,"" resident Thu Ya Zaw told Reuters news agency in the central town of Myingyan. ""We will keep protesting regardless."" The lethal crackdown came as protesters defied warnings and took to the streets on the annual Armed Forces Day. US, UK and EU officials condemned the violence, with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab calling it a ""new low"". 1988 v 2021: A tale of two Myanmar protests Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Street tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die' The AAPP said the death toll was continuing to rise. The latest violence took the number killed in the suppression of protests in Myanmar since the 1 February coup to more than 400. The military seized control of the South East Asian country after an election which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. Barricades have been erected in Yangon Protesters gathered across Myanmar, also known as Burma, on Saturday. State TV aired an announcement the previous evening saying people ""should learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot to the head and back"". Security forces were out in strength trying to prevent rallies. Images shared on social media showed people with gunshot wounds and families mourning. The director of the UK-based Burma Human Rights Network told the BBC the military had shown it had ""no limits, no principles"". ""It's a massacre, it's not a crackdown anymore,"" Kyaw Win said. Violent crackdowns using live ammunition were reported in more than 40 locations across the country. Local news site Myanmar Now put the death toll at 114, while the United Nations said it was receiving reports of ""scores killed"" and hundreds more injured. The AAPP said among the fatalities was a 13-year-old girl who was shot dead inside her home. In the main city Yangon, gunshots were fired at the US cultural centre on Saturday. The US embassy said those shots caused no injuries. Protesters in Yangon defied warnings from the military Witnesses and sources told BBC Burmese of protester deaths in the cities and townships of Magway, Mogok, Kyaukpadaung and Mayangone. Deaths were also reported in Yangon and on the streets of the second-largest city Mandalay, where protesters carried the flag of the NLD and gave their now traditional anti-authoritarian three-finger salute. Protesters gave their anti-authoritarian three-finger salute Meanwhile, an ethnic armed group in eastern Myanmar said military jets had targeted territory it controls. The strike was launched hours after the group, calledKaren National Union, said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border. It came amid rising tensions between the group and the military after years of relative peace. Moe Myint, BBC Burmese A one-year old girl was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet as she played on the pavement near her home in a suburb of Yangon. A five-year-old boy in Mandalay is fighting for his life after being shot in the head by security forces. Across the country, children are amongst the injured and the dead in the bloodiest day since the coup on the 1 February. Fourteen-year-old Pan Ei Phyu's mother says she rushed to close all the doors when she heard the military coming down her street. But she wasn't fast enough. A moment later, she was holding her daughter's blood soaked body. ""I saw her collapse and initially thought she just slipped and fell. But then blood spurted out from her chest,"" she told BBC Burmese from Meiktila in central Myanmar. It was the randomness of today's killings that was particularly shocking. Armed with battlefield weapons, the security forces appeared willing to shoot anyone they saw on the streets. The brutality they showed they were capable of today is on another level from what we have seen since the coup. Neither side - the military or the pro-democracy movement - is willing to back down. The military think they can terrorise people to achieve ""stability and security"". But the movement on the streets, led by young people, is determined to rid the country of the military dictatorship once and for all. It's painful to have to count the mounting dead, especially the children. The killings in Myanmar drew international condemnation. The US embassy said security forces were ""murdering unarmed civilians"", while the EU delegation to Myanmar said the 76th Armed Forces Day would ""stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"". Deaths were reported on the streets of Myanmar's second-largest city Mandalay Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Asia, described the scenes as ""shocking, horrible, barbaric and unacceptable"". The military has not commented on the killings. In an Armed Forces Day TV address, coup leader Min Aung Hlaing said the army wanted to ""join hands with the entire nation to safeguard democracy"". ""Violent acts that affect stability and security in order to make demands are inappropriate,"" he said. He added that the army had to seize power because of ""unlawful acts"" by democratically-elected leader Ms Suu Kyi and her party. The military held a parade to mark Armed Forces Day The military has previously tried to claim that shootings have come from among the protesters. Armed Forces Day commemorates the start of Myanmar's military resistance against Japanese occupation in 1945. A military parade in the capital Naypyitaw was attended by Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin. Other countries, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, sent representatives but not ministers, according to Reuters. Min Aung Hlaing said Russia was a ""true friend"". The US, UK and EU have all imposed sanctions in response to the military coup. Myanmar and Russia's defence ties have grown in recent years. In that time Moscow has provided training to thousands of soldiers, and has sold arms to the military. Myanmar, also known as Burma, became independent from Britain in 1948. For much of its modern history, it has been under military rule Restrictions began loosening from 2010 onwards, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government headed by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, Myanmar's army responded to attacks on police by Rohingya militants with a deadly crackdown, driving more than half a million Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh in what the UN later called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" Country profile The general who returned Myanmar to military rule Who are the rulers who executed Myanmar activists?

Families reunited in Wales as 'stay local' ends,"Wales becomes the first UK nation to lift its rule to stay local, although non-essential travel to other parts of the UK is still banned Six people from two households can now meet outdoors and self-contained tourist accommodation may reopen Prime Minister Boris Johnson says he sees 'absolutely nothing in the data' to dissuade him from continuing to lift lockdown restrictions Meanwhile, the first Covid booster jabs to stop new variants could be given to over-70s from September, the vaccines minister says Nadhim Zahawi said those in the top four priority groups of the vaccine rollout will get any booster jabs first One-fifth of the Philippines' population is going into lockdown as hospitals in Manila struggle to cope with a surge in infections In England, shops will be allowed to stay open until 22:00 BST six days a week when customers return from 12 April Police in Bristol have made 10 arrests during a demonstration that they warned broke coronavirus restrictions Both Boris Johnson and Home Secretary Priti Patel have condemned the demonstrators France has accused the UK of 'blackmail' over its handling of coronavirus vaccine exports Edited by Julian Joyce Thanks for joining us today. We'll be back tomorrow with lots more coronavirus news - from the UK and around the world. Your writers today were Francesca Gillett, Victoria Lindrea, Georgina Rannard, Jo Couzens and Joshua Nevett. The live page was edited by Julian Joyce. That's about it from us today. Here is a brief round-up of the main headlines.  The latest government data,externalhas revealed there were 4,715 positive cases recorded in the UK the past 24 hours - the first time the daily figure has dipped below 5,000 in more than a week. A further 58 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test - compared with 96 on the same day a week ago. The number of patients in hospital is continuing to fall, down to 4,560 on the last count taken on Thursday. This is the lowest since mid-October. Latest figures state 615 of those hospital patients are on ventilators. More than 29.7m people have now been given the first vaccination dose - with nearly 3.3m people having been given both doses.    Despite knowing about the rules in England, which arestay at home until Monday, and then stay local, George travelled from Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, to Snowdon. He made the 260 miles (418 km) journey, which would take around four and a half hours, to start at Pen-y-Pass. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. When asked if he knew the rules, George added: ""I know. It's outdoors, so I won't meet that many people. So, I follow this. It's not bad."" Israel has been quick to vaccinate its population against Covid-19 This time last year, Israel was placed into the first of three tough lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus. Now, with the threat of Covid-19 receding, Israel is gradually returning to something approaching normality. In that spirit, Israelis have been gathering for Passover - the Jewish holiday celebrating liberation from biblical slavery. This is only possible because coronavirus infections have plummeted in the country since February, as vaccinations were rolled out. Coronavirus restrictions have been lifted in recent weeks Israel has vaccinated about half its population of nine million. It began its vaccination campaign last December and is the leading nation globally for the number of doses per head of population. As a result, authorities have allowed restaurants, hotels, museums and theatres to reopen, while relaxing restrictions on large gatherings, outdoors and indoors. âSo very happy that the whole family is gathering together, to celebrate with everyone together,â Sasha Shunary told Reuters news agency in a Tel Aviv market. âLast year we had it on Zoom.â Passover will feel more normal this year for many Jewish people in Israel Officers were called to the address on Saturday morning A police officer who was attempting to break up a house party that broke Covid laws was attacked, the force has said. Officers from West Midlands Police were called to the party in Solihull in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""Up to 100 people"" were reported to be at the gathering - currently banned under Covid regulations. According to West Midlands Police, the police officer was kicked but was not seriously injured during the incident. Read the full story here. By Joshua Haigh, BBC News More than a year after the pandemic shut schools around the world, millions of children are still stuck at home. But the experience has been vastly different for communities. A Washington mum-of-two says she had not appreciated ""how much support, not only academic but also physical and emotional, school provided my kids"". ""The unpredictability of each day has definitely ramped up my own anxiety in unhealthy ways,"" says Lori Mihalich. Meanwhile, in the Amazon rainforest in Peru, thousands of children were cut-off from the outside world without the means to continue their education when Covid-19 struck. Authorities have since strapped loudspeakers to trees to broadcast lessons into the open air. Here's how students, teachers and parents coped when children had to leave the classroom. Vaccinationshave been suspended at a Dublin hospital after it emerged it had used spare doses to vaccinate teachers at a nearby private school. Beacon Hospital administered 20 vaccines to teachers at St Gerard's School in Bray, County Wicklow. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said this was ""entirely inappropriate and completely unacceptable"". Having considered the ""operational implications"", Mr Donnelly said he has asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to suspend vaccines at the privately-owned hospital. Those who already have an appointment at the centre will be vaccinated as scheduled - before alternative arrangements are put in place. Beacon Hospital, which was administering vaccines as part of the state rollout, apologised for its decision, claiming it was made under ""time pressure"".

This video can not be played It is normal for some people to experience short-term side effects from Covid-19 vaccines Coronavirus vaccines help protect people from getting seriously ill if they come into contact with the disease. But how do they work? And will a vaccine make you feel unwell? The BBC's CrowdScience presenterMarnie Chesterton explains why a Covid vaccine can't give you the virus, and why it's normal to experience some mild side effects, such as a headache or a raised temperature. From next Tuesday, people crossing the land border from France into Spain will have to present a negative PCR test taken in the last 72 hours, the Spanish government has announced. Spain is ramping up restrictions ahead of their traditional Easter celebrations known as Holy Week, which begin this weekend. Previously only those arriving from France by air had been subject to testing.Hauliers and cross-border workers will be exempt, along with those who live in the border zone - providing they remain within a 30-kilometre (18-mile) radius of their home. Daily cases have nearly doubled in France since the start of the month, with more than 45,000 new cases announced on Thursday. From Sunday anyone travelling from France into Germany will have to submit a negative test and go into 10 days' quarantine.  After we publishedan article about one woman's lockdown project listening to 300 vinyl records,lots of people got in touch about their own new hobbies. A surprising number were not listening to albums, butrecordingthem. Others were writing and drawing, or reading a daily short story before breakfast. A number found new or extreme ways of getting exercise. We've pulled together a selection of your stories. ""My lockdown project this time was to walk every street in St Albans,"" says Jim Hodgkins from - you guessed it - St Albans. ""The first Monday the clocks went back in October I realised I couldn't handle walking the dog round the corner in the dark every night. I needed a clever way to like the dark and cold, and make up for missing an hour's walking every day on my commute. ""I photo'd an A-to-Z and started doing walks, going up to the end of every cul-de-sac. ""Altogether, it was 150 miles on 45 walks ending at the most famous arch in St Albans, the old monastery."" Read more about people's lockdown projects here. Jim Hodgkins was one of those who shared their lockdown project with us This video can not be played For people in England who are excited for the next stage of lockdown easing, there's been some good news from the PM this morning. In a video recorded by the Conservatives, Boris Johnson says there is ""absolutely nothing"" in the data to suggest we can't continue with the lockdown easing plan. ""In just a few days time I'm finally going to be able to go to the barbers,"" he said. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Several European countries paused their use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this month after reports that a small number of people recently given the shot had also developed blood clots. Buta ""thorough and careful review"" by UK and EU regulatorssubsequently found there was no evidence the Oxford vaccine caused blood clots. About 17 million people have been vaccinated in the EU and the UK - and 37 people who had the Oxford vaccine have been reported as having had a blood clot. However, the number of blood clots reported is no more than would have been expected to have occurred naturally. The MHRA,externalandthe EMA,externalsay people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised. So how do we know a vaccine is safe, and what role do trials have?Read Michelle's full analysis here. Brazil is struggling to cope with a huge surge in Covid infections. On Friday, a record 3,650 deaths from the virus were reported by Brazil's health ministry. It's the highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period since the pandemic began - and broke a record set just days earlier. In total, more than 305,000 people in Brazil have now died with coronavirus. A new, more contagious variant is thought to be behind the recent surge in cases, with many city hospitals experiencing oxygen shortages and overcrowding. Critics say the government is still failing to introduce sufficient restrictions to control the virus, but President Jair Bolsonaro says he is addressing the crisis. On Friday the government announced that human trials will begin for two vaccines developed in Brazil.  This video can not be played Covid: Grassroots sports set ready for lockdown release Outdoor grassroots sports will once again be allowed in England from Monday 29 March. Golf, tennis, basketball and outdoor swimming will all be back on the agenda. Organised outdoor sports, such as football, can also resume - subject to government guidelines. For Bella, a keen footballer, is means being reunited with her teammates - and no longer having to be satisfied with tackling her dad and little brother. ""I've really missed it,"" says Bella. ""It gives you that freedom. It's like an escape from reality - just being able to run round and not caring what it going on."" It follows a similar restart of outdoor sports in Wales and Scotland earlier this month, while Northern Ireland follows suit on Thursday 1 April.  Police blocked roads in Amritsar, Punjab to enforce a one-hour silence How do we mark the millions of lives lost to coronavirus? It's a question many individuals and governments ask themselves, particularly as we recently marked one year since the pandemic began. In India's Punjab state, authorities have introduced a one-hour silence each Saturday to honour victims of Covid-19. All traffic is expected to stop except for emergencies or on major highways, and sirens sound at the start and end of the hour. The first silence was today, but reports suggested many residents were unaware of the tribute and were left confused as queues built up to enter cities.Critics have said that the government should focus on addressing the health crisis,external, but authorities say the silence will help people remember the importance of saving lives. Nationwide India has recorded nearly 12 million infections and more than 161,000 deaths. Germany is among those European countries facing 'a third wave' of coronavirus More from Boris Johnson who was speaking at the Conservatives' virtual spring forum. The prime minister said ""bitter experience"" has taught him that the surge in cases - or ""third wave"" - currently being experienced in parts of Europe could hit the UK ""three weeks later"". ""The question is - is it going to be, this time, as bad it has been in the past? ""Or have we sufficiently mitigated, muffled, blunted the impact by the vaccine rollout?"" he added. ""There's lots of promising evidence that a lot of people who could be vulnerable are now protected against death and serious disease, that's my hope - my hunch. ""But we haven't yet seen the real conclusive proof - in the sense that we haven't seen a take-off in infection rates that hasn't been accompanied by a lot of hospitalisations and deaths. ""That'll be the key difference this time round, if we're lucky."" Facebook has frozen Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro's Facebook page after he claimed without evidence that a herbal remedy can cure Covid-19, according to Reuters news agency. The company said the leader had repeatedly violated their policies on coronavirus misinformation. He claimed in January that thyme herb solution could cure the disease. He will unable to post on his page for 30 days. Maduro isn't the first world leader to face pushback from social media companies over coronavirus misinformation. Last year Facebook deleted a video from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over a claim that drug hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus. And previously a Twitter post by Maduro about a different fake remedy was deleted. Covid-19 misinformation on social media is a widespread problem. A dozen people are responsible for spreading thousands of anti-vaccine posts on Facebook and Twitter, according to analysis by the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Among them are Robert F Kennedy Jr, a nephew of the former US president, who leads an anti-vaccine group. Â© 2025 BBC.

'I moved to Scotland but it doesn't feel like I'm here',"Fanny Quindot says she saw more of Scotland as tourist than she did when she lived here Fanny Quindot had thought about moving to Scotland for a long time, but putting down roots in a new country during the Covid-19 pandemic was not easy. The 26-year-old librarian, who lived in Belgium, says she fell in love with Scotland during her travels. ""It felt like a great idea,"" she says. ""It wasn't too far from Belgium, so my friends and family could come visit, and I could easily go back home, even just for a weekend, if I ever felt homesick."" At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, Fanny had found a job in St Andrews. After a few months working from home in Belgium, she decided to pack up her things and relocate to Fife, arriving in August for her first experience of living and working abroad. The lockdown restrictions imposed at the start of the pandemic had eased, but in the autumn they began to be reintroduced as case numbers rose again. ""Because I arrived in the middle of the pandemic, I didn't meet anyone except my roommate and one of my colleagues,"" she says. ""So not being able to make friends, to have people visit from Belgium or go back home because of the quarantine requirements made things difficult."" Another strict lockdown at the beginning of this year made Fanny feel that things were not going to get better for a while - but the final straw was the introduction of the managed quarantine policy. ""I felt very lonely and the fact that travelling was going to be virtually impossible prompted me to leave Scotland and return home,"" she says. ""I didn't get to discover the country as much as I wanted to. It's quite ironic that I saw more of Scotland during my short trips than in the six months I actually lived there,"" she says. Elena Artacho says she is still waiting to discover her new home city Elena Artacho, 27, is still learning how to feel at home in Edinburgh. She arrived in the capital from Spain in early August to start a master's degree in international development. ""At first, I wondered if it would be worth leaving Spain at all if the university didn't offer face-to-face classes,"" she says. ""But we were told there would be a hybrid system with at least some classes taught in person, even if, when I asked what percentage exactly, I never got a straight answer,"" she remembers. ""Now we're all studying from home and it's really hard to focus."" Ms Artacho grew up in the UK before going back to Spain for university, then living in the United States, Qatar and the Philippines. She is usually a very active and social person and had expected to struggle with the two-week home quarantine at her arrival. But she says this time was ""probably my favourite couple of weeks in Scotland"". ""The university put me in an accommodation with other international students who were going through the same thing. ""We got on very well and, in fact, the majority of people I know now, I met during quarantine."" She now lives in a flat-share where she it has been possible to create a ""home feel"". ""I'm really good friends with my flatmates. Hearing them talk about how much they love Edinburgh, I really can't wait for the restrictions to be lifted. ""I'm here, but it doesn't feel like it. Edinburgh is a home I'm building up to."" Ellen Marks has retired to the Highlands Ellen Marks, from North Carolina, has lived in big cities from New York to Beijing, as she spent 40 years of her career evaluating services for vulnerable families across the world. The 67-year-old researcher fell in love with Scotland during a trip and decided to retire in the Highlands. She says Brexit rushed her decision. Holding a dual American-Lithuanian citizenship, she wanted to move to Scotland during the transition period, to avoid the paperwork linked to the end of the EU freedom of movement. ""I have been exposed to the country more than I've been exposed to the people,"" Ms Marks says. ""I haven't met many people, but I have become good friends with an American-Scottish couple who have been indispensable in welcoming me in my new community. ""They introduced me to some people who have become friends, oriented me to the closest supermarket, told me where to buy the best coffee."" She has admired the kindness and generosity of her neighbours, who she says have gone above and beyond to make her feel welcome. ""I love the sense of community caring for community,""she says. Lucie Aidart says she is enjoying life in Edinburgh After roaming the world for months and living in dozens of countries, Lucie Aidart started lockdown at home in France before making a move to live permanently in Edinburgh last summer. The screenwriting student says one of the main advantages of the restrictions, especially when you have an international social circle, is that people are always available. ""Sometimes, not being able to socialise normally is tough but we can adapt,"" she says. ""I can meet people outdoors, even if it's dark and cold."" She is eager to discover life in Scotland with some degree of normality, whenever that may come. ""So many good things happened in my life when I decided to just let go, and follow my intuition,"" she says. ""I don't worry too much about the future. I'm just enjoying life in this city as it is."" RULES:What are the restrictions in your area? LOCKDOWN:Six months that changed our lives CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools',"The Met is investigating allegations of abuse published on the Everyone's Invited website Allegations about sexual abuse in schools involve more than only private institutions in London, a senior Met Police officer has said. Several independent schools in the capital have been accused of failing to deal with a ""rape culture"", in claims written on the Everyone's Invited site. Det Supt Mel Laremore told the BBC more than 100 institutions are named and it was ""a national issue"". The website's founder said the focus on private schools was ""disappointing"". Everyone's Invited was set up last year as a place where victims canpost anonymous accounts of abuse they had suffered. It has now received more than 5,000 testimonies, including accounts from people as young as nine. Soma Sara set up the Everyone's Invited website to highlight victims' stories of sexual abuse Allegations by pupils who attended independent schools have recently been highlighted. On Thursday, Highgate School in north London announced it hadlaunched an external reviewinto claims of sexual abuse. However, DS Laremore, the Met's lead for rape and sexual offences, told the Today programme she believed the issue was ""more widespread than private schools"". ""We're still looking into the exact scope of how wide this spreads but certainly I know there's already over 100 schools cited on the website which do reach out to national parameters,"" she said. Posting an article onInstagram,externalwhich she had originallywritten for the I newspaper,external, the website's founder Soma Sara said the ""prevalence"" of ""rape culture"" in education was being ""overshadowed by the focus on a handful of institutions"". She explained there had been an initial bias towards private schools on the site because of her own background but ""we are beginning to see a widening of the demographics, with a significant increase in the numbers of state schools, as well as universities, being mentioned"". ""Seeing this long-overdue discussion being narrowed down to private schools is disappointing,"" she wrote. One 17-year-old girl who attended a London state school told the BBC she had been abused by a sixth former when she was aged 13. She said she the boy had approached her when she was out with friends after school and then ""he started touching me... and he tried to take off my clothes"". The teenager said a member of the public had intervened after she started shouting but when police got involved she was told there was not enough evidence for them to pursue the case. Asked how it made her feel, the 17-year-old said she was ""labelled as a girl who lied about something. That's serious and I didn't go to school for a while"". She added she still does not ""go near men or boys"", as ""I'm scared of them and I get uncomfortable around them"". The Met has been contacting institutions named on the site as part ofinvestigations into the allegations made on Everyone's Invited. The force has said it islooking into allegations written on the website. Speaking about the online campaign, DS Laremore said the force ""welcome any initiative which encourages any victim-survivor of a sexual offence to speak out and seek support. ""We take all allegations of sexual assault very seriously. ""Regardless of how long ago an offence took place, I would like to remind any victim-survivor that support is available for you should you wish to speak to us,"" she said. In June 2020, Ms Sara, who is now 22, shared her experience on Instagram of what she calls ""rape culture"". Within a week she had received and shared more than 300 anonymous responses of people with stories of ""misogyny, harassment, abuse and assault"". The Everyone's Invited website now carries thousands of victims' testimonies, often from schools and universities. Experiences range from being drugged and raped at parties, to explicit images being shared over messaging platforms.

We'll be back tomorrow with lots more coronavirus news - from the UK and around the world. Your writers today were Francesca Gillett, Victoria Lindrea, Georgina Rannard, Jo Couzens and Joshua Nevett. The live page was edited by Julian Joyce. That's about it from us today. Here is a brief round-up of the main headlines.  The latest government data,externalhas revealed there were 4,715 positive cases recorded in the UK the past 24 hours - the first time the daily figure has dipped below 5,000 in more than a week. A further 58 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test - compared with 96 on the same day a week ago. The number of patients in hospital is continuing to fall, down to 4,560 on the last count taken on Thursday. This is the lowest since mid-October. Latest figures state 615 of those hospital patients are on ventilators. More than 29.7m people have now been given the first vaccination dose - with nearly 3.3m people having been given both doses.    Despite knowing about the rules in England, which arestay at home until Monday, and then stay local, George travelled from Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, to Snowdon. He made the 260 miles (418 km) journey, which would take around four and a half hours, to start at Pen-y-Pass. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. When asked if he knew the rules, George added: ""I know. It's outdoors, so I won't meet that many people. So, I follow this. It's not bad."" Israel has been quick to vaccinate its population against Covid-19 This time last year, Israel was placed into the first of three tough lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus. Now, with the threat of Covid-19 receding, Israel is gradually returning to something approaching normality. In that spirit, Israelis have been gathering for Passover - the Jewish holiday celebrating liberation from biblical slavery. This is only possible because coronavirus infections have plummeted in the country since February, as vaccinations were rolled out. Coronavirus restrictions have been lifted in recent weeks Israel has vaccinated about half its population of nine million. It began its vaccination campaign last December and is the leading nation globally for the number of doses per head of population. As a result, authorities have allowed restaurants, hotels, museums and theatres to reopen, while relaxing restrictions on large gatherings, outdoors and indoors. âSo very happy that the whole family is gathering together, to celebrate with everyone together,â Sasha Shunary told Reuters news agency in a Tel Aviv market. âLast year we had it on Zoom.â Passover will feel more normal this year for many Jewish people in Israel Officers were called to the address on Saturday morning A police officer who was attempting to break up a house party that broke Covid laws was attacked, the force has said. Officers from West Midlands Police were called to the party in Solihull in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""Up to 100 people"" were reported to be at the gathering - currently banned under Covid regulations. According to West Midlands Police, the police officer was kicked but was not seriously injured during the incident. Read the full story here. By Joshua Haigh, BBC News More than a year after the pandemic shut schools around the world, millions of children are still stuck at home. But the experience has been vastly different for communities. A Washington mum-of-two says she had not appreciated ""how much support, not only academic but also physical and emotional, school provided my kids"". ""The unpredictability of each day has definitely ramped up my own anxiety in unhealthy ways,"" says Lori Mihalich. Meanwhile, in the Amazon rainforest in Peru, thousands of children were cut-off from the outside world without the means to continue their education when Covid-19 struck. Authorities have since strapped loudspeakers to trees to broadcast lessons into the open air. Here's how students, teachers and parents coped when children had to leave the classroom. Vaccinationshave been suspended at a Dublin hospital after it emerged it had used spare doses to vaccinate teachers at a nearby private school. Beacon Hospital administered 20 vaccines to teachers at St Gerard's School in Bray, County Wicklow. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said this was ""entirely inappropriate and completely unacceptable"". Having considered the ""operational implications"", Mr Donnelly said he has asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to suspend vaccines at the privately-owned hospital. Those who already have an appointment at the centre will be vaccinated as scheduled - before alternative arrangements are put in place. Beacon Hospital, which was administering vaccines as part of the state rollout, apologised for its decision, claiming it was made under ""time pressure"".

This video can not be played It is normal for some people to experience short-term side effects from Covid-19 vaccines Coronavirus vaccines help protect people from getting seriously ill if they come into contact with the disease. But how do they work? And will a vaccine make you feel unwell? The BBC's CrowdScience presenterMarnie Chesterton explains why a Covid vaccine can't give you the virus, and why it's normal to experience some mild side effects, such as a headache or a raised temperature. From next Tuesday, people crossing the land border from France into Spain will have to present a negative PCR test taken in the last 72 hours, the Spanish government has announced. Spain is ramping up restrictions ahead of their traditional Easter celebrations known as Holy Week, which begin this weekend. Previously only those arriving from France by air had been subject to testing.Hauliers and cross-border workers will be exempt, along with those who live in the border zone - providing they remain within a 30-kilometre (18-mile) radius of their home. Daily cases have nearly doubled in France since the start of the month, with more than 45,000 new cases announced on Thursday. From Sunday anyone travelling from France into Germany will have to submit a negative test and go into 10 days' quarantine.  After we publishedan article about one woman's lockdown project listening to 300 vinyl records,lots of people got in touch about their own new hobbies. A surprising number were not listening to albums, butrecordingthem. Others were writing and drawing, or reading a daily short story before breakfast. A number found new or extreme ways of getting exercise. We've pulled together a selection of your stories. ""My lockdown project this time was to walk every street in St Albans,"" says Jim Hodgkins from - you guessed it - St Albans. ""The first Monday the clocks went back in October I realised I couldn't handle walking the dog round the corner in the dark every night. I needed a clever way to like the dark and cold, and make up for missing an hour's walking every day on my commute. ""I photo'd an A-to-Z and started doing walks, going up to the end of every cul-de-sac. ""Altogether, it was 150 miles on 45 walks ending at the most famous arch in St Albans, the old monastery."" Read more about people's lockdown projects here. Jim Hodgkins was one of those who shared their lockdown project with us This video can not be played For people in England who are excited for the next stage of lockdown easing, there's been some good news from the PM this morning. In a video recorded by the Conservatives, Boris Johnson says there is ""absolutely nothing"" in the data to suggest we can't continue with the lockdown easing plan. ""In just a few days time I'm finally going to be able to go to the barbers,"" he said. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Several European countries paused their use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this month after reports that a small number of people recently given the shot had also developed blood clots. Buta ""thorough and careful review"" by UK and EU regulatorssubsequently found there was no evidence the Oxford vaccine caused blood clots. About 17 million people have been vaccinated in the EU and the UK - and 37 people who had the Oxford vaccine have been reported as having had a blood clot. However, the number of blood clots reported is no more than would have been expected to have occurred naturally. The MHRA,externalandthe EMA,externalsay people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised. So how do we know a vaccine is safe, and what role do trials have?Read Michelle's full analysis here. Brazil is struggling to cope with a huge surge in Covid infections. On Friday, a record 3,650 deaths from the virus were reported by Brazil's health ministry. It's the highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period since the pandemic began - and broke a record set just days earlier. In total, more than 305,000 people in Brazil have now died with coronavirus. A new, more contagious variant is thought to be behind the recent surge in cases, with many city hospitals experiencing oxygen shortages and overcrowding. Critics say the government is still failing to introduce sufficient restrictions to control the virus, but President Jair Bolsonaro says he is addressing the crisis. On Friday the government announced that human trials will begin for two vaccines developed in Brazil.  This video can not be played Covid: Grassroots sports set ready for lockdown release Outdoor grassroots sports will once again be allowed in England from Monday 29 March. Golf, tennis, basketball and outdoor swimming will all be back on the agenda. Organised outdoor sports, such as football, can also resume - subject to government guidelines. For Bella, a keen footballer, is means being reunited with her teammates - and no longer having to be satisfied with tackling her dad and little brother. ""I've really missed it,"" says Bella. ""It gives you that freedom. It's like an escape from reality - just being able to run round and not caring what it going on."" It follows a similar restart of outdoor sports in Wales and Scotland earlier this month, while Northern Ireland follows suit on Thursday 1 April.  Police blocked roads in Amritsar, Punjab to enforce a one-hour silence How do we mark the millions of lives lost to coronavirus? It's a question many individuals and governments ask themselves, particularly as we recently marked one year since the pandemic began. In India's Punjab state, authorities have introduced a one-hour silence each Saturday to honour victims of Covid-19. All traffic is expected to stop except for emergencies or on major highways, and sirens sound at the start and end of the hour. The first silence was today, but reports suggested many residents were unaware of the tribute and were left confused as queues built up to enter cities.Critics have said that the government should focus on addressing the health crisis,external, but authorities say the silence will help people remember the importance of saving lives. Nationwide India has recorded nearly 12 million infections and more than 161,000 deaths. Germany is among those European countries facing 'a third wave' of coronavirus More from Boris Johnson who was speaking at the Conservatives' virtual spring forum. The prime minister said ""bitter experience"" has taught him that the surge in cases - or ""third wave"" - currently being experienced in parts of Europe could hit the UK ""three weeks later"". ""The question is - is it going to be, this time, as bad it has been in the past? ""Or have we sufficiently mitigated, muffled, blunted the impact by the vaccine rollout?"" he added. ""There's lots of promising evidence that a lot of people who could be vulnerable are now protected against death and serious disease, that's my hope - my hunch. ""But we haven't yet seen the real conclusive proof - in the sense that we haven't seen a take-off in infection rates that hasn't been accompanied by a lot of hospitalisations and deaths. ""That'll be the key difference this time round, if we're lucky."" Facebook has frozen Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro's Facebook page after he claimed without evidence that a herbal remedy can cure Covid-19, according to Reuters news agency. The company said the leader had repeatedly violated their policies on coronavirus misinformation. He claimed in January that thyme herb solution could cure the disease. He will unable to post on his page for 30 days. Maduro isn't the first world leader to face pushback from social media companies over coronavirus misinformation. Last year Facebook deleted a video from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over a claim that drug hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus. And previously a Twitter post by Maduro about a different fake remedy was deleted. Covid-19 misinformation on social media is a widespread problem. A dozen people are responsible for spreading thousands of anti-vaccine posts on Facebook and Twitter, according to analysis by the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Among them are Robert F Kennedy Jr, a nephew of the former US president, who leads an anti-vaccine group. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Wales becomes first UK nation to lift travel banThe ""stay local"" rule has now been scrapped, allowing unlimited travel within Wales.","People were enjoying the seaside at Barry Island on the first day of Wales' Easter school holidays. Wales has become the first UK nation to lift travel restrictions within its borders. The ""stay local"" rule has been scrapped,externalfrom Saturday in favour of unlimited travel within the country. But travel outside Wales will not be allowed until a Welsh government review on Thursday, which could see it permitted from 12 April. Tourism operators offering self-contained accommodation are expecting a busy weekend after a winter lockdown. Six people from two households are able to meet outside, an increase from the current four-person limit. 'Shock' and joy as Welsh beauty spot visits resume Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? England lockdown easing still on course, says PM Organised outdoor activities and sports for under-18s can resumeand libraries and archives can reopen their doors. Rules also allow a limited opening of outdoor areas of some historical places and gardens. Police forces across Wales urged people to ""play their part and follow the Welsh government regulations"". Scotland's stay-at-home rules become ""stay local"" on Good Friday and Northern Ireland's stay-at-home message is to be relaxed on 12 April. England's stay-at-home rule will end on Monday, although the UK government is urging people to stay local as much as possible, but one walker from England travelled to north Wales on Saturday and said he knew he was breaking the rules. George made the more than 200 mile (320km) trip to Snowdonia from Somerset on Saturday to walk up Wales' highest mountain Snowdon. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. George travelled from Somerset to walk up Snowdon on the popular Pen-y-Pass track When asked if he knew that the rulesban people from travelling to Wales from England unless for essential reasons,George, from Weston-super-Mare replied: ""I know."" He added: ""It's outdoors, so I would not meet that many people so I thought it's not bad."" With warmer weather forecast and the Easter school holidays starting in Wales, one ice cream seller was enjoying her first day back in business in the south Wales seaside resort of Porthcawl ""It's been very busy, but people have been good with the social distancing and some people have been wearing a mask,"" said Pamela Davies, who owns Holly's Lollies on Newton Bay Beach. Pamela Davies said her Holly's Lollies ice cream had been busy in Porthcawl ""I like to see people enjoying themselves. Porthcawl is a very busy place, but I think people have taken notice of this virus and they are keeping to the rules."" While beaches were busier than they had been, so were some of Wales' famous hillsides - and Sean Orton was glad to get out hiking again after being in strict lockdown for more than three months. ""I've spent the last 12 months in, stuck to the rules, just going to work,"" said Mr Orton, who travelled from Wrexham to Snowdonia for a walk. Cars queue outside Trecco Bay Holiday Park in Porthcawl on Saturday ""So it's finally nice to be able to get out, go up there and be at one with nature."" Ministers eased Wales' restrictions further on Saturday as the Covid case rate is below 40 per 100,000 people and the test positivity rate is lower than 4% - both below World Health Organisation lockdown guidance thresholds. Another consideration behind lifting restrictions was the number of coronavirus patients in Welsh hospitals was at its lowest since October whilea third of the population have been vaccinated. Wales' outdoor spaces had been ready for visitors as Brecon Beacons National Park Authority said it was prepared for ""significant numbers of people"" so there were extra staff at hotspots. But Mr Orton, who arrived in Snowdonia at 05:30 GMT on Saturday, said Snowdon was the ""quietest I've seen it in years, it's quite odd"". Families said it felt ""like Christmas Day"" as they prepared to visit loved ones or to enjoy a much-needed trip away from home. Ed Pugh, 55, and his wife Tracey, 56, have not seen their daughter Alys, 23, since December - and said meeting her again is ""like Christmas Day"". Ed and Tracey Pugh (pictured before the Covid pandemic), are looking forward to seeing daughter Alys, 23, for the first time in three months The couple are making the two-hour journey from their home in Abergavenny in Monmouthshire to meet Alys for a walk on the beach near her home in Aberystwyth. ""We're a close family... but in the last year we've hardly seen her at all, which has been really tough,"" said Mr Pugh. ""We can FaceTime each other, but it's not quite the same as sharing that space, enjoying her company, sitting down and having a meal together. ""We've all been responsible citizens. We've all played our part. We knew this day would come and it's been building up to it and thank God, here we are now."" For all the joyful reunions and increased freedom, there was a message of caution for those travelling. Walkers described Snowdon, a popular spot tourist spot, as quiet on the first day of lockdown easing Public health experts warned the easing of travel restrictions could lead to a ""resurgence"" of the community transmission, despitemore than a third of Wales' population getting at least their first Covid jab. ""You'd expect people to go out and meet people, but everyone shares a responsibility of being cautious,"" said epidemiologist Dr Philip Anyanwu of Cardiff University. He said the factvaccine supplies could be delayed by ""up to four weeks""gave him cause for ""concern"". ""Ideally vaccination should be increased or at least maintained around lockdown easing,"" he added. ""But reports of a shortage of vaccine supply coinciding with restrictions being lifted makes me worried if this is the right time to ease lockdown."" Wales' road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales UK reports 6,187 cases on Friday Wales' first minister said the relaxations were ""part of our careful and phased approach to unlocking the restrictions and enabling people and businesses to resume their activities in the safest possible way"". ""We're only able to do this because of the sacrifices everyone across Wales has made over the last few months - everything you are doing to keep your loved ones safe is also keeping Wales safe,"" added Mark Drakeford. ""The public health position remains stable - our incredible vaccination programme goes from strength to strength - we have headroom to make these changes."" Non-essential travel to and from other UK nationswill be banned for at least two weeksunder the remaining restrictions. People were pictured spread out on the beach at Barry Island on the first day of Wales' lockdown easing Transport for Wales urged people to follow guidelines, adhere to social distancing and plan their journeys in advance. It also issued a reminder that there are still restrictions in place cross-border between Wales and England. Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were working to ""educate those living along the border on the regulations relevant to them"", but would not be actively patrolling the border with England. A Gwent Police spokesman said: ""We're continuing to engage with our communities and explain the importance of keeping Wales safe and we ask that people play their part and follow the Welsh government regulations. ""We all have a part to play, we have been and will continue to take enforcement action against those who are blatantly flouting the rules."" Are you in Wales?

Fresh effort to refloat ship stuck in Suez CanalTugs are taking advantage of a high tide to try to dislodge the ship blocking a key shipping route.,"The Ever Given, operated by Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine, does not appear to have been damaged A fresh effort is under way to refloat a giant container ship blocking Egypt's Suez Canal. Canal authorities say 14 tugboats are trying to take advantage of Saturday's high tide and more will arrive on Sunday if the latest attempt fails. The Ever Given became wedged in the canal - one of the world's busiest trade channels - on Tuesday. More than 300 ships are stuck on either side of the blockage. Some have had to reroute around Africa. By late Friday, dredgers had moved about 20,000 tonnes of sand from around the Ever Given's bow, which was stuck deep into the canal's bank. The chairman of the Suez Canal Authority (SCA), Osama Rabie, told a news conference on Saturday that 9,000 tonnes of ballast water - which is stored in tanks to stabilise the ship - had been removed to help lighten the vessel. He said the stern had begun to move on Friday night, and that the rudder and propeller had started working again. Strong tides and winds had made freeing the ship more difficult, he added. Mr Rabie could not say how soon the ship might be refloated but said the SCA would ""work around the clock"" to get other ships through once the Ever Given was free. 'Our customers are worried about the Suez blockage' How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal Initial reports said the 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel ran aground in high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. However, Mr Rabie said weather conditions were ""not the main reasons"" for the ship's grounding. ""There may have been technical or human errors,"" he told reporters, without giving details. ""All of these factors will become apparent in the investigation."" Dredgers and tugs are trying to free the ship The Ever Given is operated by the Taiwanese firm Evergreen Marine and owned by Shoei Kisen of Japan. Yukito Higaki, president of Shoei Kisen, said on Friday that the ship did not appear to be damaged. ""The ship is not taking water. Once it refloats, it should be able to operate,"" he said. If digging the sand away and pulling the ship with tugs fails to move it, Mr Rabie said rescue teams might have to remove some containers to lighten the load. He said he hoped that would not be needed. John Denholm, president of the UK Chamber of Shipping, earlier told the BBC that transferring the cargo to another vessel or the canal bank would involve bringing in specialist equipment, including a crane that would need to stretch more than 60m (200ft) high. ""If we go through the lightering process, I suspect we're talking weeks,"" he said. This video can not be played A salvage company, working to free the Ever Given, says the operation could take weeks About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. According to data from Lloyd's List, the blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day - or $400m an hour. Mr Rabie estimated that Egypt was losing up to $14m in revenue each day that the canal was closed. He said Egypt was grateful to the US, China and the United Arab Emirates for offers of help.

The latest government data,externalhas revealed there were 4,715 positive cases recorded in the UK the past 24 hours - the first time the daily figure has dipped below 5,000 in more than a week. A further 58 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test - compared with 96 on the same day a week ago. The number of patients in hospital is continuing to fall, down to 4,560 on the last count taken on Thursday. This is the lowest since mid-October. Latest figures state 615 of those hospital patients are on ventilators. More than 29.7m people have now been given the first vaccination dose - with nearly 3.3m people having been given both doses.    Despite knowing about the rules in England, which arestay at home until Monday, and then stay local, George travelled from Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, to Snowdon. He made the 260 miles (418 km) journey, which would take around four and a half hours, to start at Pen-y-Pass. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. When asked if he knew the rules, George added: ""I know. It's outdoors, so I won't meet that many people. So, I follow this. It's not bad."" Israel has been quick to vaccinate its population against Covid-19 This time last year, Israel was placed into the first of three tough lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus. Now, with the threat of Covid-19 receding, Israel is gradually returning to something approaching normality. In that spirit, Israelis have been gathering for Passover - the Jewish holiday celebrating liberation from biblical slavery. This is only possible because coronavirus infections have plummeted in the country since February, as vaccinations were rolled out. Coronavirus restrictions have been lifted in recent weeks Israel has vaccinated about half its population of nine million. It began its vaccination campaign last December and is the leading nation globally for the number of doses per head of population. As a result, authorities have allowed restaurants, hotels, museums and theatres to reopen, while relaxing restrictions on large gatherings, outdoors and indoors. âSo very happy that the whole family is gathering together, to celebrate with everyone together,â Sasha Shunary told Reuters news agency in a Tel Aviv market. âLast year we had it on Zoom.â Passover will feel more normal this year for many Jewish people in Israel Officers were called to the address on Saturday morning A police officer who was attempting to break up a house party that broke Covid laws was attacked, the force has said. Officers from West Midlands Police were called to the party in Solihull in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""Up to 100 people"" were reported to be at the gathering - currently banned under Covid regulations. According to West Midlands Police, the police officer was kicked but was not seriously injured during the incident. Read the full story here. By Joshua Haigh, BBC News More than a year after the pandemic shut schools around the world, millions of children are still stuck at home. But the experience has been vastly different for communities. A Washington mum-of-two says she had not appreciated ""how much support, not only academic but also physical and emotional, school provided my kids"". ""The unpredictability of each day has definitely ramped up my own anxiety in unhealthy ways,"" says Lori Mihalich. Meanwhile, in the Amazon rainforest in Peru, thousands of children were cut-off from the outside world without the means to continue their education when Covid-19 struck. Authorities have since strapped loudspeakers to trees to broadcast lessons into the open air. Here's how students, teachers and parents coped when children had to leave the classroom. Vaccinationshave been suspended at a Dublin hospital after it emerged it had used spare doses to vaccinate teachers at a nearby private school. Beacon Hospital administered 20 vaccines to teachers at St Gerard's School in Bray, County Wicklow. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said this was ""entirely inappropriate and completely unacceptable"". Having considered the ""operational implications"", Mr Donnelly said he has asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to suspend vaccines at the privately-owned hospital. Those who already have an appointment at the centre will be vaccinated as scheduled - before alternative arrangements are put in place. Beacon Hospital, which was administering vaccines as part of the state rollout, apologised for its decision, claiming it was made under ""time pressure"".

This video can not be played It is normal for some people to experience short-term side effects from Covid-19 vaccines Coronavirus vaccines help protect people from getting seriously ill if they come into contact with the disease. But how do they work? And will a vaccine make you feel unwell? The BBC's CrowdScience presenterMarnie Chesterton explains why a Covid vaccine can't give you the virus, and why it's normal to experience some mild side effects, such as a headache or a raised temperature. From next Tuesday, people crossing the land border from France into Spain will have to present a negative PCR test taken in the last 72 hours, the Spanish government has announced. Spain is ramping up restrictions ahead of their traditional Easter celebrations known as Holy Week, which begin this weekend. Previously only those arriving from France by air had been subject to testing.Hauliers and cross-border workers will be exempt, along with those who live in the border zone - providing they remain within a 30-kilometre (18-mile) radius of their home. Daily cases have nearly doubled in France since the start of the month, with more than 45,000 new cases announced on Thursday. From Sunday anyone travelling from France into Germany will have to submit a negative test and go into 10 days' quarantine.  After we publishedan article about one woman's lockdown project listening to 300 vinyl records,lots of people got in touch about their own new hobbies. A surprising number were not listening to albums, butrecordingthem. Others were writing and drawing, or reading a daily short story before breakfast. A number found new or extreme ways of getting exercise. We've pulled together a selection of your stories. ""My lockdown project this time was to walk every street in St Albans,"" says Jim Hodgkins from - you guessed it - St Albans. ""The first Monday the clocks went back in October I realised I couldn't handle walking the dog round the corner in the dark every night. I needed a clever way to like the dark and cold, and make up for missing an hour's walking every day on my commute. ""I photo'd an A-to-Z and started doing walks, going up to the end of every cul-de-sac. ""Altogether, it was 150 miles on 45 walks ending at the most famous arch in St Albans, the old monastery.""

Jim Hodgkins was one of those who shared their lockdown project with us This video can not be played For people in England who are excited for the next stage of lockdown easing, there's been some good news from the PM this morning. In a video recorded by the Conservatives, Boris Johnson says there is ""absolutely nothing"" in the data to suggest we can't continue with the lockdown easing plan. ""In just a few days time I'm finally going to be able to go to the barbers,"" he said. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Several European countries paused their use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this month after reports that a small number of people recently given the shot had also developed blood clots. Buta ""thorough and careful review"" by UK and EU regulatorssubsequently found there was no evidence the Oxford vaccine caused blood clots. About 17 million people have been vaccinated in the EU and the UK - and 37 people who had the Oxford vaccine have been reported as having had a blood clot. However, the number of blood clots reported is no more than would have been expected to have occurred naturally. The MHRA,externalandthe EMA,externalsay people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised. So how do we know a vaccine is safe, and what role do trials have?Read Michelle's full analysis here. Brazil is struggling to cope with a huge surge in Covid infections. On Friday, a record 3,650 deaths from the virus were reported by Brazil's health ministry. It's the highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period since the pandemic began - and broke a record set just days earlier. In total, more than 305,000 people in Brazil have now died with coronavirus. A new, more contagious variant is thought to be behind the recent surge in cases, with many city hospitals experiencing oxygen shortages and overcrowding. Critics say the government is still failing to introduce sufficient restrictions to control the virus, but President Jair Bolsonaro says he is addressing the crisis. On Friday the government announced that human trials will begin for two vaccines developed in Brazil.  This video can not be played Covid: Grassroots sports set ready for lockdown release Outdoor grassroots sports will once again be allowed in England from Monday 29 March. Golf, tennis, basketball and outdoor swimming will all be back on the agenda. Organised outdoor sports, such as football, can also resume - subject to government guidelines. For Bella, a keen footballer, is means being reunited with her teammates - and no longer having to be satisfied with tackling her dad and little brother. ""I've really missed it,"" says Bella. ""It gives you that freedom. It's like an escape from reality - just being able to run round and not caring what it going on."" It follows a similar restart of outdoor sports in Wales and Scotland earlier this month, while Northern Ireland follows suit on Thursday 1 April.  Police blocked roads in Amritsar, Punjab to enforce a one-hour silence How do we mark the millions of lives lost to coronavirus? It's a question many individuals and governments ask themselves, particularly as we recently marked one year since the pandemic began. In India's Punjab state, authorities have introduced a one-hour silence each Saturday to honour victims of Covid-19. All traffic is expected to stop except for emergencies or on major highways, and sirens sound at the start and end of the hour. The first silence was today, but reports suggested many residents were unaware of the tribute and were left confused as queues built up to enter cities.Critics have said that the government should focus on addressing the health crisis,external, but authorities say the silence will help people remember the importance of saving lives. Nationwide India has recorded nearly 12 million infections and more than 161,000 deaths. Germany is among those European countries facing 'a third wave' of coronavirus More from Boris Johnson who was speaking at the Conservatives' virtual spring forum. The prime minister said ""bitter experience"" has taught him that the surge in cases - or ""third wave"" - currently being experienced in parts of Europe could hit the UK ""three weeks later"". ""The question is - is it going to be, this time, as bad it has been in the past? ""Or have we sufficiently mitigated, muffled, blunted the impact by the vaccine rollout?"" he added. ""There's lots of promising evidence that a lot of people who could be vulnerable are now protected against death and serious disease, that's my hope - my hunch. ""But we haven't yet seen the real conclusive proof - in the sense that we haven't seen a take-off in infection rates that hasn't been accompanied by a lot of hospitalisations and deaths. ""That'll be the key difference this time round, if we're lucky."" Facebook has frozen Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro's Facebook page after he claimed without evidence that a herbal remedy can cure Covid-19, according to Reuters news agency. The company said the leader had repeatedly violated their policies on coronavirus misinformation. He claimed in January that thyme herb solution could cure the disease. He will unable to post on his page for 30 days. Maduro isn't the first world leader to face pushback from social media companies over coronavirus misinformation. Last year Facebook deleted a video from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over a claim that drug hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus. And previously a Twitter post by Maduro about a different fake remedy was deleted. Covid-19 misinformation on social media is a widespread problem. A dozen people are responsible for spreading thousands of anti-vaccine posts on Facebook and Twitter, according to analysis by the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Among them are Robert F Kennedy Jr, a nephew of the former US president, who leads an anti-vaccine group. Â© 2025 BBC.

At least 89 killed in Myanmar 'deadliest day',"This video can not be played Violent scenes were seen on the streets of Myanmar during its deadliest day Dozens of people have been killed by security forces in Myanmar, on the deadliest day since last month's military takeover of the country. More than 90 deaths, including children, were confirmed by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group. ""They are killing us like birds or chickens, even in our homes,"" resident Thu Ya Zaw told Reuters news agency in the central town of Myingyan. ""We will keep protesting regardless."" The lethal crackdown came as protesters defied warnings and took to the streets on the annual Armed Forces Day. US, UK and EU officials condemned the violence, with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab calling it a ""new low"". 1988 v 2021: A tale of two Myanmar protests Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Street tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die' The AAPP said the death toll was continuing to rise. The latest violence took the number killed in the suppression of protests in Myanmar since the 1 February coup to more than 400. The military seized control of the South East Asian country after an election which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. Barricades have been erected in Yangon Protesters gathered across Myanmar, also known as Burma, on Saturday. State TV aired an announcement the previous evening saying people ""should learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot to the head and back"". Security forces were out in strength trying to prevent rallies. Images shared on social media showed people with gunshot wounds and families mourning. The director of the UK-based Burma Human Rights Network told the BBC the military had shown it had ""no limits, no principles"". ""It's a massacre, it's not a crackdown anymore,"" Kyaw Win said. Violent crackdowns using live ammunition were reported in more than 40 locations across the country. Local news site Myanmar Now put the death toll at 114, while the United Nations said it was receiving reports of ""scores killed"" and hundreds more injured. The AAPP said among the fatalities was a 13-year-old girl who was shot dead inside her home. In the main city Yangon, gunshots were fired at the US cultural centre on Saturday. The US embassy said those shots caused no injuries. Protesters in Yangon defied warnings from the military Witnesses and sources told BBC Burmese of protester deaths in the cities and townships of Magway, Mogok, Kyaukpadaung and Mayangone. Deaths were also reported in Yangon and on the streets of the second-largest city Mandalay, where protesters carried the flag of the NLD and gave their now traditional anti-authoritarian three-finger salute. Protesters gave their anti-authoritarian three-finger salute Meanwhile, an ethnic armed group in eastern Myanmar said military jets had targeted territory it controls. The strike was launched hours after the group, calledKaren National Union, said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border. It came amid rising tensions between the group and the military after years of relative peace. Moe Myint, BBC Burmese A one-year old girl was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet as she played on the pavement near her home in a suburb of Yangon. A five-year-old boy in Mandalay is fighting for his life after being shot in the head by security forces. Across the country, children are amongst the injured and the dead in the bloodiest day since the coup on the 1 February. Fourteen-year-old Pan Ei Phyu's mother says she rushed to close all the doors when she heard the military coming down her street. But she wasn't fast enough. A moment later, she was holding her daughter's blood soaked body. ""I saw her collapse and initially thought she just slipped and fell. But then blood spurted out from her chest,"" she told BBC Burmese from Meiktila in central Myanmar. It was the randomness of today's killings that was particularly shocking. Armed with battlefield weapons, the security forces appeared willing to shoot anyone they saw on the streets. The brutality they showed they were capable of today is on another level from what we have seen since the coup. Neither side - the military or the pro-democracy movement - is willing to back down. The military think they can terrorise people to achieve ""stability and security"". But the movement on the streets, led by young people, is determined to rid the country of the military dictatorship once and for all. It's painful to have to count the mounting dead, especially the children. The killings in Myanmar drew international condemnation. The US embassy said security forces were ""murdering unarmed civilians"", while the EU delegation to Myanmar said the 76th Armed Forces Day would ""stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"". Deaths were reported on the streets of Myanmar's second-largest city Mandalay Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Asia, described the scenes as ""shocking, horrible, barbaric and unacceptable"". The military has not commented on the killings. In an Armed Forces Day TV address, coup leader Min Aung Hlaing said the army wanted to ""join hands with the entire nation to safeguard democracy"". ""Violent acts that affect stability and security in order to make demands are inappropriate,"" he said. He added that the army had to seize power because of ""unlawful acts"" by democratically-elected leader Ms Suu Kyi and her party. The military held a parade to mark Armed Forces Day The military has previously tried to claim that shootings have come from among the protesters. Armed Forces Day commemorates the start of Myanmar's military resistance against Japanese occupation in 1945. A military parade in the capital Naypyitaw was attended by Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin. Other countries, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, sent representatives but not ministers, according to Reuters. Min Aung Hlaing said Russia was a ""true friend"". The US, UK and EU have all imposed sanctions in response to the military coup. Myanmar and Russia's defence ties have grown in recent years.

We'll be back tomorrow with lots more coronavirus news - from the UK and around the world. Your writers today were Francesca Gillett, Victoria Lindrea, Georgina Rannard, Jo Couzens and Joshua Nevett. The live page was edited by Julian Joyce. That's about it from us today. Here is a brief round-up of the main headlines.  The latest government data,externalhas revealed there were 4,715 positive cases recorded in the UK the past 24 hours - the first time the daily figure has dipped below 5,000 in more than a week. A further 58 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test - compared with 96 on the same day a week ago. The number of patients in hospital is continuing to fall, down to 4,560 on the last count taken on Thursday. This is the lowest since mid-October. Latest figures state 615 of those hospital patients are on ventilators. More than 29.7m people have now been given the first vaccination dose - with nearly 3.3m people having been given both doses.    Despite knowing about the rules in England, which arestay at home until Monday, and then stay local, George travelled from Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, to Snowdon. He made the 260 miles (418 km) journey, which would take around four and a half hours, to start at Pen-y-Pass. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. When asked if he knew the rules, George added: ""I know. It's outdoors, so I won't meet that many people. So, I follow this. It's not bad."" Israel has been quick to vaccinate its population against Covid-19 This time last year, Israel was placed into the first of three tough lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus. Now, with the threat of Covid-19 receding, Israel is gradually returning to something approaching normality. In that spirit, Israelis have been gathering for Passover - the Jewish holiday celebrating liberation from biblical slavery. This is only possible because coronavirus infections have plummeted in the country since February, as vaccinations were rolled out. Coronavirus restrictions have been lifted in recent weeks Israel has vaccinated about half its population of nine million. It began its vaccination campaign last December and is the leading nation globally for the number of doses per head of population. As a result, authorities have allowed restaurants, hotels, museums and theatres to reopen, while relaxing restrictions on large gatherings, outdoors and indoors. âSo very happy that the whole family is gathering together, to celebrate with everyone together,â Sasha Shunary told Reuters news agency in a Tel Aviv market. âLast year we had it on Zoom.â Passover will feel more normal this year for many Jewish people in Israel Officers were called to the address on Saturday morning A police officer who was attempting to break up a house party that broke Covid laws was attacked, the force has said. Officers from West Midlands Police were called to the party in Solihull in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""Up to 100 people"" were reported to be at the gathering - currently banned under Covid regulations. According to West Midlands Police, the police officer was kicked but was not seriously injured during the incident. Read the full story here. By Joshua Haigh, BBC News More than a year after the pandemic shut schools around the world, millions of children are still stuck at home. But the experience has been vastly different for communities. A Washington mum-of-two says she had not appreciated ""how much support, not only academic but also physical and emotional, school provided my kids"". ""The unpredictability of each day has definitely ramped up my own anxiety in unhealthy ways,"" says Lori Mihalich. Meanwhile, in the Amazon rainforest in Peru, thousands of children were cut-off from the outside world without the means to continue their education when Covid-19 struck. Authorities have since strapped loudspeakers to trees to broadcast lessons into the open air. Here's how students, teachers and parents coped when children had to leave the classroom. Vaccinationshave been suspended at a Dublin hospital after it emerged it had used spare doses to vaccinate teachers at a nearby private school. Beacon Hospital administered 20 vaccines to teachers at St Gerard's School in Bray, County Wicklow. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said this was ""entirely inappropriate and completely unacceptable"". Having considered the ""operational implications"", Mr Donnelly said he has asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to suspend vaccines at the privately-owned hospital. Those who already have an appointment at the centre will be vaccinated as scheduled - before alternative arrangements are put in place. Beacon Hospital, which was administering vaccines as part of the state rollout, apologised for its decision, claiming it was made under ""time pressure"".

This video can not be played It is normal for some people to experience short-term side effects from Covid-19 vaccines Coronavirus vaccines help protect people from getting seriously ill if they come into contact with the disease. But how do they work? And will a vaccine make you feel unwell? The BBC's CrowdScience presenterMarnie Chesterton explains why a Covid vaccine can't give you the virus, and why it's normal to experience some mild side effects, such as a headache or a raised temperature. From next Tuesday, people crossing the land border from France into Spain will have to present a negative PCR test taken in the last 72 hours, the Spanish government has announced. Spain is ramping up restrictions ahead of their traditional Easter celebrations known as Holy Week, which begin this weekend. Previously only those arriving from France by air had been subject to testing.Hauliers and cross-border workers will be exempt, along with those who live in the border zone - providing they remain within a 30-kilometre (18-mile) radius of their home. Daily cases have nearly doubled in France since the start of the month, with more than 45,000 new cases announced on Thursday. From Sunday anyone travelling from France into Germany will have to submit a negative test and go into 10 days' quarantine.  After we publishedan article about one woman's lockdown project listening to 300 vinyl records,lots of people got in touch about their own new hobbies. A surprising number were not listening to albums, butrecordingthem. Others were writing and drawing, or reading a daily short story before breakfast. A number found new or extreme ways of getting exercise. We've pulled together a selection of your stories. ""My lockdown project this time was to walk every street in St Albans,"" says Jim Hodgkins from - you guessed it - St Albans. ""The first Monday the clocks went back in October I realised I couldn't handle walking the dog round the corner in the dark every night. I needed a clever way to like the dark and cold, and make up for missing an hour's walking every day on my commute. ""I photo'd an A-to-Z and started doing walks, going up to the end of every cul-de-sac. ""Altogether, it was 150 miles on 45 walks ending at the most famous arch in St Albans, the old monastery."" Read more about people's lockdown projects here. Jim Hodgkins was one of those who shared their lockdown project with us This video can not be played For people in England who are excited for the next stage of lockdown easing, there's been some good news from the PM this morning. In a video recorded by the Conservatives, Boris Johnson says there is ""absolutely nothing"" in the data to suggest we can't continue with the lockdown easing plan. ""In just a few days time I'm finally going to be able to go to the barbers,"" he said. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Several European countries paused their use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this month after reports that a small number of people recently given the shot had also developed blood clots. Buta ""thorough and careful review"" by UK and EU regulatorssubsequently found there was no evidence the Oxford vaccine caused blood clots. About 17 million people have been vaccinated in the EU and the UK - and 37 people who had the Oxford vaccine have been reported as having had a blood clot. However, the number of blood clots reported is no more than would have been expected to have occurred naturally. The MHRA,externalandthe EMA,externalsay people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised. So how do we know a vaccine is safe, and what role do trials have?Read Michelle's full analysis here. Brazil is struggling to cope with a huge surge in Covid infections. On Friday, a record 3,650 deaths from the virus were reported by Brazil's health ministry. It's the highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period since the pandemic began - and broke a record set just days earlier. In total, more than 305,000 people in Brazil have now died with coronavirus. A new, more contagious variant is thought to be behind the recent surge in cases, with many city hospitals experiencing oxygen shortages and overcrowding. Critics say the government is still failing to introduce sufficient restrictions to control the virus, but President Jair Bolsonaro says he is addressing the crisis. On Friday the government announced that human trials will begin for two vaccines developed in Brazil.  This video can not be played Covid: Grassroots sports set ready for lockdown release Outdoor grassroots sports will once again be allowed in England from Monday 29 March. Golf, tennis, basketball and outdoor swimming will all be back on the agenda. Organised outdoor sports, such as football, can also resume - subject to government guidelines. For Bella, a keen footballer, is means being reunited with her teammates - and no longer having to be satisfied with tackling her dad and little brother. ""I've really missed it,"" says Bella. ""It gives you that freedom. It's like an escape from reality - just being able to run round and not caring what it going on."" It follows a similar restart of outdoor sports in Wales and Scotland earlier this month, while Northern Ireland follows suit on Thursday 1 April.  Police blocked roads in Amritsar, Punjab to enforce a one-hour silence How do we mark the millions of lives lost to coronavirus? It's a question many individuals and governments ask themselves, particularly as we recently marked one year since the pandemic began. In India's Punjab state, authorities have introduced a one-hour silence each Saturday to honour victims of Covid-19. All traffic is expected to stop except for emergencies or on major highways, and sirens sound at the start and end of the hour. The first silence was today, but reports suggested many residents were unaware of the tribute and were left confused as queues built up to enter cities.Critics have said that the government should focus on addressing the health crisis,external, but authorities say the silence will help people remember the importance of saving lives. Nationwide India has recorded nearly 12 million infections and more than 161,000 deaths. Germany is among those European countries facing 'a third wave' of coronavirus More from Boris Johnson who was speaking at the Conservatives' virtual spring forum. The prime minister said ""bitter experience"" has taught him that the surge in cases - or ""third wave"" - currently being experienced in parts of Europe could hit the UK ""three weeks later"". ""The question is - is it going to be, this time, as bad it has been in the past? ""Or have we sufficiently mitigated, muffled, blunted the impact by the vaccine rollout?"" he added. ""There's lots of promising evidence that a lot of people who could be vulnerable are now protected against death and serious disease, that's my hope - my hunch. ""But we haven't yet seen the real conclusive proof - in the sense that we haven't seen a take-off in infection rates that hasn't been accompanied by a lot of hospitalisations and deaths. ""That'll be the key difference this time round, if we're lucky."" Facebook has frozen Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro's Facebook page after he claimed without evidence that a herbal remedy can cure Covid-19, according to Reuters news agency. The company said the leader had repeatedly violated their policies on coronavirus misinformation. He claimed in January that thyme herb solution could cure the disease. He will unable to post on his page for 30 days. Maduro isn't the first world leader to face pushback from social media companies over coronavirus misinformation. Last year Facebook deleted a video from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over a claim that drug hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus. And previously a Twitter post by Maduro about a different fake remedy was deleted. Covid-19 misinformation on social media is a widespread problem. A dozen people are responsible for spreading thousands of anti-vaccine posts on Facebook and Twitter, according to analysis by the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Among them are Robert F Kennedy Jr, a nephew of the former US president, who leads an anti-vaccine group. Â© 2025 BBC.

Dozens killed in Myanmar in bloodiest day since coup,"This video can not be played Violent scenes were seen on the streets of Myanmar during its deadliest day Dozens of people have been killed by security forces in Myanmar, on the deadliest day since last month's military takeover of the country. More than 90 deaths, including children, were confirmed by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group. ""They are killing us like birds or chickens, even in our homes,"" resident Thu Ya Zaw told Reuters news agency in the central town of Myingyan. ""We will keep protesting regardless."" The lethal crackdown came as protesters defied warnings and took to the streets on the annual Armed Forces Day. US, UK and EU officials condemned the violence, with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab calling it a ""new low"". 1988 v 2021: A tale of two Myanmar protests Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Street tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die' The AAPP said the death toll was continuing to rise. The latest violence took the number killed in the suppression of protests in Myanmar since the 1 February coup to more than 400. The military seized control of the South East Asian country after an election which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. Barricades have been erected in Yangon Protesters gathered across Myanmar, also known as Burma, on Saturday. State TV aired an announcement the previous evening saying people ""should learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot to the head and back"". Security forces were out in strength trying to prevent rallies. Images shared on social media showed people with gunshot wounds and families mourning. The director of the UK-based Burma Human Rights Network told the BBC the military had shown it had ""no limits, no principles"". ""It's a massacre, it's not a crackdown anymore,"" Kyaw Win said. Violent crackdowns using live ammunition were reported in more than 40 locations across the country. Local news site Myanmar Now put the death toll at 114, while the United Nations said it was receiving reports of ""scores killed"" and hundreds more injured. The AAPP said among the fatalities was a 13-year-old girl who was shot dead inside her home. In the main city Yangon, gunshots were fired at the US cultural centre on Saturday. The US embassy said those shots caused no injuries. Protesters in Yangon defied warnings from the military Witnesses and sources told BBC Burmese of protester deaths in the cities and townships of Magway, Mogok, Kyaukpadaung and Mayangone. Deaths were also reported in Yangon and on the streets of the second-largest city Mandalay, where protesters carried the flag of the NLD and gave their now traditional anti-authoritarian three-finger salute. Protesters gave their anti-authoritarian three-finger salute Meanwhile, an ethnic armed group in eastern Myanmar said military jets had targeted territory it controls. The strike was launched hours after the group, calledKaren National Union, said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border. It came amid rising tensions between the group and the military after years of relative peace. Moe Myint, BBC Burmese A one-year old girl was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet as she played on the pavement near her home in a suburb of Yangon. A five-year-old boy in Mandalay is fighting for his life after being shot in the head by security forces. Across the country, children are amongst the injured and the dead in the bloodiest day since the coup on the 1 February. Fourteen-year-old Pan Ei Phyu's mother says she rushed to close all the doors when she heard the military coming down her street. But she wasn't fast enough. A moment later, she was holding her daughter's blood soaked body. ""I saw her collapse and initially thought she just slipped and fell. But then blood spurted out from her chest,"" she told BBC Burmese from Meiktila in central Myanmar. It was the randomness of today's killings that was particularly shocking. Armed with battlefield weapons, the security forces appeared willing to shoot anyone they saw on the streets. The brutality they showed they were capable of today is on another level from what we have seen since the coup. Neither side - the military or the pro-democracy movement - is willing to back down. The military think they can terrorise people to achieve ""stability and security"". But the movement on the streets, led by young people, is determined to rid the country of the military dictatorship once and for all. It's painful to have to count the mounting dead, especially the children. The killings in Myanmar drew international condemnation. The US embassy said security forces were ""murdering unarmed civilians"", while the EU delegation to Myanmar said the 76th Armed Forces Day would ""stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"". Deaths were reported on the streets of Myanmar's second-largest city Mandalay Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Asia, described the scenes as ""shocking, horrible, barbaric and unacceptable"". The military has not commented on the killings. In an Armed Forces Day TV address, coup leader Min Aung Hlaing said the army wanted to ""join hands with the entire nation to safeguard democracy"". ""Violent acts that affect stability and security in order to make demands are inappropriate,"" he said. He added that the army had to seize power because of ""unlawful acts"" by democratically-elected leader Ms Suu Kyi and her party. The military held a parade to mark Armed Forces Day The military has previously tried to claim that shootings have come from among the protesters. Armed Forces Day commemorates the start of Myanmar's military resistance against Japanese occupation in 1945. A military parade in the capital Naypyitaw was attended by Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin. Other countries, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, sent representatives but not ministers, according to Reuters. Min Aung Hlaing said Russia was a ""true friend"". The US, UK and EU have all imposed sanctions in response to the military coup. Myanmar and Russia's defence ties have grown in recent years. In that time Moscow has provided training to thousands of soldiers, and has sold arms to the military. Myanmar, also known as Burma, became independent from Britain in 1948.

Boy placed in housing 85 miles from school,"Isaac said his family had been placed in eight different properties A young boy had to make a four-hour round trip to school after his family was placed in temporary accommodation 85 miles away. Isaac, 11, and his family were placed at a B&B in Manchester by Birmingham City Council due to a lack of social housing available in the city. ""By the time we got home we just went straight to bed,"" he said. The council said the national housing crisis had created ""significant challenges"" for all local authorities. ''Our family has stayed at eight different places,"" Issac said. ""There was one B&B where we stayed for two months in Manchester, but we still had school here in Birmingham which took us two hours to get there and two hours to get back."" Isaac told an event, organised by the charity Citizens UK: Birmingham, that his younger brother had spent all of his life in different homeless accommodation. The two-month placement in Manchester happened after his mother approached the council for help finding emergency accommodation. ""A year ago, we were in a bed and breakfast, we were all in one room, all six of us. ""There were not enough bed spaces. I slept on the top bunk because there were cockroaches, and I didn't like it,"" he said. The event was organised to issue a list of ""citizens demands"" to candidates standing to become the next West Midlands Mayor and Police and Crime Commissioner. More families 'trapped in temporary accommodation' 'I'd still be homeless if not for the pandemic' Andy Street, the Conservative candidate for West Midlands Mayor, said hearing Isaac speak showed ""how much work still has to be done to provide affordable housing."" Liam Byrne, the Labour candidate described the stories as ""heartbreaking"" and a ""complete scandal."" The city council said: ""Our strategy going forward is very prevention focussed, working closely with private landlords to expand our portfolio to source good quality and affordable accommodation through our Help to Rent scheme and running a number of additional schemes that enable households to remain in their home.""

"Wales becomes first UK nation to lift travel banThe 'stay local' rule has been scrapped, allowing unlimited travel within Wales from Saturday.Wales","People were enjoying the seaside at Barry Island on the first day of Wales' Easter school holidays. Wales has become the first UK nation to lift travel restrictions within its borders. The ""stay local"" rule has been scrapped,externalfrom Saturday in favour of unlimited travel within the country. But travel outside Wales will not be allowed until a Welsh government review on Thursday, which could see it permitted from 12 April. Tourism operators offering self-contained accommodation are expecting a busy weekend after a winter lockdown. Six people from two households are able to meet outside, an increase from the current four-person limit. 'Shock' and joy as Welsh beauty spot visits resume Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? England lockdown easing still on course, says PM Organised outdoor activities and sports for under-18s can resumeand libraries and archives can reopen their doors. Rules also allow a limited opening of outdoor areas of some historical places and gardens. Police forces across Wales urged people to ""play their part and follow the Welsh government regulations"". Scotland's stay-at-home rules become ""stay local"" on Good Friday and Northern Ireland's stay-at-home message is to be relaxed on 12 April. England's stay-at-home rule will end on Monday, although the UK government is urging people to stay local as much as possible, but one walker from England travelled to north Wales on Saturday and said he knew he was breaking the rules. George made the more than 200 mile (320km) trip to Snowdonia from Somerset on Saturday to walk up Wales' highest mountain Snowdon. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. George travelled from Somerset to walk up Snowdon on the popular Pen-y-Pass track When asked if he knew that the rulesban people from travelling to Wales from England unless for essential reasons,George, from Weston-super-Mare replied: ""I know."" He added: ""It's outdoors, so I would not meet that many people so I thought it's not bad."" With warmer weather forecast and the Easter school holidays starting in Wales, one ice cream seller was enjoying her first day back in business in the south Wales seaside resort of Porthcawl ""It's been very busy, but people have been good with the social distancing and some people have been wearing a mask,"" said Pamela Davies, who owns Holly's Lollies on Newton Bay Beach. Pamela Davies said her Holly's Lollies ice cream had been busy in Porthcawl ""I like to see people enjoying themselves. Porthcawl is a very busy place, but I think people have taken notice of this virus and they are keeping to the rules."" While beaches were busier than they had been, so were some of Wales' famous hillsides - and Sean Orton was glad to get out hiking again after being in strict lockdown for more than three months. ""I've spent the last 12 months in, stuck to the rules, just going to work,"" said Mr Orton, who travelled from Wrexham to Snowdonia for a walk. Cars queue outside Trecco Bay Holiday Park in Porthcawl on Saturday ""So it's finally nice to be able to get out, go up there and be at one with nature."" Ministers eased Wales' restrictions further on Saturday as the Covid case rate is below 40 per 100,000 people and the test positivity rate is lower than 4% - both below World Health Organisation lockdown guidance thresholds. Another consideration behind lifting restrictions was the number of coronavirus patients in Welsh hospitals was at its lowest since October whilea third of the population have been vaccinated. Wales' outdoor spaces had been ready for visitors as Brecon Beacons National Park Authority said it was prepared for ""significant numbers of people"" so there were extra staff at hotspots. But Mr Orton, who arrived in Snowdonia at 05:30 GMT on Saturday, said Snowdon was the ""quietest I've seen it in years, it's quite odd"". Families said it felt ""like Christmas Day"" as they prepared to visit loved ones or to enjoy a much-needed trip away from home. Ed Pugh, 55, and his wife Tracey, 56, have not seen their daughter Alys, 23, since December - and said meeting her again is ""like Christmas Day"". Ed and Tracey Pugh (pictured before the Covid pandemic), are looking forward to seeing daughter Alys, 23, for the first time in three months The couple are making the two-hour journey from their home in Abergavenny in Monmouthshire to meet Alys for a walk on the beach near her home in Aberystwyth. ""We're a close family... but in the last year we've hardly seen her at all, which has been really tough,"" said Mr Pugh. ""We can FaceTime each other, but it's not quite the same as sharing that space, enjoying her company, sitting down and having a meal together. ""We've all been responsible citizens. We've all played our part. We knew this day would come and it's been building up to it and thank God, here we are now."" For all the joyful reunions and increased freedom, there was a message of caution for those travelling. Walkers described Snowdon, a popular spot tourist spot, as quiet on the first day of lockdown easing Public health experts warned the easing of travel restrictions could lead to a ""resurgence"" of the community transmission, despitemore than a third of Wales' population getting at least their first Covid jab. ""You'd expect people to go out and meet people, but everyone shares a responsibility of being cautious,"" said epidemiologist Dr Philip Anyanwu of Cardiff University.

Worker injured in 'serious incident' at firing rangeA civilian contractor was injured on the live firing range in Carmarthenshire on Thursday.Wales,"A civilian contractor was injured on a live firing range in Pendine on Thursday Investigations are under way after a worker was injured in a ""serious incident"" on a live firing range in Carmarthenshire. A civilian contractor was injured at the Ministry of Defence (MoD) facility in Pendine on Thursday at about 11:00 GMT. Dyfed-Powys Police and the Health and Safety Executive are carrying out inquiries. It is understood the casualty was airlifted to hospital. The defence and technology company QinetiQ, which operates the site on a 25-year contract with the MoD, said it was also carrying out an internal inquiry. A spokesperson for QinetiQ said the ""serious incident"" resulted in ""injury to a member of QinetiQ personnel"". ""We are cooperating fully with the emergency services and a full investigation is under way. ""It is too early to comment further at this stage, but additional information will be made available in due course once all investigations have been completed."" The MoD Pendine range on the Carmarthenshire coast covers 20.5 sq km (5065 acres) and is used for testing, evaluation, and training with firearms and other weapons. Warnings published by QinetiQ on its website show the facility was carrying out activities with ""local gunfire and explosions"" on Thursday. Members of the armed forces use the site, alongside engineers and scientists employed by QinetiQ. A danger area extends out to sea and for aircraft up to 23,000ft. It is also the home of Nato's European test centre for small arms ammunition.

We'll be back tomorrow with lots more coronavirus news - from the UK and around the world. Your writers today were Francesca Gillett, Victoria Lindrea, Georgina Rannard, Jo Couzens and Joshua Nevett. The live page was edited by Julian Joyce. That's about it from us today. Here is a brief round-up of the main headlines.  The latest government data,externalhas revealed there were 4,715 positive cases recorded in the UK the past 24 hours - the first time the daily figure has dipped below 5,000 in more than a week. A further 58 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test - compared with 96 on the same day a week ago. The number of patients in hospital is continuing to fall, down to 4,560 on the last count taken on Thursday. This is the lowest since mid-October. Latest figures state 615 of those hospital patients are on ventilators. More than 29.7m people have now been given the first vaccination dose - with nearly 3.3m people having been given both doses.    Despite knowing about the rules in England, which arestay at home until Monday, and then stay local, George travelled from Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, to Snowdon. He made the 260 miles (418 km) journey, which would take around four and a half hours, to start at Pen-y-Pass. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. When asked if he knew the rules, George added: ""I know. It's outdoors, so I won't meet that many people. So, I follow this. It's not bad."" Israel has been quick to vaccinate its population against Covid-19 This time last year, Israel was placed into the first of three tough lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus. Now, with the threat of Covid-19 receding, Israel is gradually returning to something approaching normality. In that spirit, Israelis have been gathering for Passover - the Jewish holiday celebrating liberation from biblical slavery. This is only possible because coronavirus infections have plummeted in the country since February, as vaccinations were rolled out. Coronavirus restrictions have been lifted in recent weeks Israel has vaccinated about half its population of nine million. It began its vaccination campaign last December and is the leading nation globally for the number of doses per head of population. As a result, authorities have allowed restaurants, hotels, museums and theatres to reopen, while relaxing restrictions on large gatherings, outdoors and indoors. âSo very happy that the whole family is gathering together, to celebrate with everyone together,â Sasha Shunary told Reuters news agency in a Tel Aviv market. âLast year we had it on Zoom.â Passover will feel more normal this year for many Jewish people in Israel Officers were called to the address on Saturday morning A police officer who was attempting to break up a house party that broke Covid laws was attacked, the force has said. Officers from West Midlands Police were called to the party in Solihull in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""Up to 100 people"" were reported to be at the gathering - currently banned under Covid regulations. According to West Midlands Police, the police officer was kicked but was not seriously injured during the incident. Read the full story here. By Joshua Haigh, BBC News More than a year after the pandemic shut schools around the world, millions of children are still stuck at home. But the experience has been vastly different for communities. A Washington mum-of-two says she had not appreciated ""how much support, not only academic but also physical and emotional, school provided my kids"". ""The unpredictability of each day has definitely ramped up my own anxiety in unhealthy ways,"" says Lori Mihalich. Meanwhile, in the Amazon rainforest in Peru, thousands of children were cut-off from the outside world without the means to continue their education when Covid-19 struck. Authorities have since strapped loudspeakers to trees to broadcast lessons into the open air. Here's how students, teachers and parents coped when children had to leave the classroom. Vaccinationshave been suspended at a Dublin hospital after it emerged it had used spare doses to vaccinate teachers at a nearby private school. Beacon Hospital administered 20 vaccines to teachers at St Gerard's School in Bray, County Wicklow. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said this was ""entirely inappropriate and completely unacceptable"". Having considered the ""operational implications"", Mr Donnelly said he has asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to suspend vaccines at the privately-owned hospital. Those who already have an appointment at the centre will be vaccinated as scheduled - before alternative arrangements are put in place. Beacon Hospital, which was administering vaccines as part of the state rollout, apologised for its decision, claiming it was made under ""time pressure"".

This video can not be played It is normal for some people to experience short-term side effects from Covid-19 vaccines Coronavirus vaccines help protect people from getting seriously ill if they come into contact with the disease. But how do they work? And will a vaccine make you feel unwell? The BBC's CrowdScience presenterMarnie Chesterton explains why a Covid vaccine can't give you the virus, and why it's normal to experience some mild side effects, such as a headache or a raised temperature. From next Tuesday, people crossing the land border from France into Spain will have to present a negative PCR test taken in the last 72 hours, the Spanish government has announced. Spain is ramping up restrictions ahead of their traditional Easter celebrations known as Holy Week, which begin this weekend. Previously only those arriving from France by air had been subject to testing.Hauliers and cross-border workers will be exempt, along with those who live in the border zone - providing they remain within a 30-kilometre (18-mile) radius of their home. Daily cases have nearly doubled in France since the start of the month, with more than 45,000 new cases announced on Thursday. From Sunday anyone travelling from France into Germany will have to submit a negative test and go into 10 days' quarantine.  After we publishedan article about one woman's lockdown project listening to 300 vinyl records,lots of people got in touch about their own new hobbies.

""In just a few days time I'm finally going to be able to go to the barbers,"" he said. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Several European countries paused their use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this month after reports that a small number of people recently given the shot had also developed blood clots. Buta ""thorough and careful review"" by UK and EU regulatorssubsequently found there was no evidence the Oxford vaccine caused blood clots. About 17 million people have been vaccinated in the EU and the UK - and 37 people who had the Oxford vaccine have been reported as having had a blood clot. However, the number of blood clots reported is no more than would have been expected to have occurred naturally. The MHRA,externalandthe EMA,externalsay people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised. So how do we know a vaccine is safe, and what role do trials have?Read Michelle's full analysis here. Brazil is struggling to cope with a huge surge in Covid infections. On Friday, a record 3,650 deaths from the virus were reported by Brazil's health ministry. It's the highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period since the pandemic began - and broke a record set just days earlier. In total, more than 305,000 people in Brazil have now died with coronavirus. A new, more contagious variant is thought to be behind the recent surge in cases, with many city hospitals experiencing oxygen shortages and overcrowding. Critics say the government is still failing to introduce sufficient restrictions to control the virus, but President Jair Bolsonaro says he is addressing the crisis. On Friday the government announced that human trials will begin for two vaccines developed in Brazil.  This video can not be played Covid: Grassroots sports set ready for lockdown release Outdoor grassroots sports will once again be allowed in England from Monday 29 March. Golf, tennis, basketball and outdoor swimming will all be back on the agenda. Organised outdoor sports, such as football, can also resume - subject to government guidelines. For Bella, a keen footballer, is means being reunited with her teammates - and no longer having to be satisfied with tackling her dad and little brother. ""I've really missed it,"" says Bella. ""It gives you that freedom. It's like an escape from reality - just being able to run round and not caring what it going on."" It follows a similar restart of outdoor sports in Wales and Scotland earlier this month, while Northern Ireland follows suit on Thursday 1 April.  Police blocked roads in Amritsar, Punjab to enforce a one-hour silence How do we mark the millions of lives lost to coronavirus? It's a question many individuals and governments ask themselves, particularly as we recently marked one year since the pandemic began. In India's Punjab state, authorities have introduced a one-hour silence each Saturday to honour victims of Covid-19. All traffic is expected to stop except for emergencies or on major highways, and sirens sound at the start and end of the hour. The first silence was today, but reports suggested many residents were unaware of the tribute and were left confused as queues built up to enter cities.Critics have said that the government should focus on addressing the health crisis,external, but authorities say the silence will help people remember the importance of saving lives. Nationwide India has recorded nearly 12 million infections and more than 161,000 deaths. Germany is among those European countries facing 'a third wave' of coronavirus More from Boris Johnson who was speaking at the Conservatives' virtual spring forum. The prime minister said ""bitter experience"" has taught him that the surge in cases - or ""third wave"" - currently being experienced in parts of Europe could hit the UK ""three weeks later"". ""The question is - is it going to be, this time, as bad it has been in the past? ""Or have we sufficiently mitigated, muffled, blunted the impact by the vaccine rollout?"" he added. ""There's lots of promising evidence that a lot of people who could be vulnerable are now protected against death and serious disease, that's my hope - my hunch. ""But we haven't yet seen the real conclusive proof - in the sense that we haven't seen a take-off in infection rates that hasn't been accompanied by a lot of hospitalisations and deaths. ""That'll be the key difference this time round, if we're lucky."" Facebook has frozen Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro's Facebook page after he claimed without evidence that a herbal remedy can cure Covid-19, according to Reuters news agency. The company said the leader had repeatedly violated their policies on coronavirus misinformation. He claimed in January that thyme herb solution could cure the disease. He will unable to post on his page for 30 days. Maduro isn't the first world leader to face pushback from social media companies over coronavirus misinformation. Last year Facebook deleted a video from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over a claim that drug hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus. And previously a Twitter post by Maduro about a different fake remedy was deleted. Covid-19 misinformation on social media is a widespread problem. A dozen people are responsible for spreading thousands of anti-vaccine posts on Facebook and Twitter, according to analysis by the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Among them are Robert F Kennedy Jr, a nephew of the former US president, who leads an anti-vaccine group. Â© 2025 BBC.

""There's lots of promising evidence that a lot of people who could be vulnerable are now protected against death and serious disease, that's my hope - my hunch. ""But we haven't yet seen the real conclusive proof - in the sense that we haven't seen a take-off in infection rates that hasn't been accompanied by a lot of hospitalisations and deaths. ""That'll be the key difference this time round, if we're lucky."" Facebook has frozen Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro's Facebook page after he claimed without evidence that a herbal remedy can cure Covid-19, according to Reuters news agency. The company said the leader had repeatedly violated their policies on coronavirus misinformation. He claimed in January that thyme herb solution could cure the disease. He will unable to post on his page for 30 days. Maduro isn't the first world leader to face pushback from social media companies over coronavirus misinformation. Last year Facebook deleted a video from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over a claim that drug hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus. And previously a Twitter post by Maduro about a different fake remedy was deleted. Covid-19 misinformation on social media is a widespread problem. A dozen people are responsible for spreading thousands of anti-vaccine posts on Facebook and Twitter, according to analysis by the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Among them are Robert F Kennedy Jr, a nephew of the former US president, who leads an anti-vaccine group. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Wales becomes first UK nation to lift travel banThe ""stay local"" rule has now been scrapped, allowing unlimited travel within Wales.Wales","People were enjoying the seaside at Barry Island on the first day of Wales' Easter school holidays. Wales has become the first UK nation to lift travel restrictions within its borders. The ""stay local"" rule has been scrapped,externalfrom Saturday in favour of unlimited travel within the country. But travel outside Wales will not be allowed until a Welsh government review on Thursday, which could see it permitted from 12 April. Tourism operators offering self-contained accommodation are expecting a busy weekend after a winter lockdown. Six people from two households are able to meet outside, an increase from the current four-person limit. 'Shock' and joy as Welsh beauty spot visits resume Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? England lockdown easing still on course, says PM Organised outdoor activities and sports for under-18s can resumeand libraries and archives can reopen their doors. Rules also allow a limited opening of outdoor areas of some historical places and gardens. Police forces across Wales urged people to ""play their part and follow the Welsh government regulations"". Scotland's stay-at-home rules become ""stay local"" on Good Friday and Northern Ireland's stay-at-home message is to be relaxed on 12 April. England's stay-at-home rule will end on Monday, although the UK government is urging people to stay local as much as possible, but one walker from England travelled to north Wales on Saturday and said he knew he was breaking the rules. George made the more than 200 mile (320km) trip to Snowdonia from Somerset on Saturday to walk up Wales' highest mountain Snowdon. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. George travelled from Somerset to walk up Snowdon on the popular Pen-y-Pass track When asked if he knew that the rulesban people from travelling to Wales from England unless for essential reasons,George, from Weston-super-Mare replied: ""I know."" He added: ""It's outdoors, so I would not meet that many people so I thought it's not bad."" With warmer weather forecast and the Easter school holidays starting in Wales, one ice cream seller was enjoying her first day back in business in the south Wales seaside resort of Porthcawl ""It's been very busy, but people have been good with the social distancing and some people have been wearing a mask,"" said Pamela Davies, who owns Holly's Lollies on Newton Bay Beach. Pamela Davies said her Holly's Lollies ice cream had been busy in Porthcawl ""I like to see people enjoying themselves. Porthcawl is a very busy place, but I think people have taken notice of this virus and they are keeping to the rules."" While beaches were busier than they had been, so were some of Wales' famous hillsides - and Sean Orton was glad to get out hiking again after being in strict lockdown for more than three months. ""I've spent the last 12 months in, stuck to the rules, just going to work,"" said Mr Orton, who travelled from Wrexham to Snowdonia for a walk. Cars queue outside Trecco Bay Holiday Park in Porthcawl on Saturday ""So it's finally nice to be able to get out, go up there and be at one with nature."" Ministers eased Wales' restrictions further on Saturday as the Covid case rate is below 40 per 100,000 people and the test positivity rate is lower than 4% - both below World Health Organisation lockdown guidance thresholds. Another consideration behind lifting restrictions was the number of coronavirus patients in Welsh hospitals was at its lowest since October whilea third of the population have been vaccinated. Wales' outdoor spaces had been ready for visitors as Brecon Beacons National Park Authority said it was prepared for ""significant numbers of people"" so there were extra staff at hotspots. But Mr Orton, who arrived in Snowdonia at 05:30 GMT on Saturday, said Snowdon was the ""quietest I've seen it in years, it's quite odd"". Families said it felt ""like Christmas Day"" as they prepared to visit loved ones or to enjoy a much-needed trip away from home. Ed Pugh, 55, and his wife Tracey, 56, have not seen their daughter Alys, 23, since December - and said meeting her again is ""like Christmas Day"". Ed and Tracey Pugh (pictured before the Covid pandemic), are looking forward to seeing daughter Alys, 23, for the first time in three months The couple are making the two-hour journey from their home in Abergavenny in Monmouthshire to meet Alys for a walk on the beach near her home in Aberystwyth. ""We're a close family... but in the last year we've hardly seen her at all, which has been really tough,"" said Mr Pugh. ""We can FaceTime each other, but it's not quite the same as sharing that space, enjoying her company, sitting down and having a meal together. ""We've all been responsible citizens. We've all played our part. We knew this day would come and it's been building up to it and thank God, here we are now."" For all the joyful reunions and increased freedom, there was a message of caution for those travelling. Walkers described Snowdon, a popular spot tourist spot, as quiet on the first day of lockdown easing Public health experts warned the easing of travel restrictions could lead to a ""resurgence"" of the community transmission, despitemore than a third of Wales' population getting at least their first Covid jab. ""You'd expect people to go out and meet people, but everyone shares a responsibility of being cautious,"" said epidemiologist Dr Philip Anyanwu of Cardiff University. He said the factvaccine supplies could be delayed by ""up to four weeks""gave him cause for ""concern"". ""Ideally vaccination should be increased or at least maintained around lockdown easing,"" he added. ""But reports of a shortage of vaccine supply coinciding with restrictions being lifted makes me worried if this is the right time to ease lockdown."" Wales' road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales UK reports 6,187 cases on Friday Wales' first minister said the relaxations were ""part of our careful and phased approach to unlocking the restrictions and enabling people and businesses to resume their activities in the safest possible way"". ""We're only able to do this because of the sacrifices everyone across Wales has made over the last few months - everything you are doing to keep your loved ones safe is also keeping Wales safe,"" added Mark Drakeford. ""The public health position remains stable - our incredible vaccination programme goes from strength to strength - we have headroom to make these changes."" Non-essential travel to and from other UK nationswill be banned for at least two weeksunder the remaining restrictions. People were pictured spread out on the beach at Barry Island on the first day of Wales' lockdown easing Transport for Wales urged people to follow guidelines, adhere to social distancing and plan their journeys in advance. It also issued a reminder that there are still restrictions in place cross-border between Wales and England. Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were working to ""educate those living along the border on the regulations relevant to them"", but would not be actively patrolling the border with England. A Gwent Police spokesman said: ""We're continuing to engage with our communities and explain the importance of keeping Wales safe and we ask that people play their part and follow the Welsh government regulations. ""We all have a part to play, we have been and will continue to take enforcement action against those who are blatantly flouting the rules."" Are you in Wales?

Trapped Suez Canal ship 'could soon be refloated',"The ship's Japanese owners said tugboats and dredgers were working to free the ship The large container ship trapped in the Suez Canal could be dislodged as soon as Saturday, the vessel's Japanese owners have said. Yukito Higaki, president of Shoei Kisen, told a news conference on Friday that 10 tugboats had been deployed to dredge the banks and canal bottom. The US has also offered to send help, including a team of US Navy experts. The Ever Given became wedged in the canal on Tuesday, forcing companies to reroute ships around Africa. The blockage has also caused a huge traffic jam of more than 200 ships in the Red Sea. Mr Higaki told a press conference in the western Japanese city of Imabari that they were ""continuing work to remove sediment as of now, with additional dredging tools"". He added that crews were hoping to dislodge the ship as early as Saturday evening Tokyo time, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper reported. The Ever Given is almost as long as Manhattan's Empire State Building is high ""The ship is not taking water,"" he said. ""There is no problem with its rudders and propellers. Once it refloats, it should be able to operate. ""We are continuing work to remove sediment as of now, with additional dredging tools."" Meanwhile Bernhard Schulte Shipmanagement (BSM), the ship's technical manager, said on Friday that an attempt to refloat the vessel had failed. A specialised suction dredger, which can shift 2,000 cubic metres (70,000 cubic feet) of material every hour, arrived on site on Thursday, it added. White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki also said the US had offered assistance to get the Suez Canal reopened, and that they were ""tracking the situation very closely"". Joe Reynolds, chief engineer of the Maersk Ohio, told the BBC on Friday that the number of vessels waiting at the canal's southern entrance was ""growing exponentially"". ""It's going to affect shipping schedules around the world,"" he warned. The 400m-long (1,300ft), 200,000-tonne vessel ran aground on Tuesday morning in high winds and a sandstorm that affected visibility. Specialist salvage companies have been brought in to help refloat the ship, and an adviser to Egypt's president had said he hoped the situation would be resolved within two to three days. But experts have said it could take weeks if the vessel's containers need to be removed. 'Our customers are worried about the Suez blockage' How do you refloat a giant cargo ship? In pictures: Efforts to shift huge ship from canal About 12% of global trade passes through the 193km (120-mile) canal, which connects the Mediterranean Sea to the Red Sea and provides the shortest sea link between Asia and Europe. An alternative route, around the Cape of Good Hope on the southern tip of Africa, can take two weeks longer. Your device may not support this visualisation John Denholm, president of the UK Chamber of Shipping, told the BBC that if the diggers and tugs were not successful, salvage teams would have to start the slow process of ""lightering"" the ship - transferring its cargo to another vessel or the canal bank. That would involve bringing in specialist equipment, including a crane that would need to stretch more than 60m (200ft) high, he said. ""If we go through the lightering process, I suspect we're talking weeks."" Service provider Leth Agencies said a total of 237 vessels were waiting in the area on Friday - 107 at Port Suez in the Red Sea, 41 at the canal's midway point in the Great Bitter Lake, and 89 at Port Said in the Mediterranean. The blockage is holding up an estimated $9.6bn (Â£7bn) of goods each day - or $400m an hour - according to data from Lloyd's List.

'Dozens die' in Myanmar Armed Forces Day protests,"This video can not be played Violent scenes were seen on the streets of Myanmar during its deadliest day Dozens of people have been killed by security forces in Myanmar, on the deadliest day since last month's military takeover of the country. More than 90 deaths, including children, were confirmed by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group. ""They are killing us like birds or chickens, even in our homes,"" resident Thu Ya Zaw told Reuters news agency in the central town of Myingyan. ""We will keep protesting regardless."" The lethal crackdown came as protesters defied warnings and took to the streets on the annual Armed Forces Day. US, UK and EU officials condemned the violence, with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab calling it a ""new low"". 1988 v 2021: A tale of two Myanmar protests Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Street tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die' The AAPP said the death toll was continuing to rise. The latest violence took the number killed in the suppression of protests in Myanmar since the 1 February coup to more than 400. The military seized control of the South East Asian country after an election which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. Barricades have been erected in Yangon Protesters gathered across Myanmar, also known as Burma, on Saturday. State TV aired an announcement the previous evening saying people ""should learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot to the head and back"". Security forces were out in strength trying to prevent rallies. Images shared on social media showed people with gunshot wounds and families mourning. The director of the UK-based Burma Human Rights Network told the BBC the military had shown it had ""no limits, no principles"". ""It's a massacre, it's not a crackdown anymore,"" Kyaw Win said. Violent crackdowns using live ammunition were reported in more than 40 locations across the country. Local news site Myanmar Now put the death toll at 114, while the United Nations said it was receiving reports of ""scores killed"" and hundreds more injured. The AAPP said among the fatalities was a 13-year-old girl who was shot dead inside her home. In the main city Yangon, gunshots were fired at the US cultural centre on Saturday. The US embassy said those shots caused no injuries. Protesters in Yangon defied warnings from the military Witnesses and sources told BBC Burmese of protester deaths in the cities and townships of Magway, Mogok, Kyaukpadaung and Mayangone. Deaths were also reported in Yangon and on the streets of the second-largest city Mandalay, where protesters carried the flag of the NLD and gave their now traditional anti-authoritarian three-finger salute. Protesters gave their anti-authoritarian three-finger salute Meanwhile, an ethnic armed group in eastern Myanmar said military jets had targeted territory it controls. The strike was launched hours after the group, calledKaren National Union, said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border. It came amid rising tensions between the group and the military after years of relative peace. Moe Myint, BBC Burmese A one-year old girl was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet as she played on the pavement near her home in a suburb of Yangon. A five-year-old boy in Mandalay is fighting for his life after being shot in the head by security forces. Across the country, children are amongst the injured and the dead in the bloodiest day since the coup on the 1 February. Fourteen-year-old Pan Ei Phyu's mother says she rushed to close all the doors when she heard the military coming down her street. But she wasn't fast enough. A moment later, she was holding her daughter's blood soaked body. ""I saw her collapse and initially thought she just slipped and fell. But then blood spurted out from her chest,"" she told BBC Burmese from Meiktila in central Myanmar. It was the randomness of today's killings that was particularly shocking. Armed with battlefield weapons, the security forces appeared willing to shoot anyone they saw on the streets. The brutality they showed they were capable of today is on another level from what we have seen since the coup. Neither side - the military or the pro-democracy movement - is willing to back down. The military think they can terrorise people to achieve ""stability and security"". But the movement on the streets, led by young people, is determined to rid the country of the military dictatorship once and for all. It's painful to have to count the mounting dead, especially the children. The killings in Myanmar drew international condemnation. The US embassy said security forces were ""murdering unarmed civilians"", while the EU delegation to Myanmar said the 76th Armed Forces Day would ""stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"". Deaths were reported on the streets of Myanmar's second-largest city Mandalay Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Asia, described the scenes as ""shocking, horrible, barbaric and unacceptable"". The military has not commented on the killings. In an Armed Forces Day TV address, coup leader Min Aung Hlaing said the army wanted to ""join hands with the entire nation to safeguard democracy"". ""Violent acts that affect stability and security in order to make demands are inappropriate,"" he said. He added that the army had to seize power because of ""unlawful acts"" by democratically-elected leader Ms Suu Kyi and her party. The military held a parade to mark Armed Forces Day The military has previously tried to claim that shootings have come from among the protesters. Armed Forces Day commemorates the start of Myanmar's military resistance against Japanese occupation in 1945. A military parade in the capital Naypyitaw was attended by Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin. Other countries, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, sent representatives but not ministers, according to Reuters. Min Aung Hlaing said Russia was a ""true friend"". The US, UK and EU have all imposed sanctions in response to the military coup. Myanmar and Russia's defence ties have grown in recent years. In that time Moscow has provided training to thousands of soldiers, and has sold arms to the military. Myanmar, also known as Burma, became independent from Britain in 1948. For much of its modern history, it has been under military rule Restrictions began loosening from 2010 onwards, leading to free elections in 2015 and the installation of a government headed by veteran opposition leader Aung San Suu Kyi the following year In 2017, Myanmar's army responded to attacks on police by Rohingya militants with a deadly crackdown, driving more than half a million Rohingya Muslims across the border into Bangladesh in what the UN later called a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"" Country profile The general who returned Myanmar to military rule Who are the rulers who executed Myanmar activists?

Body-editing apps âtrigger eating disordersâTechnology firms have been warned to consider the impact of such apps on vulnerable people.,"Body-editing apps advertised on social media platforms TikTok and Instagram are âtriggeringâ young people with eating disorders, campaigners fear. Adverts show how the apps can be used to alter body parts, including making waists slimmer and adding muscles. Eating disorder charities have said technology firms should consider the impact on vulnerable people. The platforms said the apps did not break advertising guidance, but TikTok added it does reviews its policies. It said it is âcontinually looking to enhanceâ its framework to âsupport a body-positive environmentâ. The social media platform, popular with teenagers, banned adverts for fasting apps and weight loss supplements last year. Social media companies need to be held to account and âstop this unhealthy and unhelpful messaging,â said eating disorder campaigner Hope Virgo. ""Over the last year, we have seen a huge increase in the number of people with eating disorders, and while eating disorders aren't necessarily caused by bad body image, we know there are some intrinsic links. âThe fact that Instagram and TikTok are currently advertising body-changing apps will fuel this epidemic of eating disorders further.â Eating disorder charity Seed said it has seen a 68% rise in children and teenagers aged between 10 and 19 seeking support since the pandemic. Danae Mercer is a health journalist with a history of disordered eating. She regularly posts about body positivity on Instagram and Tiktok, filming âbehind the curtainâ videos of how bodies are edited. âI know from my own experience, these apps can be triggering,"" she told the BBC. âThe apps make me thinner and curvier than my body, even if I trained all the time, could ever be. They eliminate my pores in a way thatâs not even possible in nature. They create a âmeâ that is, quite simply, unachievable - and they do it all with a click of a button. âThe impact of technology like this is immense, and honestly I donât think weâll see the full result of it for yearsâ She said it was concerning these apps were being âtargeted at particularly vulnerable teens.â âTeens and young girls donât understand these things yet, not fully. In the same way, we wouldnât allow weight loss products to be marketed at children, we need to really push for new regulation around what apps are allowed to target vulnerable audiences. Especially when those apps edit bodies.â There are several free apps available on both Apple and Android app stores that allow for convincing body enhancements. Users can edit photos or videos, changing the size and shape of bodies and faces, smoothing skin and enhancing muscles. âWe are spending more time on these platforms than ever,â said Gemma Oaten, manager of Seed. âAs we get back to normal life, we wonât be able to hide behind screens or apps. ""People are being offered ways to distort their image online but that puts pressure on them in the real world.â Social media companies should accept a âduty of careâ and signpost any adverts which could be detrimental to body image, she added. This video can not be played 'Our skin is for life, not for likes' Beat, a UK eating disorder charity, said âbody-changing apps that encourage the stigmatisation of weight, or promote the idealisation of thinness, could cause distress for people suffering from an eating disorder or vulnerable to one"". Its director of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said: âWe urge the makers of these apps to consider the impact their portrayals have on vulnerable people. âWe would also encourage anyone struggling to report triggering content wherever possible, but also consider taking a step away and instead focusing on other positive sources of support like Beat.â Girl Guides: Digitally-enhanced photos need labels Influencers told not to use 'misleading' filters on ads Calls to ban 'harmful' diet app promoted by Apple 'We're in our skin for life, not for likes' Video, 00:04:36'We're in our skin for life, not for likes' Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Sex abuse claims 'not limited to private schools'The Met is investigating allegations of abuse published on the Everyone's Invited website.London,"The Met is investigating allegations of abuse published on the Everyone's Invited website Allegations about sexual abuse in schools involve more than only private institutions in London, a senior Met Police officer has said. Several independent schools in the capital have been accused of failing to deal with a ""rape culture"", in claims written on the Everyone's Invited site. Det Supt Mel Laremore told the BBC more than 100 institutions are named and it was ""a national issue"". The website's founder said the focus on private schools was ""disappointing"". Everyone's Invited was set up last year as a place where victims canpost anonymous accounts of abuse they had suffered. It has now received more than 5,000 testimonies, including accounts from people as young as nine. Soma Sara set up the Everyone's Invited website to highlight victims' stories of sexual abuse Allegations by pupils who attended independent schools have recently been highlighted. On Thursday, Highgate School in north London announced it hadlaunched an external reviewinto claims of sexual abuse. However, DS Laremore, the Met's lead for rape and sexual offences, told the Today programme she believed the issue was ""more widespread than private schools"". ""We're still looking into the exact scope of how wide this spreads but certainly I know there's already over 100 schools cited on the website which do reach out to national parameters,"" she said. Posting an article onInstagram,externalwhich she had originallywritten for the I newspaper,external, the website's founder Soma Sara said the ""prevalence"" of ""rape culture"" in education was being ""overshadowed by the focus on a handful of institutions"". She explained there had been an initial bias towards private schools on the site because of her own background but ""we are beginning to see a widening of the demographics, with a significant increase in the numbers of state schools, as well as universities, being mentioned"". ""Seeing this long-overdue discussion being narrowed down to private schools is disappointing,"" she wrote. One 17-year-old girl who attended a London state school told the BBC she had been abused by a sixth former when she was aged 13. She said she the boy had approached her when she was out with friends after school and then ""he started touching me... and he tried to take off my clothes"". The teenager said a member of the public had intervened after she started shouting but when police got involved she was told there was not enough evidence for them to pursue the case. Asked how it made her feel, the 17-year-old said she was ""labelled as a girl who lied about something. That's serious and I didn't go to school for a while"". She added she still does not ""go near men or boys"", as ""I'm scared of them and I get uncomfortable around them"". The Met has been contacting institutions named on the site as part ofinvestigations into the allegations made on Everyone's Invited. The force has said it islooking into allegations written on the website. Speaking about the online campaign, DS Laremore said the force ""welcome any initiative which encourages any victim-survivor of a sexual offence to speak out and seek support.

Boy placed in housing 85 miles from schoolThe family made the four-hour round trip after being placed in emergency B&B accommodation.Birmingham & Black Country,"Isaac said his family had been placed in eight different properties A young boy had to make a four-hour round trip to school after his family was placed in temporary accommodation 85 miles away. Isaac, 11, and his family were placed at a B&B in Manchester by Birmingham City Council due to a lack of social housing available in the city. ""By the time we got home we just went straight to bed,"" he said. The council said the national housing crisis had created ""significant challenges"" for all local authorities. ''Our family has stayed at eight different places,"" Issac said. ""There was one B&B where we stayed for two months in Manchester, but we still had school here in Birmingham which took us two hours to get there and two hours to get back."" Isaac told an event, organised by the charity Citizens UK: Birmingham, that his younger brother had spent all of his life in different homeless accommodation. The two-month placement in Manchester happened after his mother approached the council for help finding emergency accommodation. ""A year ago, we were in a bed and breakfast, we were all in one room, all six of us. ""There were not enough bed spaces. I slept on the top bunk because there were cockroaches, and I didn't like it,"" he said. The event was organised to issue a list of ""citizens demands"" to candidates standing to become the next West Midlands Mayor and Police and Crime Commissioner. More families 'trapped in temporary accommodation' 'I'd still be homeless if not for the pandemic' Andy Street, the Conservative candidate for West Midlands Mayor, said hearing Isaac speak showed ""how much work still has to be done to provide affordable housing."" Liam Byrne, the Labour candidate described the stories as ""heartbreaking"" and a ""complete scandal."" The city council said: ""Our strategy going forward is very prevention focussed, working closely with private landlords to expand our portfolio to source good quality and affordable accommodation through our Help to Rent scheme and running a number of additional schemes that enable households to remain in their home.""

Myanmar protesters shot after 'ugly deaths' warning,"This video can not be played Violent scenes were seen on the streets of Myanmar during its deadliest day Dozens of people have been killed by security forces in Myanmar, on the deadliest day since last month's military takeover of the country. More than 90 deaths, including children, were confirmed by the Assistance Association for Political Prisoners (AAPP) monitoring group. ""They are killing us like birds or chickens, even in our homes,"" resident Thu Ya Zaw told Reuters news agency in the central town of Myingyan. ""We will keep protesting regardless."" The lethal crackdown came as protesters defied warnings and took to the streets on the annual Armed Forces Day. US, UK and EU officials condemned the violence, with British Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab calling it a ""new low"". 1988 v 2021: A tale of two Myanmar protests Myanmar coup: What is happening and why? Street tales from Myanmar: 'Take care of our baby if I die' The AAPP said the death toll was continuing to rise. The latest violence took the number killed in the suppression of protests in Myanmar since the 1 February coup to more than 400. The military seized control of the South East Asian country after an election which Aung San Suu Kyi's National League for Democracy (NLD) party won by a landslide. Barricades have been erected in Yangon Protesters gathered across Myanmar, also known as Burma, on Saturday. State TV aired an announcement the previous evening saying people ""should learn from the tragedy of earlier ugly deaths that you can be in danger of getting shot to the head and back"". Security forces were out in strength trying to prevent rallies. Images shared on social media showed people with gunshot wounds and families mourning. The director of the UK-based Burma Human Rights Network told the BBC the military had shown it had ""no limits, no principles"". ""It's a massacre, it's not a crackdown anymore,"" Kyaw Win said. Violent crackdowns using live ammunition were reported in more than 40 locations across the country. Local news site Myanmar Now put the death toll at 114, while the United Nations said it was receiving reports of ""scores killed"" and hundreds more injured. The AAPP said among the fatalities was a 13-year-old girl who was shot dead inside her home. In the main city Yangon, gunshots were fired at the US cultural centre on Saturday. The US embassy said those shots caused no injuries. Protesters in Yangon defied warnings from the military Witnesses and sources told BBC Burmese of protester deaths in the cities and townships of Magway, Mogok, Kyaukpadaung and Mayangone. Deaths were also reported in Yangon and on the streets of the second-largest city Mandalay, where protesters carried the flag of the NLD and gave their now traditional anti-authoritarian three-finger salute. Protesters gave their anti-authoritarian three-finger salute Meanwhile, an ethnic armed group in eastern Myanmar said military jets had targeted territory it controls. The strike was launched hours after the group, calledKaren National Union, said it had overrun an army post near the Thai border. It came amid rising tensions between the group and the military after years of relative peace. Moe Myint, BBC Burmese A one-year old girl was hit in the eye with a rubber bullet as she played on the pavement near her home in a suburb of Yangon. A five-year-old boy in Mandalay is fighting for his life after being shot in the head by security forces. Across the country, children are amongst the injured and the dead in the bloodiest day since the coup on the 1 February. Fourteen-year-old Pan Ei Phyu's mother says she rushed to close all the doors when she heard the military coming down her street. But she wasn't fast enough. A moment later, she was holding her daughter's blood soaked body. ""I saw her collapse and initially thought she just slipped and fell. But then blood spurted out from her chest,"" she told BBC Burmese from Meiktila in central Myanmar. It was the randomness of today's killings that was particularly shocking. Armed with battlefield weapons, the security forces appeared willing to shoot anyone they saw on the streets. The brutality they showed they were capable of today is on another level from what we have seen since the coup. Neither side - the military or the pro-democracy movement - is willing to back down. The military think they can terrorise people to achieve ""stability and security"". But the movement on the streets, led by young people, is determined to rid the country of the military dictatorship once and for all. It's painful to have to count the mounting dead, especially the children. The killings in Myanmar drew international condemnation. The US embassy said security forces were ""murdering unarmed civilians"", while the EU delegation to Myanmar said the 76th Armed Forces Day would ""stay engraved as a day of terror and dishonour"". UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said he was ""deeply shocked"". Deaths were reported on the streets of Myanmar's second-largest city Mandalay Phil Robertson, deputy director of Human Rights Watch (HRW) in Asia, described the scenes as ""shocking, horrible, barbaric and unacceptable"". The military has not commented on the killings. In an Armed Forces Day TV address, coup leader Min Aung Hlaing said the army wanted to ""join hands with the entire nation to safeguard democracy"". ""Violent acts that affect stability and security in order to make demands are inappropriate,"" he said. He added that the army had to seize power because of ""unlawful acts"" by democratically-elected leader Ms Suu Kyi and her party. The military held a parade to mark Armed Forces Day The military has previously tried to claim that shootings have come from among the protesters. Armed Forces Day commemorates the start of Myanmar's military resistance against Japanese occupation in 1945. A military parade in the capital Naypyitaw was attended by Russia's Deputy Defence Minister Alexander Fomin. Other countries, including China, Vietnam and Thailand, sent representatives but not ministers, according to Reuters. Min Aung Hlaing said Russia was a ""true friend"". The US, UK and EU have all imposed sanctions in response to the military coup. Myanmar and Russia's defence ties have grown in recent years.

Tories warn of post-Corbyn Labour 'bounce',"Boris Johnson has hailed the role of the ""free market economy"" in the UK's coronavirus jab rollout as he launched the party's local election push. The prime minister called on activists to remind voters about the ""incredible scientific breakthrough"" of the vaccine ahead of May's elections in England. Mr Johnson said one difference between the Tories and Labour was a belief in the need for ""capitalist energy"". The party leader said the UK would recover ""jab by jab, job by job"". He told activists at a virtual party forum: ""Let's not be put off our stride. Let's remember that across the country it is Conservatives, Conservative councils and Conservative councillors that deliver better value for money. And let's take our great one nation message to the people."" The 6 May elections will include polls for district and county councils, police and crime commissioners and city mayors, including in London. Voting in Scottish and Welsh parliament elections will take place on the same day and there will be a parliamentary by-election in Hartlepool. 'Covid-safe' English local polls to go ahead in May Door-to-door campaigning to be allowed from March In a pre-recorded speech filmed and broadcast by the Conservative Party, Mr Johnson championed investment in communities through measures like the reversal of the Beeching railway cuts and money for new green buses. He said that Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget showed the party was ""holding taxes down and spending wisely"" and harnessing the advantages brought about through Brexit. Mr Johnson said he had spoken with ""amazing"" scientists in Scotland at a plant making a ""variant-busting vaccine"". And in Northern Ireland, the PM said he had visited engineers working on 3D technology. In Wales, he championed a Wrexham factory that is packaging vials of vaccine ""to fight and defeat the armies of disease"". Meanwhile, opponents ""would literally try to smash up"" the United Kingdom ""and destroy forever the formula for British success"", he said.

Super-cold thunderstorm sets temperature record,"Cumulonimbus incus: The anvil shape forms when the rising cloud reaches the tropopause We've all seen those majestic anvil storm clouds that form on a hot summer's day, but what do you think is the temperature right at the very top? It's very cold, obviously; at high altitude it is well below freezing. But would you be surprised to learn it is sometimes below even -100C? Indeed, scientists have just published research showing the top of one tropical storm cloud system in 2018 reached -111C. This is very likely a record low temperature. It was seen on 29 December that year, just south of the equator in the western Pacific. The measurement was made by a passing American satellite, Noaa-20. When a powerful upward draft reaches the top of the lower atmosphere, or troposphere, it will normally flatten and spread out to form thatclassic anvil shape,external. But if the storm is very energetic, the upward movement of air can punch through the troposphere's ceiling, the tropopause, to keep on rising into the stratosphere, the next layer up in the atmosphere. In the 2018 event, the cloud top was at about 20.5km in altitude. Same time, same place, whatever the weather Space laser starts chasing the wind ""It's called an overshooting top,"" explains Dr Simon Proud, a Nerc research fellow in satellite remote sensing at theNational Centre for Earth Observation,externaland Oxford University, UK. ""Overshooting tops are reasonably common. We get them over the UK as well, sometimes - like last August when we had a number of massive storms. But this was a very big overshoot. Normally, an overshooting top cools by about 7C for every kilometre it goes above the tropopause; and this one was about 13C or 14C cooler than the tropopause - so, a pretty big overshoot,"" he told BBC News. An example of an overshooting top: See the area of unevenness bursting through the flat surface Dr Proud and Scott Bachmeier, a research meteorologist at the University of Wisconsin-Madison, US, report the event in a paper in the journalGeophysical Research Letters,external. They describe the contributing factors. Although big storms in that part of the Pacific are frequent around the December-January timeframe, this one seemed to get an extra boost. In part, this came from some very warm ocean water in the region, but there was help too from a phenomenon meteorologists refer to as the Madden-Julian Oscillation. The MJO is an eastwards-moving zone of winds that can accentuate wet and dry weather. What's noteworthy, however, is the hint in the long-term data that these super-cold thunderstorms may be increasing in frequency. There have been as many such events across the globe in the past three years as there were in the 13 years before that. That's relevant as, in general, the colder the storm, the more likely it is to produce hazardous weather, such as lightning and flooding. ""The storm we report on was in the middle of nowhere, and just as well,"" says Dr Proud. ""If you'd been there you would have got drenched and very probably a load of hail on your head as well - and a lot of lightning. ""Over the last 20 years, it seems these super-cold thunderstorms are becoming a little bit more common. It's interesting that in this part of the world, the tropopause is actually getting warmer, so we might expect to see warmer clouds, not colder clouds, which likely means we're seeing more extreme storms as we're getting even bigger overshoots than we used to."" Artwork: Noaa-20 is an American low-orbiting satellite that feeds data into weather forecasts The meteorological agencies are aware that not all the satellite sensors they fly today are capable of measuring the extreme low temperatures recorded by Noaa-20âs Visible Infrared Imaging Radiometer (Viirs). Improved capability is therefore necessary, especially since the American spacecraft on that day probably didnât capture the absolute low temperature reached in the cloud top. It flew over at three oâclock and the peak of activity was about half-four.

Biden condemns 'atrocity' of Georgia voting law,"President Biden said this was an ""un-American law to deny people the right to vote"" US President Joe Biden has likened a new voting law in the state of Georgia to racist policies of the 20th Century US South, calling it an ""atrocity"". The law adds restrictions to voting that Mr Biden said disproportionately targeted black Americans. Republicans say they are streamlining voting procedures and trying to restore confidence in the election system. The president called the law ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century"" and ""a blatant attack on the Constitution"". Jim Crow refers to the 19th and 20th Century laws that enforced racial segregation in the South. Why it can be hard to vote in the US World reacts to long queues of voters in US The false US election claims going viral In last year's presidential election, Mr Biden became the first Democratic candidate to win Georgia since 1992 - and it was high turnout among black Americans that was believed to have tipped the state in his favour. In his statement, released on Friday, Mr Biden said: ""Recount after recount and court case after court case upheld the integrity and outcome of a clearly free, fair, and secure democratic process. ""Instead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote or winning campaigns on the merits of their ideas, Republicans in the state instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to vote."" He added: ""This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country, is a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience."" He later added that the justice department was ""taking a look"" at the new Georgia laws. The Election Integrity Act of 2021 passed in both chambers of the state's Republican-controlled legislature on Thursday. It makes Georgia the second state to pass laws that restrict ballot access in the aftermath of the 2020 election. The key elements of the legislation: Ensure new ID requirements for requesting mail-in ballots, replacing the current system which simply requires a signature Ban the practice of giving food or water to voters in line at polling stations Give the state legislature more power to take control of voting operations if problems are reported Limit the number of ""drop boxes"" in which people can place their absentee votes, meaning many will have to travel further Shorten the early-voting period for all runoff elections Drop boxes are deployed so people can place their absentee votes in them Georgia is one of more than 40 states in which Republicans are pushing for a tightening of rules around voting, mainly targeting those who do not vote on the day at polling stations. Although there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the last presidential election, many Republican voters have supported ex-President Donald Trump's unfounded allegations of voting irregularities. One survey last month showed 67% of Republicans thought the presidential election was invalid. Republicans say they are simply streamlining the voting and counting procedures to ensure election integrity. This video can not be played Are US voters being suppressed in Georgia? The Democrats say it is an attempt to target social and ethnic groups who are more likely to vote for them, reducing the surge in votes from those groups in the last election. On requiring new ID for mail-in ballots, they say it will now be harder for working-class people - who may not have an ID - to cast a ballot. Republicans say giving food or water to voters in line is a method of soliciting votes. Voters, particularly in majority black parts of the state, have often had to wait in line for hours. Democrats say shortening the period for run-off elections from nine weeks to four is an attempt to suppress votes, after an energised voter base in Georgia sent two Democrats to the US Senate this year - giving the party effective control of the upper chamber. Republicans say it will more fairly reflect voters' beliefs at the time of the initial vote. The high-stakes battle over US voting rights LeBron James rights group launches new campaign The 750,000 people you didnât know could vote Mr Trump issued a statement after the Georgia move, saying: ""They learned from the travesty of the 2020 presidential election, which can never be allowed to happen again. Too bad these changes could not have been done sooner!"" Mr Trump had repeatedly pressured Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in January, urging him to ""find"" votes. Mr Raffensperger, who has staunchly defended the integrity of the state's votes, also backed the new laws. ""The cries of 'voter suppression' from those on the left ring as hollow as the continuously debunked claims of 'mass voter fraud' in Georgia's 2020 election,"" he said. But influential Democrat Stacey Abrams, who helped mobilise the black vote in Georgia, shared Mr Biden's view: ""Suppression is the lazy man's way of winning an election. If you can't win honestly, push people out of the game, change the rules."" This video can not be played Georgia lawmaker Park Cannon arrested as governor signs voting law Democratic state lawmaker Park Cannon was arrested and removed from the state capitol for banging on Governor Brian Kemp's office door as he signed the bill. ""Georgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible and fair,"" Mr Kemp told reporters while signing it. Georgia has now joined Iowa in passing some form of overhaul to voting rules. They probably won't be the last. There are currently 253 similar bills in 43 states, according to the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice think tank. That's because, while Democrats currently hold slim majorities in both chambers of the US Congress, Republicans dominate state legislatures. Data from the National Conference of State Legislatures shows Republicans have legislative control in 30 states and unified control - including the governorship - in 23 states, far more than Democrats. Unified control means that what happened in Georgia - where a law quickly passes both chambers and gets signed by the governor - can easily be replicated. Why can it be so hard to vote in Georgia?

We'll be back tomorrow with lots more coronavirus news - from the UK and around the world. Your writers today were Francesca Gillett, Victoria Lindrea, Georgina Rannard, Jo Couzens and Joshua Nevett. The live page was edited by Julian Joyce. That's about it from us today. Here is a brief round-up of the main headlines.  The latest government data,externalhas revealed there were 4,715 positive cases recorded in the UK the past 24 hours - the first time the daily figure has dipped below 5,000 in more than a week. A further 58 people have died within 28 days of a positive Covid test - compared with 96 on the same day a week ago. The number of patients in hospital is continuing to fall, down to 4,560 on the last count taken on Thursday. This is the lowest since mid-October. Latest figures state 615 of those hospital patients are on ventilators. More than 29.7m people have now been given the first vaccination dose - with nearly 3.3m people having been given both doses.    Despite knowing about the rules in England, which arestay at home until Monday, and then stay local, George travelled from Weston-Super-Mare, Somerset, to Snowdon. He made the 260 miles (418 km) journey, which would take around four and a half hours, to start at Pen-y-Pass. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. When asked if he knew the rules, George added: ""I know. It's outdoors, so I won't meet that many people. So, I follow this. It's not bad."" Israel has been quick to vaccinate its population against Covid-19 This time last year, Israel was placed into the first of three tough lockdowns to curb the spread of coronavirus. Now, with the threat of Covid-19 receding, Israel is gradually returning to something approaching normality. In that spirit, Israelis have been gathering for Passover - the Jewish holiday celebrating liberation from biblical slavery. This is only possible because coronavirus infections have plummeted in the country since February, as vaccinations were rolled out. Coronavirus restrictions have been lifted in recent weeks Israel has vaccinated about half its population of nine million. It began its vaccination campaign last December and is the leading nation globally for the number of doses per head of population. As a result, authorities have allowed restaurants, hotels, museums and theatres to reopen, while relaxing restrictions on large gatherings, outdoors and indoors. âSo very happy that the whole family is gathering together, to celebrate with everyone together,â Sasha Shunary told Reuters news agency in a Tel Aviv market. âLast year we had it on Zoom.â Passover will feel more normal this year for many Jewish people in Israel Officers were called to the address on Saturday morning A police officer who was attempting to break up a house party that broke Covid laws was attacked, the force has said. Officers from West Midlands Police were called to the party in Solihull in the early hours of Saturday morning. ""Up to 100 people"" were reported to be at the gathering - currently banned under Covid regulations. According to West Midlands Police, the police officer was kicked but was not seriously injured during the incident. Read the full story here. By Joshua Haigh, BBC News More than a year after the pandemic shut schools around the world, millions of children are still stuck at home. But the experience has been vastly different for communities. A Washington mum-of-two says she had not appreciated ""how much support, not only academic but also physical and emotional, school provided my kids"". ""The unpredictability of each day has definitely ramped up my own anxiety in unhealthy ways,"" says Lori Mihalich. Meanwhile, in the Amazon rainforest in Peru, thousands of children were cut-off from the outside world without the means to continue their education when Covid-19 struck. Authorities have since strapped loudspeakers to trees to broadcast lessons into the open air. Here's how students, teachers and parents coped when children had to leave the classroom. Vaccinationshave been suspended at a Dublin hospital after it emerged it had used spare doses to vaccinate teachers at a nearby private school. Beacon Hospital administered 20 vaccines to teachers at St Gerard's School in Bray, County Wicklow. Health Minister Stephen Donnelly said this was ""entirely inappropriate and completely unacceptable"". Having considered the ""operational implications"", Mr Donnelly said he has asked the Health Service Executive (HSE) to suspend vaccines at the privately-owned hospital. Those who already have an appointment at the centre will be vaccinated as scheduled - before alternative arrangements are put in place. Beacon Hospital, which was administering vaccines as part of the state rollout, apologised for its decision, claiming it was made under ""time pressure"".

But how do they work? And will a vaccine make you feel unwell? The BBC's CrowdScience presenterMarnie Chesterton explains why a Covid vaccine can't give you the virus, and why it's normal to experience some mild side effects, such as a headache or a raised temperature. From next Tuesday, people crossing the land border from France into Spain will have to present a negative PCR test taken in the last 72 hours, the Spanish government has announced. Spain is ramping up restrictions ahead of their traditional Easter celebrations known as Holy Week, which begin this weekend. Previously only those arriving from France by air had been subject to testing.Hauliers and cross-border workers will be exempt, along with those who live in the border zone - providing they remain within a 30-kilometre (18-mile) radius of their home. Daily cases have nearly doubled in France since the start of the month, with more than 45,000 new cases announced on Thursday. From Sunday anyone travelling from France into Germany will have to submit a negative test and go into 10 days' quarantine.  After we publishedan article about one woman's lockdown project listening to 300 vinyl records,lots of people got in touch about their own new hobbies. A surprising number were not listening to albums, butrecordingthem. Others were writing and drawing, or reading a daily short story before breakfast. A number found new or extreme ways of getting exercise. We've pulled together a selection of your stories. ""My lockdown project this time was to walk every street in St Albans,"" says Jim Hodgkins from - you guessed it - St Albans. ""The first Monday the clocks went back in October I realised I couldn't handle walking the dog round the corner in the dark every night. I needed a clever way to like the dark and cold, and make up for missing an hour's walking every day on my commute. ""I photo'd an A-to-Z and started doing walks, going up to the end of every cul-de-sac. ""Altogether, it was 150 miles on 45 walks ending at the most famous arch in St Albans, the old monastery.""

Jim Hodgkins was one of those who shared their lockdown project with us This video can not be played For people in England who are excited for the next stage of lockdown easing, there's been some good news from the PM this morning. In a video recorded by the Conservatives, Boris Johnson says there is ""absolutely nothing"" in the data to suggest we can't continue with the lockdown easing plan. ""In just a few days time I'm finally going to be able to go to the barbers,"" he said. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online Several European countries paused their use of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine earlier this month after reports that a small number of people recently given the shot had also developed blood clots. Buta ""thorough and careful review"" by UK and EU regulatorssubsequently found there was no evidence the Oxford vaccine caused blood clots. About 17 million people have been vaccinated in the EU and the UK - and 37 people who had the Oxford vaccine have been reported as having had a blood clot. However, the number of blood clots reported is no more than would have been expected to have occurred naturally. The MHRA,externalandthe EMA,externalsay people can have confidence in the vaccine's benefits and should get immunised. So how do we know a vaccine is safe, and what role do trials have?Read Michelle's full analysis here. Brazil is struggling to cope with a huge surge in Covid infections. On Friday, a record 3,650 deaths from the virus were reported by Brazil's health ministry. It's the highest number of deaths in a 24-hour period since the pandemic began - and broke a record set just days earlier. In total, more than 305,000 people in Brazil have now died with coronavirus. A new, more contagious variant is thought to be behind the recent surge in cases, with many city hospitals experiencing oxygen shortages and overcrowding. Critics say the government is still failing to introduce sufficient restrictions to control the virus, but President Jair Bolsonaro says he is addressing the crisis. On Friday the government announced that human trials will begin for two vaccines developed in Brazil.  This video can not be played Covid: Grassroots sports set ready for lockdown release Outdoor grassroots sports will once again be allowed in England from Monday 29 March. Golf, tennis, basketball and outdoor swimming will all be back on the agenda. Organised outdoor sports, such as football, can also resume - subject to government guidelines. For Bella, a keen footballer, is means being reunited with her teammates - and no longer having to be satisfied with tackling her dad and little brother. ""I've really missed it,"" says Bella. ""It gives you that freedom. It's like an escape from reality - just being able to run round and not caring what it going on."" It follows a similar restart of outdoor sports in Wales and Scotland earlier this month, while Northern Ireland follows suit on Thursday 1 April.  Police blocked roads in Amritsar, Punjab to enforce a one-hour silence How do we mark the millions of lives lost to coronavirus? It's a question many individuals and governments ask themselves, particularly as we recently marked one year since the pandemic began. In India's Punjab state, authorities have introduced a one-hour silence each Saturday to honour victims of Covid-19. All traffic is expected to stop except for emergencies or on major highways, and sirens sound at the start and end of the hour. The first silence was today, but reports suggested many residents were unaware of the tribute and were left confused as queues built up to enter cities.Critics have said that the government should focus on addressing the health crisis,external, but authorities say the silence will help people remember the importance of saving lives. Nationwide India has recorded nearly 12 million infections and more than 161,000 deaths. Germany is among those European countries facing 'a third wave' of coronavirus More from Boris Johnson who was speaking at the Conservatives' virtual spring forum. The prime minister said ""bitter experience"" has taught him that the surge in cases - or ""third wave"" - currently being experienced in parts of Europe could hit the UK ""three weeks later"". ""The question is - is it going to be, this time, as bad it has been in the past? ""Or have we sufficiently mitigated, muffled, blunted the impact by the vaccine rollout?"" he added. ""There's lots of promising evidence that a lot of people who could be vulnerable are now protected against death and serious disease, that's my hope - my hunch. ""But we haven't yet seen the real conclusive proof - in the sense that we haven't seen a take-off in infection rates that hasn't been accompanied by a lot of hospitalisations and deaths. ""That'll be the key difference this time round, if we're lucky."" Facebook has frozen Venezuela President Nicolas Maduro's Facebook page after he claimed without evidence that a herbal remedy can cure Covid-19, according to Reuters news agency. The company said the leader had repeatedly violated their policies on coronavirus misinformation. He claimed in January that thyme herb solution could cure the disease. He will unable to post on his page for 30 days. Maduro isn't the first world leader to face pushback from social media companies over coronavirus misinformation. Last year Facebook deleted a video from Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro over a claim that drug hydroxychloroquine was totally effective in treating the virus. And previously a Twitter post by Maduro about a different fake remedy was deleted. Covid-19 misinformation on social media is a widespread problem. A dozen people are responsible for spreading thousands of anti-vaccine posts on Facebook and Twitter, according to analysis by the UK-based Center for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH). Among them are Robert F Kennedy Jr, a nephew of the former US president, who leads an anti-vaccine group. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Wales becomes first UK nation to lift travel banThe 'stay local' rule has been scrapped, allowing unlimited travel within Wales from Saturday.","People were enjoying the seaside at Barry Island on the first day of Wales' Easter school holidays. Wales has become the first UK nation to lift travel restrictions within its borders. The ""stay local"" rule has been scrapped,externalfrom Saturday in favour of unlimited travel within the country. But travel outside Wales will not be allowed until a Welsh government review on Thursday, which could see it permitted from 12 April. Tourism operators offering self-contained accommodation are expecting a busy weekend after a winter lockdown. Six people from two households are able to meet outside, an increase from the current four-person limit. 'Shock' and joy as Welsh beauty spot visits resume Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? England lockdown easing still on course, says PM Organised outdoor activities and sports for under-18s can resumeand libraries and archives can reopen their doors. Rules also allow a limited opening of outdoor areas of some historical places and gardens. Police forces across Wales urged people to ""play their part and follow the Welsh government regulations"". Scotland's stay-at-home rules become ""stay local"" on Good Friday and Northern Ireland's stay-at-home message is to be relaxed on 12 April. England's stay-at-home rule will end on Monday, although the UK government is urging people to stay local as much as possible, but one walker from England travelled to north Wales on Saturday and said he knew he was breaking the rules. George made the more than 200 mile (320km) trip to Snowdonia from Somerset on Saturday to walk up Wales' highest mountain Snowdon. ""I just want some outdoor activities,"" he said. George travelled from Somerset to walk up Snowdon on the popular Pen-y-Pass track When asked if he knew that the rulesban people from travelling to Wales from England unless for essential reasons,George, from Weston-super-Mare replied: ""I know."" He added: ""It's outdoors, so I would not meet that many people so I thought it's not bad."" With warmer weather forecast and the Easter school holidays starting in Wales, one ice cream seller was enjoying her first day back in business in the south Wales seaside resort of Porthcawl ""It's been very busy, but people have been good with the social distancing and some people have been wearing a mask,"" said Pamela Davies, who owns Holly's Lollies on Newton Bay Beach. Pamela Davies said her Holly's Lollies ice cream had been busy in Porthcawl ""I like to see people enjoying themselves. Porthcawl is a very busy place, but I think people have taken notice of this virus and they are keeping to the rules."" While beaches were busier than they had been, so were some of Wales' famous hillsides - and Sean Orton was glad to get out hiking again after being in strict lockdown for more than three months. ""I've spent the last 12 months in, stuck to the rules, just going to work,"" said Mr Orton, who travelled from Wrexham to Snowdonia for a walk. Cars queue outside Trecco Bay Holiday Park in Porthcawl on Saturday ""So it's finally nice to be able to get out, go up there and be at one with nature."" Ministers eased Wales' restrictions further on Saturday as the Covid case rate is below 40 per 100,000 people and the test positivity rate is lower than 4% - both below World Health Organisation lockdown guidance thresholds. Another consideration behind lifting restrictions was the number of coronavirus patients in Welsh hospitals was at its lowest since October whilea third of the population have been vaccinated. Wales' outdoor spaces had been ready for visitors as Brecon Beacons National Park Authority said it was prepared for ""significant numbers of people"" so there were extra staff at hotspots. But Mr Orton, who arrived in Snowdonia at 05:30 GMT on Saturday, said Snowdon was the ""quietest I've seen it in years, it's quite odd"". Families said it felt ""like Christmas Day"" as they prepared to visit loved ones or to enjoy a much-needed trip away from home. Ed Pugh, 55, and his wife Tracey, 56, have not seen their daughter Alys, 23, since December - and said meeting her again is ""like Christmas Day"". Ed and Tracey Pugh (pictured before the Covid pandemic), are looking forward to seeing daughter Alys, 23, for the first time in three months The couple are making the two-hour journey from their home in Abergavenny in Monmouthshire to meet Alys for a walk on the beach near her home in Aberystwyth. ""We're a close family... but in the last year we've hardly seen her at all, which has been really tough,"" said Mr Pugh. ""We can FaceTime each other, but it's not quite the same as sharing that space, enjoying her company, sitting down and having a meal together. ""We've all been responsible citizens. We've all played our part. We knew this day would come and it's been building up to it and thank God, here we are now."" For all the joyful reunions and increased freedom, there was a message of caution for those travelling. Walkers described Snowdon, a popular spot tourist spot, as quiet on the first day of lockdown easing Public health experts warned the easing of travel restrictions could lead to a ""resurgence"" of the community transmission, despitemore than a third of Wales' population getting at least their first Covid jab. ""You'd expect people to go out and meet people, but everyone shares a responsibility of being cautious,"" said epidemiologist Dr Philip Anyanwu of Cardiff University. He said the factvaccine supplies could be delayed by ""up to four weeks""gave him cause for ""concern"". ""Ideally vaccination should be increased or at least maintained around lockdown easing,"" he added. ""But reports of a shortage of vaccine supply coinciding with restrictions being lifted makes me worried if this is the right time to ease lockdown."" Wales' road out of lockdown - in 10 charts Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales UK reports 6,187 cases on Friday Wales' first minister said the relaxations were ""part of our careful and phased approach to unlocking the restrictions and enabling people and businesses to resume their activities in the safest possible way"". ""We're only able to do this because of the sacrifices everyone across Wales has made over the last few months - everything you are doing to keep your loved ones safe is also keeping Wales safe,"" added Mark Drakeford. ""The public health position remains stable - our incredible vaccination programme goes from strength to strength - we have headroom to make these changes."" Non-essential travel to and from other UK nationswill be banned for at least two weeksunder the remaining restrictions. People were pictured spread out on the beach at Barry Island on the first day of Wales' lockdown easing Transport for Wales urged people to follow guidelines, adhere to social distancing and plan their journeys in advance. It also issued a reminder that there are still restrictions in place cross-border between Wales and England. Dyfed-Powys Police said officers were working to ""educate those living along the border on the regulations relevant to them"", but would not be actively patrolling the border with England. A Gwent Police spokesman said: ""We're continuing to engage with our communities and explain the importance of keeping Wales safe and we ask that people play their part and follow the Welsh government regulations.

Biden condemns 'atrocity' of Georgia voting lawThe president decries new state voting restrictions that he likened to past racist laws of the US South.US & Canada,"President Biden said this was an ""un-American law to deny people the right to vote"" US President Joe Biden has likened a new voting law in the state of Georgia to racist policies of the 20th Century US South, calling it an ""atrocity"". The law adds restrictions to voting that Mr Biden said disproportionately targeted black Americans. Republicans say they are streamlining voting procedures and trying to restore confidence in the election system. The president called the law ""Jim Crow in the 21st Century"" and ""a blatant attack on the Constitution"". Jim Crow refers to the 19th and 20th Century laws that enforced racial segregation in the South. Why it can be hard to vote in the US World reacts to long queues of voters in US The false US election claims going viral In last year's presidential election, Mr Biden became the first Democratic candidate to win Georgia since 1992 - and it was high turnout among black Americans that was believed to have tipped the state in his favour. In his statement, released on Friday, Mr Biden said: ""Recount after recount and court case after court case upheld the integrity and outcome of a clearly free, fair, and secure democratic process. ""Instead of celebrating the rights of all Georgians to vote or winning campaigns on the merits of their ideas, Republicans in the state instead rushed through an un-American law to deny people the right to vote."" He added: ""This law, like so many others being pursued by Republicans in statehouses across the country, is a blatant attack on the Constitution and good conscience."" He later added that the justice department was ""taking a look"" at the new Georgia laws. The Election Integrity Act of 2021 passed in both chambers of the state's Republican-controlled legislature on Thursday. It makes Georgia the second state to pass laws that restrict ballot access in the aftermath of the 2020 election. The key elements of the legislation: Ensure new ID requirements for requesting mail-in ballots, replacing the current system which simply requires a signature Ban the practice of giving food or water to voters in line at polling stations Give the state legislature more power to take control of voting operations if problems are reported Limit the number of ""drop boxes"" in which people can place their absentee votes, meaning many will have to travel further Shorten the early-voting period for all runoff elections Drop boxes are deployed so people can place their absentee votes in them Georgia is one of more than 40 states in which Republicans are pushing for a tightening of rules around voting, mainly targeting those who do not vote on the day at polling stations. Although there was no evidence of widespread fraud in the last presidential election, many Republican voters have supported ex-President Donald Trump's unfounded allegations of voting irregularities. One survey last month showed 67% of Republicans thought the presidential election was invalid. Republicans say they are simply streamlining the voting and counting procedures to ensure election integrity. This video can not be played Are US voters being suppressed in Georgia? The Democrats say it is an attempt to target social and ethnic groups who are more likely to vote for them, reducing the surge in votes from those groups in the last election. On requiring new ID for mail-in ballots, they say it will now be harder for working-class people - who may not have an ID - to cast a ballot. Republicans say giving food or water to voters in line is a method of soliciting votes. Voters, particularly in majority black parts of the state, have often had to wait in line for hours. Democrats say shortening the period for run-off elections from nine weeks to four is an attempt to suppress votes, after an energised voter base in Georgia sent two Democrats to the US Senate this year - giving the party effective control of the upper chamber. Republicans say it will more fairly reflect voters' beliefs at the time of the initial vote. The high-stakes battle over US voting rights LeBron James rights group launches new campaign The 750,000 people you didnât know could vote Mr Trump issued a statement after the Georgia move, saying: ""They learned from the travesty of the 2020 presidential election, which can never be allowed to happen again. Too bad these changes could not have been done sooner!"" Mr Trump had repeatedly pressured Georgia's secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, in January, urging him to ""find"" votes. Mr Raffensperger, who has staunchly defended the integrity of the state's votes, also backed the new laws. ""The cries of 'voter suppression' from those on the left ring as hollow as the continuously debunked claims of 'mass voter fraud' in Georgia's 2020 election,"" he said. But influential Democrat Stacey Abrams, who helped mobilise the black vote in Georgia, shared Mr Biden's view: ""Suppression is the lazy man's way of winning an election. If you can't win honestly, push people out of the game, change the rules."" This video can not be played Georgia lawmaker Park Cannon arrested as governor signs voting law Democratic state lawmaker Park Cannon was arrested and removed from the state capitol for banging on Governor Brian Kemp's office door as he signed the bill. ""Georgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible and fair,"" Mr Kemp told reporters while signing it. Georgia has now joined Iowa in passing some form of overhaul to voting rules. They probably won't be the last. There are currently 253 similar bills in 43 states, according to the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice think tank. That's because, while Democrats currently hold slim majorities in both chambers of the US Congress, Republicans dominate state legislatures. Data from the National Conference of State Legislatures shows Republicans have legislative control in 30 states and unified control - including the governorship - in 23 states, far more than Democrats. Unified control means that what happened in Georgia - where a law quickly passes both chambers and gets signed by the governor - can easily be replicated. Why can it be so hard to vote in Georgia?

Watchdog warns against naming prophet row teacher,"Protesters gathered for a second day outside Batley Grammar School on Friday Sharing the identity of a teacher who showed pupils an ""offensive"" cartoon of the Prophet Muhammad could result in police action, a watchdog has warned. Protests were held outside Batley Grammar School, where the staff member was suspended after complaints. Baroness Kishwer Falkner said making a teacher fear for their safety was ""simply unacceptable"". The Equality and Human Rights Commission chair said the school ""ought to be trusted"" to take action. ""A teacher's identity being shared, making them fear for their safety, is simply unacceptable and could result in enforcement action from the police,"" she said. Gary Kibble, head teacher of the West Yorkshire school, said the teacher had ""given their most sincere apologies"" for the caricature being shown and said an investigation had begun. Demonstrators, who first gatheredoutside the grounds on Thursday morning, staged a second protest on Friday but had moved on by mid-afternoon. Somehad demanded the teacher's sackingand accused staff of failing to take the issue seriously. Baroness Falkner said children's education ""should not be disrupted by protests in what has already been a difficult year"". ""Schools are places where children learn about ideas, values, difference and respect. ""This sometimes involves exposing them to contentious issues and different views and ideas."" ""For schools to meet their legal duty to foster good relations between people from different groups, this should be done in a balanced, respectful and sensitive way."" Prophet Muhammad cartoon sparks protest at school The issue of depicting the Prophet Muhammad Speaking on Friday morning, Communities Secretary Robert Jenrick called for the ""deeply unsettling"" scenes outside the school to ""come to an end"". He defended the right of teachers to ""appropriately"" show images of the Prophet Muhammed and said ""no-one should be feeling intimidated or threatened as they go into school"". A petition calling for the teacher to be reinstated has received more than 10,000 signatures. Robert Jenrick described the protests as ""deeply unsettling"" Dr Shazad Amin, deputy chair of MEND, which helps Muslims engage with British media and politics, said its Islamophobia Response Unit had been helping several parents liaise with the school. He said he saw ""no problem"" with blasphemy being discussed at the school but said the particular image shown to pupils was ""deeply offensive"" and ""furthered stereotypes and anti-Islamic tropes"". As a result, he said, people in the local community had ""a right to feel hurt and a right to feel angry"" but called for them to allow the matter to be properly investigated. He said parents were ""fairly positive"" about the action taken so far by the school. Head teacher Gary Kibble has apologised ""unequivocally"" Former Conservative Party chairwoman Baroness Warsi said the debate had been hijacked by ""extremists on both sides"" to fuel a ""culture war"" at the expense of ""kids and their learning"". Labour MP for Batley and Spen, Tracey Brabin, condemned those who ""seek to fan the flames of this incident"", and said she welcomed the school's apology. West Yorkshire Police said no arrests had been made and officers remained at the school. Parts of the Koran are taken to mean thatneither Allah nor Muhammad can be captured in an image by human handand any attempt to do so is seen as an insult. Kirklees Council said Batley Grammar is an academy school so the authority only has a ""very limited role"" in its running, but it praised staff for taking ""swift action"".

Body-editing apps âtrigger eating disordersâ,"Body-editing apps advertised on social media platforms TikTok and Instagram are âtriggeringâ young people with eating disorders, campaigners fear. Adverts show how the apps can be used to alter body parts, including making waists slimmer and adding muscles. Eating disorder charities have said technology firms should consider the impact on vulnerable people. The platforms said the apps did not break advertising guidance, but TikTok added it does reviews its policies. It said it is âcontinually looking to enhanceâ its framework to âsupport a body-positive environmentâ. The social media platform, popular with teenagers, banned adverts for fasting apps and weight loss supplements last year. Social media companies need to be held to account and âstop this unhealthy and unhelpful messaging,â said eating disorder campaigner Hope Virgo. ""Over the last year, we have seen a huge increase in the number of people with eating disorders, and while eating disorders aren't necessarily caused by bad body image, we know there are some intrinsic links. âThe fact that Instagram and TikTok are currently advertising body-changing apps will fuel this epidemic of eating disorders further.â Eating disorder charity Seed said it has seen a 68% rise in children and teenagers aged between 10 and 19 seeking support since the pandemic. Danae Mercer is a health journalist with a history of disordered eating. She regularly posts about body positivity on Instagram and Tiktok, filming âbehind the curtainâ videos of how bodies are edited. âI know from my own experience, these apps can be triggering,"" she told the BBC. âThe apps make me thinner and curvier than my body, even if I trained all the time, could ever be. They eliminate my pores in a way thatâs not even possible in nature. They create a âmeâ that is, quite simply, unachievable - and they do it all with a click of a button. âThe impact of technology like this is immense, and honestly I donât think weâll see the full result of it for yearsâ She said it was concerning these apps were being âtargeted at particularly vulnerable teens.â âTeens and young girls donât understand these things yet, not fully. In the same way, we wouldnât allow weight loss products to be marketed at children, we need to really push for new regulation around what apps are allowed to target vulnerable audiences. Especially when those apps edit bodies.â There are several free apps available on both Apple and Android app stores that allow for convincing body enhancements. Users can edit photos or videos, changing the size and shape of bodies and faces, smoothing skin and enhancing muscles. âWe are spending more time on these platforms than ever,â said Gemma Oaten, manager of Seed. âAs we get back to normal life, we wonât be able to hide behind screens or apps. ""People are being offered ways to distort their image online but that puts pressure on them in the real world.â Social media companies should accept a âduty of careâ and signpost any adverts which could be detrimental to body image, she added. This video can not be played 'Our skin is for life, not for likes' Beat, a UK eating disorder charity, said âbody-changing apps that encourage the stigmatisation of weight, or promote the idealisation of thinness, could cause distress for people suffering from an eating disorder or vulnerable to one"". Its director of external affairs, Tom Quinn, said: âWe urge the makers of these apps to consider the impact their portrayals have on vulnerable people. âWe would also encourage anyone struggling to report triggering content wherever possible, but also consider taking a step away and instead focusing on other positive sources of support like Beat.â Girl Guides: Digitally-enhanced photos need labels Influencers told not to use 'misleading' filters on ads Calls to ban 'harmful' diet app promoted by Apple 'We're in our skin for life, not for likes' Video, 00:04:36'We're in our skin for life, not for likes' Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Phone companies 'must do more' to stop fraud calls,"This video can not be played Reporter Dan Whitworth was phoned by a fraudster and managed to record the call Phone companies must do more to stop fraudsters who spoof phone numbers to trap victims, one of the UK's top law enforcement officers has said. Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Crime Agency's National Economic Crime Centre, says the UK needs ""a step change in our response"" to fraud. It costs the economy up to Â£190bn each year. Phone companies say they are committed to taking action over nuisance calls. Mr Biggar says there has been an ""explosion"" in the number of criminals spoofing phone numbers in the past 12 months. ""Phone companies have been used for fraud since they've been invented and it's a constant arms race to stop vulnerabilities and then stop them. Covid fraudsters steal Â£34.5m in scams Fraudsters 'scammed me out of every penny I had' Fraud epidemic 'is now national security threat' ""With HMRC scams alone, more than 2,700 numbers have been taken out of circulation after they've been reported, but there is definitely a lot more that the phone companies need to do and can do."" His comments are backed up by arecent report,externalfrom industry body UK Finance, which suggests the number of reported cases of impersonation fraud - including spoof calls - last year nearly doubled to 40,000. However, the real figure is likely to be much higher, because many victims won't report fraud to their bank or building society, or even tell their family or friends, because of feelings of embarrassment or guilt. Earlier this year, the level of fraud in the UK was labelled a""threat to national security"". The communications watchdog, Ofcom,describes number spoofing,externalas people who deliberately change the telephone number and the name that is relayed as the Caller ID information. ""They do this to either hide their identity or to try to mimic the number of a real company or person who has nothing to do with the real caller,"" explains Ofcom on its website. ""For example, identity thieves who want to steal sensitive information such as your bank account or login details, sometimes use spoofing to pretend they're calling from your bank or credit card company."" Ope Oladejo, a 21-year-old law student, had nearly Â£2,000 stolen from her last summer - money she'd been saving whilst working as a carer for help pay for a law course. ""The number spoofing was the most important part [of the deception],"" she tells the BBC. ""At first I was a bit sceptical...but they said: 'Check the number [we're calling you on] on the back of your card'. ""I checked and it matched and that's when I let my guard down completely."" Ope Oladejo had nearly Â£2,000 stolen from her by criminals who spoofed her bank's phone number Because the criminals had convinced Ope she was speaking to her bank, they were able to get key details and information from her, which allowed them to steal the money. Thankfully, the money was refunded by Ope's bank and she has been able to continue her studies, but she says the incident hit her hard. ""Emotionally it just made me really sad, I just cried a lot about it,"" she says. ""Financially I think it made me smarter... I basically ignore any phone calls I've not got saved as they might be a spoof."" The BBC approached Mobile UK, which represents the four big mobile phone companies, as well as BT, for comment. The mobile operators and BT said they were committed to taking action against nuisance calls and to working with Ofcom and law enforcement bodies to reduce the threat. They added that they take customers' security very seriously and advised people to hang up straight away if they are suspicious about any call.
