Â£4bn schools funding boost to be confirmed,"A leaked government document appears to confirm an expected Â£4bn boost in funding for schools in England. Details of the cash injection for education,revealed by the BBCat the weekend, have been published by the Guardian newspaper. It follows warnings by heads and teachers of a worsening funding crisis in schools and colleges. In the Conservative leadership campaign, Boris Johnson had promised to reverse cuts to school budgets. Head teachers' leader Geoff Barton said school leaders would ""need some convincing that any funding commitment really does address the crisis and isn't simply part of a strategy for a forthcoming general election"". It is understood thatthe leaked document published by the Guardian,externalshows the education department's bid for funding, rather than a final outcome. It includes proposals for how extra funding would be spent, such as higher starting salaries for teachers to tackle a staffing shortage. There are also suggestions of measures to improve discipline, such as ensuring that teachers are able to use ""reasonable force"" in restraining pupils and to ban mobile phones. Schools to receive Â£4bn extra in funding School funding top priority for Gavin Williamson Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap Â£3.8bn needed to reverse school cuts Schools need multi-billion cash injection, say MPs And there would be a further commitment to open more free schools. But it is understood that these have been ideas put forward during negotiations for more funding - and that the final deal will reflect Mr Johnson's pledge to put Â£4.6bn extra per year into schools by 2022. A one-year settlement would be seen as a stepping stone towards that amount. The Guardian's leak breaks down potential increases - including Â£2.8bn for primary and secondary schools up to the age of 16, including Â£800m for children with special educational needs and disabilities. A further Â£800m could be for two areas which have faced particular funding problems - sixth form and further education. Putting more money into cash-strapped schools is likely to be seen as a popular grassroots measure ahead of a possible autumn general election. There has been a long-running campaign by school leaders protesting about inadequate funding. This was backed by analysis from the Institute for Fiscal Studies that suggestedschools had suffered budget reductions of 8%since 2010. The Department for Education had rejected such accusations, saying that schools were receiving record levels of funding. But teachers' unions and head teachers' campaign groups have maintained a constant challenge - writing directly to millions of parents about the financial difficulties facing schools. Further protests by head teachers are expected in the autumn term - and school leaders will want to check the detail of any promises. Jules White, the West Sussex head teacher who has organised a funding campaign involving thousands of schools, says there is a ""strong sentiment"" among heads that there must be a ""guaranteed long-term settlement"" and there is transparency in the detail of what is being promised. ""Once we see the details we will tell parents the accurate truth again,"" said Mr White. ""If the news is good we will say it but we will not be fobbed off by any election-driven gimmicks."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said schools would welcome any increase in funding. But he warned that: ""Any extra money must be allocated immediately and it needs to be part of a longer-term commitment to reverse the education cuts because the sums of money being discussed are not enough to achieve that objective on their own."" Labour's shadow education secretary, Angela Rayner, said: ""Time after time Boris Johnson has backed Tory cuts to school budgets that created the crisis in our classrooms, while slashing taxes for the richest. ""Johnson shows no sign of taking the action needed to undo that damage, and isn't even proposing to reverse the Conservatives' cuts to schools since 2010.""

Brazil rejects G7 Amazon fire aid over 'insults',"This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has ruled out accepting a G7 offer of aid to fight fires in the Amazon rainforest unless he gets an apology from his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron. Mr Bolsonaro said the French leader should apologise for insulting him personally by calling him a liar. Mr Macron had accused him of ""lying"" about fighting climate change. Aid worth $22m (Â£18m) was announced by Mr Macron at a summit in France of the seven leading industrial powers. What about Bolivia's Amazon fires? Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered Satellite data show a huge increase in the number of fires burning in Brazil, most of them in the Amazon region. Earlier, Brazilian ministers said the G7 money was not needed and they accused foreign powers of wanting control of the Amazon. Last week, Mr Macron said Mr Bolsonaro had ""lied"" to him at a G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June by failing to respect his climate commitments and by failing to pursue biodiversity. Mr Macron said France would not ratify a huge trade deal with South American nationsunless Brazil did more to fight fires in the Amazon. Emmanuel Macron (L) and Jair Bolsonaro at the G20 Summit in Osaka On Tuesday, Mr Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital Brasilia: ""Mr Macron must withdraw the insults that he made to my person. Firstly, he called me a liar."" He also accused Mr Macron of questioning Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon region, Brazilian news website G1 reports. ""To talk or to accept anything from France, whether it be with the best possible intentions, he [Mr Macron] will have to withdraw those words and then we can talk,"" he said. The two presidents hold sharply different political views, with Mr Bolsonaro hailing from the far right in Brazil and Mr Macron elected in a run-off against the far right in France. In another development, Mr Bolsonaro responded to a joke on Facebook mocking the age of Mr Macron's wife Brigitte who, at 65, is 25 years his senior. He wrote: ""Do not humiliate the guy, ha ha."" Asked about Mr Bolsonaro's remarks,Mr Macron said they were ""extraordinarily rude"" and ""sad"". Adding to the row over the aid offer, Mr Bolsonaro's chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, mocked the fire that ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris in April. ""Macron cannot even avoid a predictable fire in a church that is part of the world's heritage and he wants to give us lessons for our country?"" he said, quoted by the Globo news website. As the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It spans a number of countries, but the majority of it falls within Brazil. Fire damage in Brazil's Otuquis National Park Otuquis National Park is part of the Pantanal ecoregion, known for its wetlands Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but satellitedata published by Brazil's space agency show an increase of 80% this year,external. It is the highest number of fires since 2010. BBC analysis has also found that the growth in the number of fires coincided with a sharp drop in finesbeing handed out for environmental violations. Amazon: Lungs of the planet Mr Bolsonaro has previously said his government lacks the resources to fight the record number of fires in the Amazon regionbut his government is also being accused of slashing funding for environmental protection. ""The funding for Brazil's environment agency has gone down by 95% this year,"" Yadvinder Malhi, professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford, told the BBC's Today programme. On Friday, President Bolsonaro authorised the military to help tackle the blazes. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Brazil says 44,000 soldiers have been deployed to combat the fires and environmental crimes in the Amazon, and military operations are under way in seven states as the result of requests for assistance from local governments. Jorgimar Alberto, from Roraima, one of the states most affected by the fires, has seen the burning of most of the land surrounding his wooden house. Jorgimar Alberto ""It's a risky situation, we have lots of crops here and everything is burning, such as the cashew trees,"" he told the BBC. ""I even had to keep the animals [inside] so that they don't burn as well. Every year it is the same, these fires are disturbing the region a lot."" Environmental officials helped him extinguish the fires last week only for them to reignite, he said. His wife could not stand staying in the house with the smell of burning and the threat getting ever closer, so she left. Lumberyard owner Edson Oliveira from southern Amazonas said he did not believe the media coverage about the Amazon. ""In my opinion, the parts that are burning are the same that burn every year,"" he told the BBC. Asked what he would like politicians to do for the Amazon, he said that he would like ""economic alternatives for people here, to find a way we can make use of the natural wealth we have here"". ""It's no use pointing the finger at what's wrong without bringing alternatives to people,"" he said. The $22m was announced on Monday as the leaders of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - met in Biarritz, France. Mr Macron said the funds would be made available immediately - primarily to pay for more firefighting planes - and that France would also ""offer concrete support with military in the region"". This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land Greenpeace France described the G7's response to the crisis as ""inadequate given the urgency and magnitude of this environmental disaster"". As international concern over the fires spread, Hollywoodactor Leonardo DiCaprio pledged $5m towards helping the rainforest. He has long maintained that European countries are trying to gain access to Brazil's natural resources. He alleges that European interest in the welfare of the Amazon is a thin guise for attempts to gain a foothold in the region. Asked by international journalists about environmental protection of the Amazon at a press briefing on 6 July, he said: ""Brazil is like a virgin that every pervert from the outside lusts for."" This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010. Amazon fires: How bad have they got?

"Killers 'follow pattern' in domestic abuse casesMen who kill their partners follow a timeline that could be tracked by police, a new study suggests.UK","Men who kill their partners follow a ""homicide timeline"" that could be tracked by police to help prevent deaths, new research suggests. Criminology expert Dr Jane Monckton Smith found an eight-stage pattern in 372 killings in the UK. The University of Gloucestershire lecturer said controlling behaviour could be a key indicator of someone's potential to kill their partner. One murder victim's father said the findings could help to ""save lives"". About 30,000 women across the world werekilled by current or former partners in 2017. Dr Monckton Smith said women account for more than 80% of victims killed by their partners - and most of the time, the partner is male. To conduct her study, she looked at all cases on theCounting Dead Women,externalwebsite where the woman had had a relationship with the perpetrator - as well as several extra cases such as those of male victims killed by their male partners. The eight steps she discovered in almost all of the 372 killings she studied were: A pre-relationshiphistoryof stalking or abuse by the perpetrator The romancedeveloping quicklyinto a serious relationship The relationship becoming dominated bycoercive control Atriggerto threaten the perpetrator's control - for example, the relationship ends or the perpetrator gets into financial difficulty Escalation- an increase in the intensity or frequency of the partner's control tactics, such as by stalking or threatening suicide The perpetrator has achange in thinking- choosing to move on, either through revenge or by homicide Planning- the perpetrator might buy weapons or seek opportunities to get the victim alone Homicide- the perpetrator kills his or her partner, and possibly hurts others such as the victim's children The only instance where a stage in the model was not followed was when men did not meet stage one - but this was normally because they had not had a relationship before, she said. ""We've been relying on the 'crime of passion, spontaneous red-mist' explanation [of killing] forever - and it's just not true,"" Dr Monckton Smith told the BBC. ""If you start looking at all these cases, there's planning, determination, there's always coercive control."" Alice Ruggles was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2016 Alice Ruggles, 24, had been stalked by her ex-boyfriend, soldier Trimaan Dhillon, after their intense relationship ended. Dhillonkilled Miss Ruggles after breaking into her Gateshead flatin October 2016. Her father, Clive Ruggles, said the outcome of the case ""absolutely"" could have been different if police had known about Dr Monckton Smith's eight-stage model. ""He had a history of stalking and controlling - the warning signs were there,"" Mr Ruggles said. A domestic homicide review concluded Army officials hadfailed to record a previous domestic assault chargeagainst Dhillon in Kent. ""That information wasn't known to police, Alice had no idea - we had no idea,"" Mr Ruggles said. When Dhillon began stalking Miss Ruggles, she and her family ""did not realise how much danger she was in"", Mr Ruggles said. ""If [police] had looked at Jane's stages, they'd have realised - the constant messages, the emotional blackmail, all of that sort of thing - it was quite clear that he was already onto stage five,"" he added. ""We really believe that if this model gets out there and people start acting on it, then it will improve things for people and very likely save lives."" Dr Monckton Smith said she believes her homicide timeline model can prevent killings Dr Monckton Smith has taught her model to lawyers, psychologists, police forces across the country and probation officers. She hopes that now the studyhas been published,externalin the Violence Against Women Journal, the model can be rolled out more widely. ""As soon as they see it, victims and professionals are able to say, 'Oh my God, I've got a case at stage three', or 'My relationship is at stage five',"" she said. ""Police have been incredibly receptive, and recognise the steps in cases they are working on, because it speaks to their experience and makes an order out of the chaos that is domestic abuse, coercive control and stalking,"" she added. Dr Monckton Smith said once police learn the eight stages, they will be able to keep track of certain potential perpetrators - while victims will more easily be able to articulate to professionals what situation they are in. She also said there should be more research into ways in which victims can leave controlling relationships safely, and into what causes people to seek control in intimate relationships. The charity Women's Aid said improving understanding of domestic homicides could help save lives. Head of communications Teresa Parker said: ""We know that controlling and coercive behaviour underpins the vast majority of domestic homicides, and this important study shows why it is vital that we take non-physical abuse as seriously as physical abuse when considering a woman's safety. She added: ""A greater understanding will also reduce misleading and damaging headlines which cite jealousy, an affair or heartbreak as the reasons why women are killed by a current or former partner.""

'Stop misleading special offers' supermarkets told,"Supermarkets are still offering misleading special offers and discounts despite rules designed to stop this, according to Which? The consumer group found ""dubious"" deals that were worse than they first appeared at most major UK chains. These included multi-buys that cost more despite the alleged offer, and special offers in which goods are sold at the special price most of the year. Supermarkets were trying to cut costs for shoppers, a retailers' group said. Which? looked at pricing data from May 2018 to June 2019 for 459 products. These spanned seven of the UK's biggest supermarkets: Asda, Iceland, Morrisons, Ocado, Sainsbury's, Tesco and Waitrose. Tesco raises prices on 1,000 products Reality Check: Do UK supermarkets vary prices by area? Among the ""dodgy"" deals it came across was an Iceland multi-buy, where customers were offered two packets of Kellogg's Crunchy Nut cornflakes for Â£4, or Â£2 each. While this appeared to offer a saving, Which? found that the price was just Â£1.49 per packet a week earlier - 51p less per item. It also found a promotion at Asda for Wall's Carte D'Or Strawberry Ice Cream (1L) that read, ""was Â£3.50 now Â£2"". However, Which? said the product retailed at Â£2 for around eight months of the year, with the special offer only lasting about a third of that time. A previous Which? investigation into misleading pricing in 2015,externalled the government to roll out new guidance to ensure retailers' pricing practices complied with consumer law. The rules state that retailers must ensure the information they present to consumers is fair and does not waste time or cause annoyance, disappointment or regret. Neither should it cause a consumer to overspend or buy a product that is inappropriate for them. But Natalie Hitchins, head of home products and services at Which?, said: ""Four years on... many of the big supermarkets are clearly still in the wrong, with numerous examples of dodgy discounts and never-ending offers. ""These retailers must stop tricking shoppers with deceptive deals... if not, the CMA must intervene to ensure that pricing guidelines are followed."" She said that the magazine would report its latest findings to the Consumer and Markets Authority (CMA). Iceland said it would review its promotional calendar following Which?'s findings, but Asda rejected claims its offers were misleading. The other supermarkets did not respond to requests for comment. Meanwhile, industry body the British Retail Consortium said: ""Supermarkets seek to provide the best value for consumers on the hundreds of thousands of product lines they sell. ""This is often through promotions and discounts, which can change week to week, even on the same product lines, as retailers seek to cut the cost for shoppers.""

Home Office's 'misleading' Brexit ad bannedAdvertising watchdog bans government advert telling EU citizens how to stay in the UK after Brexit.UK,"A government advert telling EU citizens what they need to do to stay in the UK after Brexit has been banned. In a Home Office radio advert aired in April, listeners were told: ""All you need to apply is your passport or ID card and to complete an online form"". But the Advertising Standards Authority ruled the claim was misleading, as many applicants were required to submit further documents not stated in the ad. The Home Office said: ""We completely disagree with ASA's decision."" The Home Office advert was promoting the government'sEU Settlement Scheme,,externalwhich allows EU citizens and their families to apply to live and work in the UK after freedom of movement ends. Applicants must prove their identity, show that they live in the UK and declare any criminal convictions. What is the EU Settlement Scheme? UK 'risks another Windrush' over EU citizens Brexit: How would no deal affect UK citizens in the EU? In its ruling, advertising watchdog the ASA ruled that the proportion of people asked to submit further documents was higher than what the audience was likely to believe from listening to the ad. ""Listeners would likely understand that an official application process of this nature would always require some applicants to provide further information in exceptional cases,"" the ASA said. ""However, we understood that in 27% of decided adult cases, applicants had been asked to provide documents as evidence of residence. ""Furthermore, some applicants were also asked for other documents, such as evidence of a family relationship."" It added: ""In that context, we considered that the ad did not make sufficiently clear that, in some cases, applicants would need to supply documents beyond their passport or ID card."" In response to the complaint, the Home Office insisted the advert was part of a wider campaign promoting awareness of the EU Settlement Scheme. The Home Office said its website page about the scheme had seen more than five million page views It told the ASA it was not possible to include all aspects of the application process in a short ad, and listeners were directed to the scheme's website where there was more detailed information. It argued that - regardless of the application outcome - in 73% of cases people did not have to submit any more documents as evidence of their residence. The ASA rejected the government's defence and ruled the advert must not be broadcast again in the same format. It also told the Home Office that, in future, adverts must make clear that applicants may need to provide additional documents. Responding to the ruling, the Home Office told the BBC: ""The campaign was factual and complied with all necessary clearance processes for radio advertising. ""The campaign has had a positive impact and encouraged more than one million successful applications so far."" There are an estimated 3.3 million EU citizens living in the UK - meaning more than two million people have either not registered for the scheme or not been successful. The Home Office says it spent Â£3.75m on a marketing campaign to encourage EU citizens to apply early for the EU Settlement Scheme. In May,MPs warned that government risked another Windrush scandal if ""serious concerns"" about the scheme were not addressed. The Commons Home Affairs Committee said the scheme had been ""blighted"" by technical issues and some people were struggling to navigate the online application system. The scheme has been open to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens since March of this year, with applications currently having to be made by 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves without a deal, and 30 June 2021 if it leaves with a deal. Anyone granted settled status will be entitled to the same work, healthcare, housing and education rights after Britain leaves the EU as they do now.

Global trade in baby elephants for zoos bannedThe international wildlife regulator bans the capture and export of baby African elephants.,"A near-total ban on taking baby African elephants from the wild and selling them to zoos has been approved at a meeting in Geneva. Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) decided to tighten the rules after days of debate. The European Union decided to back the ban late in the day, despite concerns, and the move passed by 87 votes to 29. But Zimbabwe, the main exporter, voted against, as did the United States. Zimbabwe and Botswana, which have healthier elephant populations than other African nations, have been permitted to export elephants to ""appropriate and acceptable"" destinations. Under that rule, the country has captured and exported more than 100 baby elephants to Chinese zoos since 2012, Humane Society International says. Tuesday's decision significantly strengthens the restrictions on the elephant trade. A baby elephant being washed and fed in Nairobi, Kenya, in January Now elephants can only be taken from the wild and placed in ""captive facilities"" elsewhere in the world under exceptional circumstances - and subject to approval by a committee of Cites members. The ban was approved by committee last week, but it was far from certain to pass a new vote at the end of the two-week conference. Zimbabwe had campaigned fiercely against the move, and the EU had initially opposed it because of concerns over genetic variation in zoos around the world. Sharks and rays to be given new protections Botswana lifts ban on elephant hunting Poacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lions But the EU changed its vote after some amendments were made to allow trade in exceptional circumstances, and once it was made clear that elephants already in zoos could be transferred between them. ""It doesn't mean that no elephant will ever be taken from the wild and put into a captive facility overseas,"" said Will Travers, president of the Born Free Foundation. ""But it's going to tighten it up so much that mass shipments of elephants to zoos in the Far East, for example, simply won't happen."" Humane Society International said it was ""celebrating a momentous win"". ""Despite compromise language being introduced by the EU, we are relieved by its passing,"" said Audrey Delsink, the group's Africa wildlife director. She said the highly sociable animals found separations ""incredibly traumatising"". ""Speaking personally as an elephant field biologist, I am jubilant that we have secured this victory for all the elephants who will now be spared the ordeal of being ripped away from their families."" Some African nations had pushed for a re-opening of the ivory trade during the convention, arguing that existing stocks - confiscated from poachers or left over from already-dead animals - were worth vast sums of money that could be used for conservation.

""Furthermore, some applicants were also asked for other documents, such as evidence of a family relationship."" It added: ""In that context, we considered that the ad did not make sufficiently clear that, in some cases, applicants would need to supply documents beyond their passport or ID card."" In response to the complaint, the Home Office insisted the advert was part of a wider campaign promoting awareness of the EU Settlement Scheme. The Home Office said its website page about the scheme had seen more than five million page views It told the ASA it was not possible to include all aspects of the application process in a short ad, and listeners were directed to the scheme's website where there was more detailed information. It argued that - regardless of the application outcome - in 73% of cases people did not have to submit any more documents as evidence of their residence. The ASA rejected the government's defence and ruled the advert must not be broadcast again in the same format. It also told the Home Office that, in future, adverts must make clear that applicants may need to provide additional documents. Responding to the ruling, the Home Office told the BBC: ""The campaign was factual and complied with all necessary clearance processes for radio advertising. ""The campaign has had a positive impact and encouraged more than one million successful applications so far."" There are an estimated 3.3 million EU citizens living in the UK - meaning more than two million people have either not registered for the scheme or not been successful. The Home Office says it spent Â£3.75m on a marketing campaign to encourage EU citizens to apply early for the EU Settlement Scheme. In May,MPs warned that government risked another Windrush scandal if ""serious concerns"" about the scheme were not addressed. The Commons Home Affairs Committee said the scheme had been ""blighted"" by technical issues and some people were struggling to navigate the online application system. The scheme has been open to EU, EEA and Swiss citizens since March of this year, with applications currently having to be made by 31 December 2020 if the UK leaves without a deal, and 30 June 2021 if it leaves with a deal. Anyone granted settled status will be entitled to the same work, healthcare, housing and education rights after Britain leaves the EU as they do now.

Killers 'follow pattern' in domestic abuse cases,"Men who kill their partners follow a ""homicide timeline"" that could be tracked by police to help prevent deaths, new research suggests. Criminology expert Dr Jane Monckton Smith found an eight-stage pattern in 372 killings in the UK. The University of Gloucestershire lecturer said controlling behaviour could be a key indicator of someone's potential to kill their partner. One murder victim's father said the findings could help to ""save lives"". About 30,000 women across the world werekilled by current or former partners in 2017. Dr Monckton Smith said women account for more than 80% of victims killed by their partners - and most of the time, the partner is male. To conduct her study, she looked at all cases on theCounting Dead Women,externalwebsite where the woman had had a relationship with the perpetrator - as well as several extra cases such as those of male victims killed by their male partners. The eight steps she discovered in almost all of the 372 killings she studied were: A pre-relationshiphistoryof stalking or abuse by the perpetrator The romancedeveloping quicklyinto a serious relationship The relationship becoming dominated bycoercive control Atriggerto threaten the perpetrator's control - for example, the relationship ends or the perpetrator gets into financial difficulty Escalation- an increase in the intensity or frequency of the partner's control tactics, such as by stalking or threatening suicide The perpetrator has achange in thinking- choosing to move on, either through revenge or by homicide Planning- the perpetrator might buy weapons or seek opportunities to get the victim alone Homicide- the perpetrator kills his or her partner, and possibly hurts others such as the victim's children The only instance where a stage in the model was not followed was when men did not meet stage one - but this was normally because they had not had a relationship before, she said. ""We've been relying on the 'crime of passion, spontaneous red-mist' explanation [of killing] forever - and it's just not true,"" Dr Monckton Smith told the BBC. ""If you start looking at all these cases, there's planning, determination, there's always coercive control."" Alice Ruggles was murdered by her ex-boyfriend in 2016 Alice Ruggles, 24, had been stalked by her ex-boyfriend, soldier Trimaan Dhillon, after their intense relationship ended. Dhillonkilled Miss Ruggles after breaking into her Gateshead flatin October 2016. Her father, Clive Ruggles, said the outcome of the case ""absolutely"" could have been different if police had known about Dr Monckton Smith's eight-stage model. ""He had a history of stalking and controlling - the warning signs were there,"" Mr Ruggles said. A domestic homicide review concluded Army officials hadfailed to record a previous domestic assault chargeagainst Dhillon in Kent. ""That information wasn't known to police, Alice had no idea - we had no idea,"" Mr Ruggles said. When Dhillon began stalking Miss Ruggles, she and her family ""did not realise how much danger she was in"", Mr Ruggles said. ""If [police] had looked at Jane's stages, they'd have realised - the constant messages, the emotional blackmail, all of that sort of thing - it was quite clear that he was already onto stage five,"" he added. ""We really believe that if this model gets out there and people start acting on it, then it will improve things for people and very likely save lives."" Dr Monckton Smith said she believes her homicide timeline model can prevent killings Dr Monckton Smith has taught her model to lawyers, psychologists, police forces across the country and probation officers. She hopes that now the studyhas been published,externalin the Violence Against Women Journal, the model can be rolled out more widely. ""As soon as they see it, victims and professionals are able to say, 'Oh my God, I've got a case at stage three', or 'My relationship is at stage five',"" she said. ""Police have been incredibly receptive, and recognise the steps in cases they are working on, because it speaks to their experience and makes an order out of the chaos that is domestic abuse, coercive control and stalking,"" she added. Dr Monckton Smith said once police learn the eight stages, they will be able to keep track of certain potential perpetrators - while victims will more easily be able to articulate to professionals what situation they are in. She also said there should be more research into ways in which victims can leave controlling relationships safely, and into what causes people to seek control in intimate relationships. The charity Women's Aid said improving understanding of domestic homicides could help save lives. Head of communications Teresa Parker said: ""We know that controlling and coercive behaviour underpins the vast majority of domestic homicides, and this important study shows why it is vital that we take non-physical abuse as seriously as physical abuse when considering a woman's safety. She added: ""A greater understanding will also reduce misleading and damaging headlines which cite jealousy, an affair or heartbreak as the reasons why women are killed by a current or former partner.""

'Bolton doesn't deserve this' - where next for club?,"Bolton supporters have seen their side lose 22 of the 28 games they have played since the turn of the year ""It's heartbreaking. It cannot happen to the club and town. It's a devastating prospect."" Bolton Wanderers face two of the most crucial weeks in their 145-year history after they were given a 12 September deadline by the English Football League to complete a sale or prove they have the funds to finish the season. A takeover of the club by Football Ventures collapsed at the weekend, plunging their immediate future into doubt. But how did one of the founder members of the Football League, who reached the last 16 of the Uefa Cup only 11 years ago, reach this point and where do they go now? BBC Sport looks at what is next for this historic club as it faces the threat of extinction. Bolton given 14-day expulsion deadline Bury expelled from English Football League Monday's administrators' statement said that the deal to sell the club collapsed after all parties involved agreed terms to complete the sale, other than former owner Ken Anderson. The news left those at the club stunned, with the administrators suggesting 150 jobs could be lost if they went under. ""We are very worried at the prospect of the club being liquidated and we urge all parties involved to work together to get a deal to save us sorted,"" an unnamed staff source told the BBC. ""We are a founder member of the Football League and have a long and proud history in English football. ""For Bolton Wanderers to no longer exist is unthinkable."" Bolton Wanderers: Joy and despair after Wanderers got back on home soil Much of the summer has been a stalemate as the protracted takeover showed no sign of getting over the line, leaving the club's fan base hoping a last-minute deal could be done to get the takeover back on track. ""Please, please save this club. You've got so much on the line here. You've got several generations and the whole Bolton community just pleading for you to get this deal done,"" Will Jones, of fan blog Lion of Vienna Suite, told BBC Radio Manchester. ""You've got the elderly generation who've been watching for 70-80 years and it might be the last thing they have left. ""For the parents who have got to tell their youngsters that they are not able to go and watch their club on a Saturday any more, that's just devastating in itself. ""It's absolutely devastating and all I'd say is please do it for the community and the club because it does not deserve this."" Club legend and former striker John McGinlay, who scored 118 times in five years with Wanderers, said ""there's a fear and a worry when it gets to this stage"". McGinlay was the last man to score at Bolton's old ground Burnden Park before their move to the Reebok Stadium in 1997 and finished as top scorer as Bolton bounced straight back to the Premier League. ""It's time to either put your money on the table or walk away because we've been through this for long enough,"" McGinlay told BBC Radio Manchester. ""We've been told the deal is imminent or just about to be signed for so long and it's really frustrating now. ""All of us supporters are now worried and it's coming to the end of the line now. The statements in the past couple of days from the administrators and EFL have really brought things to a head."" Bolton Wanderers' 5-0 loss to Ipswich Town on Saturday was the third match in a row that they had conceded five goals and came in front of a record low attendance at the University of Bolton Stadium ""Generally speaking, most people up and down the country probably think that has been going on for a very short time,"" Maggie Tetlow of Bolton Wanderers Supporters' Trust told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""However, this has been rumbling on since Ken Anderson took charge."" Bolton were relegated from the Premier League in 2012 Four years later their football existence was threatened before former striker Dean Holdsworth waspart of a takeoverat the club Andersontook controlafter Holdsworth's company Sports Shield were wound up Wanderersentered administration in Mayafter being relegated from the Championship, before Football Ventures agreed a deal to take over the club The deal was almost stopped after Laurence Bassini, who had bid to buy the club before administration, was awarded a court order blocking the sale on 8 August The court order was adjourned paving the way for the takeover to continue before it eventually collapsed The clubcalled off their match against Doncasterlast week citing welfare concerns having only five senior outfield players available Boss Phil Parkinson resigned on Thursday after three years with the club and a young side lost 5-0 against Ipswich on Saturday ""There's something wrong in British football where these clubs with so much history and local connection are struggling at the same time the Premier League is absolutely booming,"" Bolton North East MP David Crausby told BBC Radio Manchester. ""We've really got to put it right in the interest of the fans, not just for some individual who picks it up to make a profit on it. ""We've got to be absolutely determined to defend this football institution. It can't be allowed to fail and disappear."" Bolton fielded their youngest-ever team in their draw against Coventry earlier this season - with their starting XI having an average age of just 19 On Saturday, the EFL gave Bolton until its board meeting at 17:00 on Tuesday to complete a sale of the club or provide ""credible plans"" they can compete this season. As Bolton could not satisfy the league's requirements by that point, a 14-day notice period was activated for the club to prove it has the funds to survive or face losing its place in the league. Local neighbours Bury, who have had stark financial troubles of their own, were expelled from the Football League on Tuesday after failing to sell the club. Wanderers' administrators said on Monday that the club are not in a position to carry on trading and ""the process of closing down"" could start on Wednesday.

Global trade in baby elephants for zoos bannedThe international wildlife regulator bans the capture and export of baby African elephants.Africa,"A near-total ban on taking baby African elephants from the wild and selling them to zoos has been approved at a meeting in Geneva. Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) decided to tighten the rules after days of debate. The European Union decided to back the ban late in the day, despite concerns, and the move passed by 87 votes to 29. But Zimbabwe, the main exporter, voted against, as did the United States. Zimbabwe and Botswana, which have healthier elephant populations than other African nations, have been permitted to export elephants to ""appropriate and acceptable"" destinations. Under that rule, the country has captured and exported more than 100 baby elephants to Chinese zoos since 2012, Humane Society International says. Tuesday's decision significantly strengthens the restrictions on the elephant trade. A baby elephant being washed and fed in Nairobi, Kenya, in January Now elephants can only be taken from the wild and placed in ""captive facilities"" elsewhere in the world under exceptional circumstances - and subject to approval by a committee of Cites members. The ban was approved by committee last week, but it was far from certain to pass a new vote at the end of the two-week conference. Zimbabwe had campaigned fiercely against the move, and the EU had initially opposed it because of concerns over genetic variation in zoos around the world. Sharks and rays to be given new protections Botswana lifts ban on elephant hunting Poacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lions But the EU changed its vote after some amendments were made to allow trade in exceptional circumstances, and once it was made clear that elephants already in zoos could be transferred between them. ""It doesn't mean that no elephant will ever be taken from the wild and put into a captive facility overseas,"" said Will Travers, president of the Born Free Foundation. ""But it's going to tighten it up so much that mass shipments of elephants to zoos in the Far East, for example, simply won't happen."" Humane Society International said it was ""celebrating a momentous win"". ""Despite compromise language being introduced by the EU, we are relieved by its passing,"" said Audrey Delsink, the group's Africa wildlife director. She said the highly sociable animals found separations ""incredibly traumatising"". ""Speaking personally as an elephant field biologist, I am jubilant that we have secured this victory for all the elephants who will now be spared the ordeal of being ripped away from their families."" Some African nations had pushed for a re-opening of the ivory trade during the convention, arguing that existing stocks - confiscated from poachers or left over from already-dead animals - were worth vast sums of money that could be used for conservation.

Bury expelled by English Football League,"Bury fans have stepped up protests at Gigg Lane since last week Bury have been expelled by the English Football League after a takeover bid from C&N Sporting Risk collapsed. The League One club had been given until 17:00 BST on Tuesday to complete the deal, having been granted an extension to Friday's initial deadline. Bury are the first team to drop out of the EFL since Maidstone's liquidation in 1992. League One will comprise 23 clubs for the rest of the season, with only three teams to be relegated. ""When the news broke at Gigg Lane, fans instantly let out a huge cry - for help, of disbelief,"" said BBC Radio Manchester's Mike Minay. ""Fans walked away in instant tears, some crouching down to the floor."" EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans said it was ""one of the darkest days"" in the league's history, and added: ""I understand this will be a deeply upsetting and devastating time for Bury's players, staff, supporters and the wider community. ""There is no doubt today's news will be felt across the entire football family."" Financial issues 'insurmountable' - C&N Sporting Risk 'It cuts deep, all we want is to watch our team on a Saturday' How Bury went from promotion to expulsion Bolton Wanderers, also of League One,have been given 14 days to avoid being expelled themselves,with their prospective takeover by Football Ventures (Whites) Limited still yet to go through. In a statement on Monday, the club's administrators warned they were on the brink of liquidation, saying if they were unable to resurrect the move the club was ""not in a position to carry on trading"". However they said on Tuesday they would ""continue to work through the night"" to complete a deal, adding there would be another update ""as soon as possible"". The EFL had suspended each of Bury's first six fixtures this season, requesting evidence the Shakers could pay off creditors and had the funding to make it through the campaign. In a statement at 23:05 BST on Tuesday, the league said it decided ""after a long and detailed discussion"" to withdraw Bury's EFL membership ""with enormous regret"". ""No-one wanted to be in this position but following repeated missed deadlines, the suspension of five league fixtures, in addition to not receiving the evidence we required in regard to financial commitments and a possible takeover not materialising; the EFL board has been forced to take the most difficult of decisions,"" Jevans said. Bury were initially given until 23:59 BST on Friday to either provide the required information or find a buyer to take them over. With the third-tier side effectively an hour from being thrown out of the EFL, owner Steve Dale told BBC Radio Manchester he had sold the club and they were set to survive. That news subsequently secured them an extension until Tuesday to complete the deal, but C&N Sporting Risk quickly expressed concern it was still not enough time. An estimated 300 volunteers turned up at the club's Gigg Lane home on Tuesday to help get the ground ready for Saturday's scheduled game against Doncaster Rovers, but their efforts were in vain. Reacting to news of the Shakers' expulsion, Bury North MP James Frith was critical of the EFL and claimed there was a lack of consistency in how it has treated the situations at Bury and Bolton - allowing Bolton to play games but not Bury, for example. ""I'm angry. My head is in my hands. I feel Bury is the victimâ¦ and those left to pick up the pieces are the town and the community. Yes we will rise again and keep the faith but we shouldn't be at this point,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""We have to make this a moment in time for lower league football. We are just the latest victim of this. I have had clubs speak to me who are a default payment on a mortgage away from this."" Bury supporters cleaned the stadium in the hope that their game on Saturday would go ahead Founded in 1885 and first elected to the EFL nine years later, Bury were playing in what is now known as the Championship as recently as 1999 and have twice won the FA Cup. No club has ever dropped out of the third tier before, and the Shakers also become the first FA Cup winners to have been expelled by the EFL. England women's manager Phil Neville, whose mother Jill resigned as Bury's club secretary last week, described their demise as an ""absolute disgrace"" on Friday. Supporters staged numerous protests in the build-up to the deadline, with former director Joy Harthandcuffing herself to a drainpipeoutside their ground and a coffin reading 'RIP Bury FC 1885-?' was placed at the directors' entrance. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham also wrote to EFL chief Jevans asking for the club to be granted more time""given the urgency of Bury's plight"".,external At the end of April, Bury were celebrating promotion back to the third tier of English football, but they were already enduring a torrid time off the pitch. The club was already in financial trouble when Dale bought it for Â£1 in December from previous owner Stewart Day, with players and staff often being paid late. A winding-up petition filed against the club was adjourned three times before eventually being dismissed by the High Court on 31 July. By then, creditors had approved a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) put forward by Dale, which was proposed to help settle some of their debts. The CVA meant unsecured creditors, including HM Revenue & Customs, would be paid 25% of the money owed - but also triggered a 12-point deduction in the League One table under EFL rules. Furthermore, the EFL were unsatisfied Bury had given enough evidence of their financial viability, leading to a string of postponed fixtures while the organisation awaited ""the clarity required"". On 9 August, the Shakers were given a 14-day deadline to provide the necessary information or face expulsion. That deadline expired at 23:59 BST on Friday. Emotions were running high as fans volunteered inside the stadium before being asked to leave The EFL had already outlined how it intended to balance the leagues if Bury were expelled: The current League One season would be completed with 23 teams, with the number of relegation places reduced to three. Four teams will still be promoted from League Two this season, ensuring League One is rebalanced in 2020-21. Only one team will be relegated from League Two, with two to be promoted from the National League as usual. It is not yet certain what will happen to Bury Football Club, its staff and players or the stadium. Paul Wilkinson was appointed manager on 2 July, but has not taken charge of a game. Before Saturday's announcement, the EFL said if the Shakers were expelled the club would ""be free to make an application to the Football Association to rejoin league competition further down the English football pyramid from season 2020-21"".

Has EU budged over Brexit deal?,"So many newspaper column inches have been devoted over the last week to a debate over whether or not Boris Johnson has managed to ""win a victory"" over his EU counterparts, getting them to ""budge"" over changing the Withdrawal Agreement. You can in fact argue this both ways. The ""Yes-they've-budged"" camp point to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron now saying they will consider any new proposals from the UK on replacing the contentious Irish border backstop (if they are realistic and immediately operable). This is a marked change from the EU's official position when Boris Johnson became UK Prime Minister: that the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement (containing the backstop) was signed, sealed and carved in stone. What is a no-deal Brexit? Tusk and Johnson clash over who is 'Mr No Deal' The ""No-the-EU-hasn't-really-budged"" camp say EU leaders don't believe Boris Johnson has any realistic alternatives to the backstop up his sleeve, so they are trying to take the initiative in the blame game that would inevitably follow a no-deal Brexit by wanting to appear open. The aim being that Angela Merkel, for example, could turn to German businesses that would lose out in a no-deal scenario and say: ""Look, I tried my best. It's Boris Johnson who failed you."" EU figures who've been involved in Brexit negotiations are also keen to point out that being open to alternatives to the Irish backstop is not a change of position for Brussels. It's written into the existing Withdrawal Agreement. This video can not be played Donald Tusk at the G7: I hope Boris Johnson will not want to go down in history as Mr No Deal And as for Angela Merkel's positive words to Boris Johnson about finding new solutions, the German media was quick to underline how often she has repeated over the last  few years that she would work ""until the last minute to make a deal with the UK,"" as long as EU single market rules were respected. Her attitude - in public at least - is unchanged. Behind the scenes though, EU leaders have been readjusting their view of Boris Johnson somewhat. During this summer's Conservative party leadership contest to replace Theresa May as prime minister, I heard Boris Johnson described in private conversations in EU circles as ""a buffoon"" and ""a reckless populist willing to drive his country over the cliff-edge of a no-deal Brexit to satisfy his ambition to become prime minister"". I now notice a subtle tone change. In his one-to-one chats in Paris, Berlin and at the G7 with European Council President Donald Tusk, the prime minister has managed to persuade Brussels that: a) He is serious in his threat to pursue a no-deal Brexit if no agreement with the EU can be found; and b) He would actively prefer to get a deal through parliament if possible. But this change in perception does not alter facts on the ground. EU leaders still think a no-deal Brexit is the most likely option right now. This video can not be played What is the customs union? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Time is running out - unless the prime minister were to do a last-minute U-turn and request a new Brexit extension after all. EU politicians also speak of the numbers not adding up in parliament for Boris Johnson. A reason they give for not being willing to jump forward with a backstop compromise. ""There is little-to-no pressure from the rest of us in the EU on Dublin right now to find and accept a backstop compromise,"" one high-level EU diplomat told me. ""If we did introduce a time limit - or even if we got rid of the backstop altogether from the Withdrawal Agreement, as Boris Johnson says he wants us to do - what would be the point? The prime minister doesn't have the majority in parliament to guarantee the Brexit deal would then go through and we, the EU, would have sacrificed our principles, our reputation, exposed our single market on the island of Ireland and thrown member state Dublin under a bus voluntarily. We'd be worse off than if we just accept a no-deal Brexit is going to happen."" Backstop: Why is the Irish border hindering Brexit? What could happen to food prices after Brexit? Boris Johnson's majority of one in parliament means EU leaders understand his focus is now domestic: shoring up his premiership by winning a general election, rather than agreeing a compromise deal with the EU. Few in the EU are holding their breath that MPs will succeed in stopping a no-deal Brexit in the coming weeks - though if they did, Brussels would be delighted. I notice rather that a number of European politicians are placing any hopes they have on Boris Johnson to avoid no deal. They speak of the prime minister's ambition to remain in the job and to go down in the history books in a positive way. One European official remarked: ""Johnson can see a no-deal Brexit is bad for his country but we're afraid he's boxed himself in with all his threats and promises at home."" EU leaders will now watch and wait for what early autumn brings in UK politics. The next scene in this Brexit drama will play out in Westminster, not Brussels.

What is the UK doing to get ready for a no-deal Brexit?,"The government has released an assessment of the possible effects of a no-deal Brexit on the UK, after MPs demanded that it be made public. The document, marked as ""Official Sensitive"" and dated 2 August 2019,outlines a series of ""reasonable worst-case planning assumptions"". It was drawn up as part of ""Operation Yellowhammer"" - the name for the government's contingency plan to prepare for leaving the European Union (EU) without a deal. The government says it is spending an extra Â£2.1bn on no-deal planning and is updating these planning assumptions. So, what does the document say and what is being done - as far as we know - to prepare for no-deal? What Yellowhammer document says: Between 50-85% of UK lorries travelling to the EU may not be ready for French customs Lack of readiness and limited space in French ports could cut HGV traffic by 40-60% and lead to disruption lasting three months This would lead to significant queues in Kent. In a worst-case scenario, it could take lorries up to two-and-a-half days before being able to cross into France What's being done: To ensure more lorries are ready for customs, the government announced last month that88,000 companies would be automatically enrolled in a new customs system. The Port of Dover in Kent handles approximately 10,500 lorries a day. To prevent nearby roads from clogging up, the government has a traffic management plan codenamed Operation Brock. If the plan is activated, up to 2,000 lorries will be held in a queue leading to the port. Other traffic will be kept flowing around the queued-up lorries, in what is known as a contraflow system. A fallback option would be to divert lorries to the disused Manston airfield, near Ramsgate - and use it to hold up to 6,000 lorries on the runway at any one time. If further capacity was still required, a ""last resort"" would be to turn the 10-mile  M26 motorway into a temporary lorry park. But there is a still a lot of confusion, according to Rona Hunnisett, from the Freight Transport Association. ""The report shows there's still significant detail to be clarified if Britain is to keep trading efficiently,"" she says. ""Businesses can only prepare for, and implement, new processes once, and still need confirmation of what they are to adopt in the way of new practices."" What Yellowhammer document says: Certain types of fresh food supply will decrease Key ingredients may be in shorter supply There will not be an overall shortage of food in the UK, but may be reduced availability and choice Prices may increase ""which could impact vulnerable groups"" What's being done: The government has said that it will continue to recognise EU standards for food being imported into the UK, to minimise disruption. The British Retail Consortium has said,externalretailers are doing all they can to prepare for no-deal, but will not be able to prevent all negative effects. It stresses that many fresh fruits and vegetables will be out of season in the UK and that there will be a shortage of warehouse space ahead of Christmas. ""No deal Brexit would be extremely disruptive to the supply chains that we operate, particularly the fresh food supply chains,"" Mike Coupe, chief executive of Sainsbury's told BBC News. ""There will inevitably be disruption simply because we've never done this before,"" he added, although he also said that previous delays to the Brexit date mean ""there's probably more understanding of what could go wrong and therefore more contingency planning"". Another factor is what tariffs (the taxes on imports) will be charged on food coming into the UK. The governmentpublished a ""tariff schedule"",externalin March, which removed most tariffs on imports in the event of a no-deal Brexit That means some food from outside the EU that currently attract a tariff could be cheaper, but some goods from the EU that are currently imported with 0% tariffs, like beef and dairy, will now carry tariffs, and so could become more expensive. What Yellowhammer document says: Supply chains for medicines and medical products are ""particularly vulnerable"" to disruption at the Channel ports While some products can be stockpiled, others cannot because they have a short shelf life It will not be practical to stockpile products to cover expected delays of up to six months An increase in inflation would ""significantly impact"" adult social care providers and may lead to some failing, with smaller providers impacted within two-three months. What's being done: At the end of June, the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) started putting out contracts for freight, warehouse space and fridges. These will be used to stockpile medicines and fly in those which cannot be stored, like radioisotopes for cancer treatment. Of the Â£2.1bn pledged for no-deal preparations, Â£434m has been set aside for this. That includes a Â£25m contract for planes to bring in emergency medical supplies within 24 hours. Ahead of the UK's original departure date of 29 March - then extended to 12 April - the DHSC said thousands of medicines had been analysed to work out what might be affected by supply disruption from the EU. Suppliers stockpiled an additional six weeks' worth of these drugs over and above the usual ""buffer"" stock. This exercise is being repeated to ensure the department is ""as prepared for leaving the EU without a deal in October as it was on 29 March and 12 April"". Specific ferry routes were made available for suppliers to book onto 11 weeks before the no-deal deadline in March. Six weeks before the 31 October deadline, the government had only just opened the bidding process to freight firms competing to transport medicines. So the pharmaceutical industry doesn't currently know which ports and ferry routes will be made available. Steve Bates, an industry official working with government on no-deal planning, said the time frame to make sure everything was in place for the October deadline was ""significantly compressed"". He said the difference for drug suppliers between three months and potentially three weeks to put plans into action was ""material"". On social care, the government website advises providers to draw up contingency plans and support EU staff who may be working for them. Plans are in place to ensure there are enough essential medicines like insulin What Yellowhammer document says: There will be no immediate disruption to electricity or gas supplies However, there are likely to be significant price rises if the UK splits from the EU single energy market, which could happen months or years after Brexit This could lead to some energy companies leaving the market Public water supplies are likely to remain largely unaffected What's being done: In the event of no-deal, the UK has said it will not impose tariffs on electricity and gas coming into the country. However, if the value of the pound falls in response to a no-deal Brexit, it will become more expensive to import energy from abroad. The government intends to remain part of the single energy market, in order for the UK's energy laws to continue to work after Brexit and that supplies are not disrupted. Water is unlikely to be affected, although there is still a low risk in the event of a chemical supply problem. The Yellowhammer report says water companies are well-prepared and have significant stockpiles of critical chemicals. What Yellowhammer document says: The government's planned short-term solution for the border is likely to be unsustainable because of the ""economic, legal and biosecurity risks"" it presents Trade between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic will be ""severely disrupted"" Some businesses will stop trading, some will move and some will experience higher costs that they may pass on to customers Agriculture will be hardest hit, leading to job losses, protests and direct action with road blockages Growth of the ""illegitimate economy"" around the border ""where criminal and dissident groups already operate"" What's being done: The UK government has said it is committed not to have any physical infrastructure at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. On 13 Marchit published its contingency plan,externalto avoid a hard border in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It said it would not bring in new checks or controls, or require customs declarations for any goods moving from Ireland to Northern Ireland, in the event of no-deal. But this will only be a temporary measure while negotiations take place to find longer-term solutions. Government has no plans for Irish border controls To protect people's health, some plant and animal products that come into Northern Ireland from outside the EU, via Ireland, will still need to be checked. The UK government has said these checks will not happen at the border itself, but it has not specified exactly where they will take place. It remains unclear what will happen to goods travelling from Northern Ireland to Ireland. Under EU rules, checks would normally be required at the point certain goods enter the EU single market. The Irish government says it is securing additional space, and has recruited more customs and agriculture staff to allow for a ""significant increase in checks and procedures"". What Yellowhammer document says: Protests and counter-protests likely across the UK May be a rise in public disorder and community tensions Information-sharing between UK and EU law enforcement will be disrupted What is being done: The National Police Coordination Centre will plan the allocation of officers across the country althoughit has said there has been no intelligence,externalto suggest that any protests will not be peaceful. The government has also established the International Crime and Coordination Centre, which is supposed to help the police cope with the change to the UK's relationship with law enforcement agencies in the EU. 10 ways you could be affected by no deal Most imports tariff-free under no-deal plan What could happen to food prices after Brexit?

Bury face expulsion as takeover collapses,"Bury, founded in 1885, have twice won the FA Cup Bury are facing expulsion from the English Football League after the company attempting to buy the club, C&N Sporting Risk, said it was unable to proceed with its takeover. The Shakers had been given until 17:00 BST on Tuesday to complete the deal. Chris Farnell, the lawyer working to broker a deal, has said ""alternative bids"" have been put to the EFL and they were now ""awaiting an outcome"". Bury would be the first team to drop out of the EFL since Maidstone in 1992. ""The league announced at the weekend that it was working exclusively with the club and C&N in an attempt to finalise a change of control at the club,"" said the EFL in a statement. ""However, following a period of due diligence, C&N have opted not to progress matters. ""The league continues to be in discussions with Bury FC and will provide a further update as appropriate."" The EFL suspended each of Bury's first six fixtures this season, requesting evidence the League One club could pay off creditors and had the funding to make it through the entire campaign. They were initially given until 23:59 BST on Friday to either provide the required information or find a buyer to take them over. With the third-tier side effectively an hour from being thrown out of the EFL, owner Steve Dale told BBC Radio Manchester he had sold the club and they were set to survive. That news subsequently secured them an extension until Tuesday to complete the deal, although C&N Sporting Risk expressed concern that it was still not enough time. An estimated 300 volunteers turned up at the club's Gigg Lane home on Tuesday to help get the ground ready for Saturday's scheduled game against Doncaster Rovers, but their efforts could prove to be in vain. Bury have since issued a warning on their website asking fans not to enter the stadium ""unless authorised"" at what is a ""difficult and emotional time for all supporters"". Bolton fans set for anxious wait as deadline passes Despite the withdrawal of C&N Sporting Risk's interest, Farnell told BBC Radio 5 live that other bids had been put to the EFL ""as late as in the last hour"" leading up to the deadline. ""From what I understand they appear to be credible and certainly at this stage to attract offers is the main thing that can happen,"" he said. ""I'm also informed that Mr Dale is aware of them as well, so we're awaiting to see the outcome of that. ""Some of the bids actually came in towards the end of last week, while there have been some new bids that have come in today too. They're not simply last-minute, shooting-at-the-moon type bids."" One of the offers is understood to be from MP Ivan Lewis, who has told BBC Radio Manchester that he has presented a plan and shown proof of funds to the EFL. Dale, who confirmed three bids had been passed to the EFL, said he remained hopeful Bury would be given a ""reprieve to help get a deal over the line"". C&N Sporting Risk said it had informed the EFL of its decision not to complete the takeover ""at the earliest possible opportunity"". ""As part of our due diligence, we set ourselves a list of key criteria regarding the CVA, the ground and the overall financial state of the club that had to be met in order for us to be satisfied that we have enough knowledge to proceed with the takeover,"" the company said in a statement. ""The complexities involved in each of these matters escalated and continue to do so. ""Despite previously stating we would have liked an extra 24 hours to conclude the deal, actually our position is not a condition of the strict timeline they have put in place, but reflective of the systemic failings of a football club over a number of years. ""With this in mind, we will be happy to work together with the EFL to share our findings to help them with their ongoing review of football governance, which is essential for the long term future of all members of the EFL and the broader football family."" Bury fans were joined by supporters of rival clubs in a bid to get Gigg Lane ready to host matches again on Tuesday Founded in 1885 and first elected to the EFL nine years later, Bury were playing in what is now known as the Championship as recently as 1999 and have twice won the FA Cup. No club has ever dropped out of the third tier before, and the Shakers will also become the first FA Cup winners to have been expelled by the EFL. England women's manager Phil Neville, whose mother Jill resigned as Bury's club secretary last week, described their demise as an ""absolute disgrace"" on Friday. Supporters staged numerous protests in the build-up to the deadline, with former director Joy Harthandcuffing herself to a drainpipeoutside their Gigg Lane home and a coffin with the words 'RIP Bury FC 1885-?' painted on it was placed at the directors' entrance. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham also wrote to EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans asking for the club to be granted more time""given the urgency of Bury's plight"".,external At the end of April, Bury were celebrating promotion back to the third tier of English football, but were already enduring major issues off the pitch. The club was in financial trouble even before Dale bought it for Â£1 in December from previous owner Stewart Day, with players and staff often being paid late. A winding-up petition filed against the club was adjourned three times before eventually being dismissed by the High Court on 31 July. By then, creditors had approved a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) put forward by Dale, which was proposed to help settle some of their debts. The CVA meant unsecured creditors, including HM Revenue & Customs, would be paid 25% of the money owed - but also triggered a 12-point deduction in the League One table under EFL rules. Furthermore, the EFL were unsatisfied Bury had given enough evidence of their financial viability, leading to a string of postponed fixtures while the organisation awaited ""the clarity required"". C&N Sporting Risk's interest in a takeover was enough for the EFL to extend the original cut-off on Friday - but their withdrawal came less than 90 minutes before Tuesday's latest deadline.

Global trade in baby elephants for zoos banned,"A near-total ban on taking baby African elephants from the wild and selling them to zoos has been approved at a meeting in Geneva. Parties to the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) decided to tighten the rules after days of debate. The European Union decided to back the ban late in the day, despite concerns, and the move passed by 87 votes to 29. But Zimbabwe, the main exporter, voted against, as did the United States. Zimbabwe and Botswana, which have healthier elephant populations than other African nations, have been permitted to export elephants to ""appropriate and acceptable"" destinations. Under that rule, the country has captured and exported more than 100 baby elephants to Chinese zoos since 2012, Humane Society International says. Tuesday's decision significantly strengthens the restrictions on the elephant trade. A baby elephant being washed and fed in Nairobi, Kenya, in January Now elephants can only be taken from the wild and placed in ""captive facilities"" elsewhere in the world under exceptional circumstances - and subject to approval by a committee of Cites members. The ban was approved by committee last week, but it was far from certain to pass a new vote at the end of the two-week conference. Zimbabwe had campaigned fiercely against the move, and the EU had initially opposed it because of concerns over genetic variation in zoos around the world. Sharks and rays to be given new protections Botswana lifts ban on elephant hunting Poacher trampled by elephant, eaten by lions But the EU changed its vote after some amendments were made to allow trade in exceptional circumstances, and once it was made clear that elephants already in zoos could be transferred between them. ""It doesn't mean that no elephant will ever be taken from the wild and put into a captive facility overseas,"" said Will Travers, president of the Born Free Foundation. ""But it's going to tighten it up so much that mass shipments of elephants to zoos in the Far East, for example, simply won't happen."" Humane Society International said it was ""celebrating a momentous win"". ""Despite compromise language being introduced by the EU, we are relieved by its passing,"" said Audrey Delsink, the group's Africa wildlife director. She said the highly sociable animals found separations ""incredibly traumatising"". ""Speaking personally as an elephant field biologist, I am jubilant that we have secured this victory for all the elephants who will now be spared the ordeal of being ripped away from their families."" Some African nations had pushed for a re-opening of the ivory trade during the convention, arguing that existing stocks - confiscated from poachers or left over from already-dead animals - were worth vast sums of money that could be used for conservation.

"No deal 'only acceptable' Brexit, says Farage","This video can not be played The withdrawal agreement is not Brexit, argues Nigel Farage. A no-deal Brexit is now ""the only acceptable deal"", says Nigel Farage. The Brexit Party leader said his party would fight in every seat at a general election if the government tried to pass the existing withdrawal agreement. But he said if Boris Johnson ""summoned the courage"" to pursue a no deal, The Brexit Party would work with him. He added: ""A Johnson government committed to doing the right thing and The Brexit Party working in tandem would be unstoppable."" The Brexit Party was launched in April this year ahead of the European Parliament elections, and after former Prime Minister Theresa May agreed to extend the Brexit deadline to 31 October. Mr Johnson has promised the UK will leave on that date ""do or die"", including without a deal if necessary. However, the PM has also said he is still pursuing a deal with the EU, urging European counterparts to reopen the withdrawal agreement agreed by Mrs May and make changes - especially to the backstop clause. The backstop is the so-called insurance policy to preventing a hard border - things like cameras and security posts - returning to the island of Ireland. If used, it would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks was agreed - but critics fear the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely. Bucks Fizz singer to stand for Brexit Party What is the Irish border blocking Brexit? Job of all MPs is to deliver Brexit - Johnson Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party Mr Farage was speaking at an event in London which saw hundreds of prospective parliamentary candidates for The Brexit Party gather. He revealed it had vetted 635 people for any upcoming election - 15 short of ensuring the party can fight every seat - and he believed there was a ""better than 50% chance"" the country would go to the polls in the autumn. He warned Mr Johnson not to try to revive the withdrawal agreement - already rejected by MPs in the Commons three times - in any form. ""I want to make this pledge from The Brexit Party,"" he said. ""The withdrawal agreement is not Brexit. It is a betrayal of what 17.4 million people voted for. ""If you insist on the withdrawal agreement, Mr Johnson, we will fight you in every seat up and down the length and breadth of the United Kingdom."" However, Mr Farage said he would be willing to work with the Tories if they backed a ""clean break"" from the EU and supported a no-deal Brexit. ""If Boris Johnson is prepared to do the right thing for the independence of this country, then we would put country before party and do the right thing. ""We would be prepared to work with him, perhaps in the form of a non-aggression pact at the general election. ""The Conservative Party has lost so much trust that the only way they could win a general election is with our support."" The Brexit Party event took place on Tuesday whilemembers of opposition parties in Westminster were meeting to discuss how to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Critics of no deal say it would damage the UK's economy and lead to a hard border returning between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The SNP, Liberal Democrats, The Independent Group for Change, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party all accepted an invitation from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to talk about a strategy ahead of MPs returning from recess next week. Mr Corbyn also invited five Conservative MPs opposed to a no-deal exit, but none attended. Leader of The Independent Group for Change, Anna Soubry, said the meeting was ""excellent"" and party leaders had agreed to work together. What would a Brexit Party Brexit look like?

Wrong-way drug-driver who killed biker is jailed,"This video can not be played Dash-cam footage showed drivers swerving to avoid William McLean on the East Kilbride Expressway A driver who killed a motorcyclist after taking cocaine and driving the wrong way on a dual carriageway has been jailed for six years. William McLean, 35, took five lines of the drug before driving on the East Kilbride Expressway in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, on 10 November last year. His Ford Mondeo struck student Allan Nicholson, 24, who died at the scene. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that five motorists had to take evasive action to avoid hitting McLean's car. William McLean, pictured, struck Allan Nicholson after driving the wrong way down the East Kilbride Expressway Judge Lord Brodie said: ""You drove when your ability to do so was impaired by a controlled drug, namely cocaine. ""For a long period of time you persistently drove on the wrong side of the road. You ignored or did not react to the warnings given by other motorists."" Lord Brodie told McLean, of Cathkin, Glasgow, that if he was sentencing after a trial he would have jailed him for nine years. McLean was also disqualified from driving for 10 years. Allan Nicholson died in the crash The judge said the victim was a clearly much-loved young man with a highly promising life ahead of him. Prosecutor Alex Prentice QC had told the court that Mr Nicholson was studying civil engineering and had left his girlfriend's house that morning to go to work. He said: ""Due to the impact Mr Nicholson was thrown from the motorcycle, landing on the carriageway as the motorbike burst into flames."" McLean's car stopped on the grass verge where motorists heard him say ""What have I done?"" McLean's Ford Mondeo following the crash He fled across the southbound carriageway and attempted to climb a wall, however, witnesses chased and detained him until police arrived. Officers asked him who the driver of the Mondeo was and McLean told them ""It was myself."" McLean admitted causing death by dangerous driving. Defence counsel Tony Graham QC said: ""There has never been any attempt on his part to justify his actions or to mitigate his actions."" Do you know this pooch?

Taller mast plans to boost rural mobile coverage,"EE trialled 5G equipment in London this year Bigger and taller mobile phone masts could be built without councils' permission across the countryside, under a proposed overhaul of planning rules in England. It is part of government plans to speed up the roll out of 5G networks and improve mobile coverage in rural areas. Currently masts on public land must be no more than 25m (82ft) high but ministers want to relax these rules. Labour says ""bolder"" plans are needed to boost the UK digital infrastructure. 5G, which uses higher frequency waves than earlier mobile networks, would allow more devices to have access to the internet at the same time and at faster speeds. However, 5G networks require more transmitter masts than previous technologies. Are these masts dangerous or is it just fearmongering? Finally, 5G is here - but so what? Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan, who has launched a consultation on the plans, said ""slightly taller"" masts would mean they could carry more equipment and ""potentially stop the proliferation of other masts - or even take away some"". Asked if new masts could double in height, she said ""Let's ask the question and see what it is people need."" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there has to be a balance struck between the landscape and better connectivity. ""This is about broader digital connectivity. So we will obviously look to the mobile companies and those installing those infrastructures to see what it is they actually need. ""And the point is there has to be a balance struck. We all want better phone signal. We all want to be able to download things much more quickly so we have to have the infrastructure there,"" she said. ""We have to make sure it's done in a sensitive way, it respects certain areas of outstanding natural beauty."" On the possible involvement of Chinese firm Huawei in any rollout, she said: ""I would hope that we cando something by the autumn,""adding that it has to be a decision ""for the long term, making sure that we keep all our networks secure"". The reaction to the government's plans has been mixed. Some fear the masts will be another blot on the landscape. For others - in areas of poor coverage - they cannot come soon enough. Brian Denham, a retired engineer in the Devon town of Colyton, said he has no mobile coverage in his house and only unreliable coverage outside. It has made banking difficult for him as his bank insists he will soon need to get identity verification codes sent to his phone in order to access his account, meaning he will have to go outside to do any banking. ""Anything the networks can do to increase coverage is good in my book,"" he said. ""I don't think a tall mast is particularly unsightly, but then again I am an engineer."" By Leo Kelion, BBC News Technology desk editor There are several benefits to having a taller mast in a rural setting. Firstly, it can help provide a clearer signal to users' phones. Trees and other tall vegetation can act as ""clutter"" that weakens the signals, so ideally you want your mast to be raised above them to have more chance of achieving direct line of sight and, as a result, potentially faster data speeds. Secondly, taller towers can provide coverage to a greater area. That means you might need to build fewer masts, saving on cost. Thirdly, using taller structures can help make it possible to achieve a link back to one of the telecoms provider's exchanges. In most cases, masts and their base stations are connected to the network via fibre-optic cables - the same kind of technology used to deliver fixed broadband. But sometimes, particularly in the countryside, it can make more sense to turn to a wireless alternative: microwave links. These transmit data back to an exchange or to an intermediary mast through the air rather than via a physical link. However, one limitation of this technology is that it only works if both the microwave dishes involved have perfect line of sight to each other. And if the terrain in between features hills, trees, buildings or other obstructions, then one way around this is to use a tall mast that towers above them. Elisabeth Ek, who lives in a 1930s block in Barnes High Street, takes a different view. She fears the growing number of masts on their roof is an eyesore in the south-west London village. ""We are not stupid,"" she said. ""We understand the national interest but we feel helpless and steamrolled by the phone companies."" Elizabeth Sim gets hardly any mobile service in the small village of Elsworth just outside Cambridge, where she is parish clerk. She finds the internet ""just disappears"" every morning when lots of people try to log on and says she receives her texts ""in bulk"" whenever she goes into Cambridge. In her village, they have fought to keep their BT telephone box - the only landline in the village available to the public in the event of a road accident. It is now emergency calls only - and there is a further threat of closure as it is ""not making any money"". She says the people of Elsworth would love to be considered in the same way as city dwellers for mobile services. ""I was in Tanzania in the middle of the Serengeti recently visiting my son. I had brilliant mobile coverage,"" she says. This country, she adds, is ""cringingly behind the drag curve with this, but then it is with so much other stuff too"". UK to make Huawei 5G decision 'by the autumn' London Underground to get full 4G coverage The consultation comes as the government launches a competition which will see up to 10 rural locations awarded a share of a Â£30 million fund to run trials of 5G-related technology. The government said it hoped the scheme, called the Rural Connected Communities competition, could help stimulate investment in 5G and help countryside communities take advantage of the technology. Similar schemes have already been set up in Orkney to remotely monitor salmon fisheries and improve the efficiency of wind farms. In Shropshire, 5G trials have been used to help the farming industry with targeted crop-spraying and soil analysis with drones and tractors. The new funding is expected to build on projects like these and trial other uses of 5G in rural communities to help businesses and encourage innovation. Tom Watson, deputy Labour leader, said the government ""must take bolder, faster action"". ""This funding falls far short of the ambitious roll-out we need to boost our digital infrastructure nationwide. ""5G and full fibre will be the basis of the innovative, green technologies that will underpin our future economy, but the UK's digital infrastructure is lagging embarrassingly behind"", he said. Mobile UK, which represents mobile phone companies EE, O2, Three and Vodafone, said the current planning system did not support a fast and efficient 5G roll out. Hamish MacLeod, director of the trade association, said: ""We welcome the government looking at simplifying planning processes to deliver better connectivity, and we stand ready to work in partnership to ensure these much needed reforms happen as quickly as possible."" An EE spokesman welcomed the consultation, saying the company shared the government's ambition to provide better coverage in rural areas, prioritising those that have no coverage at all. 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns - particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G can also handle many more thousands of devices simultaneously per square kilometre, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45mbps (megabits per second) on average. Experts say 5G - which is starting to be introduced in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster.

"Buyer 'unable to proceed' with Bury bidThe company which was hoping to buy Bury Football Club, C&N Sporting Risk, says it is ""unable to proceed"" with the takeover.BBC Sport","Bury, founded in 1885, have twice won the FA Cup Bury are facing expulsion from the English Football League after the company attempting to buy the club, C&N Sporting Risk, said it was unable to proceed with its takeover. The Shakers had been given until 17:00 BST on Tuesday to complete the deal. Chris Farnell, the lawyer working to broker a deal, has said ""alternative bids"" have been put to the EFL and they were now ""awaiting an outcome"". Bury would be the first team to drop out of the EFL since Maidstone in 1992. ""The league announced at the weekend that it was working exclusively with the club and C&N in an attempt to finalise a change of control at the club,"" said the EFL in a statement. ""However, following a period of due diligence, C&N have opted not to progress matters. ""The league continues to be in discussions with Bury FC and will provide a further update as appropriate."" The EFL suspended each of Bury's first six fixtures this season, requesting evidence the League One club could pay off creditors and had the funding to make it through the entire campaign. They were initially given until 23:59 BST on Friday to either provide the required information or find a buyer to take them over. With the third-tier side effectively an hour from being thrown out of the EFL, owner Steve Dale told BBC Radio Manchester he had sold the club and they were set to survive. That news subsequently secured them an extension until Tuesday to complete the deal, although C&N Sporting Risk expressed concern that it was still not enough time. An estimated 300 volunteers turned up at the club's Gigg Lane home on Tuesday to help get the ground ready for Saturday's scheduled game against Doncaster Rovers, but their efforts could prove to be in vain. Bury have since issued a warning on their website asking fans not to enter the stadium ""unless authorised"" at what is a ""difficult and emotional time for all supporters"". Bolton fans set for anxious wait as deadline passes Despite the withdrawal of C&N Sporting Risk's interest, Farnell told BBC Radio 5 live that other bids had been put to the EFL ""as late as in the last hour"" leading up to the deadline. ""From what I understand they appear to be credible and certainly at this stage to attract offers is the main thing that can happen,"" he said. ""I'm also informed that Mr Dale is aware of them as well, so we're awaiting to see the outcome of that. ""Some of the bids actually came in towards the end of last week, while there have been some new bids that have come in today too. They're not simply last-minute, shooting-at-the-moon type bids."" One of the offers is understood to be from MP Ivan Lewis, who has told BBC Radio Manchester that he has presented a plan and shown proof of funds to the EFL. Dale, who confirmed three bids had been passed to the EFL, said he remained hopeful Bury would be given a ""reprieve to help get a deal over the line"". C&N Sporting Risk said it had informed the EFL of its decision not to complete the takeover ""at the earliest possible opportunity"". ""As part of our due diligence, we set ourselves a list of key criteria regarding the CVA, the ground and the overall financial state of the club that had to be met in order for us to be satisfied that we have enough knowledge to proceed with the takeover,"" the company said in a statement. ""The complexities involved in each of these matters escalated and continue to do so. ""Despite previously stating we would have liked an extra 24 hours to conclude the deal, actually our position is not a condition of the strict timeline they have put in place, but reflective of the systemic failings of a football club over a number of years. ""With this in mind, we will be happy to work together with the EFL to share our findings to help them with their ongoing review of football governance, which is essential for the long term future of all members of the EFL and the broader football family."" Bury fans were joined by supporters of rival clubs in a bid to get Gigg Lane ready to host matches again on Tuesday Founded in 1885 and first elected to the EFL nine years later, Bury were playing in what is now known as the Championship as recently as 1999 and have twice won the FA Cup. No club has ever dropped out of the third tier before, and the Shakers will also become the first FA Cup winners to have been expelled by the EFL. England women's manager Phil Neville, whose mother Jill resigned as Bury's club secretary last week, described their demise as an ""absolute disgrace"" on Friday. Supporters staged numerous protests in the build-up to the deadline, with former director Joy Harthandcuffing herself to a drainpipeoutside their Gigg Lane home and a coffin with the words 'RIP Bury FC 1885-?' painted on it was placed at the directors' entrance. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham also wrote to EFL executive chair Debbie Jevans asking for the club to be granted more time""given the urgency of Bury's plight"".,external At the end of April, Bury were celebrating promotion back to the third tier of English football, but were already enduring major issues off the pitch. The club was in financial trouble even before Dale bought it for Â£1 in December from previous owner Stewart Day, with players and staff often being paid late. A winding-up petition filed against the club was adjourned three times before eventually being dismissed by the High Court on 31 July. By then, creditors had approved a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) put forward by Dale, which was proposed to help settle some of their debts. The CVA meant unsecured creditors, including HM Revenue & Customs, would be paid 25% of the money owed - but also triggered a 12-point deduction in the League One table under EFL rules. Furthermore, the EFL were unsatisfied Bury had given enough evidence of their financial viability, leading to a string of postponed fixtures while the organisation awaited ""the clarity required"". C&N Sporting Risk's interest in a takeover was enough for the EFL to extend the original cut-off on Friday - but their withdrawal came less than 90 minutes before Tuesday's latest deadline.

Brazil to reject G7 money to fight Amazon fires,"This video can not be played ""It's extremely upsetting... to see this kind of devastation"" - the BBC's Will Grant flew over northern Rondonia state Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro has ruled out accepting a G7 offer of aid to fight fires in the Amazon rainforest unless he gets an apology from his French counterpart, Emmanuel Macron. Mr Bolsonaro said the French leader should apologise for insulting him personally by calling him a liar. Mr Macron had accused him of ""lying"" about fighting climate change. Aid worth $22m (Â£18m) was announced by Mr Macron at a summit in France of the seven leading industrial powers. What about Bolivia's Amazon fires? Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered Satellite data show a huge increase in the number of fires burning in Brazil, most of them in the Amazon region. Earlier, Brazilian ministers said the G7 money was not needed and they accused foreign powers of wanting control of the Amazon. Last week, Mr Macron said Mr Bolsonaro had ""lied"" to him at a G20 summit in Osaka, Japan, in June by failing to respect his climate commitments and by failing to pursue biodiversity. Mr Macron said France would not ratify a huge trade deal with South American nationsunless Brazil did more to fight fires in the Amazon. Emmanuel Macron (L) and Jair Bolsonaro at the G20 Summit in Osaka On Tuesday, Mr Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital Brasilia: ""Mr Macron must withdraw the insults that he made to my person. Firstly, he called me a liar."" He also accused Mr Macron of questioning Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon region, Brazilian news website G1 reports. ""To talk or to accept anything from France, whether it be with the best possible intentions, he [Mr Macron] will have to withdraw those words and then we can talk,"" he said. The two presidents hold sharply different political views, with Mr Bolsonaro hailing from the far right in Brazil and Mr Macron elected in a run-off against the far right in France. In another development, Mr Bolsonaro responded to a joke on Facebook mocking the age of Mr Macron's wife Brigitte who, at 65, is 25 years his senior. He wrote: ""Do not humiliate the guy, ha ha."" Asked about Mr Bolsonaro's remarks,Mr Macron said they were ""extraordinarily rude"" and ""sad"". Adding to the row over the aid offer, Mr Bolsonaro's chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, mocked the fire that ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris in April. ""Macron cannot even avoid a predictable fire in a church that is part of the world's heritage and he wants to give us lessons for our country?"" he said, quoted by the Globo news website. As the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It spans a number of countries, but the majority of it falls within Brazil. Fire damage in Brazil's Otuquis National Park Otuquis National Park is part of the Pantanal ecoregion, known for its wetlands Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but satellitedata published by Brazil's space agency show an increase of 80% this year,external. It is the highest number of fires since 2010. BBC analysis has also found that the growth in the number of fires coincided with a sharp drop in finesbeing handed out for environmental violations. Amazon: Lungs of the planet Mr Bolsonaro has previously said his government lacks the resources to fight the record number of fires in the Amazon regionbut his government is also being accused of slashing funding for environmental protection. ""The funding for Brazil's environment agency has gone down by 95% this year,"" Yadvinder Malhi, professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford, told the BBC's Today programme. On Friday, President Bolsonaro authorised the military to help tackle the blazes. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Brazil says 44,000 soldiers have been deployed to combat the fires and environmental crimes in the Amazon, and military operations are under way in seven states as the result of requests for assistance from local governments. Jorgimar Alberto, from Roraima, one of the states most affected by the fires, has seen the burning of most of the land surrounding his wooden house. Jorgimar Alberto ""It's a risky situation, we have lots of crops here and everything is burning, such as the cashew trees,"" he told the BBC. ""I even had to keep the animals [inside] so that they don't burn as well. Every year it is the same, these fires are disturbing the region a lot."" Environmental officials helped him extinguish the fires last week only for them to reignite, he said. His wife could not stand staying in the house with the smell of burning and the threat getting ever closer, so she left. Lumberyard owner Edson Oliveira from southern Amazonas said he did not believe the media coverage about the Amazon. ""In my opinion, the parts that are burning are the same that burn every year,"" he told the BBC. Asked what he would like politicians to do for the Amazon, he said that he would like ""economic alternatives for people here, to find a way we can make use of the natural wealth we have here"". ""It's no use pointing the finger at what's wrong without bringing alternatives to people,"" he said. The $22m was announced on Monday as the leaders of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - met in Biarritz, France. Mr Macron said the funds would be made available immediately - primarily to pay for more firefighting planes - and that France would also ""offer concrete support with military in the region"". This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land Greenpeace France described the G7's response to the crisis as ""inadequate given the urgency and magnitude of this environmental disaster"". As international concern over the fires spread, Hollywoodactor Leonardo DiCaprio pledged $5m towards helping the rainforest. He has long maintained that European countries are trying to gain access to Brazil's natural resources. He alleges that European interest in the welfare of the Amazon is a thin guise for attempts to gain a foothold in the region. Asked by international journalists about environmental protection of the Amazon at a press briefing on 6 July, he said: ""Brazil is like a virgin that every pervert from the outside lusts for."" This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010. Amazon fires: How bad have they got?

Wrong-way drug driver who killed biker is jailed,"This video can not be played Dash-cam footage showed drivers swerving to avoid William McLean on the East Kilbride Expressway A driver who killed a motorcyclist after taking cocaine and driving the wrong way on a dual carriageway has been jailed for six years. William McLean, 35, took five lines of the drug before driving on the East Kilbride Expressway in Blantyre, South Lanarkshire, on 10 November last year. His Ford Mondeo struck student Allan Nicholson, 24, who died at the scene. The High Court in Edinburgh heard that five motorists had to take evasive action to avoid hitting McLean's car. William McLean, pictured, struck Allan Nicholson after driving the wrong way down the East Kilbride Expressway Judge Lord Brodie said: ""You drove when your ability to do so was impaired by a controlled drug, namely cocaine. ""For a long period of time you persistently drove on the wrong side of the road. You ignored or did not react to the warnings given by other motorists."" Lord Brodie told McLean, of Cathkin, Glasgow, that if he was sentencing after a trial he would have jailed him for nine years. McLean was also disqualified from driving for 10 years. Allan Nicholson died in the crash The judge said the victim was a clearly much-loved young man with a highly promising life ahead of him. Prosecutor Alex Prentice QC had told the court that Mr Nicholson was studying civil engineering and had left his girlfriend's house that morning to go to work. He said: ""Due to the impact Mr Nicholson was thrown from the motorcycle, landing on the carriageway as the motorbike burst into flames."" McLean's car stopped on the grass verge where motorists heard him say ""What have I done?"" McLean's Ford Mondeo following the crash He fled across the southbound carriageway and attempted to climb a wall, however, witnesses chased and detained him until police arrived. Officers asked him who the driver of the Mondeo was and McLean told them ""It was myself."" McLean admitted causing death by dangerous driving.

"Free iPads for nearly 50,000 school pupils","Nearly 50,000 school children in Glasgow are to get their own iPad to help with lessons. The project will see every pupil from P6 to S6 given their own device to keep, while all other pupils will have shared access to the Apple tablet. Faster internet connections and installing wi-fi in every classroom is also part of the initiative. The iPad rollout is part of a seven-year deal between Glasgow City Council and Canadian IT firm CGI. The entire deal is worth in excess of Â£300m but the council said it was not possible to break down the cost of the iPad project. By 2021 every Glasgow primary and secondary teacher and their pupils will have access to an iPad A number of local authorities have already given, or have plans to give, secondary pupils free iPads including Edinburgh, the Scottish Borders and Perth and Kinross. Councillor Chris Cunningham, Glasgow City Council's education convener, said the move was about helping pupils embrace the digital age, improve learning and help close the attainment gap. He added:  ""We want our children and young people to be equipped with the skills that will make them shine as digital citizens both now and later in their working lives. ""We are aware that 90% of jobs in Scotland involve digital work and so our pupils will be well equipped for the workplace. ""I know that this project will result in raising attainment and achievement in every one of our schools and nurseries."" All of the iPads will be tracked and managed by the council, which can lock, erase or render the devices inoperable remotely. Pupils can access the internet, but not any social media sites, and the council says its firewall will block any inappropriate sites. The iPad is the responsibility of the child and if it is lost, damaged or stolen then the pupil will need to contact the school immediately. There is some some contingency for lost iPads but Glasgow City Council says it is stressing to young people that the iPads are their responsibility and that the initial rollout has encountered few problems in this regard. Pupils will continue to use books and jotters in class in addition to the tablets. The project has already been tested at a number of primary and secondary schools across Glasgow and the full rollout will be completed by 2021. This will see 47,100 student iPads and 4,900 teacher iPads handed out. With the additional shared devices for nursery and younger primary pupils, it is estimated that 70,000 children will benefit from the what is described as the biggest Apple education project in Europe. Justene Ewing, vice president of consulting services at CGI, said: ""The rollout will help free up teachers and boost their control of the learning process, while also improving inclusivity for students in the educational process.""

Both sides sliding into blame game,"So many newspaper column inches have been devoted over the last week to a debate over whether or not Boris Johnson has managed to ""win a victory"" over his EU counterparts, getting them to ""budge"" over changing the Withdrawal Agreement. You can in fact argue this both ways. The ""Yes-they've-budged"" camp point to German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron now saying they will consider any new proposals from the UK on replacing the contentious Irish border backstop (if they are realistic and immediately operable). This is a marked change from the EU's official position when Boris Johnson became UK Prime Minister: that the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement (containing the backstop) was signed, sealed and carved in stone. What is a no-deal Brexit? Tusk and Johnson clash over who is 'Mr No Deal' The ""No-the-EU-hasn't-really-budged"" camp say EU leaders don't believe Boris Johnson has any realistic alternatives to the backstop up his sleeve, so they are trying to take the initiative in the blame game that would inevitably follow a no-deal Brexit by wanting to appear open. The aim being that Angela Merkel, for example, could turn to German businesses that would lose out in a no-deal scenario and say: ""Look, I tried my best. It's Boris Johnson who failed you."" EU figures who've been involved in Brexit negotiations are also keen to point out that being open to alternatives to the Irish backstop is not a change of position for Brussels. It's written into the existing Withdrawal Agreement. This video can not be played Donald Tusk at the G7: I hope Boris Johnson will not want to go down in history as Mr No Deal And as for Angela Merkel's positive words to Boris Johnson about finding new solutions, the German media was quick to underline how often she has repeated over the last  few years that she would work ""until the last minute to make a deal with the UK,"" as long as EU single market rules were respected. Her attitude - in public at least - is unchanged. Behind the scenes though, EU leaders have been readjusting their view of Boris Johnson somewhat. During this summer's Conservative party leadership contest to replace Theresa May as prime minister, I heard Boris Johnson described in private conversations in EU circles as ""a buffoon"" and ""a reckless populist willing to drive his country over the cliff-edge of a no-deal Brexit to satisfy his ambition to become prime minister"". I now notice a subtle tone change. In his one-to-one chats in Paris, Berlin and at the G7 with European Council President Donald Tusk, the prime minister has managed to persuade Brussels that: a) He is serious in his threat to pursue a no-deal Brexit if no agreement with the EU can be found; and b) He would actively prefer to get a deal through parliament if possible. But this change in perception does not alter facts on the ground. EU leaders still think a no-deal Brexit is the most likely option right now. This video can not be played What is the customs union? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Time is running out - unless the prime minister were to do a last-minute U-turn and request a new Brexit extension after all. EU politicians also speak of the numbers not adding up in parliament for Boris Johnson. A reason they give for not being willing to jump forward with a backstop compromise. ""There is little-to-no pressure from the rest of us in the EU on Dublin right now to find and accept a backstop compromise,"" one high-level EU diplomat told me. ""If we did introduce a time limit - or even if we got rid of the backstop altogether from the Withdrawal Agreement, as Boris Johnson says he wants us to do - what would be the point? The prime minister doesn't have the majority in parliament to guarantee the Brexit deal would then go through and we, the EU, would have sacrificed our principles, our reputation, exposed our single market on the island of Ireland and thrown member state Dublin under a bus voluntarily. We'd be worse off than if we just accept a no-deal Brexit is going to happen."" Backstop: Why is the Irish border hindering Brexit? What could happen to food prices after Brexit? Boris Johnson's majority of one in parliament means EU leaders understand his focus is now domestic: shoring up his premiership by winning a general election, rather than agreeing a compromise deal with the EU. Few in the EU are holding their breath that MPs will succeed in stopping a no-deal Brexit in the coming weeks - though if they did, Brussels would be delighted. I notice rather that a number of European politicians are placing any hopes they have on Boris Johnson to avoid no deal. They speak of the prime minister's ambition to remain in the job and to go down in the history books in a positive way. One European official remarked: ""Johnson can see a no-deal Brexit is bad for his country but we're afraid he's boxed himself in with all his threats and promises at home."" EU leaders will now watch and wait for what early autumn brings in UK politics. The next scene in this Brexit drama will play out in Westminster, not Brussels.

"No deal 'only acceptable' Brexit, says FarageThe Brexit Party leader says he would work with the PM but only if he pursued a ""clean break"" exit.UK Politics","This video can not be played The withdrawal agreement is not Brexit, argues Nigel Farage. A no-deal Brexit is now ""the only acceptable deal"", says Nigel Farage. The Brexit Party leader said his party would fight in every seat at a general election if the government tried to pass the existing withdrawal agreement. But he said if Boris Johnson ""summoned the courage"" to pursue a no deal, The Brexit Party would work with him. He added: ""A Johnson government committed to doing the right thing and The Brexit Party working in tandem would be unstoppable."" The Brexit Party was launched in April this year ahead of the European Parliament elections, and after former Prime Minister Theresa May agreed to extend the Brexit deadline to 31 October. Mr Johnson has promised the UK will leave on that date ""do or die"", including without a deal if necessary. However, the PM has also said he is still pursuing a deal with the EU, urging European counterparts to reopen the withdrawal agreement agreed by Mrs May and make changes - especially to the backstop clause. The backstop is the so-called insurance policy to preventing a hard border - things like cameras and security posts - returning to the island of Ireland. If used, it would keep the UK in a very close relationship with the EU until a trade deal permanently avoiding the need for checks was agreed - but critics fear the UK would be trapped in it indefinitely. Bucks Fizz singer to stand for Brexit Party What is the Irish border blocking Brexit? Job of all MPs is to deliver Brexit - Johnson Nigel Farage launches Brexit Party Mr Farage was speaking at an event in London which saw hundreds of prospective parliamentary candidates for The Brexit Party gather. He revealed it had vetted 635 people for any upcoming election - 15 short of ensuring the party can fight every seat - and he believed there was a ""better than 50% chance"" the country would go to the polls in the autumn. He warned Mr Johnson not to try to revive the withdrawal agreement - already rejected by MPs in the Commons three times - in any form. ""I want to make this pledge from The Brexit Party,"" he said. ""The withdrawal agreement is not Brexit. It is a betrayal of what 17.4 million people voted for. ""If you insist on the withdrawal agreement, Mr Johnson, we will fight you in every seat up and down the length and breadth of the United Kingdom."" However, Mr Farage said he would be willing to work with the Tories if they backed a ""clean break"" from the EU and supported a no-deal Brexit. ""If Boris Johnson is prepared to do the right thing for the independence of this country, then we would put country before party and do the right thing. ""We would be prepared to work with him, perhaps in the form of a non-aggression pact at the general election. ""The Conservative Party has lost so much trust that the only way they could win a general election is with our support."" The Brexit Party event took place on Tuesday whilemembers of opposition parties in Westminster were meeting to discuss how to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Critics of no deal say it would damage the UK's economy and lead to a hard border returning between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The SNP, Liberal Democrats, The Independent Group for Change, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party all accepted an invitation from Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn to talk about a strategy ahead of MPs returning from recess next week. Mr Corbyn also invited five Conservative MPs opposed to a no-deal exit, but none attended. Leader of The Independent Group for Change, Anna Soubry, said the meeting was ""excellent"" and party leaders had agreed to work together. What would a Brexit Party Brexit look like?

'Alarm bells' over private equity fostering firmsCouncils are concerned about what might happen if a run-for-profit foster care firm collapses.,"Private equity firms buying up small agencies have ""set off alarm bells"" within England's foster care system, the Local Government Association says. Three groups account for 45% of funds spent on independent fostering by English councils, according to new analysis. The LGA said councils worry about what could happen if one group failed. The Nationwide Association of Fostering Providers said its members provided a vital and high quality service. More than 75,000 children are in care in England, compared with about 60,000 a decade ago. Most of these children are in foster care. Councils manage foster placements themselves as well as commissioning care from independent fostering agencies. Many of these providers started as local, small-scale operations but private equity firms - essentially, investment companies - have moved into the sector in recent years. The National Fostering Agency, Compass Fostering and Foster Care Associates are now the dominant independent groups in the industry. All three run for profit and are backed by private equity. Foster parents honoured for 'changing lives' 'How my foster parents changed my life' Surge in 'vulnerable' teenagers in care Andrew Rome, a specialist accountant, said these firms' business models involve buying up agencies, consolidating them, and selling the companies on. Mr Rome, who analysed the finances of these providers fora recent government-backed review,externalled by Sir Martin Narey, said their rate of return was ""something like two or three times the original investment amount"". He estimated the three groups now account for more than Â£300m of annual spending by local authorities in England - ""at least"" 45% of spending. David Simmonds, deputy chairman of the LGA, said councils would worry about what the consequences would be if one of the groups failed. ""A number of companies have gone out of business in the social care sector, care home providers principally - because they've gone down this path of consolidation and ever-increasing profit and it's led to trouble,"" he said. ""Local authorities will be looking at recruitment and retention of our own in-house foster carers to make sure that we're prepared to deal with that situation effectively and efficiently."" Local authorities are also concerned there would be little competition and the groups could raise prices. Many councils said they already struggle to meet the costs of independent foster care, which they said were far higher than their in-house provision. Linda began working as a foster parent in Liverpool in 2005 through a small private agency, and has cared for nine children. The number of children in care in Liverpool has risen from 860 to 1,365 in a decade. Linda said the agency originally had a ""family feel"" but when it was sold, and sold again, it became less ""child-centred"" and more focused ""on money"". Linda has cared for nine children as young as two years old She left the agency four years ago and said she feels happier working directly for the council. However, independent agencies tend to recruit foster carers more easily than local councils - offering bigger carer allowances and sometimes better support. Liverpool City Council now offers to match what private agencies pay to try to draw foster carers away from the private sector. Councillor Barry Kushner, the council's cabinet member for children and social care, said bringing the foster carers ""in house"" could save millions of pounds per year. He was concerned the concentration of fostering in so few agencies could mean the council has less control over where children are placed. If children were sent to foster carers outside of Liverpool, they would have to move away from their schools, family and friends. There is fierce argument over the cost of independent agencies relative to in-house foster care. This video can not be played Lemn Sissay says he has ""empathy"" for his foster parents Author and poet Lemn Sissay was born in Wigan near a home for pregnant unmarried women - and grew up in the care system. He has recounted how he was abandoned by his foster parents at the age of 12. Although his foster parents were ""the ones who taught me what love is"", Sissay's childhood mischief - such as stealing biscuits - was seen as ""evil working within me"". He told theToday programme: ""My foster mother said 'because you don't love us, you don't want to be with us'."" The next day, his foster parents sent him away. He was moved between childrenâs homes and eventually left the care system, alone. He has since worked on several enterprises to help improve the lives of children in care, such asholding Christmas dinner events across the countryfor care leavers. While the LGA says it is far more expensive, the conclusion of Sir Martin Narey's review last year was the gap was ""very small"" once all overheads were taken into account. It said independent agencies cared for the more ""challenging"" children and had to invest more in pay and support for carers. The National Association of Fostering Providers said they played a vital part in supporting vulnerable children, and that local authorities were unable to keep up with demand. They said their services had been consistently rated high quality by Ofsted. But Andy Elvin, chief executive of the UK foster charity, TACT, said there was a lack of transparency in the independent sector. He said although it often offered better training and support than local authorities, he was concerned about the dominance and high profits of private firms.

"Taller mast plans to boost rural mobile coverageA balance has to be struck between the landscape and better connectivity, the digital secretary says.UK","EE trialled 5G equipment in London this year Bigger and taller mobile phone masts could be built without councils' permission across the countryside, under a proposed overhaul of planning rules in England. It is part of government plans to speed up the roll out of 5G networks and improve mobile coverage in rural areas. Currently masts on public land must be no more than 25m (82ft) high but ministers want to relax these rules. Labour says ""bolder"" plans are needed to boost the UK digital infrastructure. 5G, which uses higher frequency waves than earlier mobile networks, would allow more devices to have access to the internet at the same time and at faster speeds. However, 5G networks require more transmitter masts than previous technologies. Are these masts dangerous or is it just fearmongering? Finally, 5G is here - but so what? Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan, who has launched a consultation on the plans, said ""slightly taller"" masts would mean they could carry more equipment and ""potentially stop the proliferation of other masts - or even take away some"". Asked if new masts could double in height, she said ""Let's ask the question and see what it is people need."" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there has to be a balance struck between the landscape and better connectivity. ""This is about broader digital connectivity. So we will obviously look to the mobile companies and those installing those infrastructures to see what it is they actually need. ""And the point is there has to be a balance struck. We all want better phone signal. We all want to be able to download things much more quickly so we have to have the infrastructure there,"" she said. ""We have to make sure it's done in a sensitive way, it respects certain areas of outstanding natural beauty."" On the possible involvement of Chinese firm Huawei in any rollout, she said: ""I would hope that we cando something by the autumn,""adding that it has to be a decision ""for the long term, making sure that we keep all our networks secure"". The reaction to the government's plans has been mixed. Some fear the masts will be another blot on the landscape. For others - in areas of poor coverage - they cannot come soon enough. Brian Denham, a retired engineer in the Devon town of Colyton, said he has no mobile coverage in his house and only unreliable coverage outside. It has made banking difficult for him as his bank insists he will soon need to get identity verification codes sent to his phone in order to access his account, meaning he will have to go outside to do any banking. ""Anything the networks can do to increase coverage is good in my book,"" he said. ""I don't think a tall mast is particularly unsightly, but then again I am an engineer."" By Leo Kelion, BBC News Technology desk editor There are several benefits to having a taller mast in a rural setting. Firstly, it can help provide a clearer signal to users' phones. Trees and other tall vegetation can act as ""clutter"" that weakens the signals, so ideally you want your mast to be raised above them to have more chance of achieving direct line of sight and, as a result, potentially faster data speeds. Secondly, taller towers can provide coverage to a greater area. That means you might need to build fewer masts, saving on cost. Thirdly, using taller structures can help make it possible to achieve a link back to one of the telecoms provider's exchanges. In most cases, masts and their base stations are connected to the network via fibre-optic cables - the same kind of technology used to deliver fixed broadband. But sometimes, particularly in the countryside, it can make more sense to turn to a wireless alternative: microwave links. These transmit data back to an exchange or to an intermediary mast through the air rather than via a physical link. However, one limitation of this technology is that it only works if both the microwave dishes involved have perfect line of sight to each other. And if the terrain in between features hills, trees, buildings or other obstructions, then one way around this is to use a tall mast that towers above them. Elisabeth Ek, who lives in a 1930s block in Barnes High Street, takes a different view. She fears the growing number of masts on their roof is an eyesore in the south-west London village. ""We are not stupid,"" she said. ""We understand the national interest but we feel helpless and steamrolled by the phone companies."" Elizabeth Sim gets hardly any mobile service in the small village of Elsworth just outside Cambridge, where she is parish clerk. She finds the internet ""just disappears"" every morning when lots of people try to log on and says she receives her texts ""in bulk"" whenever she goes into Cambridge. In her village, they have fought to keep their BT telephone box - the only landline in the village available to the public in the event of a road accident. It is now emergency calls only - and there is a further threat of closure as it is ""not making any money"". She says the people of Elsworth would love to be considered in the same way as city dwellers for mobile services. ""I was in Tanzania in the middle of the Serengeti recently visiting my son. I had brilliant mobile coverage,"" she says. This country, she adds, is ""cringingly behind the drag curve with this, but then it is with so much other stuff too"". UK to make Huawei 5G decision 'by the autumn' London Underground to get full 4G coverage The consultation comes as the government launches a competition which will see up to 10 rural locations awarded a share of a Â£30 million fund to run trials of 5G-related technology. The government said it hoped the scheme, called the Rural Connected Communities competition, could help stimulate investment in 5G and help countryside communities take advantage of the technology. Similar schemes have already been set up in Orkney to remotely monitor salmon fisheries and improve the efficiency of wind farms. In Shropshire, 5G trials have been used to help the farming industry with targeted crop-spraying and soil analysis with drones and tractors. The new funding is expected to build on projects like these and trial other uses of 5G in rural communities to help businesses and encourage innovation. Tom Watson, deputy Labour leader, said the government ""must take bolder, faster action"". ""This funding falls far short of the ambitious roll-out we need to boost our digital infrastructure nationwide. ""5G and full fibre will be the basis of the innovative, green technologies that will underpin our future economy, but the UK's digital infrastructure is lagging embarrassingly behind"", he said. Mobile UK, which represents mobile phone companies EE, O2, Three and Vodafone, said the current planning system did not support a fast and efficient 5G roll out. Hamish MacLeod, director of the trade association, said: ""We welcome the government looking at simplifying planning processes to deliver better connectivity, and we stand ready to work in partnership to ensure these much needed reforms happen as quickly as possible."" An EE spokesman welcomed the consultation, saying the company shared the government's ambition to provide better coverage in rural areas, prioritising those that have no coverage at all. 5G promises great benefits but may come with higher security risks 5G is the next (fifth) generation of mobile internet connectivity, promising much faster data download and upload speeds, wider coverage and more stable connections. Existing spectrum bands are becoming congested, leading to breakdowns - particularly when many people in one area are trying to access services at the same time. 5G can also handle many more thousands of devices simultaneously per square kilometre, from phones to equipment sensors, video cameras to smart street lights. Current 4G mobile networks can offer speeds of about 45mbps (megabits per second) on average. Experts say 5G - which is starting to be introduced in the UK this year - could achieve browsing and downloads up to 20 times faster.

Mum and dad 'one of UK's biggest mortgage lenders',"Parents spend so much money to get their children onto the housing ladder that they are now among the biggest lenders in the UK, a survey suggests. The average parental contribution for homebuyers this year is Â£24,100, up by more than Â£6,000 compared to last year, according to Legal & General (L&G). Collectively parents have given Â£6.3bn, high enough to rank the bank of mum and dad 10th if it was a mortgage lender. Clydesdale Bank, the UK's 10th largest mortgage lender lent Â£5bn last year. L&G said thousands of UK buyers were reliant on their parents to either get onto the housing ladder in the first place, or upgrade to a larger home. Almost a fifth of those who said they had, or would help a family member buy a home, said it was because they felt it was their personal responsibility to help out. But the financial services firm warned that parents' generosity could hurt their standard of living in retirement. 1. Lloyds Banking Group Â£42.5bn 2. Nationwide Â£35.7bn 3. Royal Bank of Scotland Â£30.5bn 4. Santander UK Â£28.3bn 5. Barclays Â£23.1bn 6. HSBC Bank Â£21.5bn 7. Coventry Building Society Â£9.2bn 8. Yorkshire Building Society Â£8.7bn 9. Virgin Money Â£6.8bn 10. Clydesdale Bank Â£5bn *Data fromUK Finance, the trade body for UK banking and financial services,external L&G's research, based on a poll of 1,600 parents, found more than half were using cash to help their children, but others were withdrawing money from their pensions or said they would consider using equity release from their homes. Despite this, it found that more than a quarter of those surveyed were not confident they had enough money to last through their retirement. Meanwhile, 15%  said they had already accepted a lower standard of living due to helping out their children. Chris Knight, chief executive of L&G's Retail Retirement division, said retirees had ""a vast range of considerations"" to take into account when deciding whether to help out, including ""setting aside funds for any future care needs they may have"". ""Many are using their pensions and savings to help out and unfortunately this could be leaving some facing a poorer retirement,"" he said.

Rural areas could see taller 5G masts,"EE trialled 5G equipment in London this year Bigger and taller mobile phone masts could be built without councils' permission across the countryside, under a proposed overhaul of planning rules in England. It is part of government plans to speed up the roll out of 5G networks and improve mobile coverage in rural areas. Currently masts on public land must be no more than 25m (82ft) high but ministers want to relax these rules. Labour says ""bolder"" plans are needed to boost the UK digital infrastructure. 5G, which uses higher frequency waves than earlier mobile networks, would allow more devices to have access to the internet at the same time and at faster speeds. However, 5G networks require more transmitter masts than previous technologies. Are these masts dangerous or is it just fearmongering? Finally, 5G is here - but so what? Digital Secretary Nicky Morgan, who has launched a consultation on the plans, said ""slightly taller"" masts would mean they could carry more equipment and ""potentially stop the proliferation of other masts - or even take away some"". Asked if new masts could double in height, she said ""Let's ask the question and see what it is people need."" She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme there has to be a balance struck between the landscape and better connectivity. ""This is about broader digital connectivity. So we will obviously look to the mobile companies and those installing those infrastructures to see what it is they actually need. ""And the point is there has to be a balance struck. We all want better phone signal. We all want to be able to download things much more quickly so we have to have the infrastructure there,"" she said. ""We have to make sure it's done in a sensitive way, it respects certain areas of outstanding natural beauty."" On the possible involvement of Chinese firm Huawei in any rollout, she said: ""I would hope that we cando something by the autumn,""adding that it has to be a decision ""for the long term, making sure that we keep all our networks secure"". The reaction to the government's plans has been mixed. Some fear the masts will be another blot on the landscape. For others - in areas of poor coverage - they cannot come soon enough. Brian Denham, a retired engineer in the Devon town of Colyton, said he has no mobile coverage in his house and only unreliable coverage outside. It has made banking difficult for him as his bank insists he will soon need to get identity verification codes sent to his phone in order to access his account, meaning he will have to go outside to do any banking. ""Anything the networks can do to increase coverage is good in my book,"" he said. ""I don't think a tall mast is particularly unsightly, but then again I am an engineer.""

Konta & Evans into US Open second round,"Johanna Konta reached the French Open semi-finals and Wimbledon quarter-finals this year US Open 2019 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:26 Aug - 8 Sep Coverage:Live text and radio commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app Britain's Johanna Konta and Dan Evans came through tricky encounters to reach the second round of the US Open. British number one Konta started in devastating form against Daria Kasatkina, winning the first set in 24 minutes, but was then frustrated before going on to triumph 6-1 4-6 6-2. Evans progressed with a 6-4 6-3 2-6 6-3 win over Adrian Mannarino. But fellow Britons Harriet Dart and Cameron Norrie were knocked out at Flushing Meadows. Konta will play Russian world number 61 Margarita Gasparyan next, while Evans takes on French 25th seed Lucas Pouille. Konta is the only British woman left in the singles after Dart's first appearance in the main draw here ended with a 6-3 6-1 defeat by Romanian Ana Bogdan. British number three Norrie also failed to advance on day one of the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, succumbing 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 4-6 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-2) to French qualifier Gregoire Barrere in a match that ticked past four hours. British number one Kyle Edmund opens his campaign on Tuesday against Spaniard Pablo Andujar. Konta, who reached the French Open semi-finals and Wimbledon quarter-finals this year, got off to a flying start in what was a tough first-round draw against former top-10 player Kasatkina. The British 16th seed did not drop a point on her first serve in the opening set but was then held back in the second when unforced errors crept in. She was also left frustrated by a series of line calls that were overruled by the umpire. She was particularly angry after a Kasatkina forehand was called out before the umpire overruled and awarded the point to the Russian and her mood darkened moments later when her own shot was called out and overruled only for the point to be replayed. ""How is 'replay the point'?"" she asked the umpire. ""It's the same situation!"" She went on to lose that set but after taking a bathroom break before the start of the third she returned to deliver more of the dominance she had shown in the opening set. After trading breaks early in the third, Konta got the key breakthrough to go 4-1 up, eventually sealing victory when Kasatkina served back-to-back double faults. Tom Hiddleston (right) was a guest in Konta's players' box Konta was supported by award-winning British actor Tom Hiddleston, who sat courtside in her players' box alongside his co-stars in the Broadway play Betrayal. Konta says she met the 39-year-old, who is most famous for appearing in several Marvel films and BBC drama The Night Manager, when he approached her on a New York street last week. ""I did the Good Samaritan thing and said to myself, 'Don't bother him, he's obviously busy',"" Konta said. ""And then he actually said, 'I don't usually do this but I'm a massive fan,' and I was like, 'What, who? Who else is here?' ""So I invited him to come down and it was a good match for everyone to watch."" Like Konta, Evans started his match comfortably, going two sets up against French world number 57 Mannarino. But the British number two,who split with his coach David Felgateearlier this month, then became increasingly frustrated with himself as errors began to creep in on his serve and he was broken twice to lose the third set. ""I haven't felt comfortable, I was frustrated - I didn't like how I was hitting the ball or serving, I was pretty angry, I wasn't great out there,"" he said in a courtside interview. ""I was fine physically. It was more mental, going through service games - my own games - which I was struggling with."" Evans, who reached the third round on his last outing to Flushing Meadows in 2016, is hoping to build on an excellent grass-court season this year which included reaching the Wimbledon third round and back-to-back Challenger titles. Norrie could not follow Evans' lead despite a battling performance against world number 109 Barrere, who had come through three rounds of qualifying and had started to look like he was cramping in the fifth set. The Briton trailed by two sets but then staged a comeback, saving two match points to force a fourth-set tie-break, which he won to take it to a decider. He served for the match twice but both times allowed the Frenchman back in and paid the price for his errors as Barrere raced to a 6-1 lead in the fifth-set tie-break. The Briton saved another match point but there was nothing he could do about the next one where his racquet was sent flying from his hand by Barrere's powerful winning shot.

Emmanuel Macron (L) and Jair Bolsonaro at the G20 Summit in Osaka On Tuesday, Mr Bolsonaro told reporters in the capital Brasilia: ""Mr Macron must withdraw the insults that he made to my person. Firstly, he called me a liar."" He also accused Mr Macron of questioning Brazilian sovereignty over the Amazon region, Brazilian news website G1 reports. ""To talk or to accept anything from France, whether it be with the best possible intentions, he [Mr Macron] will have to withdraw those words and then we can talk,"" he said. The two presidents hold sharply different political views, with Mr Bolsonaro hailing from the far right in Brazil and Mr Macron elected in a run-off against the far right in France. In another development, Mr Bolsonaro responded to a joke on Facebook mocking the age of Mr Macron's wife Brigitte who, at 65, is 25 years his senior. He wrote: ""Do not humiliate the guy, ha ha."" Asked about Mr Bolsonaro's remarks,Mr Macron said they were ""extraordinarily rude"" and ""sad"". Adding to the row over the aid offer, Mr Bolsonaro's chief of staff, Onyx Lorenzoni, mocked the fire that ravaged Notre-Dame cathedral in Paris in April. ""Macron cannot even avoid a predictable fire in a church that is part of the world's heritage and he wants to give us lessons for our country?"" he said, quoted by the Globo news website. As the largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It spans a number of countries, but the majority of it falls within Brazil. Fire damage in Brazil's Otuquis National Park Otuquis National Park is part of the Pantanal ecoregion, known for its wetlands Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but satellitedata published by Brazil's space agency show an increase of 80% this year,external. It is the highest number of fires since 2010. BBC analysis has also found that the growth in the number of fires coincided with a sharp drop in finesbeing handed out for environmental violations. Amazon: Lungs of the planet Mr Bolsonaro has previously said his government lacks the resources to fight the record number of fires in the Amazon regionbut his government is also being accused of slashing funding for environmental protection. ""The funding for Brazil's environment agency has gone down by 95% this year,"" Yadvinder Malhi, professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford, told the BBC's Today programme. On Friday, President Bolsonaro authorised the military to help tackle the blazes. This video can not be played Why the Amazon rainforest helps fight climate change Brazil says 44,000 soldiers have been deployed to combat the fires and environmental crimes in the Amazon, and military operations are under way in seven states as the result of requests for assistance from local governments. Jorgimar Alberto, from Roraima, one of the states most affected by the fires, has seen the burning of most of the land surrounding his wooden house. Jorgimar Alberto ""It's a risky situation, we have lots of crops here and everything is burning, such as the cashew trees,"" he told the BBC. ""I even had to keep the animals [inside] so that they don't burn as well. Every year it is the same, these fires are disturbing the region a lot."" Environmental officials helped him extinguish the fires last week only for them to reignite, he said. His wife could not stand staying in the house with the smell of burning and the threat getting ever closer, so she left. Lumberyard owner Edson Oliveira from southern Amazonas said he did not believe the media coverage about the Amazon. ""In my opinion, the parts that are burning are the same that burn every year,"" he told the BBC. Asked what he would like politicians to do for the Amazon, he said that he would like ""economic alternatives for people here, to find a way we can make use of the natural wealth we have here"". ""It's no use pointing the finger at what's wrong without bringing alternatives to people,"" he said. The $22m was announced on Monday as the leaders of the G7 - Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK and the US - met in Biarritz, France. Mr Macron said the funds would be made available immediately - primarily to pay for more firefighting planes - and that France would also ""offer concrete support with military in the region"". This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land Greenpeace France described the G7's response to the crisis as ""inadequate given the urgency and magnitude of this environmental disaster"". As international concern over the fires spread, Hollywoodactor Leonardo DiCaprio pledged $5m towards helping the rainforest. He has long maintained that European countries are trying to gain access to Brazil's natural resources. He alleges that European interest in the welfare of the Amazon is a thin guise for attempts to gain a foothold in the region. Asked by international journalists about environmental protection of the Amazon at a press briefing on 6 July, he said: ""Brazil is like a virgin that every pervert from the outside lusts for."" This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010. Amazon fires: How bad have they got?

Konta & Evans into US Open second roundBritain's Johanna Konta and Dan Evans come through tricky encounters to reach the second round of the US Open.BBC Sport,"Johanna Konta reached the French Open semi-finals and Wimbledon quarter-finals this year US Open 2019 Venue:Flushing Meadows, New YorkDates:26 Aug - 8 Sep Coverage:Live text and radio commentary on selected matches on the BBC Sport website and app Britain's Johanna Konta and Dan Evans came through tricky encounters to reach the second round of the US Open. British number one Konta started in devastating form against Daria Kasatkina, winning the first set in 24 minutes, but was then frustrated before going on to triumph 6-1 4-6 6-2. Evans progressed with a 6-4 6-3 2-6 6-3 win over Adrian Mannarino. But fellow Britons Harriet Dart and Cameron Norrie were knocked out at Flushing Meadows. Konta will play Russian world number 61 Margarita Gasparyan next, while Evans takes on French 25th seed Lucas Pouille. Konta is the only British woman left in the singles after Dart's first appearance in the main draw here ended with a 6-3 6-1 defeat by Romanian Ana Bogdan. British number three Norrie also failed to advance on day one of the final Grand Slam tournament of the year, succumbing 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 4-6 6-7 (5-7) 7-6 (7-2) to French qualifier Gregoire Barrere in a match that ticked past four hours. British number one Kyle Edmund opens his campaign on Tuesday against Spaniard Pablo Andujar. Konta, who reached the French Open semi-finals and Wimbledon quarter-finals this year, got off to a flying start in what was a tough first-round draw against former top-10 player Kasatkina. The British 16th seed did not drop a point on her first serve in the opening set but was then held back in the second when unforced errors crept in. She was also left frustrated by a series of line calls that were overruled by the umpire. She was particularly angry after a Kasatkina forehand was called out before the umpire overruled and awarded the point to the Russian and her mood darkened moments later when her own shot was called out and overruled only for the point to be replayed. ""How is 'replay the point'?"" she asked the umpire. ""It's the same situation!"" She went on to lose that set but after taking a bathroom break before the start of the third she returned to deliver more of the dominance she had shown in the opening set. After trading breaks early in the third, Konta got the key breakthrough to go 4-1 up, eventually sealing victory when Kasatkina served back-to-back double faults. Tom Hiddleston (right) was a guest in Konta's players' box Konta was supported by award-winning British actor Tom Hiddleston, who sat courtside in her players' box alongside his co-stars in the Broadway play Betrayal. Konta says she met the 39-year-old, who is most famous for appearing in several Marvel films and BBC drama The Night Manager, when he approached her on a New York street last week. ""I did the Good Samaritan thing and said to myself, 'Don't bother him, he's obviously busy',"" Konta said. ""And then he actually said, 'I don't usually do this but I'm a massive fan,' and I was like, 'What, who? Who else is here?' ""So I invited him to come down and it was a good match for everyone to watch."" Like Konta, Evans started his match comfortably, going two sets up against French world number 57 Mannarino. But the British number two,who split with his coach David Felgateearlier this month, then became increasingly frustrated with himself as errors began to creep in on his serve and he was broken twice to lose the third set. ""I haven't felt comfortable, I was frustrated - I didn't like how I was hitting the ball or serving, I was pretty angry, I wasn't great out there,"" he said in a courtside interview. ""I was fine physically. It was more mental, going through service games - my own games - which I was struggling with."" Evans, who reached the third round on his last outing to Flushing Meadows in 2016, is hoping to build on an excellent grass-court season this year which included reaching the Wimbledon third round and back-to-back Challenger titles. Norrie could not follow Evans' lead despite a battling performance against world number 109 Barrere, who had come through three rounds of qualifying and had started to look like he was cramping in the fifth set. The Briton trailed by two sets but then staged a comeback, saving two match points to force a fourth-set tie-break, which he won to take it to a decider. He served for the match twice but both times allowed the Frenchman back in and paid the price for his errors as Barrere raced to a 6-1 lead in the fifth-set tie-break. The Briton saved another match point but there was nothing he could do about the next one where his racquet was sent flying from his hand by Barrere's powerful winning shot.
