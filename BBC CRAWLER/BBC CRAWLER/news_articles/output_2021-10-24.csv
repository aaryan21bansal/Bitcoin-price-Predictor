Budget: Â£2bn for new homes on derelict land,"Almost Â£2bn will be invested by the government into building new homes on derelict or unused land in England, the chancellor is expected to announce in Wednesday's Budget. The government said 160,000 greener homes could be built on brownfield land the size of 2,000 football pitches. It also pledged to invest Â£9m towards 100 urban ""pocket parks"" across the UK. However, concerns have been raised that not enough affordable homes are being built. Nigel Wilson, chief executive of Legal and General, told the BBC's Today programme the Â£1.8bn investment was the ""right direction of travel"", but was ""not enough scale right now"". He warned people living in smaller cities and towns were being ""left behind"" due to not enough homes being constructed. ""You shouldn't have to be rich to be green,"" he said. ""It's very difficult for poorer people to get on the green (housing) ladder. ""There's a lot of active listening going on (by the government), but we don't just want CGI housing - we want real housing built across the UK."" The government said the funding was part of its efforts to meet the UK's net zero target by 2050. It hopes the plans will help regenerate parts of England and support 50,000 new jobs. Six things that could affect you in the Budget Budget about investing in public services - Sunak The proposals also include creating so-called ""pocket parks"" - measuring the size of a tennis court - to create more green spaces. More than 2.5 million people across the UK currently live further than a 10 minute walk from their closest green space. Tim Farron, Liberal Democrat spokesperson for housing, said people buying new homes would be ""forced to fork out thousands to upgrade their homes in the future to cut their bills and reduce emissions"". ""In his Budget, the chancellor should bring forward new standards for greener homes to ensure all new homes are cheap to heat and produce minimal emissions,"" he said. Zoe Nicholson, Green Party leader of Lewes District Council, said building on brownfield sites made sense, but added the government's investment was an ""absurdly small amount of money"". ""It would be more effective if they handed this Â£2bn of funding to local authorities, which would allow them to build net zero council homes,"" she said,. ""This announcement seems to be little more than a gimmick intended to distract us from the fact that their agenda is to simply 'build, build, build' on our countryside to the benefit of greedy developers."" The Labour Party has not responded to requests for comment. As well as funding for new housing developments, the chancellor is expected to confirm Â£65m to develop new software to help with the digitisation of the town planning system. The first phase will see the system rolled out to up to 175 local authorities in England.

Six things in the Budget to look for,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak will lay out the government's latest tax and spending plans on Wednesday 27 October. It's the government's second Budget of the year, after one in March, and will coincide with the conclusions of the 2021 Spending Review, which will give details of how government will fund public services for the next three years. Responding to the most recent public sector finance data this week, the chancellor said: ""At the Budget and Spending Review next week, I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future."" What are his options? Here we look at six things to watch out for in the Budget that could affect your personal finances. Energy bills are set to rise this winter The chancellor is reportedly considering a cut to the 5% rate of value added tax on household energy bills. The move would be popular and timely against the background of soaring energy bills this winter and is something the government is now able to do because of Brexit. But the move could attract criticism as it would - in effect - mean subsidising fossil fuels ahead of the climate summit. Also, a VAT cut on domestic energy bills would cost about Â£1.5bn a year, which may just be too much for the chancellor. Extra tax on sparkling wine could be cut There are rumours the chancellor is planning to simplify the way that alcohol is taxed in the UK. The 2019 Conservative election manifesto promised to review it, so now could be the time. One suggestion is to reduce the premium on sparkling wine to the same level as still wine, which could knock 83p off a bottle of Champagne or Prosecco. ""The government should stop trying to favour certain parts of the industry, instead focusing on removing distortions and creating a simpler system of alcohol taxes targeted at socially costly drinking,"" said Kate Smith, associate director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The drinks levies have been in place since the 1600s and raise Â£12bn a year for the government. If you sell a second home, you'll pay capital gains tax There are rumours that the current Capital Gains Tax rates may be tinkered with. The tax is paid when people sell assets such as shares or a second home. It's been suggested that rates could be aligned more closely with income tax rates, which could mean scrapping the current tax rates of 10% and 20% (or 18% and 28% for property) and instead making everyone pay income tax rates on their gains. A report by the Office of Tax Simplification, published in November 2020, recommended that CGT rates should be increased to bring them into line with income tax. But it would be unlikely to raise significant extra amounts of tax, as it is typically paid by only about 275,000 taxpayers and raises less than Â£10bn a year. Students could be asked to repay their loans sooner There are reports that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier. The chancellor could do that by lowering the threshold at which people start repaying their student loans, a move that could save the Treasury about Â£2bn a year. Currently, English and Welsh students who enrolled at university after 2012 pay 9% of everything they earn above Â£27,295 per year. They repay the same 9% until the loan is fully repaid or until 30 years after graduating. If the threshold were reduced to Â£25,000, it would cost anyone earning more than the current limit an extra Â£206 a year, while if it were slashed to Â£20,000, it would cost an extra Â£656 a year. Ministers are rumoured to have proposed cutting the threshold to as low as Â£23,000 and giving graduates 40 years as opposed to 30 to repay their debt. A worker washing dishes could see their minimum wage rise In his March Budget, Mr Sunak announced that the National Living Wage (what the governments call the minimum wage) would increase for workers over the age of 23. Since then, the government has come under pressure to help employees further - especially as younger workers have been some of the worst hit by the economic downturn. One solution the chancellor has been reportedly looking at is to increase the National Living Wage by 5.7% to Â£9.42 per hour from its current rate of Â£8.91. That would bring it close to the Living Wage Foundation's current recommendation of Â£9.50 an hour. Pensions savers get generous tax relief The government could raise cash by cutting tax relief on pension savings for those on high salaries. But pension experts warn such a move would not be as simple as it sounds, Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: ""A move to a flat rate of pensions tax relief, rather than the current system where relief is based on the rate of income tax paid, would be far from simple to implement."" He said it would be particularly difficult for defined-benefit schemes and could mean medium to high earners, including doctors in public sector schemes, facing big tax bills. ""Removing higher-rate relief would be a direct attack on middle Britain, leading to people who do the right thing and save for their future being hit with extra tax costs,"" said Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at AJ Bell.

Will PM's NHS plan work?,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We want the NHS backlogs to be cleared as fast as possible"" Boris Johnson chose to visit a hospital he knows only too well to highlight the new funding package for the NHS in England. Hespent anxious days in intensive careat St Thomas' Hospital in central London in April 2020, seriously ill with Covid. The pandemic continues to cast a long shadow over the NHS and that's because of uncertainty over how case numbers and hospital admissions will develop next year. Hospitals have to maintain infection control measures and contingency plans to deal with any further surge in patient numbers. And that has a bearing on how much non-urgent work they can do. MPs approve NHS and social care tax rise New 1.25% health and social care tax to pay for reforms NHS to get Â£5.4bn extra to deal with Covid backlog So that makes it hard to tell how much money will be needed to make inroads on the backlog of operations cancelled at the height of the pandemic. Breaking down the figures shows that NHS England is getting an extra Â£6.6bn in the next financial year for day-to-day services, which falls to Â£3.6bn the following year and then is set at Â£5.6bn in the next 12 months. This is on top of the five-year settlement announced in 2018 which increased NHS funding by Â£20.5bn a year in real terms. The new funding is intended to cover not only costs of reducing waiting lists but also additional spending linked to Covid. There seems to be an underlying assumption that the overall burden on the NHS will be lighter after next year with less virus-related pressure. Mr Johnson was visiting a training centre at St Thomas' and there were no patients being cared for so masks were not required when we sat down for an interview. He talked of the nine million extra treatments which, in his view, the NHS could do as a result of the higher funding. But there was no attempt to sugar the pill as he added that scale of the challenge could not be underestimated. I pressed him on whetherthe number waiting more than a year for a routine operation, at more than 300,000, would come down significantly following the new investment. He would not be drawn on a target either on that measure or the waiting list number. He acknowledged that ""things may well get more difficult before they get better"". Judging by the prime minister's responses there is no clear view in Downing Street what will happen to waiting lists. He was anxious not to give a hostage to fortune by making predictions on numbers of the direction of travel. Whitehall officials will have drawn up a range of scenarios with widely varying outcomes. The documents accompanying the health and care announcement refer to a 30% increase in hospital activity from pre-pandemic levels, but note that this is an aim rather than a pledge. Mr Johnson seems to be putting his faith in social care investment taking the pressure off hospitals by getting older and frail patients discharged more swiftly. But a rapid improvement in outcomes seems highly unlikely with the new social care funding taking time to kick in. Representatives of health service organisations are clear that what has now been promised to the NHS frontline is not sufficient to meet the demands on the service. They had called for Â£10bn more in the next financial year for day-to-day running costs in England. Matthew Taylor, chief executive of the NHS Confederation, said: ""The NHS is grateful for this extra investment and it will help reduce the backlog - the problem is that its only enough to address that backlog and if the costs of Covid continue it won't be enough."" Workforce is another longer term issue which isn't fully addressed in the new policy statement. Many staff are exhausted and, while willing to work extra hours to get through more operations and procedures, may struggle to keep up the increased workload for a sustained period. Vacancies and rota gaps can't be resolved overnight as training new staff takes several years. As the Institute for Fiscal Studies has noted the NHS has historically needed more money than original plans and allocations with patient demand growing more rapidly than expected. It is unlikely this time that there will be a departure from precedent.

Extra Â£5.9bn pledged for NHS backlog in England,"This video can not be played Javid says Â£5.9bn for the NHS is ""new money"" to tackle waiting lists The NHS in England is to receive an extra Â£5.9bn in this week's Budget, the government has announced. The money will be used to help clear the record backlog of people waiting for tests and scans, which has been worsened by the pandemic, and also to buy equipment and improve IT. Chancellor Rishi Sunak called the announcement ""game-changing"". Health bodies welcomed the latest pledge but said it would not solve the problem of staff shortages. Sajid Javid, the health secretary, said the funding was ""new money"" and that Mr Sunak would set out exactly where it was coming from during Wednesday's Budget and Spending Review. A simple guide to Budget 2021 Six things that could affect you in the Budget Budget 2021: Five things to look out for More than five million people are waiting for NHS hospital treatment in England, with hundreds of thousands waiting more than a year. The Â£5.9bn is on top of the Â£12bn a yearthat was announced in September.,external. That money will be raised through tax increases - the rise in National Insurance and, from 2022, the Health and Social Care Levy - and will be spent on resources such as staffing. The Â£5.9bn will be used to pay for physical infrastructure and equipment - not day-to-day spending. Some of the Â£5.9bn - Â£2.3bn - will be used to fund more diagnostic tests, like CT, MRI and ultrasound scans, the government said. More clinics in shopping centres for scans and tests -which the government had already announced- will be opened. These will help clear the backlog of tests by the end of this Parliament, the government said. Also included in the Â£5.9bn total is: Â£1.5bn on beds, equipment and new ""surgical hubs"" Â£2.1bn on improving IT and digital technology within the NHS A proportionate amount will also go to the health services in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Access to tests and scans is a real bottleneck in the system at the moment, slowing down the ability of the NHS to work its way through the backlog in routine care and, sometimes, delaying the diagnosis of cancer. It has been known for years the NHS does not have enough equipment to carry out tests and scans. And the machines it has are ageing. The problems mean as demand has increased, performance has deteriorated. The aim is to get these tests done within six weeks of referral, unless it is an urgent cancer case. But currently around a quarter of patients wait longer than that. Before the pandemic fewer than 5% did. The funding will help, in time, improve the situation. But the big issue that it does not tackle is staffing - there is a shortage of specialists to carry out these tests. Around one in 10 posts are currently vacant. There are various reasons for this, including more part-time working, the numbers retiring and problems recruiting internationally because of the pandemic. Buying new machines is much easier than training, recruiting and retaining staff. Until that is resolved, many are sceptical about what this announcement will actually achieve. Waiting lists have grown as routine operations were cancelled throughout the pandemic and people who put off seeking help for symptoms come forward. Some of those in the healthcare sector warned it was not enough to keep up with costs and demand. Christopher Rigby, an NHS radiographer from Yorkshire, said: ""We haven't got the workforce to staff the hospitals we have now let alone all these new centres."" NHS Providers - which speaks for hospital and other NHS trusts - warned the health service needed more staff to deliver services. A body representing healthcare leaders, the NHS Confederation, said the funding ""falls short of what is needed to get services completely back on track"". The NHS is sending out a further two million invites for Covid booster jabs this week. The health secretary said ""we should actively be looking at"" making jabs mandatory for NHS staff, as they are for care workers. Mr Javid told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he would wear a face covering during Wednesday's Budget announcement in the Commons. But he said now was not time to activate England's ""Plan B"", that would make face masks mandatory in many places. Are you an NHS professional or patient affected by the NHS backlog?

David Schwimmer, aka Ross,thanked Tyler,external""for playing such a wonderful, unforgettable role"" and ""for being such a big hearted gentleman and all around mensch off screen"". ""You will be missed, buddy,"" he went on. Tyler appeared in almost 150 episodes of the comedy, which ran from 1994 to 2004. Gunther was and remains a hugely popular character among fans. Tyler's manager said the actor ""passed away peacefully at his home in Los Angeles on Sunday morning"". A statement added: ""The world knew him as Gunther (the seventh Friend)... but Michael's loved ones knew him as an actor, musician, cancer-awareness advocate, and loving husband. If you met him once you made a friend for life. ""Wanting to help as many people as possible, he bravely shared his story and became a campaigner for those with a prostate to get a... blood test as early as 40-years-old."" David Crane, who co-created Friends, told the BBC that Tyler started as an extra on the show and was given the role because he could work the coffee machine. ""As time went on, I think we realised he's funny - a really good actor,"" Crane said. ""We just kept giving him more and more, and when we realised there was a storyline about his secret love for Rachel, it was just the gift that kept on giving."" On Tyler's comedic timing, Crane added: ""His delivery was impeccable, he was so good that we found ourselves going to him for the punchline for a whole scene or for a whole episode. ""With just the littlest opportunity he created this indelible character."" Tyler revisited the Central Perk in 2015 as part of a Warner Bros studio tour In May, Tyler made a brief appearance on the Friends reunion special via Zoom. ""It was the most memorable 10 years of my life, honestly,"" the actor said at the time. ""I could not have imagined just a better experience. All these guys were fantastic and just a joy to work with. It felt very, very special."" Warner Bros Television, one of the co-producers of the sitcom, said Tyler was ""a beloved actor and integral part of our Friends family"". He continued to perform in recent years while undergoing treatment for cancer. He also starred in two short films - The Gesture and the Word, and Processing - winning best actor awards at film festivals. In 2021, his spoken word performance of Stephen Kalinich's poem If You Knew was adapted into a short video to raise awareness for the Prostate Cancer Foundation.

Two of those have since died, the force said, while the third was treated for non-life threatening injuries. Brentwood and Ongar's Conservative MP, Alex Burghart, called it a ""very dark day for our town"". Police said they were ""working to establish how the boys died"" and post-mortem examinations would take place. The BBC understands the boys are suspected to have suffered stab wounds. Police were called to an area of Brentwood, Essex, in the early hours of Sunday Det Ch Insp Andy Clarkson, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: ""We understand there will naturally be shock and concern within the community after such a tragic loss of life. ""But, at this stage, we do not believe there is any wider threat to the public."" Forensics officers have been working in a tent beside Regency Court A neighbour said he had tried to warn police about anti-social behaviour in the area in recent weeks. Mark MacIntosh told the PA news agency he had only just arrived home before he heard shouting and screaming coming from a nearby residence. ""I realise that what I heard was somebody yelling out in pain who may have lost his life shortly thereafter,"" he said. He claimed the area had been dealing with problems which stemmed from a multi-storey car park that overlooks the scene. ""There's constant anti-social behaviour, drinking, drugs, shouting, fighting,"" he said. ""I've heard people saying 'I'm going to kill him' up there. I've come down and broken up a knife fight down at the bottom here before."" Mr MacIntosh said he had warned police ""three weeks ago"" that something bad would happen if they did not arrange ""constant patrols"" of the area. Police said two of the three injured boys died Ch Insp Mark Barber, of Essex Police, had earlier said there would be a ""highly-visible police presence"" in Brentwood following the deaths. ""I am acutely aware that this incident will shock many within the community,"" he said. ""My officers will be there throughout the day - they will be there to reassure you and keep you safe. ""If you have any concerns or information on the incident then, please, do not hesitate to come forward and speak to them."" Police urged witnesses from Regency Court and central Brentwood to speak to them Mr Burghart said: ""This a very dark day for our town. My deepest condolences to the families of the boys who have so dreadfully lost their lives.

Colombian drug lord to be sent to US after capture,"Dairo Antonio Ãsuga, better known as Otoniel, led Colombia's largest criminal gang Colombia has announced that the country's most wanted drug trafficker will be extradited to the US after he was captured in a raid. Dairo Antonio Ãsuga, known as Otoniel, was seized after a joint army, air force and police operation on Saturday. He led the country's largest criminal gang and has been on the US Drug Enforcement Agency's most wanted list for years. US officials had placed a $5m (Â£3.6m) bounty on his head. They accused him of importing at least 73 metric tonnes of cocaine into the country between 2003 and 2014. Colombia's Defence Minister Diego Molano told El Tiempo newspaper that the next step for officials was to comply with the US extradition order. Authorities have now taken Otoniel to a military base in the capital BogotÃ¡ ahead of his extradition, according to newspaper El Nuevo Siglo. Being locked up in a jail thousands of miles from their home country, in a place where they have few connections and no means to intimidate guards or prison directors is a fate many Colombian drug traffickers fear. The late drug lord Pablo Escobar said that he would prefer ""lying in a grave in Colombia than being locked up in a cell in the US"". Except for a six-year period between 1991 and 1997, when Colombia's constitution banned extraditions of Colombian citizens, a number of top level traffickers facing indictments in the US have been sent to stand trial there. Among them are the co-founder of the MedellÃ­n cartel,Carlos Lehder, drug lordDaniel ""The Madman"" Barreraand paramilitary leaderSalvatore Mancuso,external. Otoniel, who was indicted in the the US in 2009, will faces a number of charges, including sending shipments of cocaine to the US, killing police officers and recruiting children. Otoniel was captured in his rural hideout in Antioquia province in north-western Colombia, close to the border with Panama. The operation involved 500 soldiers supported by 22 helicopters. One police officer was killed. Otoniel had used a network of rural safe houses to move around and evade the authorities, and did not use a phone, instead relying on couriers for communication. In the past, police have found special orthopaedic mattresses for Otoniel in these sparse homes, as he suffered back pain from a herniated disc. Police chief Jorge Vargas has said the drug lord was fearful of capture, ""never approaching inhabited areas"". BACKGROUND: Colombia's hunt for an elusive drug lord But El Tiempo reported that authorities managed to pinpoint the location where he was eventually captured two weeks ago. Chief Vargas said his movements were traced by more than 50 signal intelligence experts using satellite imagery. US and UK agencies were involved in the search. Mr Duque described the operation as ""the biggest penetration of the jungle ever seen in the military history of our country"". This video can not be played Dairo Antonio Ãsuga was led away in handcuffs following the raid Colombia's armed forces later released a photo showing its soldiers guarding Otoniel, who was in handcuffs and wearing rubber boots. There have been several huge operations involving thousands of officers to capture the 50-year-old in recent years. There's no doubt this is seen as a coup by Colombian authorities - they've been trying to capture Otoniel for several years now. The Gulf Cartel is a formidable and violent organisation with a great deal of power. And the comparisons with Pablo Escobar are understandable. Otoniel is a household name and has been hugely powerful, especially in the north west of the country. ""In South America, there is no larger cocaine trafficker,"" says Toby Muse, author of Kilo: Inside the Cocaine Cartels. ""We are living in the golden age of cocaine, we are producing more cocaine than ever - that's a fact."" But the parallels perhaps stop there - Otoniel is not as well-known outside of Colombia. And speak to people who lived in the country at the peak of Pablo Escobar's power, many feel they were more frightening times. The question is, will Otoniel's capture impact the trade of the illicit drug? It's hard to know now. We'll have to see what happens in the coming months but most experts seem to think that while demand for cocaine remains strong, it's likely there will be new ""capos"" rising to the top to replace him. Born in Antioquia in the early 1970s, Otoniel jumped between several guerrilla and paramilitary groups - including the Farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), the major Marxist-Leninist rebel group, and the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), a far-right paramilitary and drug trafficking gang. When the AUC dissolved in 2005, he began working for the drug lord Daniel RendÃ³n Herrera, known as Don Mario - head of the UrabeÃ±os, which later became known as the Gulf Clan. Otoniel then took charge of the group after its previous leader - his brother - was killed by police in a raid on a New Year's Eve party almost 10 years ago. Colombia's security forces labelled the gang as the country's most powerful criminal organisation, while authorities in the US describe it as ""heavily armed [and] extremely violent"". The gang, which operates in many provinces and has extensive international connections, is engaged in drug and people smuggling, illegal gold mining and extortion. It is believed to have about 1,800 armed members, who are mainly recruited from far-right paramilitary groups. Members have been arrested in Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Peru and Spain. The gang controls many of the routes used to smuggle drugs from Colombia to the US, and as far away as Russia. The Colombian government, however, believes it has decimated its numbers in recent years, forcing many leading members to hide in remote regions in the jungle.

Fears GCSE science is being dumbed down in Wales,"From 2025, physics, chemistry and biology will no longer be offered as separate GCSE subjects A ""dumbing down"" of science at GCSE level could see Wales ""miss out on some brilliant scientists in the future"", an academic has warned. From 2025, physics, chemistry and biology willno longer be offered as separate subjects. Instead, pupils will study for one integrated science award which combines the three subjects and will be worth two GCSEs. Qualifications Wales said integrating subjects allowed pupils a mix of GCSEs. Dr Lowri Mainwaring, academic team lead in biomedical sciences at Cardiff Metropolitan University, said: ""I worry about the message combining those three GCSEs together will give pupils. 'You can't be what you can't see' Women in science: 'Go for it' Pupils' university access success 'depends on school' ""This dumbing down, if you like, or this convergence of science, what does that tell our pupils about science? That it is maybe not as important as it should be? ""The one thing we've learned over the past 20 months is that science is extremely important, without scientists all over the world we wouldn't have an understanding of Covid at all and we wouldn't have a vaccine."" Dr Lowri Mainwaring fears the change could make it harder for GCSE science pupils to progress to A-level She said she understood why Qualifications Wales wanted to ""create more space"" in the curriculum for students to study other subjects, but feared the change could lead to fewer pupils doing A-levels and degrees in science. ""There's already a big jump between GCSE and A-level, by bringing the curriculum down a notch or changing it at GCSE that jump could be even higher,"" she said. ""How do we ensure that those who still want to go on to study science at a higher level are not afraid to do so? ""We need to motivate more people into science, and not say 'it's OK for you to do less of it', because I think we could potentially miss out on some brilliant scientists in the future, because they don't have the confidence [to progress]."" Prof Alma Harris says it will be harder to convince employers and universities outside Wales about the new GCSE Prof Alma Harris, from the department of education and childhood studies at Swansea University, echoed these concerns. ""My worry really is for the students and the way they can progress into university or employment with these new GCSE qualifications,"" said Prof Harris. ""But my main concern about this integrated approach is the subject knowledge and the amount of time the teachers will have to cover those respective subjects when they're integrated into one GCSE. ""Those three science subjects are very different in their nature, demand very different skills and abilities... to compartmentalise them would seem reasonable, but to compress them I think raises some questions."" Eluned Parrott says pupils needed to know their grades for individual science subjects within the new GCSE Eluned Parrott, head of Wales at the Institute of Physics, said: ""I think having a single root for all the sciences together is quite a positive change, but we think it's really important to retain the name and individual grades for individual subjects, because actually the sciences are quite different in character."" Asked how the new GCSE would be seen by employers and universities outside Wales, she said: ""Wales has got the right to set its own educational agenda in very much the same way as Scotland does, and it will diverge from from England. ""What we have to make sure is that the value and the quality of the qualifications that Welsh students get are comparable to those in other parts of the UK and other parts of the world."" Prof Mary Gagen says putting subjects ""in little boxes"" is ""part of the reason we are facing a climate emergency"" Prof Mary Gagen, from the department of geography at Swansea University, said she knew from speaking to schools through the university'sScience for Schools,externalscheme that teachers had ""a lot of anxiety"" about the new curriculum. ""One of our teachers summed up their concerns as feeling like there is a big experiment going in Wales with the new curriculum and children's futures, they have real anxiety about that taking place alongside a pandemic,"" she said. ""They feel that what Welsh education needs right now is stability and investment."" The change to science is part of amajor overhaul of education, which will see separate English language and literature GCSEs merged and new GCSEs, including engineering and manufacturing and film and digital media, created. Theresults of a public consultation,externalwere published in July. The report that followed the consultation, produced for Qualifications Wales by Opinion Research Services, acknowledged that when asked about the plans for the new science GCSE, there was a ""fairly equal split in reactions"" among the 355 people who responded - 42% were in favour and 40% were against. A new double award will replace the existing science GCSEs, including the existing science double award The new GCSE will include the key aspects of biology, chemistry and physics and make it clear how they link to each other, Qualifications Wales said. It said it would work with stakeholders to agree the content and assessment of the new GCSE. It is down to individual schools to decide which GCSEs are mandatory and which are optional so the new GCSE may not be compulsory in some schools. Qualifications Wales said it was ""still open to the possibility of developing other made-for-Wales qualifications to sit alongside the new GCSE science qualification"". Catrin Verrall from Qualifications Wales said the new GCSE would be designed to allow progression to A-level sciences Catrin Verrall, a senior manager at Qualifications Wales, said: ""Around 20% of schools in Wales don't offer the separate science GCSEs in biology, chemistry and physics, and so this means that not all learners in Wales are currently given the same degree of choice about which science GCSE [they take]... so we're adopting a common GCSE offer for all learners in Wales and that would support greater equality of opportunity. ""We're also integrating subjects in some other areas, so maths and English as well, and the purpose of integrating subjects is to give learners and schools freedom to choose a mix of GCSEs that reflect the breadth and balance of the new curriculum."" She said universities have ""indicated a clear preference for learners with a breadth of different learning and experiences"". She added: ""These qualifications are a really exciting opportunity for us to really reimagine qualifications that are fit for the future and relevant and engaging for our young learners in Wales.""

Tesco say website and app down after hack attempt,"Tesco's website and app are now up and running again, following a service outage that began on Saturday. The retail giant's services had crashed after what Tesco said were attempts ""to interfere with our systems"". The possible hack at Britain's biggest supermarket began with shoppers unable to order goods and track deliveries. Tesco initially said there was ""an issue"", but in a Sunday update said there had been deliberate disruption. The supermarket later confirmed onTwitter,externalthat its groceries website and app were back up and running, but it was temporarily using a ""virtual waiting room"" to manage the high volume of traffic. Why does the internet keep breaking? Tesco said the attempts to compromise its systems were made overnight from Friday to Saturday, but was not more specific. According to Downdetector,external, which monitors website outages, shoppers began reporting issues early on Saturday morning. The scale of the problem, and whether the issue was nationwide or only in certain areas, remained unclear on Sunday night. Shoppers complained over the weekend about a lack of information, with many wanting to know how to cancel orders and whether they can get money back. Earlier on Sunday, a Tesco spokesperson said: ""There is no reason to believe that this issue impacts customer data and we continue to take ongoing action to make sure all data stays safe. ""Since yesterday, we've been experiencing disruption to our online grocery website and app. ""An attempt was made to interfere with our systems which has caused problems with the search function on the site. We're working hard to fully restore all services and apologise for the inconvenience."" Meanwhile, shoppers were trying to change or cancel deliveries, or switch to other supermarkets. Tesco customer Chris Hodgson, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, told the BBC the app had not been working properly for ""a couple of days"". He picked up his click-and-collect order on Sunday, but had only managed to do half his weekly shopping before the website went down. ""The collection member of staff hadn't been informed of any issues,"" Mr Hodgson said. ""After I showed him the website, he said it was an unusually quiet day. ""I asked if I could reject the whole order and was informed I could only reject substituted items. I'll have to go out again this afternoon. If you're on a budget it's annoying, it's an inconvenience. ""Nothing from Tesco, no way of contacting them. Really poor by Tesco,"" he said. Tesco has opened a check-out free store where customers use the app to choose groceries and leave with them Another customer, Rebecca, from North Wales, got a delivery of 120 Pepsi drinks on Sunday instead of her order. ""We were meant to get a week's shop this morning,"" she told the BBC. ""The website was down all yesterday so we couldn't amend or cancel. All we received was 120 cans of Pepsi Max."" Rebecca, who asked for her surname not to be used, added: ""I'd been going in to the order over and over yesterday, right up until the 11.45 deadline. I didn't try calling, there must be thousands in the same boat. ""Fortunately someone suggested that Asda had delivery slots for today so I managed to place an order last night (just before their deadline) for enough food for the next few days."" Tesco initially said on Saturday it was ""working hard to get things back up and running"", and apologised for the inconvenience. The firm's online sales have soared recently, especially during lockdown, with the supermarket ramping up capacity. Its latest financial results say the scale and reach of its online operations are ""unmatched in the UK"", with total sales topping Â£6bn. Tesco said it had 6.6 million app users. Tesco has faced previous hacks. In 2014 about 2,000 customer accounts were deactivated amid fears login details were compromised, and there was also a cyber attack on the supermarket's bank arm. But the problem is becoming more common globally. Earlier this year, international meat manufacturer JBS had to shut down about 25% of its operation. And large swathes of US fuel supply were closed after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline. Few sectors have escaped the attention of cyber-criminals, with airlines, banks, universities, local authorities, utilities and tech giants such as Microsoft all having faced attacks on their computer systems.

Roberts, 42, who hosts Weekend Breakfast, said she was diagnosed at the start of the month and would have surgery to remove a tumour on Monday. ""So far the outlook is positive and I feel so lucky I can be treated. It's just the start of my journey but I'm going to give it everything,"" she said. The former Big Brother star missed both her radio shows this weekend. The radio DJ, from Southport, Merseyside, revealed her diagnosis inan Instagram post,,externalsaying she had sought medical advice after struggling with her digestion ""for a while"". She wrote: ""It's all happened so quickly and I'm so sorry to post something like this on here but I hope it helps anyone who might be worrying, or suffering in silence. ""As I've learned over the last few weeks, there's no 'normal' with cancer. Sadly it can affect anyone, at any age, anytime. It doesn't discriminate. Early detection can save your life.""

""It's the most horrible feeling desperately wanting her to get in that hospital ASAP but desperately not wanting to be without her."" She said it had been hard to get her head around how ""unfair"" the diagnosis was as Roberts did ""all the things they say help you prevent cancer"" and didn't do the things that were supposed to put you at higher risk. ""But I now understand it can happen to anyone. Cancer's never fair is it?"" A Radio 1 statement said: ""Our love and support is with Adele, Kate and their families at this very difficult time. ""Everyone at Radio 1, along with millions of listeners, wishes her a speedy recovery and we look forward to welcoming Adele back on air soon."" Singer Jessie Ware and actress Suranne Jones were among those to send their support to Roberts on Instagram, along with some of her BBC colleagues. Radio presenter Scott Mills wrote: ""We all love you Adele. It's amazing you posted this. You're awesome and you've got this."" Radio 2 broadcaster Sara Cox said Roberts was ""brilliant and brave to share this to help people"", adding that she was sending her ""a thousand gentle hugs"". Adele Roberts, who was part of the BBC's presenting team for the London Marathon in 2019, has competed twice in the event Roberts rose to fame after appearing on the third series of Channel 4's Big Brother series in 2002. Contestants that year included ITV's This Morning presenter Alison Hammond, and Jade Goody, who died in 2009 after being diagnosed with cervical cancer. She joined the BBC in 2012 as part of the Radio 1Xtra team, before moving to Radio 1 in 2015 to host the Early Breakfast Show. She took over the Weekend Breakfast programme earlier this year.

Colombia's most wanted drug lord captured,"This video can not be played Dairo Antonio Ãsuga was led away in handcuffs following the raid Colombia's most wanted drug trafficker and the leader of the country's largest criminal gang has been captured. Dairo Antonio Ãsuga, better known as Otoniel, was seized after a joint operation by the army, air force and police on Saturday. The government had offered a $800,000 (Â£582,000) reward for information about his whereabouts, while the US placed a $5m bounty on his head. President IvÃ¡n Duque hailed Otoniel's capture in a televised video message. ""This is the biggest blow against drug trafficking in our country this century,"" he said. ""This blow is only comparable to the fall of Pablo Escobar in the 1990s."" Otoniel was captured in his rural hideout in Antioquia province in north-western Colombia, close to the border with Panama. The operation involved 500 soldiers supported by 22 helicopters. One police officer was killed. Otoniel had used a network of rural safe houses to move around and evade the authorities, and did not use a phone, instead relying on couriers for communication. In the past, police have found special orthopaedic mattresses for Otoniel in these sparse homes, as he suffered back pain from a herniated disc. Police chief Jorge Vargas has said the drug lord was fearful of capture, ""never approaching inhabited areas"". BACKGROUND: Colombia's hunt for an elusive drug lord But El Tiempo newspaper said that authorities managed to pinpoint the location where he was eventually captured two weeks ago. Chief Vargas said his movements were traced by more than 50 signal intelligence experts using satellite imagery. US and UK agencies were involved in the search. Mr Duque, quoted by AFP news agency, described the operation as ""the biggest penetration of the jungle ever seen in the military history of our country"". Otoniel was escorted by the security forces after his capture - and some posed for photos Colombia's armed forces later released a photo showing its soldiers guarding Otoniel, who was in handcuffs and wearing rubber boots. There have been several huge operations involving thousands of officers to capture the 50-year-old in recent years, but until now none has been successful. There's no doubt this is seen as a coup by Colombian authorities - they've been trying to capture Otoniel for several years now. The Gulf Cartel is a formidable and violent organisation with a great deal of power. And the comparisons with Pablo Escobar are understandable. Otoniel is a household name and has been hugely powerful, especially in the north west of the country. ""In South America, there is no larger cocaine trafficker,"" says Toby Muse, author of Kilo: Inside the Cocaine Cartels. ""We are living in the golden age of cocaine, we are producing more cocaine than ever - that's a fact."" But the parallels perhaps stop there - Otoniel is not as well-known outside of Colombia. And speak to people who lived in the country at the peak of Pablo Escobar's power, many feel they were more frightening times. The question is, will Otoniel's capture impact the trade of the illicit drug? It's hard to know now. We'll have to see what happens in the coming months but most experts seem to think that while demand for cocaine remains strong, it's likely there will be new ""capos"" rising to the top to replace him. Born in Antioquia in the early 1970s, Otoniel jumped between several guerrilla and paramilitary groups - including the Farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), the major Marxist-Leninist rebel group, and the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), a far-right paramilitary and drug trafficking gang. When the AUC dissolved in 2005, he began working for the drug lord Daniel RendÃ³n Herrera, known as Don Mario - head of the UrabeÃ±os, which later became known as the Gulf Clan. Otoniel then took charge of the group after its previous leader - his brother - was killed by police in a raid on a New Year's Eve party almost 10 years ago. Colombia's security forces labelled the gang as the country's most powerful criminal organisation, while authorities in the US describe it as ""heavily armed [and] extremely violent"". The gang, which operates in many provinces and has extensive international connections, is engaged in drug and people smuggling, illegal gold mining and extortion. It is believed to have about 1,800 armed members, who are mainly recruited from far-right paramilitary groups. Members have been arrested in Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Peru and Spain. The gang controls many of the routes used to smuggle drugs from Colombia to the US, and as far away as Russia. The Colombian government, however, believes it has decimated its numbers in recent years, forcing many leading members to hide in remote regions in the jungle. Otoniel now faces a number of charges, including sending shipments of cocaine to the US, killing police officers and recruiting children. He was indicted in the US in 2009, and faces extradition proceedings, which could see him eventually appear in court in New York.

Kobe Bryant's wife first heard of his death online,"Vanessa Bryant is suing the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department Vanessa Bryant, the widow of Kobe Bryant, said she learned about the death of her husband by seeing ""RIP Kobe"" notifications on her phone. Basketball star Bryant died with his daughter, 13-year-old Gianna, and seven others in the January 2020 crash. Ms Bryant is suing the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department for negligence and invasion of privacy. She alleges that officers shared graphic photos of the crash scene, including Kobe and Gianna's bodies. During a deposition, a county attorney asked Ms Bryant when she was first made aware of the crash. Ms Bryant said that she was informed by a family assistant that her husband and daughter had been in a helicopter accident, but that five people had survived. She thought that they were likely among the survivors. But then messages started popping up on her phone. ""I was holding onto my phone, because obviously I was trying to call my husband back, and all these notifications started popping up on my phone, saying 'RIP Kobe. RIP Kobe. RIP Kobe',"" Ms Bryant said, according to a transcript of the deposition. ""My life will never be the same without my husband and daughter,"" she added. Kobe Bryant, his 13-year-old daughter and seven others died when a helicopter crashed in California last year In March, Ms Bryant published the names of Los Angeles County police officers who she said shared graphic photos of the scene of the crash. She alleges that one of the officers shared with a bartender photos of Kobe Bryant's body and the others distributed ""gratuitous photos of the dead children, parents, and coaches"". The Los Angeles Times newspaper reported in February last year that an internal police investigationfound officers shared photos of victims' remains.,external ""I don't think it's fair that I'm here today having to fight for accountability,"" Ms Bryant said.

A giant who had his controversies Gianna Bryant: Young basketball talent killed alongside father Vanessa Bryant, her mother's lawsuit and the value of childcare Ms Bryant said that she had asked Sheriff Alex Villanueva to make sure nobody took photos at the scene. The sheriff's department has declined to comment on the pending lawsuit. Ms Bryant said that she has kept the clothes her husband and daughter were wearing when they died. ""And if their clothes represent the condition of their bodies, I cannot imagine how someone could be so callous and have no regard for them or our friends, and just share the images as if they were animals on a street,"" she said.

Disruption ahead as busy roads close for conference,"Disruption is expected in Glasgow over the weekend as the first major road closures for COP26 take effect. Routes including the Clyde Arc and part of the Clydeside Expressway closed on Saturday night while Finnieston Street will only allow local access on Sunday. Rail strikes also look set to go aheadfor the duration of the summit, following a breakdown in union talks. The climate conference is expected to draw 25,000 delegates and runs from 31 October to 12 November. Security is expected to be tight, particularly around the attendance of some 120 world leaders, and police have announcedhow they plan to approach disruptive climate activists. Strikes and closures during Glasgow climate summit How will road closures affect Glasgow? 'I'm worried how my business will fare with COP26' Road closures will last until Monday 15 November. Some days are expected to be busier than others, with the biggest disruption expected on Saturday 6 November which has been designated as the Global Day For Climate Justice. About 100,000 protesters are expected in Glasgow, with a march which begins at Kelvingrove Park at noon before making its way to Glasgow Green for about 15:00. People across the city can expect to be affected by delays, diversions or road congestion, from pedestrians and cyclists to drivers and those using public transport. This video can not be played Roads in Glasgow close ahead of the COP26 climate change summit The RMT confirmed that strikes during COP26 would go ahead, with ScotRail workers planning action from 1-12 November amid an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. The union's general secretary Mick Lynch said the decision to press on with industrial action was made on Friday after the train company ""failed to get serious"" in talks with the union. He said ScotRail had missed ""a golden opportunity"" for progress by offering ""nothing of any consequence"". Mr Lynch continued that there was still time to avoid ""the chaos of a transport shutdown during COP26 if the key players get back with some serious proposals"". Government 'perplexed' at RMT over ScotRail strike A Scottish government spokesperson welcomed that three out of four railway trade unions had now accepted, or recommended acceptance of, the pay offer. That offer amounts to a 2.5% pay increase backdated to 1 April 2021, and a 2.2% increase effective from 1 April 2022, with a one-off Â£300 payment for staff working during COP26. But the government said it was ""disappointed"" the offer was rejected by the RMT. A spokesperson said after this, ScotRail sought to focus the issue ofrest day working,external, which the RMT said needed to be addressed. However, an offer on rest day working was ""rejected out of hand"" and the union returned to the issue of pay, according to the government. It said: ""We don't think anyone, including the membership of the RMT, wants to disrupt COP26 or the chance to showcase Scotland's green, clean railway to a global audience. We hope that encompasses the RMT leadership too, although their approach to seeking resolution does appear to call this into question."" Meanwhile, Ian McConnell, of ScotRail, said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the union had ""point blank rejected"" the latest proposal. He accused the leadership of having ""moved the goalposts without consulting their members"". Mr McConnell said time was running out to reach agreement, adding: ""It seems RMT bosses are intent on sabotaging Scotland's railway's role during COP26."" Contingency plans were being developed to provide a core service for the duration of the summit, he said. Appearing onBBC Radio Scotland, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken urged people to plan ahead of travelling and check theGet Ready Glasgow,externalwebsite for more information. Ms Aitken also said cleansing teams were out clearing up fly-tipping ""hotspots"" after the issue of mounting rubbish in the city was raised onQuestion Time. About 1,500 Glasgow City Council staff including those in refuse collection and cleansingplan to strike for a week during the climate summitdue to an ongoing pay dispute. Union members rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 a year, and are instead calling for a Â£2,000 pay rise for staff. Concerns have also been raised about the impact the summit could have on Scotland's Covid cases. Prof Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, tweeted,externalthat a mass event such as COP26 ""will cause an increase in cases"" and could ""trigger a need for further restrictions"". Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence for NHS Grampian, said the risk of infection during mass events was high even if safety precautions were in place. Shewarnedmany of those attending would not be fully vaccinated. Ms Evans added: ""We've got a really fragile situation, the number of cases in Scotland have been plateauing - plateaued at higher levels than ever before."" ""You're looking at numbers we probably haven't seen before, whether that leads to restrictions will depend on the scale of this. I would say the stakes are really high,"" she said. The Scottish government has said appropriate mitigation measures will be in place for the summit and Covid-19 continues to be closely monitored. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

What can you do to reduce your carbon footprint?Public figures in Wales tell us what they are doing differently to combat climate change.Wales,"Taking public transport instead of driving a car is one way of reducing your carbon footprint The UK is preparing to host a summit on climate change that could lead to major changes in our everyday lives. The world is warming because of fossil fuel emissions caused by humans and, asthe COP26 meeting approaches, the focus has turned to what we can do to reduce our harmful impact on the environment.

She added that ""thinking through those little things you do in life"" often leads to a more sustainable way of doing them. ""In my early career, when I first started in the world of work, I was driving to work to get to work for 9am, flexible working wasn't a thing,"" she said. ""What I reflect on now - we're probably about 25 years on from that - is that when I'm going into the office I'll drop the kids off at school and I'll get the bus at 09:15 and that bus is full of parents from the school who've just dropped their kids off. ""That is now my absolute norm, where the norm before was I'd get in my car and I'd drive to work."" Wales' Climate Change Minister Julie James was brought up with an awareness of the need to protect the planet As the Welsh government's minister for climate change, it would probably not go down too well if Julie James drove a thirsty vehicle and never recycled. But the self-confessed ""ageing tree-hugging hippy"" is a life-long vegetarian, and her parents made her aware of climate change from an early age. ""My parents were vegetarians in the 1950s, which was very unusual, so I grew up feeling quite unusual,"" she said. ""Weirdly they were already aware of climate change because we lived between Wales and northern Canada, and in northern Canada it was already obvious that there were changes in the world. ""So I grew up in a family that was already that way inclined, so we've always been a bit 'repair, not buy new' and all that sort of stuff."" Ms James said people ""might be surprised how old quite a lot of the clothes in my wardrobe are and how many things we've got around my house that have been repaired and not replaced"". But she added there could always be further effort and ""small changes are important"". The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? ""Everybody can still do more, can't they? Everybody can still think more about whether they need to travel, whether they need to buy that new thing, whether they have the optimal heating arrangements in their house."" But she admitted finding solutions to decarbonising the home was ""proving quite difficult"". ""One of the things we're trying to do in Wales is make it easier for people who are privileged enough to own their own home to be able to decarbonise it with the right skills and equipment and so on,"" she said. ""I'm looking to shift to an electric vehicle as soon as I can. The cost of those technologies is reducing and one of the big efforts the government is going to make is to use its purchasing power to make it as cheap as possible and as easy as possible for people to make those changes to their own lifestyles in order for us all to play our part."" The Very Rev Nigel Williams wants to install solar panels on the roof of St Asaph Cathedral Everyone can help the fight against climate change, according to the Very Reverend Nigel Williams. He is the Dean of St Asaph Cathedral and chairs the Eco-Church Group for the diocese ""I moved to a green energy tariff on my home two years ago. It was a conscious decision to reduce our carbon footprint at home,"" said Dean Williams. ""I'm aiming to do the same with St Asaph Cathedral by installing solar panels on the roof, which would cover all our heating and lighting requirements and the energy needs of our tearoom. ""In addition, we'll be investing in a new robotic electric lawnmower to keep the cathedral grounds tidy and move away from using petrol. Eventually, the mower will charge from the solar panels during the day and cut the grass every night. ""Not only will we be moving away from fossil fuel use, but we will no longer have to find space to store and compost the grass cuttings."" Laura Tenison cycles to work to reduce her carbon footprint Businesswoman Laura Tenison, founder of JoJo Maman Bebe, might front a luxury babywear brand, but she was brought up with a ""waste-not-want-not attitude to life"". ""It wasn't a matter of changing the way that I behaved, it was more about retaining those kind of war-time austerity measures that I was brought up with and not becoming an over-consumerist person,"" she said. ""That may sound like an oxymoron - I'm a retailer and a retailer is encouraging people to buy more - but in fact we've had a very strong message over the years which is to buy less and buy better."" She admitted to being ""a little bit obsessive"" about her carbon footprint for many years. ""I am well known for cycling everywhere... so I guess reducing my carbon footprint by not using a car is probably the number one thing that I do on a day-to-day basis. ""You could say that I should get myself a hybrid or electric car, but the car that I use is 20 years old and my mileage is still very low, so I feel that as a bigger saving to my carbon footprint, not replacing my car but using it very, very little is probably more sensible than upgrading it for a new electric car."" Dr Judith Thornton says she has stopped using air travel and only eats meat twice a week Stabilising global temperatures requires ""urgent and drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions"" across all sectors of the economy, according to Dr Judith Thornton from the Institute of Biological, Environmental and Rural Sciences at Aberystwyth University. Dr Thornton outlined three categories of action necessary to achieve this, the first of which she said was achievable for everyone. ""Firstly, we can all take action as individuals; for me this includes not flying, using public transport in preference to driving, and eating meat a maximum of twice a week."" The second category is interventions by governments and policy makers, she added, to make it easier to live low-carbon lifestyles. ""These are system-level changes... so things like large-scale investment in low-carbon retrofitting of houses, integrated and affordable public transport provision, renewable electricity supplies, and taxation/incentive systems that encourage low-carbon behaviours. ""It's important to recognise that many of these changes would also benefit our health and wellbeing, as well as the environment."" The third category, which is her day job, is researching future solutions to combat climate change. ""While I'm passionate about the need for research that provides answers in the medium term, we need to be absolutely clear that drastic emission reductions are needed in the short term,"" she said. ""World leaders attending COP26 cannot simply point to technologies that haven't been invented yet as a reason to delay action."" What are you doing differently to help the planet?

Budget about investing in public services - SunakThe chancellor says he will set out a plan for rebuilding the economy next week based on skills.,"This video can not be played Rishi Sunak tells Andrew Marr the Budget will see investment in public services Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said ""strong investment in public services"" will be at the heart of his plans for rebuilding the economy when he sets outhis Budgetnext week. Speaking on BBC One's Andrew Marr Show, he said he would drive growth by spending on infrastructure, innovation and skills. But he said he did not have a ""magic wand"" to make rising costs disappear. Labour wants VAT on energy bills to be cut to zero to help families. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves, who was speaking on the same show, said many households were facing a ""tough winter"", and were worried about putting food on the table and heating their homes because prices were going up ""on everything"". Six things that could affect you in the Budget Ministers pledge Â£500m to support young families Chancellor to pledge funds for skills training Mr Sunak will set out his Budget on Wednesday, amid concern among some in his own party too that rising energy prices, inflation and tax hikes are causing a cost of living crisis in the UK. Speaking to the BBC, the chancellor said his previous budgets had been about taking action to protect incomes and jobs, but it was now time to look to the future and reshape the economy. He said: ""One of the elements of building a stronger economy is having strong public services, and you will see that next week - whether it's the NHS, which we've already taken steps to support significantly to recover from coronavirus - children, schools, skills, all of these things, policing and crime. ""You will see investment across the board in public services because that's what we were elected to deliver and that's what we are getting on and doing."" Asked if he would raise public sector wages in line with inflation, the chancellor said ""that will be one of the things we talk about"". ""Over the past year, we took a decision to have a more targeted approach to public sector pay,"" he continued, but ""going forward we'll have to set a new pay policy and that'll be a topic for next week's spending review"". He said there was ""no magic wand"" to make the factors contributing to high inflation disappear - such as pressure on global supply chains as economies have reopened after Covid, and soaring energy prices. And while his ""instincts"" were to cut tax, Mr Sunak said he was having to grapple with ""an economic shock - the biggest in three hundred years."" Â£7bn for areas outside of London to ""level up"" transport Â£5bn for health-related research and development, including towards genome sequencing and tackling health inequalities Â£3bn to drive a ""skills revolution"" A Â£1.4bn fund to funnel money into key innovative sectors and a new talent network to woo foreign talent into UK industries Â£850m to ""breathe life"" back into cultural hotspots Â£700m for a new fleet of patrol boats for Britain's borders Â£700m to improve sports and youth clubs Â£560m to provide personalised maths coaching Â£500m towards support for families and children, including new family hubs Â£435m for crime prevention and the Crown Prosecution Service, part of which aims to improve the response to rape and sexual assault cases Â£5m for cutting-edge treatments for veterans But shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said immediate help was essential and ministers needed to match their rhetoric with action. ""People are facing a tough winter now with prices of everything going up, not least gas and electricity bills,"" she said. ""When we pay our gas and electricity bills, 5% of that money goes automatically to the taxman. ""There's something very simple the government could do. It would be immediate and it would be felt automatically on people's bills next month - and that is to cut that rate of VAT from 5% to 0%."" She said she had been looking at VAT receipts and they had come in more than Â£2bn higher than forecast because of rising prices, giving the chancellor some wriggle room to act. ""Let's use that money to ease that pressure on people who are worried about the winter months, worried about putting food on the table and heating their homes"" she added. And she said Labour would not have made the ""appalling""cuts to  universal credit paymentswhich came into force earlier this month.

A-level book pulled over Native American questionThe exam board AQA apologises and says the textbook should never have been approved.,"An A-level history textbook has been withdrawn after a youth worker said she was ""horrified"" to discover an image asking whether the treatment of Native Americans had been exaggerated. The AQA-approved book asked students to balance ""criticisms of treatment of Native Americans"" with ""defence"" of their treatment in the late 1800s. The period saw some massacres of Native American tribes by the US government. The publisher Hodder has withdrawn the book. In one section the textbook - called The Making of a Superpower: USA 1865-1975 - asked students ""to what extent do you believe the treatment of Native Americans has been exaggerated?"" Hannah Wilkinson, who offers history mentoring sessions at Durham Sixth Form Centre, said the exercise was ""quite problematic"". ""It was deeply shocking to see how ingrained racial injustice is,"" she told the BBC. ""The period we're looking at is a period of American policy where Native Americans were treated terribly,"" she said. ""The way the textbook framed it suggests that maybe the treatment of Native Americans has been exaggerated."" From the early the 17th Century through to the late 19th Century a series of wars took place between European colonists and Native American tribes. They became known as the American-Indian Wars. In this time the Native American population fell heavily, partly due to new diseases brought by the Europeans and partly due to wars and massacres. Several historians have accused the colonialists of a ""genocide"" against Native American tribes. Whether or not the US government's actions amounted to a genocide, it imposed policies that targeted Native American land, freedom, and wellbeing. Ms Wilkinson teaches history for students who need extra support as part of her work with St Nicholas Church, Durham. ""My concern is that it presents really oppressive policies in an objective way. That didn't seem appropriate to the historical context,"" she said. ""I am definitely worried this is a wider pattern. We like to think that compared to America that we don't really have an issue of racial injustice."" She added: ""This period goes from slavery, to Jim Crow, to civil rights. If this is how they're presenting the history of Native Americans with such bias my concern is whether that is a repeated pattern in the framing of US history and whether that is coming up throughout the course.""

Woman recalls 'extraordinary' 1949 fossil find,"Ichthyosaurs became extinct around 90 million years ago The prized remains of a prehistoric sea reptile kept at Leeds Museum were discovered by a schoolgirl while fossil hunting on holiday, it has emerged. Pauline Hoggard was 16 when she found the limb of an ichthyosaur embedded in a cliff in Whitby in 1949. Recalling the chance discovery, the 88-year-old, from Leicester, said it was a moment she had ""never forgotten"". The fossil, which was passed to Leeds Museum, is one of their most impressive prehistoric specimens, experts said. Ms Hoggard said she had been staying at a boarding house with another family, the Nicholls, and discovered the father shared her passion for fossils. She said: ""He knew where to go exploring, so the next day we went to the beach but we didn't really see anything, just a couple of ammonoids. ""Everyone was getting a bit bored so decided to leave but I was really disappointed so I lingered behind to see what I could find and then I noticed these remains in the rock."" Pauline Hoggard had been holidaying with her family in Whitby She said Mr Nicholls alerted The University of Leeds, which then organised an excavation and later confirmed she had found the fossilised remains of an ichthyosaur. The remains were passed to Leeds Museums and Galleries where they have remained part of the collection ever since. Often misidentified as ""swimming dinosaurs"", they first appeared in the early Triassic period (251 million to 199 million years ago) The name means fish-lizard, although the creature has been classified as a reptile since the mid-19th Century Its length ranged from 3ft 3in (1m) to 46ft (14m) The creature was noted for its sharp, robust teeth Ichthyosaurs became extinct around 90 million years ago Source: Encyclopaedia of Palaeontology The ichthyosaur was a dolphin-like reptile which is thought to have lived in the sea millions of years ago Ms Hoggard's story only come to light decades later after recalling the tale to her niece, who then made contact with museum staff and went to look at the fossil. She said: ""I remember it was so exciting to find it but at the time I couldn't seem to get anyone else that excited. ""It's something I've never forgotten and I'm glad I've been able to share the story of how it came to be found."" Her family have been fascinated by the story and been to see the fossilised remains Clare Brown, Leeds Museums and Galleries curator of natural sciences, said: ""It's been an absolute delight for all of us to hear about Pauline's story and breathe some new life into an extraordinary specimen that's been part of our collection for decades.""

Police investigate anti-takeover bannerPolice are investigating a banner by Crystal Palace fans criticising the Saudi Arabian-led takeover of Newcastle.BBC Sport,"The banner was displayed by Crystal Palace fans during the club's 1-1 draw at home to Newcastle United on Saturday Police are investigating a graphic banner displayed by Crystal Palace fans that targeted the Saudi Arabian-led takeover of Newcastle United. The banner took aim at the Premier League's ownership test, following Newcastle's recent Â£305m sale. It featured illustrations of a man dressed in traditional Arabic clothing alongside what appeared to be Premier League chief executive Richard Masters. The banner had a checklist with alleged offences by the Saudi Arabia regime. Newcastle owners change stance on traditional Arabic clothing Crystal Palace 1-1 Newcastle: Match report Six reasons why Newcastle takeover is controversial Listed on a picture of a clipboard under the headline 'Premier League Owners Test' were 'Terrorism, beheading, civil rights abuses, murder, censorship and persecution'. The man in Arab-style clothing was also holding a sword with blood on it. Palace fan group Holmesdale Fanatics has taken credit for the banner - displayed during the 1-1 draw between the clubs on Saturday - on Twitter, and issued a statement. ""The Saudi led takeover of Newcastle has rightly received widespread condemnation and anger,"" it said. ""To give the thumbs up to this deal at a time when the Premier League is promoting the women's game and inclusive initiatives such as rainbow armbands, shows the total hypocrisy at play and demonstrates the league's soulless agenda where profits trump all."" The takeover was 80% financed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), whose chair is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. When approving the takeover, the Premier League said it had received legal assurances from the new owners that the Saudi state would not control Newcastle United and there would be penalties if it was proved otherwise. The fans group's statement said this decision ""made a mockery"" of the 'Owners and Directors' test. Croydon Metropolitan Police have released a statement on Twitter, which says: ""On Saturday 23 October police received a report of an offensive banner displayed by Crystal Palace fans. ""Officers are assessing the information and carrying out enquiries. Any allegations of racist abuse will be taken very seriously."" Proud and Palace, the club's official lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender supporters group, also protested on Saturday, posting a video on their Twitter account. It is understood Crystal Palace themselves did not have any prior knowledge of the banner being brought into the ground. They have been asked by police for information surrounding the circumstances and are co-operating with the investigation. Newcastle, Crystal Palace and the Premier League have all been approached for comment by BBC Sport. The Premier League declined to comment. Earlier on Saturday, Newcastlereversed their guidanceon fans celebrating the takeover by wearing ""traditional Arabic clothing or Middle East-inspired head coverings"" at matches - saying supporters should now ""feel free"" to do so.

This video can not be played Roads in Glasgow close ahead of the COP26 climate change summit The RMT confirmed that strikes during COP26 would go ahead, with ScotRail workers planning action from 1-12 November amid an ongoing dispute over pay and conditions. The union's general secretary Mick Lynch said the decision to press on with industrial action was made on Friday after the train company ""failed to get serious"" in talks with the union. He said ScotRail had missed ""a golden opportunity"" for progress by offering ""nothing of any consequence"". Mr Lynch continued that there was still time to avoid ""the chaos of a transport shutdown during COP26 if the key players get back with some serious proposals"". Government 'perplexed' at RMT over ScotRail strike A Scottish government spokesperson welcomed that three out of four railway trade unions had now accepted, or recommended acceptance of, the pay offer. That offer amounts to a 2.5% pay increase backdated to 1 April 2021, and a 2.2% increase effective from 1 April 2022, with a one-off Â£300 payment for staff working during COP26. But the government said it was ""disappointed"" the offer was rejected by the RMT. A spokesperson said after this, ScotRail sought to focus the issue ofrest day working,external, which the RMT said needed to be addressed. However, an offer on rest day working was ""rejected out of hand"" and the union returned to the issue of pay, according to the government. It said: ""We don't think anyone, including the membership of the RMT, wants to disrupt COP26 or the chance to showcase Scotland's green, clean railway to a global audience. We hope that encompasses the RMT leadership too, although their approach to seeking resolution does appear to call this into question."" Meanwhile, Ian McConnell, of ScotRail, said he was ""incredibly frustrated"" that the union had ""point blank rejected"" the latest proposal. He accused the leadership of having ""moved the goalposts without consulting their members"". Mr McConnell said time was running out to reach agreement, adding: ""It seems RMT bosses are intent on sabotaging Scotland's railway's role during COP26."" Contingency plans were being developed to provide a core service for the duration of the summit, he said. Appearing onBBC Radio Scotland, Glasgow City Council leader Susan Aitken urged people to plan ahead of travelling and check theGet Ready Glasgow,externalwebsite for more information. Ms Aitken also said cleansing teams were out clearing up fly-tipping ""hotspots"" after the issue of mounting rubbish in the city was raised onQuestion Time. About 1,500 Glasgow City Council staff including those in refuse collection and cleansingplan to strike for a week during the climate summitdue to an ongoing pay dispute. Union members rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 a year, and are instead calling for a Â£2,000 pay rise for staff. Concerns have also been raised about the impact the summit could have on Scotland's Covid cases. Prof Devi Sridhar, of Edinburgh University, tweeted,externalthat a mass event such as COP26 ""will cause an increase in cases"" and could ""trigger a need for further restrictions"". Jillian Evans, head of health intelligence for NHS Grampian, said the risk of infection during mass events was high even if safety precautions were in place. Shewarnedmany of those attending would not be fully vaccinated. Ms Evans added: ""We've got a really fragile situation, the number of cases in Scotland have been plateauing - plateaued at higher levels than ever before."" ""You're looking at numbers we probably haven't seen before, whether that leads to restrictions will depend on the scale of this. I would say the stakes are really high,"" she said. The Scottish government has said appropriate mitigation measures will be in place for the summit and Covid-19 continues to be closely monitored. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

How will COP26 road closures affect Glasgow?,"Road closures are in place from 23 October and until 15 November. Travelling around Glasgow is expected to be ""significantly impacted"" during the COP26 climate change summit, with major road closures during the conference. COP26 is held over two weeks from 31 October - 12 November 2021 at the Scottish Event Campus (SEC). About 25,000 delegates are expected to be at the talks and security will be tight, especially around the attendance of about 120 world leaders. Road closures started a week ahead of the summit on 23 October and last until Monday 15 November. Some days are expected to be busier than others. The biggest disruption is expected on Saturday 6 November, which has been designated as the Global Day For Climate Justice. About 100,000 protesters are expected in Glasgow, with a march which begins at Kelvingrove Park at noon before making its way to Glasgow Green for about 15:00. Transport Scotland, the national transport agency, has warned the public to avoid the SEC area and expect delays on the M8 as this will be the main route for delegates travelling to the summit. The main message is to be prepared for anything. Unplanned protests could emerge, roads could be temporarily closed or diversions put in place at the last minute due to obstructions or for security reasons. Get Ready Glasgow,external, the city's information site, has produced a congestion map to show where travel in the city will be affected. It might not just be Glasgow that is affected, with world leaders staying in other locations such as Edinburgh, St Andrews and Perthshire. Anyone who has to travel in central Scotland during the conference period could be affected. You can readthe official COP26 transport plan here,external. The area around the SEC summit venue will see the most impact. More than 9,000 people in Glasgow's Finnieston, Anderston and Yorkhill areas will be affected by parking restrictions and security measures. Road closures will mean longer journey times, and businesses have been asked to carefully consider how their staff will travel to and from work on the busiest days. The main closures are: A814 Clydeside ExpresswayThe main route along Glasgow's riverside Clyde ArcKnown locally as the Squinty Bridge Finnieston Street The alternative routes are: Great Western Road Paisley Road West Clyde Tunnel Get Ready Glasgow is suggesting motorists follow suggested alternative routes around the city until roads reopen after COP26. Roads won't be back to normal immediately at the end of the summit. They will reopen gradually over the next week. Congress Road -The main road outside the SEC campus will reopen on 17 November at 06:00. Congress Way, Finnieston Quay, Tunnel Street, Stobcross Road and Castlebank Street -Subject to lane restrictions with full road closure until 06:00 on 21 November. Clyde Arc, Lancefield Quay and Finnieston Street -Reopening on Monday 15 November. Minerva Street  -Reopens 13 November. Local Access to private car parks maintained. Clydeside Expressway -The main route directly from the M8 motorway to the SEC summit venue. It reopens on 15 November. The M8 and the M74 motorways are the most likely to be affected by closures and restrictions. The main carriageway of the M74 on the approach to Glasgow will be extremely busy, where more traffic heads westbound towards the Clyde Tunnel alternative route. Increased queueing and delays are also expected on the M8 at Junction 25 westbound as more traffic heads towards the Clyde tunnel. This is a key access road to the Queen Elizabeth University Hospital. Transport Scotland has said there are no official requests to close any sections of the motorways. However this could change, and could be revisited in the event of individual incidents. You can check day-by-day maps of road closures and diversions atGet Ready Glasgow,external. COP26 delegates are being encouraged to travel by train to reach the SEC conference venue, which is served by its own station Exhibition Centre. However, the RMT union has said members who work for ScotRailwill strike during the summit, which is set to impact rail travel. ScotRail says it has contingency plans to provide a core service for the duration of the summit. Before these developments, Glasgow City Council and travel providers were working on travel demand management during COP26 and had already issued warnings that public transport will be very busy. For delegates, a dedicated shuttle bus service will operate between Glasgow city centre and the SEC.  Delegates are also expected to get a free travel smartcard, allowing them to use bus, rail and subway services in the city. For city residents, the main advice is to plan ahead and allow extra time for unforeseen delays. TheTraveline Scotland website,externalhas up-to-date information on all modes of public transport and a journey planner. Cycling is being highly encouraged during the climate change event. Glasgow City Council's cycle hire scheme ""Nextbike"" will be free to use for all COP26 attendees to get around the city. It is also available to event volunteers and local residents. Glasgow has an expanding network of active travel routes and shared-use footpaths and a number of core paths connect the venue with the surrounding areas. However, for security purposes, the National Cycle Network (Route 7), that runs north of the River Clyde to Loch Lomond, will be closed in Glasgow because of its proximity to the SEC venue. Other cycle routes along streets and bridges within the summit zone are also closed to the public.

Tesco website and app crash after 'interference',"Tesco's website and app are now up and running again, following a service outage that began on Saturday. The retail giant's services had crashed after what Tesco said were attempts ""to interfere with our systems"". The possible hack at Britain's biggest supermarket began with shoppers unable to order goods and track deliveries. Tesco initially said there was ""an issue"", but in a Sunday update said there had been deliberate disruption. The supermarket later confirmed onTwitter,externalthat its groceries website and app were back up and running, but it was temporarily using a ""virtual waiting room"" to manage the high volume of traffic. Why does the internet keep breaking? Tesco said the attempts to compromise its systems were made overnight from Friday to Saturday, but was not more specific. According to Downdetector,external, which monitors website outages, shoppers began reporting issues early on Saturday morning. The scale of the problem, and whether the issue was nationwide or only in certain areas, remained unclear on Sunday night. Shoppers complained over the weekend about a lack of information, with many wanting to know how to cancel orders and whether they can get money back. Earlier on Sunday, a Tesco spokesperson said: ""There is no reason to believe that this issue impacts customer data and we continue to take ongoing action to make sure all data stays safe. ""Since yesterday, we've been experiencing disruption to our online grocery website and app. ""An attempt was made to interfere with our systems which has caused problems with the search function on the site. We're working hard to fully restore all services and apologise for the inconvenience."" Meanwhile, shoppers were trying to change or cancel deliveries, or switch to other supermarkets. Tesco customer Chris Hodgson, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, told the BBC the app had not been working properly for ""a couple of days"". He picked up his click-and-collect order on Sunday, but had only managed to do half his weekly shopping before the website went down. ""The collection member of staff hadn't been informed of any issues,"" Mr Hodgson said. ""After I showed him the website, he said it was an unusually quiet day. ""I asked if I could reject the whole order and was informed I could only reject substituted items. I'll have to go out again this afternoon. If you're on a budget it's annoying, it's an inconvenience. ""Nothing from Tesco, no way of contacting them. Really poor by Tesco,"" he said. Tesco has opened a check-out free store where customers use the app to choose groceries and leave with them Another customer, Rebecca, from North Wales, got a delivery of 120 Pepsi drinks on Sunday instead of her order. ""We were meant to get a week's shop this morning,"" she told the BBC. ""The website was down all yesterday so we couldn't amend or cancel. All we received was 120 cans of Pepsi Max."" Rebecca, who asked for her surname not to be used, added: ""I'd been going in to the order over and over yesterday, right up until the 11.45 deadline. I didn't try calling, there must be thousands in the same boat. ""Fortunately someone suggested that Asda had delivery slots for today so I managed to place an order last night (just before their deadline) for enough food for the next few days."" Tesco initially said on Saturday it was ""working hard to get things back up and running"", and apologised for the inconvenience. The firm's online sales have soared recently, especially during lockdown, with the supermarket ramping up capacity. Its latest financial results say the scale and reach of its online operations are ""unmatched in the UK"", with total sales topping Â£6bn. Tesco said it had 6.6 million app users. Tesco has faced previous hacks. In 2014 about 2,000 customer accounts were deactivated amid fears login details were compromised, and there was also a cyber attack on the supermarket's bank arm. But the problem is becoming more common globally. Earlier this year, international meat manufacturer JBS had to shut down about 25% of its operation. And large swathes of US fuel supply were closed after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline. Few sectors have escaped the attention of cyber-criminals, with airlines, banks, universities, local authorities, utilities and tech giants such as Microsoft all having faced attacks on their computer systems.

The banner took aim at the Premier League's ownership test, following Newcastle's recent Â£305m sale. It featured illustrations of a man dressed in traditional Arabic clothing alongside what appeared to be Premier League chief executive Richard Masters. The banner had a checklist with alleged offences by the Saudi Arabia regime. Newcastle owners change stance on traditional Arabic clothing Crystal Palace 1-1 Newcastle: Match report Six reasons why Newcastle takeover is controversial Listed on a picture of a clipboard under the headline 'Premier League Owners Test' were 'Terrorism, beheading, civil rights abuses, murder, censorship and persecution'. The man in Arab-style clothing was also holding a sword with blood on it. Palace fan group Holmesdale Fanatics has taken credit for the banner - displayed during the 1-1 draw between the clubs on Saturday - on Twitter, and issued a statement. ""The Saudi led takeover of Newcastle has rightly received widespread condemnation and anger,"" it said. ""To give the thumbs up to this deal at a time when the Premier League is promoting the women's game and inclusive initiatives such as rainbow armbands, shows the total hypocrisy at play and demonstrates the league's soulless agenda where profits trump all."" The takeover was 80% financed by Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund (PIF), whose chair is Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. When approving the takeover, the Premier League said it had received legal assurances from the new owners that the Saudi state would not control Newcastle United and there would be penalties if it was proved otherwise. The fans group's statement said this decision ""made a mockery"" of the 'Owners and Directors' test. Croydon Metropolitan Police have released a statement on Twitter, which says: ""On Saturday 23 October police received a report of an offensive banner displayed by Crystal Palace fans. ""Officers are assessing the information and carrying out enquiries. Any allegations of racist abuse will be taken very seriously."" Proud and Palace, the club's official lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender supporters group, also protested on Saturday, posting a video on their Twitter account. It is understood Crystal Palace themselves did not have any prior knowledge of the banner being brought into the ground. They have been asked by police for information surrounding the circumstances and are co-operating with the investigation. Newcastle, Crystal Palace and the Premier League have all been approached for comment by BBC Sport. The Premier League declined to comment. Earlier on Saturday, Newcastlereversed their guidanceon fans celebrating the takeover by wearing ""traditional Arabic clothing or Middle East-inspired head coverings"" at matches - saying supporters should now ""feel free"" to do so.

"Eight murder arrests after two teenage boys diePolice were called to an area of Brentwood, Essex, in the early hours of Sunday morning.Essex","Medical equipment was visible in the road outside Regency Court Eight men have been arrested on suspicion of murder after two teenage boys died. Essex Police said officers found three people injured after it had received a number of calls to Regency Court, Brentwood, at about 01:30 BST. Two of those have since died, the force said, while the third was treated for non-life threatening injuries. Brentwood and Ongar's Conservative MP, Alex Burghart, called it a ""very dark day for our town"". Police said they were ""working to establish how the boys died"" and post-mortem examinations would take place. The BBC understands the boys are suspected to have suffered stab wounds. Police were called to an area of Brentwood, Essex, in the early hours of Sunday Det Ch Insp Andy Clarkson, of the Kent and Essex Serious Crime Directorate, said: ""We understand there will naturally be shock and concern within the community after such a tragic loss of life. ""But, at this stage, we do not believe there is any wider threat to the public."" Forensics officers have been working in a tent beside Regency Court A neighbour said he had tried to warn police about anti-social behaviour in the area in recent weeks. Mark MacIntosh told the PA news agency he had only just arrived home before he heard shouting and screaming coming from a nearby residence. ""I realise that what I heard was somebody yelling out in pain who may have lost his life shortly thereafter,"" he said. He claimed the area had been dealing with problems which stemmed from a multi-storey car park that overlooks the scene. ""There's constant anti-social behaviour, drinking, drugs, shouting, fighting,"" he said. ""I've heard people saying 'I'm going to kill him' up there. I've come down and broken up a knife fight down at the bottom here before."" Mr MacIntosh said he had warned police ""three weeks ago"" that something bad would happen if they did not arrange ""constant patrols"" of the area. Police said two of the three injured boys died Ch Insp Mark Barber, of Essex Police, had earlier said there would be a ""highly-visible police presence"" in Brentwood following the deaths. ""I am acutely aware that this incident will shock many within the community,"" he said. ""My officers will be there throughout the day - they will be there to reassure you and keep you safe. ""If you have any concerns or information on the incident then, please, do not hesitate to come forward and speak to them."" Police urged witnesses from Regency Court and central Brentwood to speak to them Mr Burghart said: ""This a very dark day for our town. My deepest condolences to the families of the boys who have so dreadfully lost their lives. ""I must urge anyone with any information to immediately share it with the police so that justice can be done as swiftly as possible.""

Chancellor to pledge funds for skills training,"Healthcare Science is one of the T-levels already on offer The government will reconfirm its commitment to a ""skills revolution"" with a spending package to be unveiled by the chancellor on Wednesday. Rishi Sunak will announce Â£1.6bn to roll out newT-levels,externalfor 16 to 19-year-olds, and Â£550m for adult skills in England in his autumn statement. And there will be Â£830m confirmed to continue a five-year-scheme to revamp and modernise colleges. College principals said the funding was welcome but would not go far enough. Sixth form colleges and 16-19 education finances have been struggling for many years. A report by the IPPR think-tank last year suggested colleges in England would have needed an extra Â£2.7bn a year since 2010 just to catch up with investment levels then. Scrapping B-Tecs 'hammer blow for social mobility' Millions 'could miss out on new skills scheme' What will teenagers study for the new T-levels? The Â£1.6bn cash investment for colleges over three years to 2024-25 will be used, in the main, to provide additional classroom hours for up to 100,000 young people taking T-levels. Presently there are about 6,000 students on T-level courses. These are the government's new vocational qualifications, equivalent to three A-levels, that have been developed with businesses to meet the needs of industry. Currently, there are 10 T-levels available currently However, in time the government wants the list to be expanded to include training for many more professions. The funding will also cover inflationary pressures and accommodate the higher number of teenagers in the population. An extra Â£550m is being invested in adult skills through the Skills Fund by 2024-25. This fund offers short courses and so-called ""skills boot camps"" for adults who have no qualifications beyond GCSE level. And there is a further Â£170m for apprenticeships and training. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our future economic success depends not just on the education we give to our children but the lifelong learning we offer to adults."" He said his Â£3bn investment would create a ""skills revolution"", which would build on the government's job creation plans and spread opportunity across the UK by transforming post-16 education. Mr Sunak told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show ""more sector-orientated training schemes have been shown to be really powerful"" and ""the best way to get to a high wage economy is to improve people's skills"". At the heart of the government's plan for 16 to 19-year-olds in England is a qualification that few have yet heard of, the Technical or T-Level. One T-level is designed to be equivalent to three A-levels, or up to 3 BTecs. T-Levels are meant to be substantial and quite demanding courses, which include at least 45 days of work placement. At the moment, only around 6,000 students across England are enrolled to study the first T-levels, which they will complete next summer. The government hopes to scale up the numbers rapidly as more T-levels are introduced, partly through a controversial decision to remove funding from popular BTecs in similar subjects. Association of Colleges chief executive David Hughes said: ""We always expected the increased funding wouldn't go far enough, but in the circumstances we view this as a good start in a tough spending round. ""That the chancellor is leading with this announcement in advance of the Comprehensive Spending Review shows just how far we've come in making the government recognise the importance of investing in people to close the skills gap."" He added: ""I am hopeful that the lack of mention of education recovery is because of a significant announcement on Wednesday at the dispatch box."" He said his organisation had calculated that it was going to take at least Â£300m per year to support education recovery for 16 to 19-year-olds. Bill Watkins, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: ""Today's announcement focuses on the small minority of 16 to 18-year-olds that pursue a technical course. ""That's welcome, but all students deserve to have their education properly funded and we hope that Wednesday's spending review will also focus on the vast majority of young people that study A-level or BTec qualifications."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the investment in the further education sector, which he said had traditionally been ""starved of funding"". However, he told BBC Breakfast the move was a ""gamble"" when it was still unclear how many teenagers would want to do T-levels.

Tesco apologises as website and app crashBritain's biggest supermarket is still trying to resolve the issue as shoppers complain about a lack of information.Business,"Tesco's website and app are now up and running again, following a service outage that began on Saturday. The retail giant's services had crashed after what Tesco said were attempts ""to interfere with our systems"". The possible hack at Britain's biggest supermarket began with shoppers unable to order goods and track deliveries. Tesco initially said there was ""an issue"", but in a Sunday update said there had been deliberate disruption. The supermarket later confirmed onTwitter,externalthat its groceries website and app were back up and running, but it was temporarily using a ""virtual waiting room"" to manage the high volume of traffic. Why does the internet keep breaking? Tesco said the attempts to compromise its systems were made overnight from Friday to Saturday, but was not more specific. According to Downdetector,external, which monitors website outages, shoppers began reporting issues early on Saturday morning. The scale of the problem, and whether the issue was nationwide or only in certain areas, remained unclear on Sunday night. Shoppers complained over the weekend about a lack of information, with many wanting to know how to cancel orders and whether they can get money back. Earlier on Sunday, a Tesco spokesperson said: ""There is no reason to believe that this issue impacts customer data and we continue to take ongoing action to make sure all data stays safe. ""Since yesterday, we've been experiencing disruption to our online grocery website and app. ""An attempt was made to interfere with our systems which has caused problems with the search function on the site. We're working hard to fully restore all services and apologise for the inconvenience."" Meanwhile, shoppers were trying to change or cancel deliveries, or switch to other supermarkets. Tesco customer Chris Hodgson, who lives in Stoke-on-Trent, told the BBC the app had not been working properly for ""a couple of days"". He picked up his click-and-collect order on Sunday, but had only managed to do half his weekly shopping before the website went down. ""The collection member of staff hadn't been informed of any issues,"" Mr Hodgson said. ""After I showed him the website, he said it was an unusually quiet day. ""I asked if I could reject the whole order and was informed I could only reject substituted items. I'll have to go out again this afternoon. If you're on a budget it's annoying, it's an inconvenience. ""Nothing from Tesco, no way of contacting them. Really poor by Tesco,"" he said. Tesco has opened a check-out free store where customers use the app to choose groceries and leave with them Another customer, Rebecca, from North Wales, got a delivery of 120 Pepsi drinks on Sunday instead of her order. ""We were meant to get a week's shop this morning,"" she told the BBC. ""The website was down all yesterday so we couldn't amend or cancel. All we received was 120 cans of Pepsi Max."" Rebecca, who asked for her surname not to be used, added: ""I'd been going in to the order over and over yesterday, right up until the 11.45 deadline. I didn't try calling, there must be thousands in the same boat. ""Fortunately someone suggested that Asda had delivery slots for today so I managed to place an order last night (just before their deadline) for enough food for the next few days."" Tesco initially said on Saturday it was ""working hard to get things back up and running"", and apologised for the inconvenience. The firm's online sales have soared recently, especially during lockdown, with the supermarket ramping up capacity. Its latest financial results say the scale and reach of its online operations are ""unmatched in the UK"", with total sales topping Â£6bn. Tesco said it had 6.6 million app users. Tesco has faced previous hacks. In 2014 about 2,000 customer accounts were deactivated amid fears login details were compromised, and there was also a cyber attack on the supermarket's bank arm. But the problem is becoming more common globally. Earlier this year, international meat manufacturer JBS had to shut down about 25% of its operation. And large swathes of US fuel supply were closed after a ransomware attack on Colonial Pipeline. Few sectors have escaped the attention of cyber-criminals, with airlines, banks, universities, local authorities, utilities and tech giants such as Microsoft all having faced attacks on their computer systems.

Woman recalls 'extraordinary' 1949 fossil findPauline Hoggard was 16 when she found the tail end of an ichthyosaur in a cliff in Whitby.Leeds & West Yorkshire,"Ichthyosaurs became extinct around 90 million years ago The prized remains of a prehistoric sea reptile kept at Leeds Museum were discovered by a schoolgirl while fossil hunting on holiday, it has emerged. Pauline Hoggard was 16 when she found the limb of an ichthyosaur embedded in a cliff in Whitby in 1949. Recalling the chance discovery, the 88-year-old, from Leicester, said it was a moment she had ""never forgotten"". The fossil, which was passed to Leeds Museum, is one of their most impressive prehistoric specimens, experts said. Ms Hoggard said she had been staying at a boarding house with another family, the Nicholls, and discovered the father shared her passion for fossils. She said: ""He knew where to go exploring, so the next day we went to the beach but we didn't really see anything, just a couple of ammonoids. ""Everyone was getting a bit bored so decided to leave but I was really disappointed so I lingered behind to see what I could find and then I noticed these remains in the rock."" Pauline Hoggard had been holidaying with her family in Whitby She said Mr Nicholls alerted The University of Leeds, which then organised an excavation and later confirmed she had found the fossilised remains of an ichthyosaur. The remains were passed to Leeds Museums and Galleries where they have remained part of the collection ever since. Often misidentified as ""swimming dinosaurs"", they first appeared in the early Triassic period (251 million to 199 million years ago) The name means fish-lizard, although the creature has been classified as a reptile since the mid-19th Century Its length ranged from 3ft 3in (1m) to 46ft (14m) The creature was noted for its sharp, robust teeth Ichthyosaurs became extinct around 90 million years ago Source: Encyclopaedia of Palaeontology The ichthyosaur was a dolphin-like reptile which is thought to have lived in the sea millions of years ago Ms Hoggard's story only come to light decades later after recalling the tale to her niece, who then made contact with museum staff and went to look at the fossil. She said: ""I remember it was so exciting to find it but at the time I couldn't seem to get anyone else that excited. ""It's something I've never forgotten and I'm glad I've been able to share the story of how it came to be found."" Her family have been fascinated by the story and been to see the fossilised remains Clare Brown, Leeds Museums and Galleries curator of natural sciences, said: ""It's been an absolute delight for all of us to hear about Pauline's story and breathe some new life into an extraordinary specimen that's been part of our collection for decades.""

Travel rules simplified,"New simplified travel rules have come into force in the UK, with the traffic light system replaced by a single red list. Most fully vaccinated travellers arriving from non-red list countries will no longer have to take a test before setting off for the UK. Airlines UK said it would make travelling abroad easier and cheaper. But those coming from red list destinations must still pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Under the changes, which came into force at 04:00 BST, the green and amber lists have been scrapped. Testing rules are also being eased for people travelling from non-red list destinations who have been vaccinated in the UK, the EU, the US, or any of 18 other recognised countries. Anyone under 18 who is resident in those countries can also travel to the UK without testing. These groups were already able to avoid self-isolating on their arrival back in the UK. How are the green and amber lists changing on Monday? Plan A or Plan B - what could happen this winter? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? All travellers - except children under five years old - will still have to pay for a PCR test two days after arrival. People who are not fully vaccinated will need a pre-departure test and a PCR test on days two and eight after they return, and must self-isolate for 10 days at home. And those arriving from red list countries, including Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and South Africa, must quarantine for 10 days in a government-approved hotel, at a cost of Â£2,285 for one adult. Only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, are allowed to enter the UK if they have been in a red country in the previous 10 days. The red list is due to be updated later this week. The government may also announce additions to the list of countries whose vaccination certificates are recognised by the UK. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""We are accelerating towards a future where travel continues to reopen safely and remains open for good, and today's rule changes are good news for families, businesses and the travel sector. ""Our priority remains to protect public health but, with more than eight in 10 people now fully vaccinated, we are able to take these steps to lower the cost of testing and help the sector to continue in its recovery."" There was a surge in holiday bookings after the government announced the changes last month andthe travel sector has welcomed the move. The industry previously criticised the government for being too slow to ease and simplify rules on testing and quarantine. From later in October, the government has said fully vaccinated people coming to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival and can take a cheaper lateral flow test instead. No date has been set for this change but ministers are aiming to have it in place for the half-term school break. So far, no other UK nation has followed suit. Scotland has said it will ""align with the UK post-arrival testing regime"" but has not announced further details. The Welsh government said it had ""concerns"" about easing its testing regime. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK carriers, said: ""Things are moving in the right direction and the removal of these restrictions will make it easier and cheaper for people to travel."" However, he said the UK remained ""an outlier on arrivals testing for vaccinated passengers"". Airlines UK hopes to see more countries removed from the red list at the next update and further mutual recognition of vaccine status for those jabbed in other countries, he added. Willie Walsh, head of industry body the International Air Transport Association, welcomed the change as a ""positive step"", saying the government's testing and quarantine restrictions had been both unscientific and costly. ""People have been led to believe that the risk is people flying into the country. The risk was inside the country,"" he said. Alan French, chief executive at Thomas Cook, said more options would now be available for travellers. ""They will be more confident if they book the holiday, they can travel safely there and be able to return in a transparent way, which is something they've not been able to do,"" he said. Mr French said since the government announced the changes, three weeks ago, his company had seen bookings more than double. The UK recorded 30,439 cases on Sunday, with the total number of cases in the past seven days up one per cent on the previous week. However, the number of Covid deaths and hospital admissions are falling, with 43 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Sunday.

What is social care and how does it work in Wales?,"Care at home or in a residential setting is means-tested in Wales Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced plans for an overhaul of funding for the social care system, which includes raisingNational Insurance(NI) payments. Social care is managed by each of the home nations separately, but NI is paid throughout the United Kingdom into the Treasury at Westminster. So a rise affects everyone who pays contributions. How will this affect people in Wales? Social care refers to caring services - help with personal services like washing and dressing, and taking medication - for elderly or disabled people. This can be carried out in their homes, if they are still able to live independently, with carers coming in to help them as often as their assessed level of need. If they cannot live independently, people can be looked after in a care home, where they will have to pay for food and accommodation as well as care services. Costs can vary depending on the level of need - nursing care costs more than looking after a person who just needs help with dressing, and people with dementia can need higher levels of intervention, for example. Social care changes at-a-glance What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? Why workers face the bill for care revolution Social care is means-tested. In Wales, no-one who is eligible for care at home is expected to pay more than Â£100 a week towards the costs. Anyone with savings and assets under Â£24,000 will be fully funded by their local authority, with a sliding scale once assets go over that amount. For those in care homes, people can have savings and assets (including the value of their home if they own it) up to Â£50,000 before they have to pay towards the service. Additional costs of PPE because of Covid has hit care home budgets As it is something that mainly affects older people, a rising elderly population is putting increased strain on the system. This is particularly relevant in Wales, which already has the oldest population across the four nations. Cuts in council funding have led to reductions in the amounts local authorities are paying towards social care, meaning some people are missing out or having to pay more to fund their own care. The coronavirus pandemic has had an impact from a number of angles. Deaths of residents in care homes, an inability to move people into homes because of lockdown, staff sickness, increased personal protective equipment (PPE) costs, a heightened shortage of workers - all of these have put more pressure on the system. The pandemic, compounded with Brexit, has reduced the pool of foreign workers who might normally be available to take up positions in caring. According toSkills for Care,external, 16% of workers in the sector were non-British in 2019/20. However under the new immigration system which started in January 2021, care worker was not listed on the skilled worker entry route. The knock-on effect to the NHS is also significant as people cannot be released from hospital unless they have somewhere suitable with the right care in place to go to, meaning bed-blocking at a time of massively increased demand during the pandemic. Could care be provided free, like the NHS? Too costly, the government says The ""baseline "" cost of care for the over-65s in Wales was given as Â£586m (out of a total social care bill of Â£1.8bn) in 2019-20, according toWelsh government figures,external. This has been projected to rise to Â£687m in the current financial year (2021-22) and Â£723m the following year, although these are now considered to be an underestimate in light of the pandemic. The Welsh government published a white paper earlier this year looking at improving social care. It considered the option of providing all social care free at the point of need, in the same way as the NHS. What would a National Insurance rise mean for me? What are the challenges facing social care? However it concluded this would cost an additional Â£700m per year on top of the current budget, well beyond the government's ability to provide. With National Insurance contributions being increased, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland will get a proportionate share of the proceeds, based on the rise in spending in England. The UK government says there will be a legal requirement that the extra cash will be spent only on health and social care, with a source calling the funding ""very beneficial for Wales"". Under a 1.25% rise in contributions, Wales would receive an extra Â£700m by 2024-25, which the source said was 15% more than it raises in National Insurance from its population. National Insurance is paid on earnings above Â£9,564 at 12% up to Â£50,268, and then 2% on earnings over that amount, so unlike income tax it does not continue to rise past a certain point. If as projected the Prime Minister raises the rate of tax by 1.25%, a person earning Â£30,000 would pay an extra Â£255 every year. You can find a handy guidehere.

Woman recalls 'extraordinary' 1949 fossil findPauline Hoggard was 16 when she found the tail end of an ichthyosaur in a cliff in Whitby.,"Ichthyosaurs became extinct around 90 million years ago The prized remains of a prehistoric sea reptile kept at Leeds Museum were discovered by a schoolgirl while fossil hunting on holiday, it has emerged. Pauline Hoggard was 16 when she found the limb of an ichthyosaur embedded in a cliff in Whitby in 1949. Recalling the chance discovery, the 88-year-old, from Leicester, said it was a moment she had ""never forgotten"". The fossil, which was passed to Leeds Museum, is one of their most impressive prehistoric specimens, experts said. Ms Hoggard said she had been staying at a boarding house with another family, the Nicholls, and discovered the father shared her passion for fossils. She said: ""He knew where to go exploring, so the next day we went to the beach but we didn't really see anything, just a couple of ammonoids. ""Everyone was getting a bit bored so decided to leave but I was really disappointed so I lingered behind to see what I could find and then I noticed these remains in the rock."" Pauline Hoggard had been holidaying with her family in Whitby She said Mr Nicholls alerted The University of Leeds, which then organised an excavation and later confirmed she had found the fossilised remains of an ichthyosaur. The remains were passed to Leeds Museums and Galleries where they have remained part of the collection ever since. Often misidentified as ""swimming dinosaurs"", they first appeared in the early Triassic period (251 million to 199 million years ago) The name means fish-lizard, although the creature has been classified as a reptile since the mid-19th Century Its length ranged from 3ft 3in (1m) to 46ft (14m) The creature was noted for its sharp, robust teeth Ichthyosaurs became extinct around 90 million years ago Source: Encyclopaedia of Palaeontology The ichthyosaur was a dolphin-like reptile which is thought to have lived in the sea millions of years ago Ms Hoggard's story only come to light decades later after recalling the tale to her niece, who then made contact with museum staff and went to look at the fossil. She said: ""I remember it was so exciting to find it but at the time I couldn't seem to get anyone else that excited. ""It's something I've never forgotten and I'm glad I've been able to share the story of how it came to be found."" Her family have been fascinated by the story and been to see the fossilised remains Clare Brown, Leeds Museums and Galleries curator of natural sciences, said: ""It's been an absolute delight for all of us to hear about Pauline's story and breathe some new life into an extraordinary specimen that's been part of our collection for decades.""

"Colombia's most wanted drug lord capturedThe US had placed a $5m bounty on the head of Dairo Antonio Ãsuga, better known as Otoniel.","This video can not be played Dairo Antonio Ãsuga was led away in handcuffs following the raid Colombia's most wanted drug trafficker and the leader of the country's largest criminal gang has been captured. Dairo Antonio Ãsuga, better known as Otoniel, was seized after a joint operation by the army, air force and police on Saturday. The government had offered a $800,000 (Â£582,000) reward for information about his whereabouts, while the US placed a $5m bounty on his head. President IvÃ¡n Duque hailed Otoniel's capture in a televised video message. ""This is the biggest blow against drug trafficking in our country this century,"" he said. ""This blow is only comparable to the fall of Pablo Escobar in the 1990s."" Otoniel was captured in his rural hideout in Antioquia province in north-western Colombia, close to the border with Panama. The operation involved 500 soldiers supported by 22 helicopters. One police officer was killed. Otoniel had used a network of rural safe houses to move around and evade the authorities, and did not use a phone, instead relying on couriers for communication. In the past, police have found special orthopaedic mattresses for Otoniel in these sparse homes, as he suffered back pain from a herniated disc. Police chief Jorge Vargas has said the drug lord was fearful of capture, ""never approaching inhabited areas"". BACKGROUND: Colombia's hunt for an elusive drug lord But El Tiempo newspaper said that authorities managed to pinpoint the location where he was eventually captured two weeks ago. Chief Vargas said his movements were traced by more than 50 signal intelligence experts using satellite imagery. US and UK agencies were involved in the search. Mr Duque, quoted by AFP news agency, described the operation as ""the biggest penetration of the jungle ever seen in the military history of our country"". Otoniel was escorted by the security forces after his capture - and some posed for photos Colombia's armed forces later released a photo showing its soldiers guarding Otoniel, who was in handcuffs and wearing rubber boots. There have been several huge operations involving thousands of officers to capture the 50-year-old in recent years, but until now none has been successful. There's no doubt this is seen as a coup by Colombian authorities - they've been trying to capture Otoniel for several years now. The Gulf Cartel is a formidable and violent organisation with a great deal of power. And the comparisons with Pablo Escobar are understandable. Otoniel is a household name and has been hugely powerful, especially in the north west of the country. ""In South America, there is no larger cocaine trafficker,"" says Toby Muse, author of Kilo: Inside the Cocaine Cartels. ""We are living in the golden age of cocaine, we are producing more cocaine than ever - that's a fact."" But the parallels perhaps stop there - Otoniel is not as well-known outside of Colombia. And speak to people who lived in the country at the peak of Pablo Escobar's power, many feel they were more frightening times. The question is, will Otoniel's capture impact the trade of the illicit drug? It's hard to know now. We'll have to see what happens in the coming months but most experts seem to think that while demand for cocaine remains strong, it's likely there will be new ""capos"" rising to the top to replace him. Born in Antioquia in the early 1970s, Otoniel jumped between several guerrilla and paramilitary groups - including the Farc (Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia), the major Marxist-Leninist rebel group, and the United Self-Defence Forces of Colombia (AUC), a far-right paramilitary and drug trafficking gang. When the AUC dissolved in 2005, he began working for the drug lord Daniel RendÃ³n Herrera, known as Don Mario - head of the UrabeÃ±os, which later became known as the Gulf Clan. Otoniel then took charge of the group after its previous leader - his brother - was killed by police in a raid on a New Year's Eve party almost 10 years ago. Colombia's security forces labelled the gang as the country's most powerful criminal organisation, while authorities in the US describe it as ""heavily armed [and] extremely violent"". The gang, which operates in many provinces and has extensive international connections, is engaged in drug and people smuggling, illegal gold mining and extortion. It is believed to have about 1,800 armed members, who are mainly recruited from far-right paramilitary groups. Members have been arrested in Argentina, Brazil, Honduras, Peru and Spain. The gang controls many of the routes used to smuggle drugs from Colombia to the US, and as far away as Russia. The Colombian government, however, believes it has decimated its numbers in recent years, forcing many leading members to hide in remote regions in the jungle. Otoniel now faces a number of charges, including sending shipments of cocaine to the US, killing police officers and recruiting children. He was indicted in the US in 2009, and faces extradition proceedings, which could see him eventually appear in court in New York.

Chancellor to announce 'skills revolution' funding,"Healthcare Science is one of the T-levels already on offer The government will reconfirm its commitment to a ""skills revolution"" with a spending package to be unveiled by the chancellor on Wednesday. Rishi Sunak will announce Â£1.6bn to roll out newT-levels,externalfor 16 to 19-year-olds, and Â£550m for adult skills in England in his autumn statement. And there will be Â£830m confirmed to continue a five-year-scheme to revamp and modernise colleges. College principals said the funding was welcome but would not go far enough. Sixth form colleges and 16-19 education finances have been struggling for many years. A report by the IPPR think-tank last year suggested colleges in England would have needed an extra Â£2.7bn a year since 2010 just to catch up with investment levels then. Scrapping B-Tecs 'hammer blow for social mobility' Millions 'could miss out on new skills scheme' What will teenagers study for the new T-levels? The Â£1.6bn cash investment for colleges over three years to 2024-25 will be used, in the main, to provide additional classroom hours for up to 100,000 young people taking T-levels. Presently there are about 6,000 students on T-level courses. These are the government's new vocational qualifications, equivalent to three A-levels, that have been developed with businesses to meet the needs of industry. Currently, there are 10 T-levels available currently However, in time the government wants the list to be expanded to include training for many more professions. The funding will also cover inflationary pressures and accommodate the higher number of teenagers in the population. An extra Â£550m is being invested in adult skills through the Skills Fund by 2024-25. This fund offers short courses and so-called ""skills boot camps"" for adults who have no qualifications beyond GCSE level. And there is a further Â£170m for apprenticeships and training. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Our future economic success depends not just on the education we give to our children but the lifelong learning we offer to adults."" He said his Â£3bn investment would create a ""skills revolution"", which would build on the government's job creation plans and spread opportunity across the UK by transforming post-16 education. Mr Sunak told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show ""more sector-orientated training schemes have been shown to be really powerful"" and ""the best way to get to a high wage economy is to improve people's skills"". At the heart of the government's plan for 16 to 19-year-olds in England is a qualification that few have yet heard of, the Technical or T-Level. One T-level is designed to be equivalent to three A-levels, or up to 3 BTecs. T-Levels are meant to be substantial and quite demanding courses, which include at least 45 days of work placement. At the moment, only around 6,000 students across England are enrolled to study the first T-levels, which they will complete next summer. The government hopes to scale up the numbers rapidly as more T-levels are introduced, partly through a controversial decision to remove funding from popular BTecs in similar subjects. Association of Colleges chief executive David Hughes said: ""We always expected the increased funding wouldn't go far enough, but in the circumstances we view this as a good start in a tough spending round. ""That the chancellor is leading with this announcement in advance of the Comprehensive Spending Review shows just how far we've come in making the government recognise the importance of investing in people to close the skills gap."" He added: ""I am hopeful that the lack of mention of education recovery is because of a significant announcement on Wednesday at the dispatch box."" He said his organisation had calculated that it was going to take at least Â£300m per year to support education recovery for 16 to 19-year-olds. Bill Watkins, chief executive of the Sixth Form Colleges Association, said: ""Today's announcement focuses on the small minority of 16 to 18-year-olds that pursue a technical course. ""That's welcome, but all students deserve to have their education properly funded and we hope that Wednesday's spending review will also focus on the vast majority of young people that study A-level or BTec qualifications."" Geoff Barton, general secretary of the Association of School and College Leaders, welcomed the investment in the further education sector, which he said had traditionally been ""starved of funding"". However, he told BBC Breakfast the move was a ""gamble"" when it was still unclear how many teenagers would want to do T-levels.

"UK says new NI Protocol talks 'constructive'A government source says the EU has offered ""things that we can work with"" but gaps remain.Northern Ireland","The protocol is the Brexit deal for Northern Ireland which keeps it in the EU's single market for goods The first round of new talks on theNorthern Ireland Protocolwas ""constructive"", UK officials have said. However big gaps remain, particularly onthe role of the European Court of Justice(ECJ). EU and UK officials held technical talks in Brussels last week, and an EU team will arrive in London on Tuesday to continue negotiations. The lead negotiators, Lord Frost and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ, are expected to meet at the end of next week. A European Commission spokesperson declined to comment on the talks. Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem Why is there a Brexit row over a European court? The protocol is the Brexit deal which prevents a hard Irish border by keeping Northern Ireland inside the EU's single market for goods. That also creates a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, something the EU accepts is causing difficulties for many businesses. Unionist politicians say the arrangement undermines Northern Ireland's place in the UK. Unionists say the protocol damages trade and threatens Northern Ireland's place in the UK The EU has suggested a package of reforms which would reduce the practical impacts of the protocol. The UK wants more fundamental change, including the removal of the ECJ from its oversight role in the deal. A UK government source said: ""The talks this week were constructive and we've heard some things from the EU that we can work with. ""There's been plenty of speculation about governance this week but our position remains unchanged: the role of the ECJ in resolving disputes between the UK and EU must end. ""We need to see real progress soon rather than get stuck in a process of endless negotiation. ""Whether we're able to establish that momentum soon will help us determine if we can bridge the gap or if we need to use Article 16."" Lord Frost is expected to meet his EU counterpart MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ next week Article 16 is the part of the deal which allows parts of the protocol to be temporarily suspended if they are causing serious difficulties or leading to diversion of trade. If one side uses Article 16 the other can take ""proportionate rebalancing measures"". Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveney has suggested the talks have a rough deadline of late December. He told the Press Association news agency that there is a finite ""window"" within which the EU is willing to find solutions. ""I think that window is on offer now to the British government if they want to use it to find a way of implementing the protocol in a way that responds to the vast majority of the issues and problems that have been raised,"" he said. ""I can't tell you when the EU will decide that that approach is getting us nowhere if there's no agreement. ""But certainly I think there's a window between now and late December, when the EU, I think, will be open to continuing dialogue and trying to find a way of making this work.""
