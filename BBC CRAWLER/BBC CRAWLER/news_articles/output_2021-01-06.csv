The people who still believe Trump won,"Dillard Ungeheuer, shown in Mound City, says he believes Biden ballots were sneaked into electoral offices at night Weeks after President-elect Joe Biden was declared winner of November's election, there remains a deep mistrust of the electoral process among many ardent supporters of Donald Trump. It reflects a broader sentiment among conservatives, one that has profound implications for the nation and its institutions. Standing on Main Street, Dillard Ungeheuer, 73, was scraping cow manure off his shoes, left over from a visit to a feed lot, and seemed testy. When it came to the ballots, he was emphatic - many were fake. ""I'm not going to argue with nobody about it,"" he says, voice rising. ""I believe what I'm saying is factual."" His indignation over the presidential election, and the government writ large, was palpable, and his feelings were shared by many in town. ""No, I don't have much faith in government at all,"" he says. US President Donald Trump lost the election to his Democratic rival, Joe Biden, and his efforts to have that result overturned in the courts have failed. On 6 January, the electoral votes from each state will be counted by Congress. Although some Republicans have said they would challenge this final step in the process of certifying the winner of the election, it will only delay, rather than change, the outcome. In Mound City , located in Linn County, 80% of the people voted for Trump, and many doubt the election results Interviews with some two dozen Republican voters in the Midwestern state of Kansas reveal a picture of how they see the world. Most felt they had been cheated out of a victory, and that democratic institutions, particularly the electoral process, were broken. Most Republican voters, in Kansas and elsewhere, either believe Trump won the election or they are not certain of the victor,polls like this one from Northeastern University suggest.,external Jackie Taylor, 59, publisher of the Linn County News in Pleasanton, says the election was stolen: ""The whole thing is dirty. You've got a guy who got elected under dirty circumstances, and now he's president."" How you can be US president without winning most votes Senator Ted Cruz on Donald Trump: Then and now When asked why they thought the election was rigged, many said they got their news from Newsmax, One America News and other outlets that have broadcast stories about alleged voter fraud. These media companies were relatively obscure until Trump took office. He frequently mentions them and has raised their profile. Tyler Johnson says he believes that some of the ballots were fraudulent Others say they did not know anyone who supported Biden, and have seen only Trump yard signs. For them, it was inconceivable that Biden could win. They hold an unshakeable belief, despite the lack of any evidence, that liberals stole the election. Their views are reflected in the programmes they watch, and are discussed in coffeehouses, at gas stations and other places in town. They called for an overhaul of the system, saying stricter controls should be imposed on voters. They said they were afraid that Biden would demolish what remained of American democracy, turning the country into a socialist state. Tyler Johnson, 35, spoke about election fraud while standing next to his Chevy, one outfitted with a feed box. Earlier, outside town, a pickup truck had kicked up dust plumes, rising as high as a barn, and a sign, just off route 69, said: ""Vote - remove every Democrat."" Johnson does not think Democrats should be in charge: ""With there being questions in the election, it makes me question everything they stand for."" He raises calves like his father did - and the way he hopes his two-year-old son, Monroe, will someday - and fears Democrats will sabotage the cattle industry. ""With all the rules that the Biden presidency wants to enforce on us, it makes me wonder - is my lifestyle going to be a viable one for my son, as it was for my dad, and to me?"" he says. In Mound City, named after a hill with sugar maples, known as Sugar Mound, voters express scepticism about Biden Their wariness of the electoral process could lead to a deeper divide in the US, with some believing in the Biden White House and others rejecting it. ""America is in a very fragile position,"" says Edward Foley, an election law scholar at Ohio State University in Columbus. He describes mistrust of the electoral process as ""a real challenge to the very premise of the system"". What's in store for President-elect Biden? Foley recalls another moment in history when a battle broke out over an election.  In 2000, the Republican candidate, George W Bush, won Florida, and its electoral votes, by a narrow 537 votes, clinching the election. Supporters of his Democratic rival, Al Gore, were distraught. ""There was this fear that officials would use political power to manipulate the ballots,"" he says, although there was no serious effort to undermine the process. The Democrats brought the matter before the Supreme Court, but the justices halted their efforts. It fizzled out. Mike Avery says he believes Democrats may have won through nefarious means Today, however, Trump and his allies have cast serious doubt on Biden's victory. Roger Marshall, a newly elected US Senator from Kansas, is planning to raise objections about Biden's victory on Wednesday as members of Congress meet for a joint session to certify the election results. Marshall and about a dozen other conservative senators will challenge votes in some states - a doomed, last-ditch effort to stop Biden. When asked whether contesting the election erodes confidence in the process, Marshall says he is pressing the issue because ""I want to give people confidence in future elections, so I couldn't possibly undermine people's confidence any more than it is right now"". His concerns are shared by many in the area, a deeply conservative region. Here, fears of socialism and dread about a Biden presidency are intense. ""I feel that we're going to see the first signs of socialism,"" says Mike Avery, 53, the owner of a lumberyard on Main Street, located in Linn County, where 80% of eligible voters cast ballots for Trump. Ungeheuer, who makes corral fences, says of Biden's policies: ""You can't start giving everybody something, and have me work my butt off and run a business, and expect me to give it away. Venezuela didn't do very good, following a socialistic agenda."" Kansas conservatives such as Julia Smith are calling for an overhaul of the voting system There are now also calls in Kansas and elsewhere to tighten restrictions on voting. ""I think the election was rigged, with the mail-in ballots. I think there were just people who are no longer with us that voted,"" says Julia Smith, 65, who is retired. ""I think we're going to have to go back to voting in person, with ID."" For her, Trump's defeat was proof the Democrats had pulled a fast one, and she says their efforts should be stopped. Then she pulled her coat tight against an icy wind and headed up the road. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Can rebel Republicans overturn the election?,"This video can not be played How an election is supposed to be certified by Congress Election Day may feel like an era ago but the presidential saga isn't over yet. Now it's time for Congress to take centre stage - and there's already political drama aplenty. Americans cast their ballots on 3 November, setting in motion the electoral proceedings that led to Democrat Joe Biden becoming the US President-elect. But the presidential cycle is not done and dusted until Congress approves the Electoral College results and Mr Biden takes his oath of office on 20 January. From constitutional deadlines to congressional objections, there's a lot to explain. First things first... When Americans go to the polls in presidential elections they're actually voting for a group of officials who make up the electoral college. The word ""college"" here simply refers to a group of people with a shared task. These people are electors and their job is to choose the president and vice-president, based on the popular vote of their states. There are 538 electors in total, divvyed up among the states. Each elector represents one electoral vote, and a candidate needs to gain a majority of the votes - 270 or more - to win the presidency. In this election, President-elect Joe Biden defeated President Donald Trump by 306-232. He also won the popular vote by more than seven million ballots. Vice-President Mike Pence will preside over the count The electoral college meets every four years, a few weeks after election day, to cast their electoral votes. Congress will finalise the results of the 2020 election by certifying the electoral college votes. It's a part of the process enshrined in the Constitution. All 50 states have certified the election result, some after recounts and legal appeals. The people who ultimately pick the US president Inauguration 2021:Â What to expect as Biden sworn in On 14 December, members of the electoral college sent off their votes in sealed certificates to Congress from across the country. On 6 January, these certificates will enter the Capitol in mahogany ballot boxes. Members of both the House of Representatives and Senate from both parties will read the votes out in alphabetical state order and tally them up. Vice-president Mike Pence, who is the president of the Senate, will preside and eventually declare the winner. This video can not be played Senator Ted Cruz on Donald Trump: then and now His role as president of the Senate is to ""open all the certificates"" in the presence of the House of Representatives and the Senate, according to the US Constitution. OK, so once he does that, Biden is winner and we all go home? Not this year. Keep reading. Taking their cue from the outgoing president, several lawmakers have said they will raise objections. This is against the advice of Senate leader Mitch McConnell. An objection will be heard only if a member of the House and Senate both submit it. Then, the two chambers are allocated two hours per objection to debate the matter before voting on whether to uphold it or not. For a state's electoral votes to be tossed out, majorities in both the House and Senate must vote to do so. With the House in Democratic control and the Senate with Republicans, this would be all but impossible to pull off. While there is certainly precedent for post-election pushback, and objections have been recorded before (most recently in 2005), no debate has ever resulted in electoral votes being thrown out. It's not exactly Donald Trump's last stand - he may never stop questioning the validity of the 2020 presidential election - but the congressional counting of Electoral College votes is the last major procedural hurdle between Joe Biden and his inauguration. It is a hurdle Biden, with help of Democrats and some Republicans, is sure to clear. It is also the last chance for the president's supporters in Congress to demonstrate fealty to their man while he still holds office. As such, the day's (and night's, and perhaps next morning's) events could shed light on the breadth of support the president still enjoys. Already, there are signs that his backing may not be as strong as even recent predictions suggested. If Republicans fall short of 100 votes in the House and the Senate can't muster much more than the dozen senators who have already announced their intention to object, it could indicate a party sharply divided over its future. Does it involve unquestioning loyalty to Trump or one where his power is receding? No matter the outcome, that such a remarkable, unprecedented attempt to reject the results of a democratic election could become a political litmus test will not easily be forgotten by many. Eleven Republican senators, led by Texas Senator Ted Cruz, want a 10-day delay to audit unsubstantiated allegations of election fraud. In a statement, they said November's election had ""featured unprecedented allegations of voter fraud, violations and lax enforcement of election law, and other voting irregularities"". This video can not be played Can you explain the electoral college in 10 seconds? There is no proof of widespread voter fraud and numerous legal challenges have been tossed out in the courts. An investigation by the federal Department of Justice (DOJ) found no evidence to back any claims of fraud. The lawmakers said they did not want to ""thwart the democratic process"" but prove that the election was ""lawfully conducted"". Separately, Missouri Senator Josh Hawley has also announced he will object when Congress counts the votes. In the House, Alabama Congressman Mo Brooks heads the group of dozens of Trump loyalists disputing Mr Biden's win in certain states. The representatives are objecting to results in the six key swing states won by Mr Biden where the president has challenged the results (Arizona, Georgia, Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Nevada). They argue that these states may not have followed election laws properly. The vote row has also prompted questions over Vice-President Mike Pence's role as the one presiding over the joint meeting of Congress. Mr Pence has said he ""welcomes"" the lawmakers' objections. But by US election law, Mr Pence's duty is purely administrative - and it is highly unlikely he will try to overstep. Ted Cruz on Donald Trump: Then and now.

Democrats take control of Senate with Georgia wins,"Raphael Warnock, seen here during the campaign, is the first black senator for Georgia The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden has won control of the Senate - and of Congress overall - with two victories in the state of Georgia. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff defeated Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue respectively. Democrats will control the Senate, the House of Representatives and the White House for the first time since 2009. An estimated four million Georgians turned out to vote in the run-off election. The result is a severe blow for outgoing Republican President Donald Trump. The Georgia election was rerun because none of the candidates in the November general election achieved the 50% needed for victory under state rules. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? Mr Warnock, a Baptist pastor, becomes the first black senator for Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black member of the Senate in US history. Mr Warnock paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. ""The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said. Jon Ossoff is a 33-year-old documentary filmmaker With the result in Georgia, the Democrats and the Republicans will now each have 50 seats in the Senate, the upper house of Congress. However, the incoming Democratic vice-president, Kamala Harris, will preside over the Senate once she takes office and will have the tie-breaking vote. This gives the Biden administration a greater chance of achieving its agenda on issues such as healthcare and climate change. The Senate also has the power to approve or reject Mr Biden's nominees for cabinet and judicial posts. It appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up at the polls in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Meanwhile, Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers. The two Democrats at times ran as a team, and appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Mr Ossoff drew out suburban and educated voters around Atlanta. Donald Trump is set to receive considerable blame for the Republican defeat. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state. Instead, the two races remained close, as Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Georgia's Republican leaders. It turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it will cost Republicans control of the Senate. Both races were very tight. Mr Warnock defeated Senator Kelly Loeffler by a projected 50.7% to 49.3%, figures from the Associated Press indicate. Ms Loeffler, who was appointed to the Senate last year to fill a vacancy, is a Trump loyalist. The other contest was even closer. Jon Ossoff edged ahead of Senator David Perdue, 70, taking 50.28% to 49.72%. This video can not be played Jon Ossoff: 'Georgia, thank you for the confidence you've placed in me' Final results are expected later. President Trump continued to make unsubstantiated claims of electoral fraud, doubting the integrity of the Georgia vote. On Sunday, a recording emerged of Mr Trump putting pressure on Georgia's top election official, Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, to ""find"" enough votes to overturn Mr Biden's win in the state. Raphael Warnock, 51, is a pastor at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta - the church where civil rights leader Martin Luther King once preached. Mr Warnock was a youth pastor in New York City in the 1990s before moving to Baltimore, one of the poorest cities in the US. The story of historically black colleges in the US There, he worked to educate his congregation about the risks of HIV/Aids. He also supports access to abortion, making him a rarity among faith leaders, and opposes the death penalty. In 2013, he gave the benediction at the second inauguration of President Barack Obama. Jon Ossoff, 33, is a documentary filmmaker, born in Atlanta. As a high school student, he interned for John Lewis, the civil rights campaigner and congressman who died in 2020. He became an aide to a Democratic member of Congress, specialising in foreign policy and national security. In 2012, Mr Ossoff joined an independent production company specialising in investigative journalism, Insight TWI, which is based in London. He is now the CEO.

World reacts to 'attack on US democracy',"Supporters of US President Donald Trump stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday World leaders have condemned violent scenes in Washington after supporters of US President Donald Trump stormed the Capitol building on Wednesday. The riot forced the suspension of a joint session of Congress to certify Joe Biden's electoral victory. Many leaders called for peace and an orderly transition of power, describing what happened as ""horrifying"" and an ""attack on democracy"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned the ""disgraceful scenes"". ""The United States stands for democracy around the world and it is now vital that there should be a peaceful and orderly transfer of power,"" he wrote on Twitter. Other UK politicians joined him in criticising the violence,with opposition leader Sir Keir Starmer calling it a ""direct attack on democracy"". Home Secretary Priti Patel told the BBC that Mr Trump's comments""directly led"" to his supporters storming Congress and clashing with police. This video can not be played Home Secretary Priti Patel says Donald Trump was wrong for not condemning the violence Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeontweeted that the scenes from the US Capitol were ""utterly horrifying"".,external In Germany, Chancellor Angela Merkel said those who stormed the US legislature were ""attackers and rioters"" and that she felt ""angry and also sad"" after seeing pictures from the scene. She told a meeting of German conservatives: ""I regret very much that President Trump has still not admitted defeat, but has kept raising doubts about the elections."" China meanwhile attempted to draw comparisons between the rioters who entered Congress to try and subvert the US election result and pro-democracy protesters who stormed Hong Kong's Legislative Council last year. Foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying claimed events in Hong Kong were more ""severe"" than those in Washington but ""not one demonstrator died"". The comparisons between the two incidents has caused outrage among Hong Kong's pro-democracy activists and their supporters. Live: Violence engulfs Capitol as Trump supporters run riot In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol The people who still believe Trump won Russia blamed the ""archaic"" US electoral system and the politicisation of the media for Wednesday's unrest in Washington. ""The electoral system in the United States is archaic, it does not meet modern democratic standards, creating opportunities for numerous violations, and the American media have become an instrument of political struggle,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said. Elsewhere in Europe, a chorus of leaders condemned the scenes in Washington as an attack on democracy. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said: ""I have trust in the strength of US democracy. The new presidency of Joe Biden will overcome this tense stage, uniting the American people."" In a video on Twitter,French President Emmanuel Macron said,external: ""When, in one of the world's oldest democracies, supporters of an outgoing president take up arms to challenge the legitimate results of an election, a universal idea - that of 'one person, one vote' - is undermined. ""What happened today in Washington DC is not American, definitely. We believe in the strength of our democracies. We believe in the strength of American democracy"" he added. Swedish Prime Minister Stefan Lofven described the incident as ""worrying"" and said it was ""an assault on democracy"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Congress in turmoil as rioters breach building,"This video can not be played Police place US Capitol Building on lockdown after Trump supporters breached security lines Violent supporters of President Donald Trump have breached the Capitol in Washington, as lawmakers met to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's poll win. In dramatic scenes, demonstrators swarmed the building as Congress members were escorted out by police. Mr Biden said it was an ""insurrection"", and Mr Trump released a video message asking supporters to go home. The joint session of Congress certifying Mr Biden's win has been suspended and forced into recess. There are reports of guns drawn in the building and at least one person shot. A woman was reported to be in a critical condition and several police were injured. There has been an armed confrontation at the doors of the House of Representatives. Tear gas has also been used. Follow our live updates from Washington US Capitol stormed - in pictures World leaders react to 'horrifying' scenes in Washington Rioters were seen marching through the building chanting ""We want Trump"" and one was photographed in the Senate president's chair. Washington police said it was clear the crowd was intent on using chemical irritants to force entry to the building. Tear gas is used to disperse protesters at the Capitol building After an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement. But there is little sign that the protesters are obeying Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT). Mr Trumprecorded a video message on Twitter,externalcalling on supporters to leave the Capitol, but continuing to make unsubstantiated claims that Democrats had stolen the election. ""I know your pain, I know you're hurt,"" he said. ""You have to go home now, we have to have peace... we don't want anybody hurt."" Mr Biden said the demonstration ""borders on sedition and it must end now"". ""At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault,"" he said. Political figures across the world expressed shock.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned ""disgraceful scenes""and called for a ""peaceful and orderly transfer of power"". Mr Trump's spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, tweeted that the National Guard was being deployed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Troops and police have also been mobilised in neighbouring states, and the FBI has been deployed to help Capitol police. There are also reports of protests at state legislatures around the country. By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington On the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters are packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers keep a watchful eye. The mood here is tense and defiant. ""We're not [expletive] Antifa!"" one man screams at the police, referring to the loose coalition of ""anti-fascist"" activists that oppose Mr Trump. Trump loyalists near him wave placards that say ""show us the ballots"". ""All we want is for the Capitol police to stand down, and surrender the building to us,"" says one man to news cameras, as he is filmed by other Trump supporters. The conviction here is that the election was stolen from President Trump, and the lawmakers inside the building should do their duty and somehow award the election to him. Never mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence. It's a siege mentality here, as word spreads through the crowd that the National Guard is on its way to the Capitol. A joint session of Congress was being held to certify Mr Biden's election victory on 3 November. The proceedings are usually brief and ceremonial but Republican lawmakers have been objecting to some results. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters For days Mr Trump had also been putting pressure on Mr Pence, who is presiding over the session, to block certification of the result. The people who still believe Trump won Can rebel Republicans overturn the election? What is the electoral college?

By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington On the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters are packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers keep a watchful eye. The mood here is tense and defiant. ""We're not [expletive] Antifa!"" one man screams at the police, referring to the loose coalition of ""anti-fascist"" activists that oppose Mr Trump.

Never mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence.

Biden blasts Trump supporters' 'siege' of Capitol,"This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol US President-elect Joe Biden has blasted the ""insurrection"" of pro-Trump supporters who stormed the US Congress in a riot that saw a woman shot dead. The Democrat demanded outgoing President Donald Trump ""step up"" and repudiate the violence. Mr Trump, who had urged the demonstrators to march on the Capitol, later called on them to ""go home"". A joint session of Congress confirming Mr Biden's election win has resumed after it was suspended by the mayhem. US Vice-President Mike Pence started the session on Wednesday evening, saying it had been a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". Earlier, the protesters fought their way past police into the complex, shouting and waving Trump and US flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned. This video can not be played 'I just want the real winner to be president' In stunning scenes beamed around the world, the invasion sent members of Congress scrambling for cover under their seats as a gunshot rang out and tear gas was fired in the Capitol Rotunda. A female civilian who was shot inside the US Capitol during the chaos has died, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department said. Federal law enforcement official said two suspected explosive devices were found and were both rendered safe by the FBI and Capitol Hill police. The rampage came as two Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia, which shifted the balance of Congress to their party's effective political control, aiding the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated on 20 January. In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol Democrats take control of Senate with Georgia wins The Democrat, who defeated the Republican president in November's White House election, said the protesters' activity ""borders on sedition"". Speaking from Wilmington, Delaware, he also said democracy was ""under unprecedented assault"".

""It's not protest; it's insurrection."" The people who still believe Trump won Can rebel Republicans overturn the election? What is the electoral college? Mr Trump responded in a recorded video on Twitter, repeating his unproven claims of election fraud. ""I know your pain. I know you're hurt,"" said the president. ""We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. ""But you have to go home now. We have to have peace."" This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters For the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account. The social media company announced it would keep the account locked for 12 hours, demanding he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening ""permanent suspension"". Facebook and Instagram followed suit. Social media giants remove Trump video Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump addressed a ""Save America Rally"" outside the White House. He had urged supporters to head to the Capitol and said: ""Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore."" Little is known about the woman who died, but disturbing footage from the scene shows her slumped on the ground with blood on her face. Police have not yet released her identity and it is unclear who fired the shot. Local US media have named her as a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter, Ashli Babbitt. The protesters surged up the Capitol steps at around 14:15 local time (19:15 GMT), shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee. They marched through the building shouting ""Where are they?"" and chanting ""We want Trump"". A protester jumps over a balcony to reach the Senate floor One climbed on to the Senate dais and shouted: ""Trump won that election."" Another protester was photographed sitting in House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office with a foot on the table. Police with guns drawn piled furniture against the doors of the House chamber to keep protesters out. Members of Congress - including Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, who is a senator - were told to evacuate the building. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police. After sitting at the desk of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one protester leaves a message reading ""we will not back down"" After an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement. But there was little sign the protesters were heeding Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT). Meanwhile, a suspicious device was found outside the Republican National Committee's headquarters, near the Capitol complex, and it was detonated by a bomb squad. Tear gas is used to disperse protesters at the Capitol building Washington DC Metropolitan Police said five guns were seized. At least 13 people were arrested. There were also protests at state legislatures in Kansas, Georgia, Utah and on the other side of the country in Oregon and the north-western state of Washington.

Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor. The Kentucky senator warned: ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral."" After the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as ""rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists"". He said the president ""bears a great deal of the blame"".

Clap for Carers to return for new lockdown,"Clap for Carers is to return under a new name of Clap for Heroes, the initiative's founder has said. The weekly applause for front-line NHS staff and other key workers ran for 10 weeks during the UK's first coronavirus lockdown last spring. Founder Annemarie Plas tweeted that it would return at 20:00 GMT on Thursday. Ms Plas said she hoped the initiative would ""lift the spirit of all of us"" including ""all who are pushing through this difficult time"". Allow Twitter content?

The idea of clapping and banging pots from doorsteps originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown for the first time. After proving popular it was expanded to cover all key workers and continued every Thursday for 10 weeks, with millions of people across the UK taking part. Members of the Royal Family and politicians including Prime Minister Boris Johnson also joined in with the show of support. However, the event later faced criticism for becoming politicised, with some suggesting the NHS would benefit more from extra funding than applause. Is this the last hurrah for clap for carers? Clap for Carers creator on her viral challenge Last May, Ms Plas, a Dutch national living in south London,said the weekly applause should end after its 10th weekand instead become an annual event. At the time, she said the public had ""shown our appreciation"" and it was now up to ministers to ""reward"" key workers. ""Without getting too political, I share some of the opinions that some people have about it becoming politicised,"" she told the PA news agency ahead of the final clap in May.

'How long can we keep going like this? About a week',"This video can not be played WATCH: ICU hospital staff ""scared, sad, petrified, worried"" I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I first visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. I asked one of the consultants who I've met several times in the last year, Dr Jim Down, how long they can keep going like this - and the answer was stark. ""At this rate, about a week. After that we really need to see it slow down or we're going to see the care we can deliver suffering."" Newscast: NHS on the brink They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Dr Alice Carter compares it to an elastic band that is close to snapping. ""It gets to a point where you stretch so far it never returns back to its baseline. I think that's probably where we are now. It's not going to take much more for that elastic band to break, and that's the real fear for us at the moment."" Dr Alice Carter: 'It's not going to take much more for that elastic band to break' That could have very serious consequences, she adds. ""If we get to that point, we can't offer anyone ICU, not just Covid patients, but anyone who has a traffic accident or a heart attack or a stroke - whatever it is, to take them in."" For 38-year-old Rachel Arfin, one of the three pregnant women in intensive care with Covid-19, treatment is more complicated. Her baby is due in five weeks and the staff have to monitor them both. ""They can't do anything that will harm the baby,"" she says. ""All the time [they are] checking, monitoring the baby."" She is reassured by the ""beautiful sound"" of her baby's heartbeat. ""They are looking after two people in one. They're saving lives,"" says Rachel. But her children - she has seven - keep asking when she's coming home. Rachel Arfin's baby is due in five weeks - both are doing well I've reported from here several times during the pandemic and am always struck by the professionalism and dedication of staff. It's always quiet and calm, but that belies what's actually happening. This is a system under strain like never before. The warning signs are clear, the NHS is on the brink. Unless infection rates fall, soon it will have a serious impact. The pressure on staff is unrelenting. I saw two nurses in tears. Compared to when I visited in April, it's a lot busier. In some ways, it's more structured - they now know what they're dealing with. They've got new treatments, such as the drug dexamethasone, which they didn't have last time. And many of the staff have now had the first dose of the vaccine. But other aspects don't get any easier, such as the emotional burden of breaking bad news over a telephone or video call. It is very different to being able to hold someone's hand. Staff say they don't know which patients to help first ICU staff have incredibly high standards. They're used to doing everything meticulously and perfectly. And they're doing all they can. But sometimes they go home and feel guilty that they can't do more. The impact on nurses - the bedrock of care in intensive care - is visible. The highly specialised staff are usually one-to-one with patients. Deputy sister Ashleigh Shillingford is looking after three or four ventilated patients at a time, with one other junior member of staff. It's emotional and often devastating work. ""We are so stretched we have to prioritise and prioritising care is not the NHS that I grew up in - we shouldn't have to choose which patient gets what care first."" She says she's never had to make decisions like these before. ""You just don't know who to help first. The patients are losing their lives at a dramatic speed, we're not just getting old people,"" she says, ""these are young people that we're getting."" Gerald Williams, 58, is awaiting chemotherapy for lung cancer and had been shielding, but he still caught coronavirus. ""All of a sudden, out of the blue, Covid came knocking on my door and it's frightening - you don't know how you're getting your next breath,"" he says. Gerald Williams had been shielding but he still caught coronavirus He wants to get home to his daughters, the youngest of whom is 13. And he's annoyed at those who don't take it seriously. ""People are moaning and groaning. Even in A&E. They need to get a life. Don't be idiots, forget about meeting your mate, stay home. No-one is invulnerable."" For now the Trust is coping better than many others in London and is still taking Covid patients from other hospitals. But the next few weeks could be the biggest challenge the NHS has ever faced - and it will be its doctors and nurses who will bear the brunt for all of us.

Apology for 'significant' vaccination centre delay,"Queues formed outside the vaccination centre in Llandudno on Wednesday ""Significant delays"" at a Covid vaccination centre has prompted a health board to apologise. Betsi Cadwaladr health board said the training of ""new vaccinators"" led to the delay on Wednesday. Queues of up to three hours were reported at the vaccination centre atYsbyty Enfys,externalin Llandudno, Conwy. Bethan Jones, the health board's central area director, said it was part of the ""scaling up of our programme"" for vaccination. She added: ""We are aware there has been significant delays at our mass vaccination centre at Ysbyty Enfys Llandudno today. We apologise to everyone who has experienced a long wait for their vaccine. ""New vaccinators arrived at the site today to support the scaling up of our programme, and these individuals needed to be trained before they were able to begin vaccinating."" 'Momentous day' as Oxford Covid jab rollout begins Q&A: When will I get the Oxford vaccine? Ms Jones also said that a number of people had arrived for their appointments early, which resulted in people having to wait longer. ""We would like to remind everyone who has received an invite for the vaccination to arrive at the time that has been allocated to them, not any earlier,"" she said. ""We are doing all we can to ensure everyone is seen in a timely manner."" One person tweeted on Wednesday that the queue was two hours long, but later updated it to say it was three.

One of those who had been queueing for three hours told BBC Wales there were a ""good few hundred"" in the queue and said they were not told how long the delay would be. ""The information they gave you told you not to arrive early and not to arrive late and to wear appropriate clothing so you can lift your sleeve up and be jabbed. I went in t-shirt, jeans and a hoody and I was frozen. ""We walked round the building and there's a big car park at the back and it was just a big snake of people, a good few hundred. ""There were elderly people there, there were clearly vulnerable people, a couple of people had to have wheelchairs brought out to them because it was so cold. They weren't dressed for it, it was 2 degrees. ""There were people turning away, leaving the queue."" Monday was described as a ""momentous day"" in the fight against Covid-19 as therollout of the second Covid vaccine - Oxford-AstraZeneca - began in Wales. More than 35,000 people in Wales have had a Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - the first to be approved in the UK. Both vaccines will be available in Wales and the Welsh Government said 40,000 doses of the Oxford jab would be available within the first two weeks - with 22,000 jabs this week. Two full doses of the Oxford vaccine gave 62% protection, a half dose followed by a full dose was 90% and overall the trial showed 70% protection.

"UK records more than 1,000 daily virus deaths","The UK has reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus, the highest daily death toll since April. It came as 62,322 new cases were recorded, the highest daily rise since mass testing began, and as MPs supported England's lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said doctors could be forced to ration treatment without the new curbs. There are 30,074 Covid patients in UK hospitals, he said, as an ambulance trust told of severe pressure. Current patient numbers are 39% higher than the previous peak on 12 April last year, when 21,684 were in hospital. The number of those who died within 28 days of a positive test in the past week is 37% higher than the previous seven days. Andrew Hayward, a professor of infectious diseases, said the number of deaths could continue to increase for the next few weeks. He explained deaths ""lag two or three weeks behind the number of cases in the community, and those have been increasing"". Prof Hayward, who is also a government science adviser, added: ""I think the lockdown measures will turn that number of deaths around but it is going to take a little while."" Can lockdown stop the new variant? The UK's new lockdown rules explained Clap for Carers to return for new lockdown Mr Hancock told MPs the consequences of inaction could be similar to scenes elsewhere in the world - of overrun hospitals and doctors choosing ""who to treat and who to turn away"". ""If we don't act now, we know that eventually the NHS would not be able to cope,"" he said. West Midlands Ambulance Serviceexperienced its busiest-ever day on Monday, handling 5,383 emergency calls due to a combination of Covid-19 pressures and winter weather. Sussex and Surreyhave rolled out ""major incident"" plans, allowing the two counties to seek more central government support as pressure mounts on health services. And hospitals in Greater Manchester are in danger of ""falling over"" as cancer operations risk being cancelled, Manchester City Council's leader Sir Richard Leese said. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. While England's lockdown became law at midnight, MPs voted overwhelmingly - by 524 to 16 - in support of the tougher measures on Wednesday evening. Labour backed the restrictions but 12 Conservative MPs rebelled to vote against. Speaking during the Commons debate, Health Minister Helen Whately said although the regulations allowed the lockdown to be in place until the end of March, the government did not expect it to continue until then. Instead, the plan was for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a local basis"" to exit lockdown. Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they do not like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention. Meanwhile, GCSEs, A-level and AS-level examswill be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said. All national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are also cancelled, he confirmed. He said that during this lockdown, every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week. The figures are stark. But sadly they were to be expected. Infection rates were climbing throughout December - they are now more than four times higher than they were at the start of last month. More infections, mean more hospital admissions and more deaths. The fact deaths have gone over 1,000 for the first time since April is alarming. But one caveat to that is that the figures over the past week have been jumping around because of delays reporting deaths over the Christmas period. A better way to measure deaths is to look at the average number of deaths over the course of the week. This metric shows we are seeing just below 700 a day - although that is still up by 40% compared to the figure before Christmas. And these numbers are only going to continue rising. That's because this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions and some of those being admitted then will die maybe a week or so later. Lockdown is expected to have an impact, but it will take some time - and even then it may have less affect than previous ones because of the more transmissible variant. The rollout of the vaccines cannot come soon enough. As MPs debated the new lockdown, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for the government to ramp-up its vaccination programme to six million doses a week. It came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs England's new lockdown would not end with a ""big bang""but a ""gradual unwrapping"". He said that, unlike during the first lockdown from March 2020, vaccines now offered ""the means of our escape"". But he said there was a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half-term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League football can continue Vaccines Minister Nadhim Zahawi earlier said he was ""confident"" the ""ambitious"" target would be met, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK hadbeen vaccinatedso far. The locations for seven mass vaccination centres in Englandhave been announced by the government. Sites in Stevenage, London, Newcastle, Manchester, Surrey, Bristol and Birmingham will be staffed by NHS workers and volunteers from next week.

Mass arrests as HK swoops on pro-democracy camp,"Lester Shum was first barred from running for office, then arrested More than 50 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested in the biggest crackdown since China imposed a draconian security law last year. About 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city. Those held helped run an unofficial ""primary"" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections. They are accused of trying to ""overthrow"" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent. China's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Beijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop ""external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security"". But the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are ""the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment"". Dozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures. Police fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include: long-established opposition figures James To, Lam Cheuk-ting, Claudio Mo and Benny Tai, one of the initiators of the primaries young pro-democracy campaigners Lester Shum, Gwyneth Ho, Tiffany Yuen and Jeffrey Andrews Human rights lawyer John Clancey, a US citizen two academics behind the primaries strategy 13 candidates from the primaries Police also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets. Apple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information. Mr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works. Benny Tai was one of the architects of the primaries Hours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of ""overthrowing"" the city's government. The government will not tolerate ""subversive"" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council. If charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison. The BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call ""white terror"" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory. When authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says. In July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament. More than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests The opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms. Hong Kong's leaderCarrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion,externalif the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election. In July, Joshua Wong (on right in poster) and Lester Shum (on left) had still hoped to run for LegCo Several of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo electionwere later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests. Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers resign en masse Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? Most of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament. The crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong. ""Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it. ""I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people,"" Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency. The arrests have been widely condemned internationally. Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick as next US Secretary of State, said they were an ""assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights"". ""The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy."" Antony Blinken said Washington will stand with Hong Kong UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the arrests were a ""grievous attack"" on rights applied under the joint declaration signed with Britain when the territory was handed over in 1997. He said it demonstrated the national security law was ""being used to crush dissent and opposing political views"". Chris Patten, the territory's last British governor, said: ""The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong. Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society."" Maya Wang, China specialist at Human Rights Watch, said China was now ""removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city"". ""Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government,"" she said. Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist who fled the territory in July last year, said the widespread arrests had taken ""the suppression of political freedom and freedom of speech"" to ""another level"". ""Anyone who is still defending the National Security Law and making peace is the enemy of Hong Kong people."" By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai Beijing sees ""vicious plans"" to topple Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government. Supporters of the dozens arrested see another crude crackdown on what's left of the territory's nascent democracy. Despite co-ordinated international criticism, with some targeted retaliation, led by the US and the UK, the authorities have enthusiastically embraced their powers under the new national security law passed last year. How these latest arrests come under that jurisdiction is not yet clear. But it's worth remembering this law is ambiguous and sweeping in its definition, targeting anyone, anywhere in the world. The street protests are now a distant memory. Some prominent figures have fled to friendly countries, almost certainly never to return. The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. It has been widely criticised by rights groups and Western nations as effectively curtailing dissent. A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It retained more civil and political freedoms than the mainland has. Activists say that in recent years, these freedoms have been eroded. Pro-democracy protests have often led to violent clashes with police. Pro-democracy protests have rocked Hong Kong for years The Chinese government has defended the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice Agnes Chow: Hong Kongâs 'real Mulan' After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety and several high profile court cases under the security law have started.

Emma Barnett defends herself after guest drops out,"Emma Barnett took the reins of Woman's Hour earlier this week Woman's Hour host Emma Barnett has defended herself after a guest who was booked to appear on the BBC Radio 4 programme dropped out due to remarks the presenter made about her off-air. Kelechi Okafor said,externalshe was treated in a ""degrading"" and ""vile"" manner. Barnett said she and her producers were discussing alleged anti-Semitic remarks Okafor had made in the past. The host said she then raised these directly, adding: ""I stand by my questions to my team and to Kelechi."" Barnett said Okafor ""denied the allegations and hung up"". Okafor, who is an actress, dance instructor and podcaster, had been booked for an item about the #MeToo movement. Wednesday's programme marked a year since the trial of disgraced film producer Harvey Weinstein, who was jailed for 23 years for rape and sexual assault. The 15-minute discussion was intended to explore what the #MeToo movement has achieved. After Okafor pulled out of the programme, the item went ahead with the other guests, Rosanna Arquette and Caitlin Dulany - two of the actresses who accused Weinstein of sexual assault. Writing on Twitter, she said Barnett spoke about her in a disrespectful way, without realising she could be heard. ""The host didn't realise her mic was on as she was talking about me before the interview started,""Okafor posted.,external ""You can have a genuine concern about something you've been told about me and address it in a manner that is kind. That wasn't what took place. ""The need for me on today's show was to offer balance to these wayward women thinking that the MeToo movement is no longer needed. The fact is that if you feel it's no longer needed for your white middle class sensibilities, marginalised voices still need it. ""We haven't heard from everybody regarding the violations they've faced. The originators of the MeToo movement were black women. From enslaved black women who were raped by slave owners to Tarana Burke yet their voices are yet to be honoured."" Writing on Twitter, Barnett said:,external""Just before I went on air this morning to present a special programme about Me Too... it came to my attention that one of our guests, Kelechi Okafor, had made alleged anti-Semitic remarks. ""I was also sent a press report of the transcript of what she had said on her podcast supporting Reggie Yates's comments about Jewish male managers and profits."" Yates apologised in 2017after saying in a podcast interview: ""The thing that makes it great about this new generation of [music] artists is that they ain't signing to majors. They're independent, they're not managed by some random fat Jewish guy from north west London, they're managed by their brethren."" Later that year,Okafor said,externalYates had been speaking ""the truth"" and said his comments were ""not problematic"". Barnett continued: ""As Weinstein is also Jewish and was referenced as part of this same podcast, I was discussing with my producers the role of this guest in light of her allegedly anti-Semitic comments. Kelechi overheard that chat on our open Zoom link - with two minutes to airtime. ""I then directly talked to Kelechi about the allegations, standing by my queries, and said she could put her response across in the programme. She denied the allegations and hung up, choosing to no longer be part of the programme. ""I stand by my questions to my team and to Kelechi. I would have happily hosted her on the programme with a question on this issue."" Me Too founder says movement not over The Queen sends birthday wishes to Woman's Hour She added: ""I believe people can always answer for themselves - but equally it is my duty to ask people what qualifies them as a leading voice in a space."" A BBC spokesman said: ""During an off-air conversation ahead of the programme, Emma Barnett and the production team talked about a guest's role in the discussion, and how to reflect some of the guest's alleged previous comments and the issue of anti-Semitism as part of the Woman's Hour discussion on the role of minority voices in the MeToo movement. ""This was also raised directly with the guest before going on air."" The BBC said the off-air conversation did not make reference to Okafor's race. The alleged incident occurred on Barnett's third day as the new presenter of Woman's Hour. Dame Jenni Murray and Jane Garvey both left the programme last year. Barnett has previously spoken out against anti-Semitismon her BBC Radio 5 Live programme after controversial comments from the rapper Wiley.

Fake NHS vaccine messages sent in banking scam,"Fraudsters are sending out bogus text messages about the coronavirus vaccine in an attempt to steal bank details. The scam tells recipients they are ""eligible to apply for your vaccine"" with a link to a bogus NHS website, trading standards officers have warned. That, in turn, asks for personal information and - crucially - bank details ""for verification"". The warning comes the same day as MPs heard that Covid is leading some people into the net of pension fraudsters. The fake NHS message is one of a range of scams which have sought to take advantage of the pandemic and the isolation and legitimate worries of potential victims, according to the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. Others have included people travelling door-to-door selling counterfeit or useless protection equipment, or fraudsters claiming to be from the official test and trace service and demanding payments. Banks reveal 10 coronavirus scams to be wary of Scam warning over NHS test and trace The latest scam is preying on those elderly or vulnerable people who are fully expecting to receive legitimate information about their vaccine. Health authorities have stressed they would never ask for an individual's banking details. Katherine Hart, lead office at the CTSI, said: ""I have been tracking and warning the public about Covid-related scams since the beginning of the pandemic, and at every stage of response, unscrupulous individuals have modified their campaigns to defraud the public. ""The vaccine brings great hope for an end to the pandemic and lockdowns, but some only wish to create even further misery by defrauding others. The NHS will never ask you for banking details, passwords, or PIN numbers and these should serve as instant red flags."" She urged people to report the scams toAction Fraud,externalorPolice Scotland,external. Pensions have been stolen or put into high-risk schemes The warning came as MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee heard how fraudsters were seizing on victims' financial uncertainty during the pandemic to draw them into pension scams. Rules allowing people to withdraw cash from their pension pot from the age of 55 have led some people to move money into investment schemes which look generous, but are simply vehicles to steal money. ""Household finances are stretched and so the temptations to use savings or to be tempted by offers of 'free pension reviews', for example, which we've warned about, are very real,"" Mark Steward, from the Financial Conduct Authority told the committee. ""Of course, a 'free pension review' is hardly free. It is the first step on a process that will lead someone to investing in something that is too good to be true."" He said that fraudsters had used social media advertising to ""industrialise"" this kind of fraud. Whereas previously, fraudsters had to produce sophisticated glossy brochures and office fronts, they could now operate in anonymity on social media, sending fake information to millions of people. Millions of pounds have been lost to pension scams in recent years, but it is a crime considered to be widely under-reported by victims and pension companies. Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, told the committee that fraudsters were continuing to use new avenues to reach potential victims. ""What we're looking to do next is to move on to fake comparison websites, which is this new gateway into investment frauds, to spot those and take them down at source,"" he said.

What to expect from Biden,"The inauguration of a new president is a day that usually follows decades of custom and precedent. A day that follows a routine set in stone. Well, you can forget all that this year. Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will still take the oath, of course, to make them officially US president and vice-president, but this will be a much scaled back affair, due to Covid and the recent riots. Here's everything you need to know about the big day. The inauguration is the formal ceremony that marks the start of a new presidency, and it takes place in Washington DC. The only required feature is that the president-elect recite the presidential oath of office. ""I do solemnly swear that I will faithfully execute the Office of President of the United States, and will to the best of my ability, preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" What Joe Biden wants to do The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Does Biden's new team better reflect America? Once he utters these words, Mr Biden will then take his place as the 46th president and the inauguration will be complete (but that's not all - celebrations follow). Kamala Harris will become vice-president once she takes the oath of office, which usually happens just before the president. Opening remarks are usually scheduled for around 11:30 EST (16:30 GMT) and Joe Biden and Kamala Harris will be sworn in around midday. By law, inauguration day is always 20 January. Mr Biden will move into the White House later in the day - his home for the next four years. Presidential inaugurations typically involve detailed security plans, but even more so now, after a pro-Trump mob stormed the US Capitol on 6 January. Officials have ramped up security and closed off large sections of the city. The Secret Service has taken command of the security plans, backed up by some 25,000 National Guard troops, in addition to thousands of police officers. This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration Washington DC is already under a state of emergency and will remain that way through inauguration. Agent Matt Miller, who is leading the security effort on behalf of the Secret Service, told reporters on Friday that planning for the event has been going on for over a year. How security threats have changed Bidenâs inauguration And while Mr Biden has insisted on taking the oath of office outside, as is tradition, attendance to the event will be scaled back. It's become customary for the outgoing president to watch the next in line being sworn in, which can sometimes make things awkward. This year, it will be a different type of awkward - the outgoing president will be a no-show. ""To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th,"" Mr Trump tweeted on 8 January. He is widely expected to be travelling to his Florida residence, Mar-a-Lago. Some of his supporters say they are planning a virtual ""second inauguration"" for Mr Trump on the same day (and time) that Mr Biden takes office. More than 68,000 people said on Facebook they would attend an online event to show their support for Mr Trump.  Facebook said it removed this event the week before the inauguration, because it violated its policies. Barack Obama was there to see Donald Trump sworn in When Mr Trump was sworn in, Hillary Clinton joined her husband, former President Bill Clinton, at the inauguration - just two months after her election defeat and a bitter campaign against Mr Trump. Only three presidents - John Adams, John Quincy Adams and Andrew Johnson - have actively chosen to sit out their successor's inaugurations, and none in the last century. Vice-President Mike Pence, however, has said that he will attend. In normal circumstances, Washington DC would see hundreds of thousands of people flock to the city, swarming the National Mall and selling out hotels - an estimated two million came when President Obama was sworn in for his first term in 2009. But this year, the celebration's size will be ""extremely limited"", the Biden team has said, and it has urged Americans to avoid travelling to the capital, a call that has been repeated by DC authorities following the storming of Congress.  Viewing stands that had been constructed along the parade route have been taken down. One tradition that will be preserved is that Mr Biden and Ms Harris will still take their oaths in front of the US Capitol, overlooking the Mall (a tradition that started with President Ronald Reagan in 1981). About 200 people will sit, socially distanced, on the stage with them,the Washington Post reports,external. There will be masks and everybody on the platform will have to be tested within a couple of days of the event itself, it added. As for the moment of the swearing in itself, Mr Bidensaid back in June that he would not wear one to take the presidential oath,external. Inauguration rehearsals took place on Monday on the West Front at the Capitol In the past, up to 200,000 tickets were up for grabs to attend the official ceremony, but with infections still surging across the US, only around 1,000 tickets will be available. This year, there will still be a ""pass in review"" ceremony - a traditional part of the peaceful transfer of power, where the new commander in chief inspects the troops, but instead of the usual parade down Pennsylvania Avenue to the White House, organisers say they will host a ""virtual parade"" across the US. Chairs are arranged to allow for social distancing Mr Biden, Ms Harris and their spouses will then be escorted to the White House by members of the military, including a band and drum corps. Tickets are required for seated and standing areas near the stage and seats along the parade route in normal years, and traditionally, the rest of the National Mall remained open to the public. So if you want to watch the inaugural ceremonies from up close, you'll need to talk to your local representatives first. Inaugural balls and other related events around the city require separate tickets. Barack Obama's first inauguration reportedly drew some two million people to the celebrations Senators and members of Congress are the keepers of the keys. Each has an allotted number of free tickets that they can distribute. This year's pandemic-restricted number amounts to each lawmaker plus a guest. Commemorative tickets will be available for constituents after inauguration day. In recent years, incoming presidents have added some of the country's most beloved performers to the day's programme. Despite the pandemic, this year won't be any different. Mr Biden and Ms Harris will be joined by Lady Gaga - an active supporter of the incoming president - who will sing the national anthem, and Jennifer Lopez will sing during the ceremony's musical performance. After Mr Biden is sworn in, actor Tom Hanks will host 90-minutes of primetime television - a Covid-friendly replacement of celebrations typically held in-person. It will feature Garth Brooks, Jon Bon Jovi, Demi Lovato and Justin Timberlake and will be broadcast across all major US networks and streaming platforms - with the exception of Fox News, a conservative network that has primarily supported Mr Trump during his presidency. Beyonce performed at both of Obama's inaugurations In 2009, Aretha Franklin sang at Barack Obama's inauguration, performing My Country 'Tis of Thee. BeyoncÃ© was also present, singing At Last to the first couple at Mr Obama's inaugural ball. At his second inauguration in 2013, President Obama called on Kelly Clarkson and Jennifer Hudson to do the honours. BeyoncÃ© was back again, this time to sing the national anthem. Donald Trump reportedly had more trouble booking performers. Elton John declined Mr Trump's offer to perform, and reports circulated that Celine Dion, Kiss and Garth Brooks did the same. In the end, the Rockettes, country artist Lee Greenwood, and the band 3 Doors Down turned out for Mr Trump's day. Third time lucky: Biden's journey to White House.

McDonald's pauses walk-in takeaways in lockdown,"McDonald's is pausing walk-in takeaway services in the UK as new lockdown restrictions come into force. Dine-in meals and walk-in takeaways will not be available temporarily while it reviews safety procedures, it said. Its UK boss said it will be testing ""additional measures that may further enhance the safety of our takeaway service."" Rival food chains Burger King, Subway, KFC and Pret A Manger are still offering takeaways in-store. McDonald's UK and Ireland chief executive Paul Pomroy said that safety measures across the firm's 1,300 restaurants will be reviewed by an independent health and safety body. He added that customers would be kept updated via the restaurant's app and its website. Drive-through and delivery services across the fast food chain will remain open. McDonald's to introduce plant-based burgers and fast food Just Eat: McDonald's and Greggs help boost orders by 40% Under new lockdown restrictions which came into force in England and Scotland this week, hospitality firms are allowed to offer takeaways and deliveries. But rules which previously allowed takeaways or click-and-collect services for alcoholic drinks have been scrapped. Wales and Northern Ireland were already in lockdown, which meant that pubs, restaurants and cafes were restricted to takeaway-only too. After the first nationwide lockdown in March, many chains including McDonald's, Burger King and Pret closed their doors to hungry customers. They gradually reopened with additional safety measures in place, such as plastic screens in front of the tills, hand sanitiser dispensers and restrictions on the number of customers allowed in at any one point. Some also pared back the number of dishes on offer. A Burger King spokesperson said that takeaway was still available in some branches and that it would continue to offer click-and-collect and delivery services ""in line with guidance issued"". Sandwich chain Pret A Manger told the BBC that it is keeping some outlets open for both takeaways and delivery, but it would keep the number under review in the coming months. ""Last year we shifted our business to focus on delivery and expanded our delivery platform partnerships, to make Pret available to a wider customer base"", a spokesperson said. ""Since then, we have seen a significant increase in the use of delivery."" Subway and KFC also confirmed that they remain open for in-store takeaways, deliveries and click-and-collect orders across the UK. Fast food firm Leon, which has 65 outlets, said that 28 of their sites will remain open for takeaways and deliveries. ""We will continue to keep as many restaurants open as possible, as we did in the previous two lockdowns in line with government guidelines,"" a spokesperson said. Despite adapting their business models, many casual dining chains have been forced to make job cuts in the last year as lockdown restrictions hit sales.Pret, for example, announced 3,000 job cutsin August, whileGreggs made 820 job cuts at the end of 2020. Greggs faces first loss for 36 years amid lockdown Just Eat orders up 40% after tie-up with McDonald's McDonald's 'does not need table service' At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Breaking|Breaking newsBiden tells Trump to 'demand an end to this siege'""It's not a protest, it's an insurrection,"" says Joe Biden, as he urges Donald Trump to ""demand an end to this siege""US & Canada","This video can not be played When a mob stormed the US capitol US President-elect Joe Biden has blasted the ""insurrection"" of pro-Trump supporters who stormed the US Congress in a riot that saw a woman shot dead. The Democrat demanded outgoing President Donald Trump ""step up"" and repudiate the violence. Mr Trump, who had urged the demonstrators to march on the Capitol, later called on them to ""go home"". A joint session of Congress confirming Mr Biden's election win has resumed after it was suspended by the mayhem. US Vice-President Mike Pence started the session on Wednesday evening, saying it had been a ""dark day in the history of the United States Capitol"". Earlier, the protesters fought their way past police into the complex, shouting and waving Trump and US flags as they roamed the halls, demanding the results of the presidential election be overturned. This video can not be played 'I just want the real winner to be president' In stunning scenes beamed around the world, the invasion sent members of Congress scrambling for cover under their seats as a gunshot rang out and tear gas was fired in the Capitol Rotunda. A female civilian who was shot inside the US Capitol during the chaos has died, a spokesperson for the Metropolitan Police Department said. Federal law enforcement official said two suspected explosive devices were found and were both rendered safe by the FBI and Capitol Hill police. The rampage came as two Democrats won Senate seats in elections in Georgia, which shifted the balance of Congress to their party's effective political control, aiding the passage of Mr Biden's agenda after he is inaugurated on 20 January. In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol Democrats take control of Senate with Georgia wins The Democrat, who defeated the Republican president in November's White House election, said the protesters' activity ""borders on sedition"". Speaking from Wilmington, Delaware, he also said democracy was ""under unprecedented assault"". ""I call on President Trump to go on national television now to fulfil his oath and defend the Constitution and demand an end to this siege,"" he said. This video can not be played Joe Biden: The scenes of chaos at the Capitol do not reflect a true America, do not represent who we are ""To storm the Capitol, to smash windows, to occupy offices on the floor of the United States Senate, rummaging through desks, on the House of Representatives, threatening the safety of duly elected officials. ""It's not protest; it's insurrection."" The people who still believe Trump won Can rebel Republicans overturn the election? What is the electoral college? Mr Trump responded in a recorded video on Twitter, repeating his unproven claims of election fraud. ""I know your pain. I know you're hurt,"" said the president. ""We had an election that was stolen from us. It was a landslide election, and everyone knows it, especially the other side. ""But you have to go home now. We have to have peace."" This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters For the first time, Twitter froze Mr Trump's account. The social media company announced it would keep the account locked for 12 hours, demanding he delete three tweets that it said could stoke violence and threatening ""permanent suspension"". Facebook and Instagram followed suit. Social media giants remove Trump video Earlier on Wednesday, Mr Trump addressed a ""Save America Rally"" outside the White House. He had urged supporters to head to the Capitol and said: ""Our country has had enough and we will not take it anymore."" Little is known about the woman who died, but disturbing footage from the scene shows her slumped on the ground with blood on her face. Police have not yet released her identity and it is unclear who fired the shot. Local US media have named her as a San Diego-area US Air Force veteran and Trump supporter, Ashli Babbitt. The protesters surged up the Capitol steps at around 14:15 local time (19:15 GMT), shoving past barricades and officers in riot gear to penetrate the building. The mob - some of whom wore body armour - used chemical irritants to attack police, according to Washington Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee. They marched through the building shouting ""Where are they?"" and chanting ""We want Trump"". A protester jumps over a balcony to reach the Senate floor One climbed on to the Senate dais and shouted: ""Trump won that election."" Another protester was photographed sitting in House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office with a foot on the table. Police with guns drawn piled furniture against the doors of the House chamber to keep protesters out. Members of Congress - including Vice-President-elect Kamala Harris, who is a senator - were told to evacuate the building. Several thousand National Guard troops, FBI agents and US Secret Service were deployed to help overwhelmed Capitol police. After sitting at the desk of US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, one protester leaves a message reading ""we will not back down"" After an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement. But there was little sign the protesters were heeding Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT). Meanwhile, a suspicious device was found outside the Republican National Committee's headquarters, near the Capitol complex, and it was detonated by a bomb squad. Tear gas is used to disperse protesters at the Capitol building Washington DC Metropolitan Police said five guns were seized. At least 13 people were arrested. There were also protests at state legislatures in Kansas, Georgia, Utah and on the other side of the country in Oregon and the north-western state of Washington. By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington On the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters were packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers kept a watchful eye. The mood was tense and defiant. ""We're not [expletive] Antifa!"" one man screamed at the police, referring to the loose coalition of ""anti-fascist"" activists that oppose Mr Trump. Trump loyalists near him waved placards that said ""show us the ballots"". ""All we want is for the Capitol police to stand down, and surrender the building to us,"" said one man to news cameras, as he was filmed by other Trump supporters. The conviction was that the election was stolen from President Trump, and the lawmakers inside the building should do their duty and somehow award the election to him. Never mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence. A joint session of Congress was being held to certify Mr Biden's election victory on 3 November. The proceedings are usually brief and ceremonial but Republican lawmakers have been objecting to some results. Police have been taking up position inside the Capitol building For days Mr Trump had also been piling pressure on Mr Pence, who was presiding over the session, to block certification of the result. ""Do it Mike, this is a time for extreme courage!"" the president tweeted on Wednesday. But in a letter to Congress, Mr Pence said that he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also definitively broke with Mr Trump in an emotional speech from the chamber floor. The Kentucky senator warned: ""If this election were overturned by mere allegations from the losing side, our democracy would enter a death spiral."" After the session resumed, Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer blasted the mob at the Capitol as ""rioters and insurrectionists, goons and thugs, domestic terrorists"". He said the president ""bears a great deal of the blame"". Senator Kelly Loeffler, who lost her bid for election in Georgia's vote on Tuesday, said she could no longer in good conscience vote against certification as she had originally planned, citing the ""abhorrent"" invasion of the Capitol. This video can not be played How an election is supposed to be certified Political figures across the world expressed shock.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned ""disgraceful scenes""and called for a ""peaceful and orderly transfer of power"". German Foreign Minister Heiko Maas said: ""Trump and his supporters must accept the decision of American voters at last and stop trampling on democracy."" World reacts to 'attack on US democracy' And former US President George W Bush said in a statement: ""It is a sickening & heartbreaking sight. This is how election results are disputed in a banana republic - not our democratic republic."" Former President Barack Obama said in a statement that history would rightly remember the assault on the Capitol as ""as a moment of great dishonour and shame for our nation"".

"Netflix raises UK prices to cover cost of contentThe streaming giant is criticised for ""unfortunate"" timing during the new lockdowns.Technology","Shows like Tiger King kept people entertained during the first UK lockdown Netflix is raising the cost of some of its UK subscriptions from next month, its customers have been told. The streaming service said the price rises reflected money spent on content. Its standard monthly package will go up from Â£8.99 to Â£9.99 and its premium one will rise from Â£11.99 to Â£13.99, but its basic plan remains at Â£5.99. However, comparison site Uswitch said the timing of the price rises was unfortunate with UK citizens living under new national lockdowns. Virgin first to announce 2021 broadband price rise TV shows and films to help you through lockdown Netflix  adds 16 million new sign-ups thanks to lockdown The streaming service's subscriber numbers have jumped during the pandemic, with almost 16 million new customers added worldwide in the first three months of 2020 alone. In the UK, during the first national lockdown which started in March 2020, the amount of streaming content watched by consumers rose by a third compared with the previous year. But Netflix faces tough competition from rivals, such as Disney+, which has also announced price rises of Â£2 per month up to Â£7.99 or Â£79.90 for a full year. Netflix said: ""This year we're spending over $1bn [Â£736m] in the UK on new, locally-made films, series and documentaries, helping to create thousands of jobs and showcasing British storytelling at its best - with everything from The Crown, to Sex Education and Top Boy, plus many, many more. ""Our price change reflects the significant investments we've made in new TV shows and films, as well as  improvements to our product."" A standard Netflix subscription gives users HD streaming on two devices at the same time with the ability to download to two phones or tablets. The premium service allows streaming on up to four screens at once, as well as offering 4K streaming and downloading to four phones or tablets. Subscribers who do not want to pay the extra can cancel their plan at any time without penalty or simply shift to the basic package, which allows users to watch movies and TV shows in standard definition on one device only and download to one mobile or tablet. Nick Baker, streaming and TV expert at Uswitch.com, said: ""Netflix has been a lifeline for many people during lockdown, so this price rise is an unwanted extra expense for households feeling the financial pressure. ""It's unfortunate timing that this price hike coincides with another national lockdown, when all of us will be streaming more television and films than ever.""

Teachers' grades for cancelled exams in England,"Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He told MPs he would ""trust in teachers rather than algorithms"", a reference to the U-turn over last year's exams. For primaries, he confirmed there would be no Year 6 Sats tests this year. Mr Williamson promised parents it would be ""mandatory"" for schools to provide ""high-quality remote education"" of three to five hours per day. He said this would be ""enforced"" by Ofsted, with inspections where there were ""serious concerns"" about what was provided for children now studying at home. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, accused Mr Williamson of ""chaos and confusion"" - and said he had failed to listen to the ""expertise of professionals on the front line"". She said he had given a ""cast-iron commitment"" that exams would go ahead - and Ms Green said: ""At that moment, we should have known they were doomed to be cancelled."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams this week Mr Williamson, in a statement to the House of Commons, said there would be ""training and support"" for teachers in estimating grades, ""to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently"". He also told MPs there would be no Sats tests for those at the end of primary school. ""I can absolutely confirm that we won't be proceeding with Sats this year. We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a ""vague statement"" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a ""dereliction of duty"" that it was not already prepared. And he warned against repeating the ""shambles"" of last summer's cancelled exams. Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say students Northern Ireland cancels GCSEs and A-levels Exams cancelled in England's latest lockdown Vocational exams allowed to go ahead The big exam U-turn of the summer The education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown. The exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places. Simon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered. A consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner. Last year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades. And without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates. On vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was ""failing to show leadership on exams in January"". Vocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion. If students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have ""enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression"", says the awarding body Pearson. An Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, ""to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances"". The exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades. Mr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. Education Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday. Scotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers. GCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November.

Netflix raises UK prices to cover cost of content,"Shows like Tiger King kept people entertained during the first UK lockdown Netflix is raising the cost of some of its UK subscriptions from next month, its customers have been told. The streaming service said the price rises reflected money spent on content. Its standard monthly package will go up from Â£8.99 to Â£9.99 and its premium one will rise from Â£11.99 to Â£13.99, but its basic plan remains at Â£5.99. However, comparison site Uswitch said the timing of the price rises was unfortunate with UK citizens living under new national lockdowns. Virgin first to announce 2021 broadband price rise TV shows and films to help you through lockdown Netflix  adds 16 million new sign-ups thanks to lockdown The streaming service's subscriber numbers have jumped during the pandemic, with almost 16 million new customers added worldwide in the first three months of 2020 alone. In the UK, during the first national lockdown which started in March 2020, the amount of streaming content watched by consumers rose by a third compared with the previous year. But Netflix faces tough competition from rivals, such as Disney+, which has also announced price rises of Â£2 per month up to Â£7.99 or Â£79.90 for a full year. Netflix said: ""This year we're spending over $1bn [Â£736m] in the UK on new, locally-made films, series and documentaries, helping to create thousands of jobs and showcasing British storytelling at its best - with everything from The Crown, to Sex Education and Top Boy, plus many, many more. ""Our price change reflects the significant investments we've made in new TV shows and films, as well as  improvements to our product."" A standard Netflix subscription gives users HD streaming on two devices at the same time with the ability to download to two phones or tablets. The premium service allows streaming on up to four screens at once, as well as offering 4K streaming and downloading to four phones or tablets. Subscribers who do not want to pay the extra can cancel their plan at any time without penalty or simply shift to the basic package, which allows users to watch movies and TV shows in standard definition on one device only and download to one mobile or tablet. Nick Baker, streaming and TV expert at Uswitch.com, said: ""Netflix has been a lifeline for many people during lockdown, so this price rise is an unwanted extra expense for households feeling the financial pressure. ""It's unfortunate timing that this price hike coincides with another national lockdown, when all of us will be streaming more television and films than ever.""

'How long can we keep going like this? About a week'Fergus Walsh reports from the intensive care unit he first visited in April - is it worse now?,"This video can not be played WATCH: ICU hospital staff ""scared, sad, petrified, worried"" I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I first visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. I asked one of the consultants who I've met several times in the last year, Dr Jim Down, how long they can keep going like this - and the answer was stark. ""At this rate, about a week. After that we really need to see it slow down or we're going to see the care we can deliver suffering."" Newscast: NHS on the brink They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Dr Alice Carter compares it to an elastic band that is close to snapping. ""It gets to a point where you stretch so far it never returns back to its baseline. I think that's probably where we are now. It's not going to take much more for that elastic band to break, and that's the real fear for us at the moment."" Dr Alice Carter: 'It's not going to take much more for that elastic band to break' That could have very serious consequences, she adds. ""If we get to that point, we can't offer anyone ICU, not just Covid patients, but anyone who has a traffic accident or a heart attack or a stroke - whatever it is, to take them in."" For 38-year-old Rachel Arfin, one of the three pregnant women in intensive care with Covid-19, treatment is more complicated. Her baby is due in five weeks and the staff have to monitor them both. ""They can't do anything that will harm the baby,"" she says. ""All the time [they are] checking, monitoring the baby."" She is reassured by the ""beautiful sound"" of her baby's heartbeat. ""They are looking after two people in one. They're saving lives,"" says Rachel. But her children - she has seven - keep asking when she's coming home. Rachel Arfin's baby is due in five weeks - both are doing well I've reported from here several times during the pandemic and am always struck by the professionalism and dedication of staff. It's always quiet and calm, but that belies what's actually happening. This is a system under strain like never before. The warning signs are clear, the NHS is on the brink. Unless infection rates fall, soon it will have a serious impact. The pressure on staff is unrelenting. I saw two nurses in tears. Compared to when I visited in April, it's a lot busier. In some ways, it's more structured - they now know what they're dealing with. They've got new treatments, such as the drug dexamethasone, which they didn't have last time. And many of the staff have now had the first dose of the vaccine. But other aspects don't get any easier, such as the emotional burden of breaking bad news over a telephone or video call. It is very different to being able to hold someone's hand. Staff say they don't know which patients to help first ICU staff have incredibly high standards. They're used to doing everything meticulously and perfectly. And they're doing all they can. But sometimes they go home and feel guilty that they can't do more. The impact on nurses - the bedrock of care in intensive care - is visible. The highly specialised staff are usually one-to-one with patients. Deputy sister Ashleigh Shillingford is looking after three or four ventilated patients at a time, with one other junior member of staff. It's emotional and often devastating work. ""We are so stretched we have to prioritise and prioritising care is not the NHS that I grew up in - we shouldn't have to choose which patient gets what care first."" She says she's never had to make decisions like these before. ""You just don't know who to help first. The patients are losing their lives at a dramatic speed, we're not just getting old people,"" she says, ""these are young people that we're getting."" Gerald Williams, 58, is awaiting chemotherapy for lung cancer and had been shielding, but he still caught coronavirus. ""All of a sudden, out of the blue, Covid came knocking on my door and it's frightening - you don't know how you're getting your next breath,"" he says. Gerald Williams had been shielding but he still caught coronavirus He wants to get home to his daughters, the youngest of whom is 13. And he's annoyed at those who don't take it seriously. ""People are moaning and groaning. Even in A&E. They need to get a life. Don't be idiots, forget about meeting your mate, stay home. No-one is invulnerable."" For now the Trust is coping better than many others in London and is still taking Covid patients from other hospitals. But the next few weeks could be the biggest challenge the NHS has ever faced - and it will be its doctors and nurses who will bear the brunt for all of us.

Officers fired over roles in Breonna Taylor death,"Breonna Taylor, 26, was a decorated emergency medical technician Two US police officers linked to a notorious raid in which young black medic Breonna Taylor was fatally shot have been fired, authorities have said. Detectives Myles Cosgrove and Joshua Jaynes are the latest officers to be dismissed over the shooting in March last year. The incident in Kentucky caused outrage, spurring protests against racism and police brutality. Ms Taylor, 26, died when police raided her home in connection to a drug case. The FBI said Mr Cosgrove fired the shot that killed Ms Taylor at her home in Louisville. Louisville police dismissed Mr Cosgrove for violating procedures for use of force and failing to use a body camera during the search,the Louisville Courier Journal reported on Wednesday,external. Mr Jaynes, the newspaper said, was fired for violating the police force's policy for truthfulness and search warrant preparation. What happened to Breonna Taylor? Timeline of police killings of black people Why it's hard to charge US police over shootings During the raid, Ms Taylor's boyfriend fired at the officers who he said he believed were attackers breaking into their home. Police say they knocked on the door to announce their presence before breaking down the door with a battering ram. Ms Taylor's boyfriend said police did not make their presence known, and he fired out of self-defence. Three officers returned fire with 32 shots, six of which hit Ms Taylor. Ms Taylor's name became a global rallying cry as people demanded a thorough investigation into her death. Black Lives Matter activists in the US have demanded that Louisville police take stronger action against the officers in the case and say that police too often escape unpunished after killing members of the public. But despite the outcry against Ms Taylor's shooting, no criminal charges were sought relating to her death.

"Scots Covid deaths up by 68 as 33,000 more get vaccine","The deaths of a further 68 people who tested positive for Covid have been recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours. It comes as official figures show 33,381 people received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in the week to 27 December. That takes the total number of people to get a vaccine in Scotland since 8 December to 92,188. Patients in hospital with coronavirus rose from 1,347 on Tuesday to 1,384. Hospital admissions have been rising sharply but are still 136 short ofthe peak figure of 1,520recorded on 20 April last year. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? How do hospital numbers compare with April's peak? The latest statistics show 2,039 new cases of the virus, which is 10.5% of those recently tested, a slightly lower figure than in recent days. A total of 95 people are in intensive care - a slight increase but significantly lower than the April peak of 208. Health officials have expressed concern about the situation in Inverclyde, Dumfries & Galloway and the Scottish Borders, in particular, which have seen sharp rises in positive tests. Weekly figures show Inverclyde recorded 538.5 cases per 100,000, Dumfries & Galloway 538.1 and the Scottish Borders 435.5. There were a further 603 confirmed coronavirus cases in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area in the past 24 hours, with an additional 296 in NHS Lanarkshire, 206 in NHS Grampian and 164 in the NHS Lothian area. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 141,066 cases in Scotland, with a total of  4,701 people dying within 28 days of first testing positive. The latest vaccine figures were released after doctors in Scotland raised concerns aboutplans to delay the second doseof the Pfizer vaccine. All four UK nations will now leave up to 12 weeks between the first and second doses of the jab rather than giving both within 21 days. Dr Lewis Morrison, head of the BMA in Scotland, said members had concerns about the potential impact of leaving such a big gap between the two doses. But the UK's chief medical officers havedefended the move, saying the first dose will give people substantial protection against the virus within two to three weeks.

Medics concerned over 12-week vaccine dose gap,"Doctors in Scotland have raised concerns about plans to delay the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. All four UK nations will now leave up to 12 weeks between the first and second doses of the jab rather than giving both within 21 days. Dr Lewis Morrison, head of the BMA in Scotland, said members had concerns about the potential impact of leaving such a big gap between the two doses. But the UK's chief medical officers havedefended the move. They said that the first dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines - the only two so far approved for use in the UK - will give people substantial protection against the virus within two to three weeks of being administered. And they said that the second dose was ""likely to be very important for duration of protection, and at an appropriate dose interval may further increase vaccine efficacy"". Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? Scotland hopes to accelerate vaccine rollout 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs The Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments and recommended the new strategy, said data showed that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine would be ""90% effective"". But the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it would not recommend following the UK's decision to delay giving the second Pfizer dose, saying there was no evidence to support the decision. Pfizer has said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart. The Pfizer vaccine was the first to be approved for use in the UK, with more than a million people having already been given the first dose. The change to the vaccination strategy has meant health boards have had to change plans and cancel people booked in for their second doses of the Pfizer jabs. This includes medics who are among the priority groups for Covid vaccinations. Dr Lewis Morrison, chairman of the British Medical Association's Scottish Council, raised concerns about the logistical impact of changing the vaccination strategy Dr Morrison told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that some doctors had told him they would have waited for the AstraZeneca jab, which has been proven to work in the longer timetable, if they had known the second Pfizer dose was going to be delayed. He said: ""We are concerned because there's clearly disagreement about the effectiveness of the second dose of Pfizer after that period of time. ""Furthermore I think if you give more people the first dose when you don't know what vaccine supplies are going to be within that 12-week window, that's a worry that has been expressed to me by a lot of doctors. ""If we give more people the first dose, do we definitely know that the second one is coming? ""The announcement about this before a four-day NHS holiday weekend left many places with great difficulty in reorganising vaccinations, with a real risk that vaccination numbers might perversely drop because of the organisational issues."" Opposition parties want the Scottish government to publish daily figures for how many people have been vaccinated It comes as NHS staff were left queueing for hours outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary on Tuesday after an ""scheduling error"" meant vaccination staff did not turn up. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has apologised to those affected and said it was rearranging the appointments. The Scottish government has said it aims to have given at least one vaccine dose to everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the timetable could be accelerated if there were sufficient supplies of the jab. The Scottish government is being pressured to provide daily figures on the number of people being vaccinated, as the UK government has already pledged to do. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""There are now no excuses left for the SNP government to dodge publishing daily vaccination rates alongside the daily infection numbers as soon as possible. ""The SNP's evasion to try and avoid scrutiny is nothing new but on something so important, the Scottish public must have the same information as will be provided across the UK."" His call was echoed by Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon, who added: ""It is simply unacceptable that scores of NHS staff were left queueing outside in the cold for hours, and well into the evening. ""It's time for Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to get to grips with the vaccination programme, publish daily figures on the number of vaccinations available and administered, and ensure that our NHS staff do not pay the price of a bungled rollout.""

Can Scotland hold an election during the pandemic?,"A number of other countries have managed to hold elections despite the pandemic Scotland has entered a new Covid-19 lockdown, but is also preparing to go to the polls in just a few months time. How can an election take place during a pandemic, and what plans are in place? To start with, yes. Many countries have held elections already during the pandemic. Some, like New Zealand, have had relatively few cases of coronavirus to contend with. But others, like the US, have successfully conducted ballots while in the grip of nationwide outbreaks. There have even been a number of council by-elections in Scotland over the past year, from Edinburgh and Aberdeen to the Western Isles. Yes, they featured a far smaller turnout than is expected in May - but they provide vital experience for returning officers in terms of the ease of finding polling places and recruiting staff in the present conditions. The Holyrood election is not the only one due in the UK this spring, either - there are also elections to the Welsh Parliament and a host of local council and mayoralty contests across England. Joe Biden won the US presidency despite doing much of his campaigning remotely As it stands, everyone is still planning for an election on Thursday 6 May. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she can ""see no reason at this stage"" why it should have to be delayed, despite the fact the vaccination programme will still be ongoing come polling day. Any change would be a decision for Holyrood as a whole, rather than the government. However the principal opposition party - the Conservatives - have backed Ms Sturgeon's position. MSPs have introduced contingency plans which would allow the vote to be pushed back by up to six months - either by a vote of parliament, or in the most extreme circumstances via a decree from Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh. But the hope is that the combination of the vaccine and the other backup plans that have been put in place will be enough for the vote to go ahead safely. Any delay would likely have implications across the UK, with the races mentioned above in mind - polling and politics guru Prof Sir John Curtice has suggested that a joint approach may ultimately be taken in Cardiff, Edinburgh and London if there are to be any changes. Dogs may need to be more socially distant at polling stations in 2021 Voting by post is expected to be a big feature of the coming election - but current plans would not allow foreveryoneto mail in their ballots. It was already agrowing trend,external- 3.6% of the electorate registered for a postal vote in 2003, then 11.2% in 2007, 14.1% in 2011, and 17.7% in 2016 - and surveys suggest more Scots than ever will want to take the socially-distant option to cast their vote in 2021. At present only 17% of the electorate have signed up for a postal ballot, but officials are braced for this to surge to up to 40% once campaigning gets under way - with parties expected to urge their supporters to sign up en masse. The challenge will be what happens if an even greater number than that apply. The deadline for postal registrations has already been brought forward to provide time to process the expected wave of applications. If, say, half of the electorate were to ask for a postal ballot, the Electoral Management Board have voiced fears the election would have to be pushed back in order to get through the paperwork. And they say an all-postal election likely would not be possible until November, such would be the burden of signing up all 4.2m Scottish voters to the system. Mail-in ballots played a significant role in the US presidential election One contingency plan on the table is to hold polling across more than one day - potentially even with different age groups voting on different days. Several parties - Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems - have voiced cautious support for multi-day polling. However the Election Management Board have stated a preference for voting on a single date, and both the SNP and Tories are behind that position. Another consideration iswherevotes are cast. For the most part, there are few concerns about polling places becoming the epicentre of new outbreaks - they are highly regulated environments at the best of times, and officials say they would pose no more risk than a supermarket. However, the Electoral Commission have said they might reconsider using schools as polling places, particularly if voting does take place over more than one day, due to the risk of disrupting education still further. Within polling places, more stations where voters can cast their ballot may be set up, to reduce queues - which would require extra staff to be taken on. One final question applies to when votes might becounted. Talks have been held about whether the traditional overnight count - with staff packed into community centres and gym halls - would go ahead as normal, or whether results could be tallied at a more sedate pace the following day. Extra precautions will likely be needed at election counts too The election campaign is due to officially begin in March - although arguably some parties have already been in campaign mode for some time now. It seems highly unlikely that social distancing guidelines will have been relaxed enough by then for politicians to go out shaking hands and kissing babies. Indeed there have been complaints in some quarters about candidates going out knocking on doors during selection contests, so the traditional ""boots on the ground"" approach will likely take a back seat to the ""air war"" of wider messaging. The US election is likely to be instructive - Joe Biden managed to win the presidency despite rarely leaving the house. One final wrinkle is that this year, MSPs will likely still be MSPs right up to polling day. Normally in an election year, Holyrood would shut down in late March. However this year ""dissolution"" is likely to be delayed until the day before polling, in case parliament needs to be recalled in an emergency. This is mostly a technical matter - Holyrood would be in recess, so members wouldn't be prevented from campaigning - but would mean members were bound by the MSPs code of conduct throughout the election period.

McDonald's pauses walk-in takeaways in lockdownDrive-through and delivery services will still be available while it reviews its safety procedures.,"McDonald's is pausing walk-in takeaway services in the UK as new lockdown restrictions come into force. Dine-in meals and walk-in takeaways will not be available temporarily while it reviews safety procedures, it said. Its UK boss said it will be testing ""additional measures that may further enhance the safety of our takeaway service."" Rival food chains Burger King, Subway, KFC and Pret A Manger are still offering takeaways in-store. McDonald's UK and Ireland chief executive Paul Pomroy said that safety measures across the firm's 1,300 restaurants will be reviewed by an independent health and safety body. He added that customers would be kept updated via the restaurant's app and its website. Drive-through and delivery services across the fast food chain will remain open. McDonald's to introduce plant-based burgers and fast food Just Eat: McDonald's and Greggs help boost orders by 40% Under new lockdown restrictions which came into force in England and Scotland this week, hospitality firms are allowed to offer takeaways and deliveries. But rules which previously allowed takeaways or click-and-collect services for alcoholic drinks have been scrapped. Wales and Northern Ireland were already in lockdown, which meant that pubs, restaurants and cafes were restricted to takeaway-only too. After the first nationwide lockdown in March, many chains including McDonald's, Burger King and Pret closed their doors to hungry customers. They gradually reopened with additional safety measures in place, such as plastic screens in front of the tills, hand sanitiser dispensers and restrictions on the number of customers allowed in at any one point. Some also pared back the number of dishes on offer. A Burger King spokesperson said that takeaway was still available in some branches and that it would continue to offer click-and-collect and delivery services ""in line with guidance issued"". Sandwich chain Pret A Manger told the BBC that it is keeping some outlets open for both takeaways and delivery, but it would keep the number under review in the coming months. ""Last year we shifted our business to focus on delivery and expanded our delivery platform partnerships, to make Pret available to a wider customer base"", a spokesperson said. ""Since then, we have seen a significant increase in the use of delivery."" Subway and KFC also confirmed that they remain open for in-store takeaways, deliveries and click-and-collect orders across the UK. Fast food firm Leon, which has 65 outlets, said that 28 of their sites will remain open for takeaways and deliveries. ""We will continue to keep as many restaurants open as possible, as we did in the previous two lockdowns in line with government guidelines,"" a spokesperson said. Despite adapting their business models, many casual dining chains have been forced to make job cuts in the last year as lockdown restrictions hit sales.Pret, for example, announced 3,000 job cutsin August, whileGreggs made 820 job cuts at the end of 2020.

"Fake NHS vaccine messages sent in banking scamOne scam tells recipients they are ""eligible to apply for your vaccine"" with a link to a bogus NHS website.Business","Fraudsters are sending out bogus text messages about the coronavirus vaccine in an attempt to steal bank details. The scam tells recipients they are ""eligible to apply for your vaccine"" with a link to a bogus NHS website, trading standards officers have warned. That, in turn, asks for personal information and - crucially - bank details ""for verification"". The warning comes the same day as MPs heard that Covid is leading some people into the net of pension fraudsters. The fake NHS message is one of a range of scams which have sought to take advantage of the pandemic and the isolation and legitimate worries of potential victims, according to the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. Others have included people travelling door-to-door selling counterfeit or useless protection equipment, or fraudsters claiming to be from the official test and trace service and demanding payments. Banks reveal 10 coronavirus scams to be wary of Scam warning over NHS test and trace The latest scam is preying on those elderly or vulnerable people who are fully expecting to receive legitimate information about their vaccine. Health authorities have stressed they would never ask for an individual's banking details. Katherine Hart, lead office at the CTSI, said: ""I have been tracking and warning the public about Covid-related scams since the beginning of the pandemic, and at every stage of response, unscrupulous individuals have modified their campaigns to defraud the public. ""The vaccine brings great hope for an end to the pandemic and lockdowns, but some only wish to create even further misery by defrauding others. The NHS will never ask you for banking details, passwords, or PIN numbers and these should serve as instant red flags."" She urged people to report the scams toAction Fraud,externalorPolice Scotland,external. Pensions have been stolen or put into high-risk schemes The warning came as MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee heard how fraudsters were seizing on victims' financial uncertainty during the pandemic to draw them into pension scams. Rules allowing people to withdraw cash from their pension pot from the age of 55 have led some people to move money into investment schemes which look generous, but are simply vehicles to steal money. ""Household finances are stretched and so the temptations to use savings or to be tempted by offers of 'free pension reviews', for example, which we've warned about, are very real,"" Mark Steward, from the Financial Conduct Authority told the committee. ""Of course, a 'free pension review' is hardly free. It is the first step on a process that will lead someone to investing in something that is too good to be true."" He said that fraudsters had used social media advertising to ""industrialise"" this kind of fraud. Whereas previously, fraudsters had to produce sophisticated glossy brochures and office fronts, they could now operate in anonymity on social media, sending fake information to millions of people. Millions of pounds have been lost to pension scams in recent years, but it is a crime considered to be widely under-reported by victims and pension companies. Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, told the committee that fraudsters were continuing to use new avenues to reach potential victims. ""What we're looking to do next is to move on to fake comparison websites, which is this new gateway into investment frauds, to spot those and take them down at source,"" he said.

Georgia voter fraud claims fact-checked,"US President Donald Trump and others have made new unsubstantiated claims of voter fraud following the rerun of two crucial Senate races in the state of Georgia. With the Democrats looking likely to win both seats and with them control of the US Senate, we've debunked some of the theories that have been widely shared on social media. Since the November election, the president has repeatedly madebaseless allegations that Dominion voting machines have been manipulatedto engineer electoral fraud. Referring to the vote in Georgia, Mr Trump said these machines had stopped working in Republican strongholds for ""over an hour"". The official in charge of Georgia's voting systems, Gabriel Sterling, said there has been an issue in one county due to ""a programming error on security keys"" but that it was resolved hours before the president made his comments. Mr Sterling tweeted: ""The, votes of everyone will be protected and counted. Sorry you received old intel Mr President."" Georgia's Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger also clarified in a statement that there had been some issues but they did not stop people from voting, Reuters news agency reports. ""At no point did voting stop as voters continued casting ballots on emergency ballots, in accordance with the procedures set out by Georgia law,"" said Mr Raffensperger. An image that has been shared thousands of times on Twitter purported to show a pile of destroyed ballots in Georgia on election day. ""Our team is in Georgia. They took a little walk. They found shredded ballots in Dell boxes,"" the tweet said. Although the post provided no detail as to where exactly the picture had been taken, we were able to geolocate it to the absentee ballot processing centre at the Georgia World Congress Center in Fulton County, which includes Atlanta. Fulton County elections director Richard Barron told the BBC that the papers in the picture were ""definitely not ballots"", but waste from a letter-opening machine used to cut ballot envelopes. We've reported onsimilar claimsabout alleged ballot shredding in Georgia before. In November, an investigation into the shredding of papers in Cobb County concluded that it was part of a ""routine clean-up operation"" and the documents disposed of were not actual votes ""relevant to the election or the re-tally"". In a tweet generating some 300,000 likes and retweets, President Trump claimed there was a ""voter dump"" planned against Republican candidates. Trump's hour-long phone call fact-checked The most viral US vote claims debunked But there's no evidence of wrongdoing. It's not clear exactly what he means by a ""voter dump"", but he may be referring to the fact that large batches of votes are released at once. This is standard practice and a valid part of the vote-counting process. In Georgia, as in the presidential elections, larger districts, often including cities that may lean Democrat, take longer to report their results. This video can not be played Georgia official Gabriel Sterling urged voters to cast ballots Mr Trump has falsely claimed on multiple occasions that millions of genuine votes in November's presidential election that were counted after polls closed were ""fake"". In Georgia, election official Gabriel Sterling noted after the polls closed that some 171,000 early, in-person ballots from DeKalb County, which is Democrat-leaning, were yet to be counted. Authorities knew how many of these ""advanced"" votes were coming. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

As it happened: MPs back England's new Covid lockdown,"MPs in the House of Commons back the government's decision to impose a lockdown across England amid surging coronavirus infections MPs approve regulations enabling the new national lockdown in England by 524 votes to 16, a majority of 508 The number of patients in UK hospitals with Covid is now above 30,000 - and 1,041 new deaths are reported, the highest daily figure since April Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson PM Boris Johnson emphasises that England's third lockdown is different from the first, saying that this will be a ""sprint"" to the finish rather than a ""marathon"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government has been ""repeatedly too slow to act"" and that has left the NHS under an unprecedented strain European regulators approves the Moderna vaccine - making it the second vaccine to be recommended for use in the EU Edited by Marie Jackson We're wrapping up our live updates on the coronavirus pandemic for now, but we will be back again on Thursday. Today's updates were brought to you by Sophie Williams, Lauren Turner, Emma Harrison, Paul Seddon, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Scott and Victoria Bisset. The page was edited by Helier Cheung, Sarah Collerton, John Hand, Suzanne Leigh and Marie Jackson. Thank you for joining us. Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?"" Dr Clarke, who is also an author, said ministers should not have ""ignored"" the independent advisory group Sage when they suggested as early as September that a ""circuit breaker"" was required  - and before Christmas to have a lockdown.

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection. ""It's a universal right,"" President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters news agency. ""We would do it."" He gave no details about how such a plan would be implemented, or who would  be eligible to receive a vaccine. Many undocumented migrants in the US are from Mexico. The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"". He added Johnson also ""outlined his vision for building back better from the pandemic"". Downing Street said Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Trade Secretary Liz Truss also joined the call. He said: ""The chancellor also spoke about his optimism for the UK economy in 2021 and committed to using all the levers at his disposal to drive growth across the entire UK which meets our climate ambitions."" The conversation also took in the Brexit trade deal, No 10 said, as well as the government's ""urgent ambition to unite and level up across the country by investing in education, skills, technology and infrastructure"". Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external. It says members of the public should first be encouraged to comply with the law. ""Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" it says. For participation in gatherings, fixed penalty notices start at Â£100 and can rise to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. There are fines of Â£10,000 for organisers of restricted gatherings. It also says, in addition to businesses already closed, aquariums and zoos, including safari parks and wildlife centres, are among the attractions that must close. MPs have voted to approve the law which introduced a new lockdown in England this morning. A total of 524 MPs voted in favour of the restrictions, compared to 16 who voted against. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month. Here's a closer look at the data: Itâs been a busy day so far and MPs are continuing to debate
the new lockdown in England in the House of Commons. Weâre not expecting a vote
until about 19:00 GMT, but weâll continue to bring you the latest on our live
page. Hereâs a round-up of the main coronavirus headlines in the UK:  Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne is making his criticism of lockdowns very clear in his allotted time in the Commons. He calls it a ""situation of state capture"" where the government is ""completely enthralled to a lobby driving a policy that has manifestly failed"" - slamming the ""increasing iterations of this policy with ever tighter controls and restrictions in the hope it may finally work"". After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame. ""And on that occasion at least, they will be right."" Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin correspondent The Irish government has announced a raft of measures to fight the coronavirus including school closures. Non-essential construction will also be shut down and air passengers must have negative Covid-19 PCR tests 72 hours before flying into the state. PCR tests are regarded as the ""gold standard"" of testing. The travel restriction will apply to passengers from Britain and South Africa before an anticipated extension to all visitors. The Taoiseach (Irish PM) has told a news conference that public compliance with the measures will reflect on how many people may die. MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said he expected people to ""face the coming month with steely determination and resolve."" Read the full story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Fake NHS vaccine messages sent in banking scamOne scam tells recipients they are ""eligible to apply for your vaccine"" with a link to a bogus NHS website.","Fraudsters are sending out bogus text messages about the coronavirus vaccine in an attempt to steal bank details. The scam tells recipients they are ""eligible to apply for your vaccine"" with a link to a bogus NHS website, trading standards officers have warned. That, in turn, asks for personal information and - crucially - bank details ""for verification"". The warning comes the same day as MPs heard that Covid is leading some people into the net of pension fraudsters. The fake NHS message is one of a range of scams which have sought to take advantage of the pandemic and the isolation and legitimate worries of potential victims, according to the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. Others have included people travelling door-to-door selling counterfeit or useless protection equipment, or fraudsters claiming to be from the official test and trace service and demanding payments. Banks reveal 10 coronavirus scams to be wary of Scam warning over NHS test and trace The latest scam is preying on those elderly or vulnerable people who are fully expecting to receive legitimate information about their vaccine. Health authorities have stressed they would never ask for an individual's banking details. Katherine Hart, lead office at the CTSI, said: ""I have been tracking and warning the public about Covid-related scams since the beginning of the pandemic, and at every stage of response, unscrupulous individuals have modified their campaigns to defraud the public. ""The vaccine brings great hope for an end to the pandemic and lockdowns, but some only wish to create even further misery by defrauding others. The NHS will never ask you for banking details, passwords, or PIN numbers and these should serve as instant red flags."" She urged people to report the scams toAction Fraud,externalorPolice Scotland,external. Pensions have been stolen or put into high-risk schemes The warning came as MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee heard how fraudsters were seizing on victims' financial uncertainty during the pandemic to draw them into pension scams. Rules allowing people to withdraw cash from their pension pot from the age of 55 have led some people to move money into investment schemes which look generous, but are simply vehicles to steal money. ""Household finances are stretched and so the temptations to use savings or to be tempted by offers of 'free pension reviews', for example, which we've warned about, are very real,"" Mark Steward, from the Financial Conduct Authority told the committee. ""Of course, a 'free pension review' is hardly free. It is the first step on a process that will lead someone to investing in something that is too good to be true."" He said that fraudsters had used social media advertising to ""industrialise"" this kind of fraud. Whereas previously, fraudsters had to produce sophisticated glossy brochures and office fronts, they could now operate in anonymity on social media, sending fake information to millions of people. Millions of pounds have been lost to pension scams in recent years, but it is a crime considered to be widely under-reported by victims and pension companies. Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, told the committee that fraudsters were continuing to use new avenues to reach potential victims. ""What we're looking to do next is to move on to fake comparison websites, which is this new gateway into investment frauds, to spot those and take them down at source,"" he said.

Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external. It says members of the public should first be encouraged to comply with the law. ""Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" it says. For participation in gatherings, fixed penalty notices start at Â£100 and can rise to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences.

It also says, in addition to businesses already closed, aquariums and zoos, including safari parks and wildlife centres, are among the attractions that must close. MPs have voted to approve the law which introduced a new lockdown in England this morning. A total of 524 MPs voted in favour of the restrictions, compared to 16 who voted against. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month. Here's a closer look at the data: Itâs been a busy day so far and MPs are continuing to debate
the new lockdown in England in the House of Commons. Weâre not expecting a vote
until about 19:00 GMT, but weâll continue to bring you the latest on our live
page. Hereâs a round-up of the main coronavirus headlines in the UK:  Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne is making his criticism of lockdowns very clear in his allotted time in the Commons. He calls it a ""situation of state capture"" where the government is ""completely enthralled to a lobby driving a policy that has manifestly failed"" - slamming the ""increasing iterations of this policy with ever tighter controls and restrictions in the hope it may finally work"". After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame. ""And on that occasion at least, they will be right."" Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin correspondent The Irish government has announced a raft of measures to fight the coronavirus including school closures. Non-essential construction will also be shut down and air passengers must have negative Covid-19 PCR tests 72 hours before flying into the state.

Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?"" Dr Clarke, who is also an author, said ministers should not have ""ignored"" the independent advisory group Sage when they suggested as early as September that a ""circuit breaker"" was required  - and before Christmas to have a lockdown.

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection. ""It's a universal right,"" President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters news agency. ""We would do it."" He gave no details about how such a plan would be implemented, or who would  be eligible to receive a vaccine. Many undocumented migrants in the US are from Mexico. The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"".

Can Pence reject Biden's win?,"US President Donald Trump says his vice-president, Mike Pence, has the power to reject the formal confirmation of Joe Biden as the next president. But this isn't the case. The vice-president has no legal authority to declare Mr Biden's election victory invalid. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the US, electors - based on the results in each state - officially decide who is to be the next president. Congress is meeting to count the electoral votes and confirm the nomination of president-elect Biden. This process usually takes place without controversy, but the president and his supporters are continuing to dispute the election results, citing unfounded claims of fraud. Allow Twitter content?

Once the electoral votes are counted, it will be up to Mr Pence to formally announce Mr Biden as the next US president. Mr Trump wants the vice-president to step in and reject the results of the election, declaring the vote fraudulent. The vice-president's role is largely procedural, as the president of the Senate. The 12th Amendment of the US Constitution says:,external""The President of the Senate [in this case, Mike Pence] shall, in the presence of the Senate and House of Representatives, open all the certificates and the votes shall then be counted."" Mr Pence hasreleased a statement,externalahead of the session saying he doesn't have the power to change the results, and his role is to conduct proceedings ""in an orderly manner"". His will then be required to read out the final presidential result as approved by Congress. The Electoral Count Act of 1887,externalgives Congress the power to review the results, not the vice-president. Members of Congress can raise disputes. If a challenge is supported by a member in both the Senate and House (the upper and lower chambers of Congress), then counting is paused and the challenge is debated. Despite some significant support among Republicans in Congress, the president is not expected to have enough backers to overturn the results. This would require a majority of both chambers of Congress to vote in favour of nullifying the disputed results. At a rally in Georgia, President Trump said: ""I hope that our great vice-president comes through for us. He's a great guy."" Trump's hour-long phone call fact-checked Fact-checking Trump team's main fraud claims The 'dead voters' in Michigan who are still alive Mr Pence has said he ""welcomes"" the Republican lawmakers' plan to raise objections. But once disputes are debated and settled, it's over to Mr Pence to announce the final confirmation that Mr Biden won the 2020 election. This is something Mr Biden did to officially confirm Mr Trump as the winner of the 2016 election. That would certainly be an option for a reluctant vice-president - or perhaps leaving the room before the announcement of the final result. There is a precedent for this. Vice-President Hubert Humphrey declined to preside over the counting of electoral votes in 1969, after he lost to Richard Nixon.

The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month. Here's a closer look at the data: Itâs been a busy day so far and MPs are continuing to debate
the new lockdown in England in the House of Commons. Weâre not expecting a vote
until about 19:00 GMT, but weâll continue to bring you the latest on our live
page. Hereâs a round-up of the main coronavirus headlines in the UK:  Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne is making his criticism of lockdowns very clear in his allotted time in the Commons. He calls it a ""situation of state capture"" where the government is ""completely enthralled to a lobby driving a policy that has manifestly failed"" - slamming the ""increasing iterations of this policy with ever tighter controls and restrictions in the hope it may finally work"". After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame. ""And on that occasion at least, they will be right."" Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin correspondent The Irish government has announced a raft of measures to fight the coronavirus including school closures. Non-essential construction will also be shut down and air passengers must have negative Covid-19 PCR tests 72 hours before flying into the state. PCR tests are regarded as the ""gold standard"" of testing. The travel restriction will apply to passengers from Britain and South Africa before an anticipated extension to all visitors. The Taoiseach (Irish PM) has told a news conference that public compliance with the measures will reflect on how many people may die.

MPs back England's new Covid lockdown,"MPs in the House of Commons back the government's decision to impose a lockdown across England amid surging coronavirus infections MPs approve regulations enabling the new national lockdown in England by 524 votes to 16, a majority of 508 The number of patients in UK hospitals with Covid is now above 30,000 - and 1,041 new deaths are reported, the highest daily figure since April Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson PM Boris Johnson emphasises that England's third lockdown is different from the first, saying that this will be a ""sprint"" to the finish rather than a ""marathon"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government has been ""repeatedly too slow to act"" and that has left the NHS under an unprecedented strain European regulators approves the Moderna vaccine - making it the second vaccine to be recommended for use in the EU Edited by Marie Jackson We're wrapping up our live updates on the coronavirus pandemic for now, but we will be back again on Thursday. Today's updates were brought to you by Sophie Williams, Lauren Turner, Emma Harrison, Paul Seddon, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Scott and Victoria Bisset. The page was edited by Helier Cheung, Sarah Collerton, John Hand, Suzanne Leigh and Marie Jackson. Thank you for joining us. Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?"" Dr Clarke, who is also an author, said ministers should not have ""ignored"" the independent advisory group Sage when they suggested as early as September that a ""circuit breaker"" was required  - and before Christmas to have a lockdown.

BBC Question Time The UK has an ""ambitious"" vaccine delivery plan, the minister in charge of the roll out has insisted. Asked by a member of the public on the BBC's Question Time programme why there appeared to be a ""lack of joined-up planning"" compared to other countries, Nadhim Zahawi highlighted the target to vaccinate just under 14 million people by the middle of February. He said: ""Between the 4 of January and the 11 January you'll see another step up."" Prof Mark Walport, a member of the independent government's advisory group Sage, told the programme: ""We are in a race between getting people vaccinated and this new more transmissible variant.""

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection. ""It's a universal right,"" President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters news agency. ""We would do it."" He gave no details about how such a plan would be implemented, or who would  be eligible to receive a vaccine. Many undocumented migrants in the US are from Mexico. The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"". He added Johnson also ""outlined his vision for building back better from the pandemic"". Downing Street said Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Trade Secretary Liz Truss also joined the call. He said: ""The chancellor also spoke about his optimism for the UK economy in 2021 and committed to using all the levers at his disposal to drive growth across the entire UK which meets our climate ambitions."" The conversation also took in the Brexit trade deal, No 10 said, as well as the government's ""urgent ambition to unite and level up across the country by investing in education, skills, technology and infrastructure"". Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external. It says members of the public should first be encouraged to comply with the law. ""Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" it says. For participation in gatherings, fixed penalty notices start at Â£100 and can rise to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. There are fines of Â£10,000 for organisers of restricted gatherings. It also says, in addition to businesses already closed, aquariums and zoos, including safari parks and wildlife centres, are among the attractions that must close.

Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election.

Congress in turmoil as protesters breach buildingTrump supporters get inside Washington's Capitol as lawmakers meet to confirm Joe Biden's poll win.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Police place US Capitol Building on lockdown after Trump supporters breached security lines Violent supporters of President Donald Trump have breached the Capitol in Washington, as lawmakers met to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's poll win. In dramatic scenes, demonstrators swarmed the building as Congress members were escorted out by police. Mr Biden said it was an ""insurrection"", and Mr Trump released a video message asking supporters to go home. The joint session of Congress certifying Mr Biden's win has been suspended and forced into recess. There are reports of guns drawn in the building and at least one person shot. A woman was reported to be in a critical condition and several police were injured. There has been an armed confrontation at the doors of the House of Representatives. Tear gas has also been used. Follow our live updates from Washington US Capitol stormed - in pictures World leaders react to 'horrifying' scenes in Washington Rioters were seen marching through the building chanting ""We want Trump"" and one was photographed in the Senate president's chair. Washington police said it was clear the crowd was intent on using chemical irritants to force entry to the building. Tear gas is used to disperse protesters at the Capitol building After an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement. But there is little sign that the protesters are obeying Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT). Mr Trumprecorded a video message on Twitter,externalcalling on supporters to leave the Capitol, but continuing to make unsubstantiated claims that Democrats had stolen the election. ""I know your pain, I know you're hurt,"" he said. ""You have to go home now, we have to have peace... we don't want anybody hurt."" Mr Biden said the demonstration ""borders on sedition and it must end now"". ""At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault,"" he said. Political figures across the world expressed shock.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned ""disgraceful scenes""and called for a ""peaceful and orderly transfer of power"". Mr Trump's spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, tweeted that the National Guard was being deployed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Troops and police have also been mobilised in neighbouring states, and the FBI has been deployed to help Capitol police. There are also reports of protests at state legislatures around the country. By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington On the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters are packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers keep a watchful eye. The mood here is tense and defiant. ""We're not [expletive] Antifa!"" one man screams at the police, referring to the loose coalition of ""anti-fascist"" activists that oppose Mr Trump. Trump loyalists near him wave placards that say ""show us the ballots"". ""All we want is for the Capitol police to stand down, and surrender the building to us,"" says one man to news cameras, as he is filmed by other Trump supporters. The conviction here is that the election was stolen from President Trump, and the lawmakers inside the building should do their duty and somehow award the election to him. Never mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence. It's a siege mentality here, as word spreads through the crowd that the National Guard is on its way to the Capitol. A joint session of Congress was being held to certify Mr Biden's election victory on 3 November. The proceedings are usually brief and ceremonial but Republican lawmakers have been objecting to some results. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters For days Mr Trump had also been putting pressure on Mr Pence, who is presiding over the session, to block certification of the result. The people who still believe Trump won Can rebel Republicans overturn the election? What is the electoral college? But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said that he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". The protesters arrived at the Capitol from a ""Save America Rally"", where Mr Trump had urged them to support those legislators opposing Mr Biden's confirmation. Mr Trump has refused to concede the 3 November election, repeatedly alleging fraud without providing any evidence. Police have been taking up position inside the Capitol building On Wednesday, he said again: ""We will never give up. We will never concede."" He has also tried to throw doubt on the integrity of Tuesday's Senate run-off votes in the southern, traditionally Republican, state of Georgia.Projections by US TV networks suggest the Democrats have won one of the seatsand are neck-and-neck for the second seat. If the Democrats win both they will gain effective control of the Senate - something that will help Mr Biden push forward his agenda after he is inaugurated as president on 20 January.

"Teachers' grades for cancelled exams in EnglandGavin Williamson will ""trust in teachers rather than algorithms"" in awarding this year's results.Family & EducationComments","Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He told MPs he would ""trust in teachers rather than algorithms"", a reference to the U-turn over last year's exams. For primaries, he confirmed there would be no Year 6 Sats tests this year. Mr Williamson promised parents it would be ""mandatory"" for schools to provide ""high-quality remote education"" of three to five hours per day. He said this would be ""enforced"" by Ofsted, with inspections where there were ""serious concerns"" about what was provided for children now studying at home. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, accused Mr Williamson of ""chaos and confusion"" - and said he had failed to listen to the ""expertise of professionals on the front line"". She said he had given a ""cast-iron commitment"" that exams would go ahead - and Ms Green said: ""At that moment, we should have known they were doomed to be cancelled."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams this week Mr Williamson, in a statement to the House of Commons, said there would be ""training and support"" for teachers in estimating grades, ""to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently"". He also told MPs there would be no Sats tests for those at the end of primary school. ""I can absolutely confirm that we won't be proceeding with Sats this year. We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a ""vague statement"" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a ""dereliction of duty"" that it was not already prepared. And he warned against repeating the ""shambles"" of last summer's cancelled exams. Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say students Northern Ireland cancels GCSEs and A-levels Exams cancelled in England's latest lockdown Vocational exams allowed to go ahead The big exam U-turn of the summer The education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown. The exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places. Simon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered. A consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner. Last year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades. And without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates. On vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was ""failing to show leadership on exams in January"". Vocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion. If students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have ""enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression"", says the awarding body Pearson. An Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, ""to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances"". The exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades. Mr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. Education Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday. Scotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers. GCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November.

Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Calls for clarity for university students in Wales,"Guidance issued to students in Wales before Christmas remains in place, the Welsh Government has said There are calls for clarity for university students in Wales, after students in England were told not to return to college until mid-February. It comes as the prime minister announced anEngland-wide lockdown. The Welsh Conservatives said students in Wales were asking ""what this means for them,"" with current advice being not to return until notified. Universities Wales and the Welsh Government have said plans agreed before Christmas remain in place. Learners studying in England have been told to remain ""where they are"" if possible and to start term online ""until at least mid-February."" Schools and colleges in Wales were told this week tomove to online learning until 18 January. Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies MS said she has already contacted Education Minister Kirsty Williams to ""urge her to clarify the position"" whether there are changes for university students in Wales or not. ""The most important thing right now is for students to have certainty on what is happening,"" she said. ""Decisions that were made and announced before Christmas have now been changed for schools, and due to the changes for students due to return to universities elsewhere in the UK, students who study in Wales are asking us what this means for them."" Are universities doing enough to look after students? Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? University students 'to get phased January return' Dr Dyfrig Jones, a senior lecturer at Bangor University, has called on the Welsh Government to provide ""urgent clarification"" in light of the changes across the border. Dr Jones said: ""What's hard to understand in Wales is what the situation here is"". ""It's a completely ridiculous situation that could have big health impactions if things aren't changed."" The Welsh Government said last month thatuniversity students would have a staggered start dateafter Christmas and be asked to take two Covid tests once they return. When announcing that schools will move online on Monday, Ms Williams said onTwitter,external: ""Universities in Wales have already agreed a staggered start to term. ""Students should not return to universities for face to face learning until they are notified by their university that they can do so."" Students in England have been told to work online and remain where they are Pembrokeshire student Marina Nichols, who is studying economics at Bath University, said she and others faced ""uncertain times"". She is paying for accommodation in Oxford but is at home in Wales and said she was finding it difficult trying to work online, sharing a broadband connection with her two sisters who were studying online. ""I do find myself just worrying about what the future will look like,"" she toldGareth Lewis's programmeon BBC Radio Wales. ""Whether I'm even going to get a graduation, I don't know. It's just a bit scary."" Meanwhile, Tegwen Bruce-Deans, a Welsh student at Bangor University, said she believes it is important students like herself return to university. ""We can do our work there, we will have enough room to do so,"" she said. ""We can be around people who are our own age, so that will be nice after everyone is back safely. ""It's so important to have somewhere safe to do our work and try and live a normal of a life as possible"". Swansea University said it would issue further advice to students if the situation changed Welsh universities were contacted for comment. The University of South Wales said it was planning for a ""phased return of on-campus learning over the next few weeks, in line with Welsh Government guidelines and prioritisation for courses"". It said safety measures, which were in place last term, would remain in place. Swansea University said there had been a lot of changes over the last few days and it understood further meetings would be taking place with Welsh Government and universities and if there were changes to the policy in Wales,Â updated advice would be issued. Bangor University said it was currently asking students to return to their term-time addresses, allowing time for Covid tests and toÂ ""lay low""Â at leastÂ until the results of the second. ""If the Welsh Government rules change, we will send information about any changes to our students by email,"" a spokesman added. BBC Wales understands that representatives from Welsh universities met with Ms Williams on Tuesday afternoon and the current position was discussed but not changed. Universities Wales said institutions were ""rigorously adhering"" to Welsh Government regulations and that students will be tested asymptomatically so ""Covid-secure, in-person teaching can resume"". It added in a statement that evidence suggested transmission of the virus had not been taking place in a teaching setting. The Welsh Government said it hadissued advice to students, including the rules around a mix of in-person and blended learning.,external UCL goes against government on students returning 'Grave consequences' in closing Wales' schools What are the latest Covid rules for Wales?

Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington.

According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Alaskan wilderness opens up for oil explorationThe Trump administration pushes ahead with first oil lease sales in an Arctic wildlife refuge.Science & Environment,"A polar bear cub playing in a snow drift in the area of the proposed oil lease sales The Trump administration is pushing ahead with the first sale of oil leases in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The giant Alaskan wilderness is home to many important species, including polar bears, caribou and wolves. Now, after decades of dispute, the rights to drill for oil on about 5% of the refuge will go ahead. Opponents have criticised the rushed nature of the sale, coming just days before President Trump's term ends. Why 2021 could be turning point for tackling climate change Green body gives verdict on UK's climate policies 2021 will be cooler but still in top six warmest Covering some 19 million acres (78,000 sq km) the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge (ANWR) is often described as America's last great wilderness. It is a critically important location for many species, including polar bears. In the winter months, pregnant bears build dens in which to give birth. As temperatures have risen and sea ice has become thinner, these bearshave started building their dens on land,external. Many indigenous groups with strong links to the ANWR have opposed oil exploration The coastal plain of the ANWR now has the highest concentration of these dens in the state. The refuge is also home to Porcupine caribou, one of the largest herds in the world, numbering around 200,000 animals. In the spring, the herd moves to the coastal plain region of the ANWR as it is their preferred calving ground. The same coastal plain is now the subject of the first ever oil lease sale in the refuge. The push for exploration in the park has been a decades long battle between oil companies supported by the state government and environmental and indigenous opponents. Many of Alaska's political representatives believe that drilling in the refuge could lead to another major oil find, like the one in Prudhoe Bay, just west of the ANWR. Prudhoe Bay is the largest oil field in North America and supporters believe the ANWR shares the same geology, and potential reserves of crude oil. Oil revenues are critical for Alaska, with every resident getting a cheque for around $1,600 every year from the state's permanent fund. In 2017, the Trump administration's tax cutting bill contained a provision to open up the ANWR coastal plain for drilling. It was seen as a way of offsetting the costs of the tax cuts. The US Bureau of Land Management isnow selling the drilling rights,externalto 22 tracts of land covering about one million acres. These oil and gas leases last for 10 years. Allow Twitter content?

A last-minute attempt to stop the sale in the courts failed but opponents say it will not be the end of their efforts to protect the refuge from drilling. ""The Trump administration is barrelling forward without doing the careful, legally required analyses of the impacts such activity will have on the environment or the Gwich'in people who have relied on this land for millennia,"" said Kristen Monsell, a senior attorney at the Center for Biological Diversity, which is headquartered in Tucson, Arizona, who had sought an injunction against the sale. ""That's why we've taken them to court. We can't let Trump turn this amazing landscape into an oil field."" Reports indicate that interest in the lease sales has been low. Thinning ice has seen more polar bears make their dens on land While estimates suggest around 11 billion barrels of oil lie under the refuge, it has no roads or other infrastructure, making it a very expensive place to drill for oil. Several large US banks have said they will not fund oil and gas exploration in the area. There is also the matter of a change of leadership in the White House. The Biden team have nominated Deb Haaland as Secretary of the Interior. She is on record as being strongly opposed to drilling in the ANWR. With climate change set to be a central focus for the Biden administration, it's likely that efforts to extract new fossil fuels in Alaska will be subject to review and delay. This could ultimately limit the interest and opportunity for oil exploration in the refuge. Follow Matton Twitter,external.

Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January.

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Baby death motorist admits dangerous driving,"Stephen Stennett had a head on collision with a van on the B9157 near Kirkcaldy in Fife A driver who caused a crash in Fife that led to his passenger losing her baby has admitted causing death by dangerous driving. Stephen Stennett, 23, had a head-on collision with a van on the B9157 near Kirkcaldy on 3 October 2018. The High Court in Glasgow heard he had attempted a ""dangerous"" overtaking manoeuvre. Judge Lady Stacey deferred sentence until next month for background reports. Passenger, Shannon Myers, 18, who was 30 weeks pregnant, had to have an emergency caesarean section due to her injuries in the crash. However, her son Luke Myers died 32 minutes later. Prosecutor Murdoch McTaggart said: ""The accused pulled out and drove into the path of an oncoming van. ""The accused's vehicle ended up in a ditch on the side of the road."" Ms Myers, who was in the front passenger seat, complained about pain in her abdomen and was taken to hospital. A scan showed the baby had a heartbeat of 60 beats per minute. Mr McTaggart said this was regarded as low and gave cause for concern, prompting doctors to perform an emergency C-section. Luke's cause of death was recorded as ""complications of traumatic abruption due to road traffic collision"". Pathologists said the baby had red marks on his face as well as fractures to his collarbone and four ribs. Ms Myers suffered broken toes and a fractured arm. A 15-year-old girl, who was also a passenger in the car, sustained a fractured spine, collarbone and sternum. A fourth passenger, a boy also aged 15, suffered a fractured spine and eye bone as well as a minor head injury. Van driver Ian Baker, his wife Clara and their 10-year-old daughter had minor injuries. The baby's mother paid tribute to Luke on Facebook shortly after his death. She said: ""I love you so much my handsome little boy."" The judge Lady Stacey said: ""You will understand you pleaded guilty to a serious crime which had tragic results. ""When a life is lost, the court will almost always impose a period of imprisonment."" Stennett said: ""I'm sorry"" before being bailed.

Shoppers told not to buy more than normal,"Supermarkets are seeking to reassure shoppers that there is no need to bulk-buy products as new lockdown restrictions come into force. Asda asked its customers to ""continue to shop considerately and not buy more than they normally would."" There was a surge in online grocery shopping after new lockdown restrictions were announced on Monday, but demand has since dropped back. Stores said they have good availability and have increased delivery slots. Tesco and Sainsbury's have doubled the number of delivery slots since March. When fresh lockdown restrictions were announced on Monday there was arush online by supermarket shoppers to book delivery slots. That surge has since calmed down, but big supermarkets were keen on Wednesday to reassure customers that there is no need to bulk-buy, as stores would like to avoid a repeat of the panic-buying that was triggered by the first lockdown. Asda said it ""currently has strong product availability across its stores and depots and its colleagues are working around the clock to keep the shelves stocked."" Sainsbury's said it had ""good availability and encourage customers to shop as normal. We aren't currently restricting products."" Tesco has had buying limits on various products since the first lockdown, and most recently limited items including eggs, rice, soap and toilet roll after freight delays in December as ports got snarled up. Tesco said on Wednesday that it had ""good availability in stores and online, with plenty of stock to go round, and we would encourage our customers to shop as normal."" During the first lockdown supermarkets saw a huge spike in demand for online shopping as people tried to avoid mixing in shops. The big chains have all increased their capacity to deliver food. Tesco, the biggest UK supermarket chain, has more than doubled the number of online delivery slots available since the start of the crisis, and now has 1.5 million slots per week. Not all of these get used across the UK at present, so Tesco has no plans at the moment for further slots. Sainsbury's, the second biggest, has also more than doubled the number of its online delivery slots since March, and can meet more than 800,000 orders per week. Asda, the third biggest chain, has upped the number of available weekly slots by 90% since March to 850,000, and by the start of April it's planning to offer 900,000 slots per week. Morrison's, the fourth largest UK supermarket chain, said it had increased its online operation fivefold since March. Asda said on Wednesday that it was also doubling the size of its partnership with Uber Eats. From February Asda will offer a 30-minute delivery service from 200 stores. Asda is also stepping-up Covid safety measures, including doubling safety marshal hours, more sanitation stations, increasing cleaning, and ""adding a protective antimicrobial coating to customer 'touch points' in stores such as fridge and freezer handles, checkout areas, plus all trolley and basket handles"". The chain also has a virtual queueing app called ""Quidini"" whereby customers can sit in their car to wait for a slot in a store if it is busy.

"PM warns lockdown won't end 'with a bang'There will be a ""gradual unwrapping"" of England's lockdown, Boris Johnson tells MPs ahead of a vote later.UKComments","This video can not be played The prime minister says schools will be the first places to reopen The end of England's lockdown will not happen with a ""big bang"" but will instead be a ""gradual unwrapping"", Boris Johnson has told MPs. The prime minister made the comments in the Commons ahead of a retrospective vote later on the lockdown measures. He said the legislation runs until 31 March to allow a ""controlled"" easing of restrictions back into local tiers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's decisions ""have led us to the position we're now in"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were now 30,074 patients with coronavirus in UK hospitals. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. It came as the UK reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus,the highest daily death toll since April. Clap for Carers to return for new lockdown Can lockdown stop the new variant? The UK's new lockdown rules explained In a statement to the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new variant had ""led to more cases than we've seen ever before"" and that this had left the government with ""no choice but to return to national lockdown"". He said the legislation ran until the end of March ""not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis"". He said this would happen ""brick-by-brick... without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us"". But in response to MPs' questions, he said there was a ""cautious presumption"" that restrictions could start being eased from mid-February. ""And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping,"" he added. This video can not be played ""We need a plan"", Keir Starmer told MPs while declaring Labour would support new lockdown Under the measures, which came into force legally on Wednesday, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, for exercise outdoors only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close. Police have the powers to enforce the new restrictions with a Â£200 fine for each breach, doubling on every offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400 - and a Â£10,000 penalty for mass gatherings. Officers in London arrested at least a dozen people in Parliament Square after a protest against the new measures on Wednesday. The need to debate and vote on the restrictions means the Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. With Sir Keir saying Labour will support the motion, the measures are expected to pass with ease. The restrictions will be kept under ""continuous review"", Mr Johnson added, with a statutory requirement to reconsider them every two weeks. Addressing the closure of schools, the PM said ""we did everything in our power to keep them open as long as possible"" and that was why schools were the ""very last thing to close"". They would be the ""very first thing to reopen"" after lockdown - that could be after the February half term - but ""we must be very cautious"" about the timetable, he said. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams would be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades. ""This year, we're going to put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms,"" he said, referencing controversy overthe way exam grades were awardedto some students last year. All national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are now cancelled, Mr Williamson confirmed. He said every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week. The prime minister wasted no time in emphasising the ""fundamental difference"" between this and previous lockdowns. To keep opposition from his own MPs at bay he needs to demonstrate that the government's aim to vaccinate the most at-risk groups by mid-February is viable. He is also under pressure to give a sense of how quickly restrictions might be lifted after that. The course of the pandemic has changed swiftly at times, though, and may do so again, so it's unlikely we'll get any firm new timelines from Boris Johnson today. Most Conservative backbenchers seem resigned to the need for this new national lockdown and agree the prime minister had ""no choice"" but to act. But MPs on all sides are impatient to hear how soon things may start returning to something like life as normal at last. Mr Johnson said unlike in March last year, during the first lockdown, vaccines offered ""the means of our escape"". But he said there was now a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. ""After the marathon of last year, we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Every needle in every arm makes a difference."" Earlier, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""confident"" the government would meet its ""ambitious"" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a ""significant increase"" in the number of people who have received the jab.

"PM warns lockdown won't end 'with a bang'There will be a ""gradual unwrapping"" of England's lockdown, Boris Johnson tells MPs ahead of a vote later.","This video can not be played The prime minister says schools will be the first places to reopen The end of England's lockdown will not happen with a ""big bang"" but will instead be a ""gradual unwrapping"", Boris Johnson has told MPs. The prime minister made the comments in the Commons ahead of a retrospective vote later on the lockdown measures. He said the legislation runs until 31 March to allow a ""controlled"" easing of restrictions back into local tiers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's decisions ""have led us to the position we're now in"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were now 30,074 patients with coronavirus in UK hospitals. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. It came as the UK reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus,the highest daily death toll since April. Clap for Carers to return for new lockdown Can lockdown stop the new variant? The UK's new lockdown rules explained In a statement to the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new variant had ""led to more cases than we've seen ever before"" and that this had left the government with ""no choice but to return to national lockdown"". He said the legislation ran until the end of March ""not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis"". He said this would happen ""brick-by-brick... without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us"". But in response to MPs' questions, he said there was a ""cautious presumption"" that restrictions could start being eased from mid-February. ""And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping,"" he added. This video can not be played ""We need a plan"", Keir Starmer told MPs while declaring Labour would support new lockdown Under the measures, which came into force legally on Wednesday, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, for exercise outdoors only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close. Police have the powers to enforce the new restrictions with a Â£200 fine for each breach, doubling on every offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400 - and a Â£10,000 penalty for mass gatherings. Officers in London arrested at least a dozen people in Parliament Square after a protest against the new measures on Wednesday. The need to debate and vote on the restrictions means the Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. With Sir Keir saying Labour will support the motion, the measures are expected to pass with ease. The restrictions will be kept under ""continuous review"", Mr Johnson added, with a statutory requirement to reconsider them every two weeks. Addressing the closure of schools, the PM said ""we did everything in our power to keep them open as long as possible"" and that was why schools were the ""very last thing to close"". They would be the ""very first thing to reopen"" after lockdown - that could be after the February half term - but ""we must be very cautious"" about the timetable, he said. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams would be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades. ""This year, we're going to put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms,"" he said, referencing controversy overthe way exam grades were awardedto some students last year. All national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are now cancelled, Mr Williamson confirmed. He said every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week. The prime minister wasted no time in emphasising the ""fundamental difference"" between this and previous lockdowns. To keep opposition from his own MPs at bay he needs to demonstrate that the government's aim to vaccinate the most at-risk groups by mid-February is viable. He is also under pressure to give a sense of how quickly restrictions might be lifted after that. The course of the pandemic has changed swiftly at times, though, and may do so again, so it's unlikely we'll get any firm new timelines from Boris Johnson today. Most Conservative backbenchers seem resigned to the need for this new national lockdown and agree the prime minister had ""no choice"" but to act. But MPs on all sides are impatient to hear how soon things may start returning to something like life as normal at last. Mr Johnson said unlike in March last year, during the first lockdown, vaccines offered ""the means of our escape"". But he said there was now a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. ""After the marathon of last year, we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Every needle in every arm makes a difference."" Earlier, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""confident"" the government would meet its ""ambitious"" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a ""significant increase"" in the number of people who have received the jab. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK hadbeen vaccinatedso far. Mr Zahawi also said nursery schools presented ""very little risk"", are Covid-safe and hedefended the decision to keep them open during England's lockdown. People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half-term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League football can continue Responding to the prime minister's statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party will support the new restrictions and urged people to comply with them.

Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Park killer's interest in Islamic jihad 'fleeting',"(L-R) David Wails, Joe Ritchie-Bennett and James Furlong were pronounced dead at the scene A man who stabbed three people to death in a Reading park was suffering from psychosis ""right up to the day"" of the killings, a court has heard. Khairi Saadallah, 26, attacked James Furlong, 36, David Wails, 49, and Joseph Ritchie-Bennett, 39, in the Forbury Gardens in June. A hearing to decide if he was motivated by a religious or ideological cause has been told he was ""no radical Islamist"". The hearing at the Old Bailey is part of his sentencing. This video can not be played CCTV cameras captured Khairi Saadallah before and after the stabbing Saadallah, of Basingstoke Road, Reading, has pleaded guilty to three murders and three attempted murders. An examination of his mobile phone revealed extremist material, including an image of the Islamic State flag and the 9/11 Twin Towers attack, the court was told. The prosecution is seeking a whole-life prison order, meaning he would never be considered for release. Rossano Scamardella QC, defending, said the sentence should be one of life imprisonment with a starting point of 30 years, due to a lack of serious premeditation, the ""fleeting"" strength of his commitment to Islamist jihad, and his mental health issues. Khairi Saadallah previously admitted three counts of murder and three counts of attempted murder He said while the attack in Reading was ""terrifying"" and ""senseless"", it did not justify the failed Libyan asylum seeker being jailed for more than 30 years. He added that ""as brutal as these killings were"", the suggestion they were ""ruthlessly efficient"" had been ""exaggerated"". Saadallah took ""certain steps to facilitate the killings"", he said, but ""significant planning or premeditation simply does not exist"". 'Reading weeps' as town mourns stab deaths Victims of Reading stabbings 'died of neck wounds' Reading attack suspect 'known to MI5' He told the hearing Saadallah had ""come to the attention of the authorities on hundreds of occasions"", and had a history of frequent interactions with the police, criminal justice system and mental health services. He said Saadallah had developed an emotionally unstable and anti-social personality disorder and ""right up until the day of killing he was plainly suffering from episodes of psychosis"". Mr Scamardella said there is no suggestion this caused his offending but insisted his ""culpability [for the attack] is reduced"". The court heard earlier that a psychiatrist has since concluded the attack on June 20 was ""unrelated to the effects of either mental disorder or substance misuse"". Khairi Saadallah was visited and filmed by police during a welfare check the day before the attack The court was shown CCTV footage of Saadallah in Morrisons buying the knife he used in the attack Saadallah had described himself in interview as ""part Muslim and part Catholic"", said Mr Scamardella, adding: ""No radical Islamist would countenance adoption of another faith, it's inconceivable."" He said portraying Saadallah as a committed jihadist was a ""superficially attractive proposition"" based on ""pieces of evidence that exist that demonstrate or at least might demonstrate a fleeting interest"". Three others - Stephen Young, Patrick Edwards and Nishit Nisudan - were also injured by Saadallah. The hearing continues. CCTV shows park killer fleeing murder scene.

Julian Assange loses extradition bail bid,"Mr Assange and District Judge Vanessa Baraitser Julian Assange will remain in jail as he continues to fight against extradition to the United States. District Judge Vanessa Baraitser said there were substantial grounds to believe he would abscond. On Monday, she ruled the Wikileaks founder cannot be extradited to the US because he might kill himself. The US is now appealing that decision - and had opposed releasing the 49-year-old from a maximum security prison before the case is heard. Mr Assange, who was wearing a dark suit and face mask, was not seen to react to the decision at Westminster Magistrates Court. He's been held in prison since 2019, after hiding for seven years inside the Ecuadorian Embassy to avoid extradition. US prosecutors want to put him on trial for hacking and disclosing classified information - including the identities of informants who were helping intelligence agencies in Afghanistan, Iraq and elsewhere. Assange's US extradition blocked on health grounds How does the UK decide on Assange extradition? In her ruling, DJ Baraitser said Mr Assange still had the incentive to abscond. ""He is willing to flout the order of this court,"" she said. ""As a matter of fairness, the US must be allowed to challenge my decision and if Mr Assange absconds during this process they will lose the opportunity to do so."" Stella Moris: Urged US administration to drop prosecution During the bail application, Mr Assange's barrister Ed Fitzgerald QC said his client had been offered a London home by a supporter, where he could be with his partner and their two young children - but also compelled to remain under the strictest bail conditions. ""Your decision [on Monday] changes everything and it certainly changes any motive to abscond,"" said Mr Fitzgerald. ""On any view... [Mr Assange] would be safer isolating with his family in the community, subject to severe restrictions, than if he were in Belmarsh which has, very recently, had a severe outbreak...(of coronavirus). He wishes to live a sheltered life with his family."" But Clair Dobbin, for the USA, told the court Mr Assange had the ""resources, abilities and the sheer wherewithal"" to secretly arrange a flight to another country. ""[Mr Assange] regards himself as above the law and no cost is too great, whether that cost be to himself or others,"" said the barrister. Julian Assange's partner, Stella Moris, was among a large group of his supporters who had gathered at court. ""This a huge disappointment,"" she said. ""Julian should not be in Belmarsh prison in the first place. I urge the [US] Department of Justice to drop the charges and the President of the United States to pardon Julian."" District Judge Baraitser blocked Julian Assange's extradition on Monday,ruling that that while he had a case to answer,external, he was so mentally unwell that the US authorities could not guarantee he would not kill himself once inside a maximum security prison in the country. The USA's appeal against that ruling - which will go to more senior judges later this year - will challenge that finding.

Northern Ireland cancels GCSE and A-level exams,"All GCSE, AS and A-level examinations in Northern Ireland will not go ahead this year due to the Covid-19 crisis. Education Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday. Speaking BBC's Evening Extra programme, he said plans for awarding arrangements to replace the exams would be finalised before the end of January. Some GCSE exams were due to take place next week and more were scheduled for February, May and June. They will not take place but it is not yet clear what alternative arrangements will be in place for awarding grades. The news comes a day aftertransfer tests were cancelledin Northern Ireland. Hours latera single Association for Quality Education (AQE) transfer test was scheduled for 27 February. Strabane Academy in County Tyrone said on Wednesday afternoon that it had decided not to facilitate this additional test and would instead apply contingency criteria.

"Scots Covid deaths up by 68 as 33,000 more get vaccineLatest figures show more than 90,000 people in Scotland had received a first vaccination by late December.Scotland","The deaths of a further 68 people who tested positive for Covid have been recorded in Scotland in the past 24 hours. It comes as official figures show 33,381 people received their first dose of the coronavirus vaccine in the week to 27 December. That takes the total number of people to get a vaccine in Scotland since 8 December to 92,188. Patients in hospital with coronavirus rose from 1,347 on Tuesday to 1,384. Hospital admissions have been rising sharply but are still 136 short ofthe peak figure of 1,520recorded on 20 April last year. Covid in Scotland: Where are the latest cases? How do hospital numbers compare with April's peak? The latest statistics show 2,039 new cases of the virus, which is 10.5% of those recently tested, a slightly lower figure than in recent days. A total of 95 people are in intensive care - a slight increase but significantly lower than the April peak of 208. Health officials have expressed concern about the situation in Inverclyde, Dumfries & Galloway and the Scottish Borders, in particular, which have seen sharp rises in positive tests. Weekly figures show Inverclyde recorded 538.5 cases per 100,000, Dumfries & Galloway 538.1 and the Scottish Borders 435.5. There were a further 603 confirmed coronavirus cases in the NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde area in the past 24 hours, with an additional 296 in NHS Lanarkshire, 206 in NHS Grampian and 164 in the NHS Lothian area. Since the start of the pandemic, there have been 141,066 cases in Scotland, with a total of  4,701 people dying within 28 days of first testing positive. The latest vaccine figures were released after doctors in Scotland raised concerns aboutplans to delay the second doseof the Pfizer vaccine. All four UK nations will now leave up to 12 weeks between the first and second doses of the jab rather than giving both within 21 days. Dr Lewis Morrison, head of the BMA in Scotland, said members had concerns about the potential impact of leaving such a big gap between the two doses. But the UK's chief medical officers havedefended the move, saying the first dose will give people substantial protection against the virus within two to three weeks.

Ambulance service records busiest day ever,"Ambulances wait outside City Hospital in Birmingham An ambulance service has experienced its busiest day of calls on record. On Monday, West Midlands Ambulance Service dealt with 5,383 calls in 24 hours. The previous record was 5,001 calls in March 2018. Seven hundred of those calls came from London as its calls system struggled, according to BBC health correspondent Michele Paduano. The ambulance service said Covid-19 and winter weather had resulted in hospitals being ""extremely busy"". At the hosptials, the longest a patient waited was five hours and 39 minutes, with two of the longest waits at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham. A combination of Covid-19 and winter weather has resulted in hospitals being ""extremely busy"" At one point on Monday night, 15 ambulances were waiting to hand over patients outside New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton. A source told the BBC it was ""a very challenging day"" and in total, handovers had accounted for 759 hours of crews' time, equivalent to taking 63 ambulances off the road. While another said at 06:00 GMT on Tuesday, ambulances were still responding to emergency calls from the night before. Traditionally, the first Monday after New Year is always busy. GP surgeries have been closed and people wait until after the festivities to get medical treatment. This year, the number of calls was exacerbated by the service taking about 700 calls for the London ambulance service after its system struggled. There was also the perfect storm of snow and ice coupled with coronavirus - made worse because many of our trusts, particularly University Hospitals Birmingham have been struggling with capacity for many months. Usually hospitals would put patients on corridors, they can't because of Covid risks. They also have fewer beds due to wider spacing to prevent infection and fewer staff on duty. Hence patients left for hours on ambulances outside. West Midlands Ambulance Service is the best performing in the country, but even with near to 500 ambulances a day on the road, it cannot keep up with demand. Prof David Loughton, the chief executive of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, warned its capacity would ""soon be compromised"". ""The numbers are ramping up enormously and I don't think we've seen the full impact of what happened on Christmas Day yet, that will take time to come through,"" Prof Loughton said. He added a two-week ""lag"" meant things could get worst before they get better. ""As I always say today's Covid rate is my order book for intensive care in two weeks' time."" Grow up and take Covid seriously: Doctor 'Horrendous' ambulance delays at hospitals Latest news and updates for the West Midlands A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ""A combination of Covid-19 and winter weather has resulted in hospitals being extremely busy which unfortunately resulted in hospital handover delays. ""We work closely with the hospitals to try and ensure our crews are able to handover patients quickly and safely, but due to the extremely high demand some patients did wait longer to be handed over than we would normally see."" In a statement London Ambulance Service NHS Trust said : ""As is standard practice during periods of high demand and high levels of staff sickness, ambulance services provide support for each other, which includes answering 999 calls.""

Scotland hopes to accelerate vaccine rollout - FM,"The new Oxford vaccine was given to the first people on Monday Scotland hopes to accelerate its vaccine rollout programme if supplies of the jab allow it to do so, the country's first minister has said. The Scottish NHS hopes to vaccinate everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May. If the target is achieved, it would mean 2.7 million people - about half of the population - will have had the jab. It would then be rolled out to the rest of the adult population. But Nicola Sturgeon said that timetable was a ""cautious prediction"", and the aim was to accelerate the rollout ""as fast as we possibly can"" as more details about supply became available. Ms Sturgeon was speaking as new lockdowns began in both Scotland and England, with people being told to stay at home except for a handful of permitted reasons. The tough restrictions will remain in force across all of mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gigha until at least the end of the month, and will see schools closed to most pupils, places of worship shut and group exercise banned. Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? 'Stay at home' lockdown order comes into force What are the latest Covid rules in Scotland? Speaking to theBBC Radio's Good Morning Scotland programme, the first minister said it was difficult to be definitive about when the restrictions would be lifted. But she said it might be possible to ease some of the rules if the vaccination programme managed to push ahead of the virus in the ""race"" over the coming months. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Lockdown is about trying to slow down the virus and push rates of it back down. ""Now, if we manage to do that, then hopefully we will be able to start lifting some of these restrictions while the vaccination programme is ongoing, even in that first phase of it. ""But I can't be certain about that yet, because it's dependent on us managing to get the levels of infection down."" Cases of Covid have risen sharply in recent days Scotland hopes to have received just over 900,000 doses of the vaccine by the end of January - including the 100,000 doses that have already been administered to people. Ms Sturgeon said the government did not yet have full certainty about supply schedules after this month, but said details were being firmed up all the time. And she said a ""cautious prediction"" would be that ""we will have vaccinated the whole of the JCVI priority list by early May, which is everybody in Scotland above the age of 50 and people under 50 with underlying health conditions. ""That is about 2.7 million people, and we will then go on to the rest of the population. ""But we will be working as information on supplies becomes clearer to accelerate that timetable as fast as we possibly can."" The NHS in England has said it hopes to be able todeliver two million vaccines a weekby the end of this month. And Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said he wants to vaccinate people in the top four priority groups in England by mid-February - which would include everyone over the age of 70 and the most clinically vulnerable, as well as care home staff and residents and frontline health and social care workers. Ms Sturgeon later told her daily briefing that said she would ideally want to do the same, but that she did not yet have enough certainty about the supply of the vaccine to be able to make a firm commitment. She said this could risk ""undermining people's confidence in our ability to deliver"" if it was not possible to meet the timetable. Opposition parties have called on the Scottish government to publish daily vaccination figures so that the public can clearly see what progress is being made in the fight against Covid-19. A further 2,529 new coronavirus cases have been recorded in the past 24 hours, about half of which are thought to be the new variant. The number of hospital patients confirmed to have coronavirus has also risen steeply to 1,347, an increase of 255 over the past week. Of these patients, 93 are in intensive care, an increase of 28 in the same period, while a further 11 deaths of people who had tested positive have been recorded. Ms Sturgeon said she hoped pupils would be able to return to the classroom from 1 February The first minister also said she hoped the situation would have improved enough to allow pupils to return  to school on 1 February, but admitted that she cannot be certain that this will happen. The Scottish Conservatives have warned that the attainment gap between richer and poorer pupils is poised to stretch even wider unless the Scottish government radically increase their support for learning at home. The party says the government has had months to prepare for a return to remote learning, but that schools still do not have the necessary guidance and resources they need to provide equal access to high quality education. The Children and Young People's Commissioner, Bruce Adamson, has also warned that closing schools poses a ""serious risk of harm to the wellbeing of children and young people"" and online learning is being provided ""inconsistently"" across Scotland. And Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said the closure of schools had left working parents in a very difficult position. Ms Sturgeon said plans were being developed to extend testing for the virus in schools, but said it would be ""wrong"" to divert vaccine doses away from the most vulnerable people so they could be given to teachers instead. Ms Sturgeon added: ""We are trying to work out, within the overall programme, how quickly can we prioritise getting teachers and school staff vaccinated, so we have some discussions and some thinking still to do around that."" She also said she could see no reason why the Scottish Parliament election would not go ahead in May, adding that it was ""really important"" that the democratic process continues. MSPs passed legislation last month which contains contingency options for the election. It could allow voting to take place on more than one day, though ministers do not expect this power will have to be used. A legally-enforceable stay-at-home order is now in place across mainland Scotland and Skye with people only permitted to leave their home for an ""essential purpose"". This includes essential shopping, exercise, caring for someone, or if you are part of an extended household. Anyone able to work from home must do so, although those shielding to protect themselves from Covid-19 should not go into work - even if they cannot work from home. Schools will be closed to most pupils until 1 February at the earliest, meaning an additional two weeks of home learning for youngsters, in a move welcomed by teaching unions on Monday. Ms Sturgeon also revised the numbers of those allowed to gather outside to just two people from two different households, instead of the previous limit of six people from two households. However children aged 11 and under are not included in this limit and can still ""play outdoors in larger groups, including in organised gatherings"". From Friday, places of worship must close but can open to broadcast a service or conduct a funeral, wedding or civil partnership. A maximum of 20 people can attend a funeral service but wakes are banned, while up to five people can attend weddings and civil partnership services. Police Scotland Chief Constable Iain Livingstone also confirmed there will be ""increased patrols"" in Scotland's communities and said and officers will continue to act against anyone making ""wilful breaches"" of the law. Shetland, Orkney, Western Isles and several other islands currently remain at level three restrictions. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Will the new lockdown work?,"Lockdowns have worked before, but can we expect the new one to do the same? It feels like we are back in March or April last year, when the strict controls on all our lives led to a fairly quick decline in levels of coronavirus. But one of the crucial differences this time is the new variant, which is thought to spread between 50 and 70% faster than previous forms of the virus. Experts warn there are now no guarantees that lockdown will be enough to bring the variant under control. ""It still would not have been easy, but it would have been a much easier situation if it had not been for the new variant,"" Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told Inside Health. ""That really pushes the bounds of our ability to control the spread of the virus, even with measures that were previously relatively quite effective."" Listen: Prof Neil Ferguson on BBC Radio 4's Inside Health What are England's new lockdown rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? The coronavirus spreads when we come into contact with each other so moving classrooms online, telling people to stay at home and closing shops breaks many of those opportunities for human contact. If we consider the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - it was about 3.0 in the run up to the first lockdown and anything above 1.0 means cases are climbing. What is the R number? R fell to 0.6 during the first lockdown. Then every 1,000 infected people passed the virus on to 600 others, who passed it on to 360 others and so on. But if the new variant is 50% more transmissible then the R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be about 0.9. Then 1,000 infected people would pass the virus onto 900 others, then 810 and so on. As you can see this leads to far slower decline. And that assumes lockdown can get R down to 0.9 in areas where the new variant has become the most common form of the virus. If, as some studies suggest, the variant is about 70% more transmissible then R may stay above 1.0 and cases may not fall at all. ""We'd at best flatten the curve, keep numbers at a roughly constant level, and that's frankly why there is so much emphasis on getting vaccine into people's arms as quickly as possible,"" said Prof Ferguson. It is hard to lock down even harder as there are some parts of society - hospitals, supermarkets - that need to be kept open. What happens to the number of cases over the coming weeks will be closely monitored. If this lockdown is less effective then we will have to live with it for longer. There have been some encouraging signs over the Christmas break, which was a bit like a lockdown due to school holidays and other restrictions. ""We are in a very difficult situation here, but my initial assessment of the last few days is that the rate is slowing which is good news,"" Prof John Edmunds, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. He added: ""It looks likes those restrictions should be sufficient to stop the increase, whether they will be sufficient to bring cases down sufficiently we are yet to see."" Eventually the vaccine will give people immunity so we do not need the same controls on our lives. Now more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine.

Medics concerned over 12-week vaccine dose gapThe BMA in Scotland says it is concerned about the potential impact of delaying the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine.,"Doctors in Scotland have raised concerns about plans to delay the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. All four UK nations will now leave up to 12 weeks between the first and second doses of the jab rather than giving both within 21 days. Dr Lewis Morrison, head of the BMA in Scotland, said members had concerns about the potential impact of leaving such a big gap between the two doses. But the UK's chief medical officers havedefended the move. They said that the first dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines - the only two so far approved for use in the UK - will give people substantial protection against the virus within two to three weeks of being administered. And they said that the second dose was ""likely to be very important for duration of protection, and at an appropriate dose interval may further increase vaccine efficacy"". Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? Scotland hopes to accelerate vaccine rollout 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs The Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments and recommended the new strategy, said data showed that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine would be ""90% effective"". But the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it would not recommend following the UK's decision to delay giving the second Pfizer dose, saying there was no evidence to support the decision. Pfizer has said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart. The Pfizer vaccine was the first to be approved for use in the UK, with more than a million people having already been given the first dose. The change to the vaccination strategy has meant health boards have had to change plans and cancel people booked in for their second doses of the Pfizer jabs. This includes medics who are among the priority groups for Covid vaccinations. Dr Lewis Morrison, chairman of the British Medical Association's Scottish Council, raised concerns about the logistical impact of changing the vaccination strategy Dr Morrison told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that some doctors had told him they would have waited for the AstraZeneca jab, which has been proven to work in the longer timetable, if they had known the second Pfizer dose was going to be delayed. He said: ""We are concerned because there's clearly disagreement about the effectiveness of the second dose of Pfizer after that period of time. ""Furthermore I think if you give more people the first dose when you don't know what vaccine supplies are going to be within that 12-week window, that's a worry that has been expressed to me by a lot of doctors. ""If we give more people the first dose, do we definitely know that the second one is coming? ""The announcement about this before a four-day NHS holiday weekend left many places with great difficulty in reorganising vaccinations, with a real risk that vaccination numbers might perversely drop because of the organisational issues."" Opposition parties want the Scottish government to publish daily figures for how many people have been vaccinated It comes as NHS staff were left queueing for hours outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary on Tuesday after an ""scheduling error"" meant vaccination staff did not turn up. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has apologised to those affected and said it was rearranging the appointments. The Scottish government has said it aims to have given at least one vaccine dose to everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the timetable could be accelerated if there were sufficient supplies of the jab. The Scottish government is being pressured to provide daily figures on the number of people being vaccinated, as the UK government has already pledged to do. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""There are now no excuses left for the SNP government to dodge publishing daily vaccination rates alongside the daily infection numbers as soon as possible. ""The SNP's evasion to try and avoid scrutiny is nothing new but on something so important, the Scottish public must have the same information as will be provided across the UK."" His call was echoed by Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon, who added: ""It is simply unacceptable that scores of NHS staff were left queueing outside in the cold for hours, and well into the evening. ""It's time for Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to get to grips with the vaccination programme, publish daily figures on the number of vaccinations available and administered, and ensure that our NHS staff do not pay the price of a bungled rollout.""

"Patients with Covid in UK hospitals now above 30,000","MPs in the House of Commons back the government's decision to impose a lockdown across England amid surging coronavirus infections MPs approve regulations enabling the new national lockdown in England by 524 votes to 16, a majority of 508 The number of patients in UK hospitals with Covid is now above 30,000 - and 1,041 new deaths are reported, the highest daily figure since April Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson PM Boris Johnson emphasises that England's third lockdown is different from the first, saying that this will be a ""sprint"" to the finish rather than a ""marathon"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government has been ""repeatedly too slow to act"" and that has left the NHS under an unprecedented strain European regulators approves the Moderna vaccine - making it the second vaccine to be recommended for use in the EU Edited by Marie Jackson We're wrapping up our live updates on the coronavirus pandemic for now, but we will be back again on Thursday. Today's updates were brought to you by Sophie Williams, Lauren Turner, Emma Harrison, Paul Seddon, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Scott and Victoria Bisset. The page was edited by Helier Cheung, Sarah Collerton, John Hand, Suzanne Leigh and Marie Jackson. Thank you for joining us. Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?"" Dr Clarke, who is also an author, said ministers should not have ""ignored"" the independent advisory group Sage when they suggested as early as September that a ""circuit breaker"" was required  - and before Christmas to have a lockdown.

BBC Question Time The UK has an ""ambitious"" vaccine delivery plan, the minister in charge of the roll out has insisted. Asked by a member of the public on the BBC's Question Time programme why there appeared to be a ""lack of joined-up planning"" compared to other countries, Nadhim Zahawi highlighted the target to vaccinate just under 14 million people by the middle of February. He said: ""Between the 4 of January and the 11 January you'll see another step up."" Prof Mark Walport, a member of the independent government's advisory group Sage, told the programme: ""We are in a race between getting people vaccinated and this new more transmissible variant.""

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection. ""It's a universal right,"" President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters news agency. ""We would do it."" He gave no details about how such a plan would be implemented, or who would  be eligible to receive a vaccine. Many undocumented migrants in the US are from Mexico. The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"". He added Johnson also ""outlined his vision for building back better from the pandemic"". Downing Street said Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Trade Secretary Liz Truss also joined the call. He said: ""The chancellor also spoke about his optimism for the UK economy in 2021 and committed to using all the levers at his disposal to drive growth across the entire UK which meets our climate ambitions."" The conversation also took in the Brexit trade deal, No 10 said, as well as the government's ""urgent ambition to unite and level up across the country by investing in education, skills, technology and infrastructure"". Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external. It says members of the public should first be encouraged to comply with the law. ""Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" it says. For participation in gatherings, fixed penalty notices start at Â£100 and can rise to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. There are fines of Â£10,000 for organisers of restricted gatherings. It also says, in addition to businesses already closed, aquariums and zoos, including safari parks and wildlife centres, are among the attractions that must close. MPs have voted to approve the law which introduced a new lockdown in England this morning. A total of 524 MPs voted in favour of the restrictions, compared to 16 who voted against. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month. Here's a closer look at the data: Itâs been a busy day so far and MPs are continuing to debate
the new lockdown in England in the House of Commons. Weâre not expecting a vote
until about 19:00 GMT, but weâll continue to bring you the latest on our live
page. Hereâs a round-up of the main coronavirus headlines in the UK:  Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne is making his criticism of lockdowns very clear in his allotted time in the Commons. He calls it a ""situation of state capture"" where the government is ""completely enthralled to a lobby driving a policy that has manifestly failed"" - slamming the ""increasing iterations of this policy with ever tighter controls and restrictions in the hope it may finally work"". After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame. ""And on that occasion at least, they will be right."" Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin correspondent The Irish government has announced a raft of measures to fight the coronavirus including school closures. Non-essential construction will also be shut down and air passengers must have negative Covid-19 PCR tests 72 hours before flying into the state. PCR tests are regarded as the ""gold standard"" of testing. The travel restriction will apply to passengers from Britain and South Africa before an anticipated extension to all visitors. The Taoiseach (Irish PM) has told a news conference that public compliance with the measures will reflect on how many people may die. MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said he expected people to ""face the coming month with steely determination and resolve."" Read the full story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Can Scotland hold an election during the pandemic?Scotland is due to go to the polls in May - although the election is likely to be very different than usual.Scotland politics,"A number of other countries have managed to hold elections despite the pandemic Scotland has entered a new Covid-19 lockdown, but is also preparing to go to the polls in just a few months time. How can an election take place during a pandemic, and what plans are in place? To start with, yes. Many countries have held elections already during the pandemic. Some, like New Zealand, have had relatively few cases of coronavirus to contend with. But others, like the US, have successfully conducted ballots while in the grip of nationwide outbreaks. There have even been a number of council by-elections in Scotland over the past year, from Edinburgh and Aberdeen to the Western Isles. Yes, they featured a far smaller turnout than is expected in May - but they provide vital experience for returning officers in terms of the ease of finding polling places and recruiting staff in the present conditions. The Holyrood election is not the only one due in the UK this spring, either - there are also elections to the Welsh Parliament and a host of local council and mayoralty contests across England. Joe Biden won the US presidency despite doing much of his campaigning remotely As it stands, everyone is still planning for an election on Thursday 6 May. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon says she can ""see no reason at this stage"" why it should have to be delayed, despite the fact the vaccination programme will still be ongoing come polling day. Any change would be a decision for Holyrood as a whole, rather than the government. However the principal opposition party - the Conservatives - have backed Ms Sturgeon's position. MSPs have introduced contingency plans which would allow the vote to be pushed back by up to six months - either by a vote of parliament, or in the most extreme circumstances via a decree from Presiding Officer Ken Macintosh. But the hope is that the combination of the vaccine and the other backup plans that have been put in place will be enough for the vote to go ahead safely. Any delay would likely have implications across the UK, with the races mentioned above in mind - polling and politics guru Prof Sir John Curtice has suggested that a joint approach may ultimately be taken in Cardiff, Edinburgh and London if there are to be any changes. Dogs may need to be more socially distant at polling stations in 2021 Voting by post is expected to be a big feature of the coming election - but current plans would not allow foreveryoneto mail in their ballots. It was already agrowing trend,external- 3.6% of the electorate registered for a postal vote in 2003, then 11.2% in 2007, 14.1% in 2011, and 17.7% in 2016 - and surveys suggest more Scots than ever will want to take the socially-distant option to cast their vote in 2021. At present only 17% of the electorate have signed up for a postal ballot, but officials are braced for this to surge to up to 40% once campaigning gets under way - with parties expected to urge their supporters to sign up en masse. The challenge will be what happens if an even greater number than that apply. The deadline for postal registrations has already been brought forward to provide time to process the expected wave of applications. If, say, half of the electorate were to ask for a postal ballot, the Electoral Management Board have voiced fears the election would have to be pushed back in order to get through the paperwork. And they say an all-postal election likely would not be possible until November, such would be the burden of signing up all 4.2m Scottish voters to the system. Mail-in ballots played a significant role in the US presidential election One contingency plan on the table is to hold polling across more than one day - potentially even with different age groups voting on different days. Several parties - Labour, the Greens and Lib Dems - have voiced cautious support for multi-day polling. However the Election Management Board have stated a preference for voting on a single date, and both the SNP and Tories are behind that position. Another consideration iswherevotes are cast. For the most part, there are few concerns about polling places becoming the epicentre of new outbreaks - they are highly regulated environments at the best of times, and officials say they would pose no more risk than a supermarket. However, the Electoral Commission have said they might reconsider using schools as polling places, particularly if voting does take place over more than one day, due to the risk of disrupting education still further. Within polling places, more stations where voters can cast their ballot may be set up, to reduce queues - which would require extra staff to be taken on. One final question applies to when votes might becounted. Talks have been held about whether the traditional overnight count - with staff packed into community centres and gym halls - would go ahead as normal, or whether results could be tallied at a more sedate pace the following day. Extra precautions will likely be needed at election counts too The election campaign is due to officially begin in March - although arguably some parties have already been in campaign mode for some time now. It seems highly unlikely that social distancing guidelines will have been relaxed enough by then for politicians to go out shaking hands and kissing babies. Indeed there have been complaints in some quarters about candidates going out knocking on doors during selection contests, so the traditional ""boots on the ground"" approach will likely take a back seat to the ""air war"" of wider messaging. The US election is likely to be instructive - Joe Biden managed to win the presidency despite rarely leaving the house. One final wrinkle is that this year, MSPs will likely still be MSPs right up to polling day. Normally in an election year, Holyrood would shut down in late March. However this year ""dissolution"" is likely to be delayed until the day before polling, in case parliament needs to be recalled in an emergency. This is mostly a technical matter - Holyrood would be in recess, so members wouldn't be prevented from campaigning - but would mean members were bound by the MSPs code of conduct throughout the election period.

PM warns lockdown won't end 'with a bang',"This video can not be played The prime minister says schools will be the first places to reopen The end of England's lockdown will not happen with a ""big bang"" but will instead be a ""gradual unwrapping"", Boris Johnson has told MPs. The prime minister made the comments in the Commons ahead of a retrospective vote later on the lockdown measures. He said the legislation runs until 31 March to allow a ""controlled"" easing of restrictions back into local tiers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's decisions ""have led us to the position we're now in"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were now 30,074 patients with coronavirus in UK hospitals. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. It came as the UK reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus,the highest daily death toll since April. Clap for Carers to return for new lockdown Can lockdown stop the new variant? The UK's new lockdown rules explained In a statement to the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new variant had ""led to more cases than we've seen ever before"" and that this had left the government with ""no choice but to return to national lockdown"". He said the legislation ran until the end of March ""not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis"". He said this would happen ""brick-by-brick... without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us"". But in response to MPs' questions, he said there was a ""cautious presumption"" that restrictions could start being eased from mid-February. ""And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping,"" he added. This video can not be played ""We need a plan"", Keir Starmer told MPs while declaring Labour would support new lockdown Under the measures, which came into force legally on Wednesday, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, for exercise outdoors only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close. Police have the powers to enforce the new restrictions with a Â£200 fine for each breach, doubling on every offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400 - and a Â£10,000 penalty for mass gatherings. Officers in London arrested at least a dozen people in Parliament Square after a protest against the new measures on Wednesday. The need to debate and vote on the restrictions means the Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. With Sir Keir saying Labour will support the motion, the measures are expected to pass with ease. The restrictions will be kept under ""continuous review"", Mr Johnson added, with a statutory requirement to reconsider them every two weeks. Addressing the closure of schools, the PM said ""we did everything in our power to keep them open as long as possible"" and that was why schools were the ""very last thing to close"". They would be the ""very first thing to reopen"" after lockdown - that could be after the February half term - but ""we must be very cautious"" about the timetable, he said. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams would be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades. ""This year, we're going to put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms,"" he said, referencing controversy overthe way exam grades were awardedto some students last year. All national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are now cancelled, Mr Williamson confirmed. He said every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week. The prime minister wasted no time in emphasising the ""fundamental difference"" between this and previous lockdowns. To keep opposition from his own MPs at bay he needs to demonstrate that the government's aim to vaccinate the most at-risk groups by mid-February is viable. He is also under pressure to give a sense of how quickly restrictions might be lifted after that. The course of the pandemic has changed swiftly at times, though, and may do so again, so it's unlikely we'll get any firm new timelines from Boris Johnson today. Most Conservative backbenchers seem resigned to the need for this new national lockdown and agree the prime minister had ""no choice"" but to act. But MPs on all sides are impatient to hear how soon things may start returning to something like life as normal at last. Mr Johnson said unlike in March last year, during the first lockdown, vaccines offered ""the means of our escape"". But he said there was now a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. ""After the marathon of last year, we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Every needle in every arm makes a difference."" Earlier, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""confident"" the government would meet its ""ambitious"" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a ""significant increase"" in the number of people who have received the jab. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK hadbeen vaccinatedso far. Mr Zahawi also said nursery schools presented ""very little risk"", are Covid-safe and hedefended the decision to keep them open during England's lockdown. People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half-term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League football can continue Responding to the prime minister's statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party will support the new restrictions and urged people to comply with them. ""The virus is out of control, over a million people in England now have Covid, the number of hospital admissions is rising, tragically so are the numbers of people dying,"" he said. ""It's only the early days of January and the NHS is under huge strain. In those circumstances, tougher restrictions are necessary."" But he added ""this is not just bad luck, it's not inevitable, it follows a pattern"" of the government being slow to respond. ""These are the decisions that have led us to the position we're now in - and the vaccine is now the only way out and we must all support the national effort to get it rolled out as quickly as possible.""

"UK records highest daily Covid deaths since AprilA further 62,322 new coronavirus cases are also reported, the highest number since mass tests began.UKComments","The UK has reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus, the highest daily death toll since April. It came as 62,322 new cases were recorded, the highest daily rise since mass testing began, and as MPs supported England's lockdown. Health Secretary Matt Hancock earlier said doctors could be forced to ration treatment without the new curbs. There are 30,074 Covid patients in UK hospitals, he said, as an ambulance trust told of severe pressure. Current patient numbers are 39% higher than the previous peak on 12 April last year, when 21,684 were in hospital. The number of those who died within 28 days of a positive test in the past week is 37% higher than the previous seven days. Andrew Hayward, a professor of infectious diseases, said the number of deaths could continue to increase for the next few weeks. He explained deaths ""lag two or three weeks behind the number of cases in the community, and those have been increasing"". Prof Hayward, who is also a government science adviser, added: ""I think the lockdown measures will turn that number of deaths around but it is going to take a little while."" Can lockdown stop the new variant? The UK's new lockdown rules explained Clap for Carers to return for new lockdown Mr Hancock told MPs the consequences of inaction could be similar to scenes elsewhere in the world - of overrun hospitals and doctors choosing ""who to treat and who to turn away"". ""If we don't act now, we know that eventually the NHS would not be able to cope,"" he said. West Midlands Ambulance Serviceexperienced its busiest-ever day on Monday, handling 5,383 emergency calls due to a combination of Covid-19 pressures and winter weather. Sussex and Surreyhave rolled out ""major incident"" plans, allowing the two counties to seek more central government support as pressure mounts on health services. And hospitals in Greater Manchester are in danger of ""falling over"" as cancer operations risk being cancelled, Manchester City Council's leader Sir Richard Leese said. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. While England's lockdown became law at midnight, MPs voted overwhelmingly - by 524 to 16 - in support of the tougher measures on Wednesday evening. Labour backed the restrictions but 12 Conservative MPs rebelled to vote against. Speaking during the Commons debate, Health Minister Helen Whately said although the regulations allowed the lockdown to be in place until the end of March, the government did not expect it to continue until then. Instead, the plan was for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a local basis"" to exit lockdown. Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they do not like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention. Meanwhile, GCSEs, A-level and AS-level examswill be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said. All national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are also cancelled, he confirmed. He said that during this lockdown, every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week. The figures are stark. But sadly they were to be expected. Infection rates were climbing throughout December - they are now more than four times higher than they were at the start of last month. More infections, mean more hospital admissions and more deaths. The fact deaths have gone over 1,000 for the first time since April is alarming. But one caveat to that is that the figures over the past week have been jumping around because of delays reporting deaths over the Christmas period. A better way to measure deaths is to look at the average number of deaths over the course of the week. This metric shows we are seeing just below 700 a day - although that is still up by 40% compared to the figure before Christmas. And these numbers are only going to continue rising. That's because this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions and some of those being admitted then will die maybe a week or so later. Lockdown is expected to have an impact, but it will take some time - and even then it may have less affect than previous ones because of the more transmissible variant. The rollout of the vaccines cannot come soon enough. As MPs debated the new lockdown, Labour's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth called for the government to ramp-up its vaccination programme to six million doses a week. It came after Prime Minister Boris Johnson told MPs England's new lockdown would not end with a ""big bang""but a ""gradual unwrapping"". He said that, unlike during the first lockdown from March 2020, vaccines now offered ""the means of our escape"". But he said there was a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February.

On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK hadbeen vaccinatedso far. The locations for seven mass vaccination centres in Englandhave been announced by the government. Sites in Stevenage, London, Newcastle, Manchester, Surrey, Bristol and Birmingham will be staffed by NHS workers and volunteers from next week.

"Northern Ireland cancels GCSE and A-level examsMeanwhile, a Tyrone grammar school says it will opt out of February's AQE test ""for children's welfare"".Northern IrelandComments","All GCSE, AS and A-level examinations in Northern Ireland will not go ahead this year due to the Covid-19 crisis. Education Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday. Speaking BBC's Evening Extra programme, he said plans for awarding arrangements to replace the exams would be finalised before the end of January. Some GCSE exams were due to take place next week and more were scheduled for February, May and June. They will not take place but it is not yet clear what alternative arrangements will be in place for awarding grades. The news comes a day aftertransfer tests were cancelledin Northern Ireland. Hours latera single Association for Quality Education (AQE) transfer test was scheduled for 27 February. Strabane Academy in County Tyrone said on Wednesday afternoon that it had decided not to facilitate this additional test and would instead apply contingency criteria. In a statement, the school said it understood the amount of time and effort invested in preparing for the exams. ""However, in these exceptional and unprecedented circumstances, we have taken this decision based on what we believe is thecorrect decision for children's welfare,external."" Northern Ireland is under tight lockdown restrictions amid a sharply-rising number of Covid-19 cases. Schools will remain shut until after the half-term break in mid-February, with the majority of pupils facing an extended period of remote learning. This video can not be played Overriding aim is that NI students 'are not disadvantaged' Speaking in the assembly on Wednesday, Mr Weir said his department had been ""preparing for all eventualities"". ""I now feel we have reached a point where, while I still believe examinations are the most appropriate and fairest awarding methodology, with a further six weeks of remote learning having to be imposed, we cannot continue with exams in the way that was planned,"" he said. The minister added that details about alternative arrangements would be brought forward as soon as possible but he did not commit to a timeframe. Mr Weir does not have responsibility for BTec exams - they fall under the remit of the Department for the Economy. Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said ""further flexibilities"" would be put in place for January's BTecs assessments and exams. Siblings Will, 17, and Rosemary, 16, who attend Lagan College in Belfast, said they were relieved and happy that the exams had been scrapped. But they told BBC News NI that they wished the guidance had been issued sooner. They said they hoped their grades would be formed by teachers' predictions. Will and Rosemary say they are relieved they will not face exams this year Will, who is in year 14, has missed seven weeks of school this academic year due toextended school holiday periodsand having been identified as a close contact with someone who tested positive for coronavirus.

Clap for Carers to return for new lockdownFounder Annemarie Plas says the initiative will return on Thursday under the new name of Clap for Heroes.UKComments,"Clap for Carers is to return under a new name of Clap for Heroes, the initiative's founder has said. The weekly applause for front-line NHS staff and other key workers ran for 10 weeks during the UK's first coronavirus lockdown last spring. Founder Annemarie Plas tweeted that it would return at 20:00 GMT on Thursday. Ms Plas said she hoped the initiative would ""lift the spirit of all of us"" including ""all who are pushing through this difficult time"". Allow Twitter content?

The idea of clapping and banging pots from doorsteps originally began as a one-off to support NHS staff on 26 March - three days after the UK went into lockdown for the first time. After proving popular it was expanded to cover all key workers and continued every Thursday for 10 weeks, with millions of people across the UK taking part. Members of the Royal Family and politicians including Prime Minister Boris Johnson also joined in with the show of support. However, the event later faced criticism for becoming politicised, with some suggesting the NHS would benefit more from extra funding than applause. Is this the last hurrah for clap for carers? Clap for Carers creator on her viral challenge Last May, Ms Plas, a Dutch national living in south London,said the weekly applause should end after its 10th weekand instead become an annual event. At the time, she said the public had ""shown our appreciation"" and it was now up to ministers to ""reward"" key workers.

"LiveLivePatients with Covid in UK hospitals now above 30,0006 minutes ago","MPs in the House of Commons back the government's decision to impose a lockdown across England amid surging coronavirus infections MPs approve regulations enabling the new national lockdown in England by 524 votes to 16, a majority of 508 The number of patients in UK hospitals with Covid is now above 30,000 - and 1,041 new deaths are reported, the highest daily figure since April Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson PM Boris Johnson emphasises that England's third lockdown is different from the first, saying that this will be a ""sprint"" to the finish rather than a ""marathon"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government has been ""repeatedly too slow to act"" and that has left the NHS under an unprecedented strain European regulators approves the Moderna vaccine - making it the second vaccine to be recommended for use in the EU Edited by Marie Jackson We're wrapping up our live updates on the coronavirus pandemic for now, but we will be back again on Thursday. Today's updates were brought to you by Sophie Williams, Lauren Turner, Emma Harrison, Paul Seddon, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Scott and Victoria Bisset. The page was edited by Helier Cheung, Sarah Collerton, John Hand, Suzanne Leigh and Marie Jackson. Thank you for joining us. Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?"" Dr Clarke, who is also an author, said ministers should not have ""ignored"" the independent advisory group Sage when they suggested as early as September that a ""circuit breaker"" was required  - and before Christmas to have a lockdown.

BBC Question Time The UK has an ""ambitious"" vaccine delivery plan, the minister in charge of the roll out has insisted. Asked by a member of the public on the BBC's Question Time programme why there appeared to be a ""lack of joined-up planning"" compared to other countries, Nadhim Zahawi highlighted the target to vaccinate just under 14 million people by the middle of February. He said: ""Between the 4 of January and the 11 January you'll see another step up."" Prof Mark Walport, a member of the independent government's advisory group Sage, told the programme: ""We are in a race between getting people vaccinated and this new more transmissible variant.""

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection. ""It's a universal right,"" President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters news agency. ""We would do it."" He gave no details about how such a plan would be implemented, or who would  be eligible to receive a vaccine. Many undocumented migrants in the US are from Mexico. The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"". He added Johnson also ""outlined his vision for building back better from the pandemic"". Downing Street said Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Trade Secretary Liz Truss also joined the call. He said: ""The chancellor also spoke about his optimism for the UK economy in 2021 and committed to using all the levers at his disposal to drive growth across the entire UK which meets our climate ambitions."" The conversation also took in the Brexit trade deal, No 10 said, as well as the government's ""urgent ambition to unite and level up across the country by investing in education, skills, technology and infrastructure"". Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external. It says members of the public should first be encouraged to comply with the law. ""Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" it says. For participation in gatherings, fixed penalty notices start at Â£100 and can rise to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. There are fines of Â£10,000 for organisers of restricted gatherings. It also says, in addition to businesses already closed, aquariums and zoos, including safari parks and wildlife centres, are among the attractions that must close. MPs have voted to approve the law which introduced a new lockdown in England this morning. A total of 524 MPs voted in favour of the restrictions, compared to 16 who voted against. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month. Here's a closer look at the data: Itâs been a busy day so far and MPs are continuing to debate
the new lockdown in England in the House of Commons. Weâre not expecting a vote
until about 19:00 GMT, but weâll continue to bring you the latest on our live
page. Hereâs a round-up of the main coronavirus headlines in the UK:  Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne is making his criticism of lockdowns very clear in his allotted time in the Commons. He calls it a ""situation of state capture"" where the government is ""completely enthralled to a lobby driving a policy that has manifestly failed"" - slamming the ""increasing iterations of this policy with ever tighter controls and restrictions in the hope it may finally work"". After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame. ""And on that occasion at least, they will be right."" Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin correspondent The Irish government has announced a raft of measures to fight the coronavirus including school closures. Non-essential construction will also be shut down and air passengers must have negative Covid-19 PCR tests 72 hours before flying into the state. PCR tests are regarded as the ""gold standard"" of testing. The travel restriction will apply to passengers from Britain and South Africa before an anticipated extension to all visitors. The Taoiseach (Irish PM) has told a news conference that public compliance with the measures will reflect on how many people may die. MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said he expected people to ""face the coming month with steely determination and resolve."" Read the full story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Teachers' grades to replace exams in England,"Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He told MPs he would ""trust in teachers rather than algorithms"", a reference to the U-turn over last year's exams. For primaries, he confirmed there would be no Year 6 Sats tests this year. Mr Williamson promised parents it would be ""mandatory"" for schools to provide ""high-quality remote education"" of three to five hours per day. He said this would be ""enforced"" by Ofsted, with inspections where there were ""serious concerns"" about what was provided for children now studying at home. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, accused Mr Williamson of ""chaos and confusion"" - and said he had failed to listen to the ""expertise of professionals on the front line"". She said he had given a ""cast-iron commitment"" that exams would go ahead - and Ms Green said: ""At that moment, we should have known they were doomed to be cancelled."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams this week Mr Williamson, in a statement to the House of Commons, said there would be ""training and support"" for teachers in estimating grades, ""to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently"". He also told MPs there would be no Sats tests for those at the end of primary school. ""I can absolutely confirm that we won't be proceeding with Sats this year. We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a ""vague statement"" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a ""dereliction of duty"" that it was not already prepared. And he warned against repeating the ""shambles"" of last summer's cancelled exams. Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say students Northern Ireland cancels GCSEs and A-levels Exams cancelled in England's latest lockdown Vocational exams allowed to go ahead The big exam U-turn of the summer The education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown. The exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places. Simon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered. A consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner. Last year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades. And without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates. On vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was ""failing to show leadership on exams in January"". Vocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion. If students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have ""enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression"", says the awarding body Pearson. An Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, ""to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances"". The exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades. Mr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. Education Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday. Scotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers. GCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November.

Conmen use Covid and social media to peddle scams,"Fraudsters are sending out bogus text messages about the coronavirus vaccine in an attempt to steal bank details. The scam tells recipients they are ""eligible to apply for your vaccine"" with a link to a bogus NHS website, trading standards officers have warned. That, in turn, asks for personal information and - crucially - bank details ""for verification"". The warning comes the same day as MPs heard that Covid is leading some people into the net of pension fraudsters. The fake NHS message is one of a range of scams which have sought to take advantage of the pandemic and the isolation and legitimate worries of potential victims, according to the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. Others have included people travelling door-to-door selling counterfeit or useless protection equipment, or fraudsters claiming to be from the official test and trace service and demanding payments. Banks reveal 10 coronavirus scams to be wary of Scam warning over NHS test and trace The latest scam is preying on those elderly or vulnerable people who are fully expecting to receive legitimate information about their vaccine. Health authorities have stressed they would never ask for an individual's banking details. Katherine Hart, lead office at the CTSI, said: ""I have been tracking and warning the public about Covid-related scams since the beginning of the pandemic, and at every stage of response, unscrupulous individuals have modified their campaigns to defraud the public. ""The vaccine brings great hope for an end to the pandemic and lockdowns, but some only wish to create even further misery by defrauding others. The NHS will never ask you for banking details, passwords, or PIN numbers and these should serve as instant red flags."" She urged people to report the scams toAction Fraud,externalorPolice Scotland,external. Pensions have been stolen or put into high-risk schemes The warning came as MPs on the Work and Pensions Select Committee heard how fraudsters were seizing on victims' financial uncertainty during the pandemic to draw them into pension scams. Rules allowing people to withdraw cash from their pension pot from the age of 55 have led some people to move money into investment schemes which look generous, but are simply vehicles to steal money. ""Household finances are stretched and so the temptations to use savings or to be tempted by offers of 'free pension reviews', for example, which we've warned about, are very real,"" Mark Steward, from the Financial Conduct Authority told the committee. ""Of course, a 'free pension review' is hardly free. It is the first step on a process that will lead someone to investing in something that is too good to be true."" He said that fraudsters had used social media advertising to ""industrialise"" this kind of fraud. Whereas previously, fraudsters had to produce sophisticated glossy brochures and office fronts, they could now operate in anonymity on social media, sending fake information to millions of people. Millions of pounds have been lost to pension scams in recent years, but it is a crime considered to be widely under-reported by victims and pension companies. Graeme Biggar, director general of the National Economic Crime Centre, told the committee that fraudsters were continuing to use new avenues to reach potential victims. ""What we're looking to do next is to move on to fake comparison websites, which is this new gateway into investment frauds, to spot those and take them down at source,"" he said. Reject unexpected pension offers, whether made online, on social media or over the phone Check who you're dealing with before changing your pension arrangements. Check theFCA Register,externalor call the FCA contact centre on 0800 111 6768 to see if the firm you are dealing with is authorised by the FCA Don't be rushed or pressured into making any decision about your pension Consider getting impartial information and advice Source:ScamSmart,external More than Â£30m lost to pension fraud since 2017 Scam warning over NHS test and trace Banks reveal 10 coronavirus scams to be wary of At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

House party murders gang jailed for life,"Clayton Barker, Earl Bevans, Charlie Chandler, Jamie Chandler and Ben Potter must serve minimum sentences of between 22 and 28 years Five attackers who stabbed two teenagers to death in a gang-related ""revenge"" raid at a house party have been jailed for life. Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice, both 17, were fatally stabbed in the attack in Milton Keynes in 2019. Charlie Chandler, 23; Clayton Barker, 20; Ben Potter and Jamie Chandler, both 17, were convicted of murder at Luton Crown Court last month. Earl Bevans, 23, pleaded guilty at the start of the trial. The boys were stabbed in Archford Croft in Milton Keynes in October 2019 Mr Justice Spencer described the murders of Ben Gillham-Rice (left) and Dom Ansah as ""senseless and tragic"" The trial heard the attackers were either members of, or associated with, the B3 gang in west Bletchley, Milton Keynes. Prosecutors said the murders were part of a revenge attack after Potter wassubjected to a ""humiliating"" ordealby members of a gang called M4. He was assaulted, stripped and taunted in woodland in the Westcroft area of Milton Keynes in 2017. This was recorded and shared on social media, the court heard, and the teenager later named Dom Ansah as one of the perpetrators. Jurors were also told Jamie Chandler had been stabbed just months before the murders. The court heard that B3 were tipped-off that people associated with M4 were at the party at an address on Archford Croft in Emerson Valley on Saturday, 19 October, 2019. Armed and wearing masks, three stormed the rear of the house while one, armed with a large machete, blocked the front door. This video can not be played Milton Keynes house party murders: Mothers speak of their loss Ben Gillham-Rice was stabbed six times, including through the heart, while prosecutor Charlotte Newell said Dom Ansah received 47 injuries before later dying in hospital. Two other people were seriously injured. Dom Ansah, top right, slipped as he tried to run from his attackers and suffered 47 injuries Sentencing, Mr Justice Spencer called them ""senseless and tragic"" killings that came about through a ""culture of violence and knives"" promoted through social media. The judge said Dom Ansah had been a ""leading member"" of M4. He added that ""it was through his association with Dom Ansah, albeit not a member of the gang himself, that Ben Gilham-Rice was at the party that night with M4 gang members"". Addressing Potter, the judge said: ""I have no doubt that your motivation related to the traumatic experience of the assault you had suffered yourself at the hands of M4 two years earlier. But that did not begin to justify your participation in these murders."" Clayton Barker, of Surrey Road in Bletchley, was jailed for a minimum of 28 years Charlie Chandler, of Fitzwilliam Street in Bletchley, was jailed for a minimum of 27 years Earl Bevans, of no fixed address, was jailed for a minimum of 27 years Ben Potter, of Chiswick Close in Westcroft, Milton Keynes, was detained for a minimum of 22 years Jamie Chandler, of Woodrush in Beanhill, Milton Keynes, was detained for a minimum of 22 years Ben's mother Suzanne Gillham said she had felt ""physically sick"" being so close to her son's killers during the court case. She called the use of knives ""cowardly"" and added that she ""was hoping to see some remorse on the faces of the juveniles and there was none"". ""They just smirked and walked out with a smile,"" she said Tracey Ansah, Dom's mother, added: ""Every day we had to put on a mask and a brave face to look at them."" Dom Ansah told his family the names of his attackers while doctors tried to save his life at Milton Keynes Hospital Tracey Ansah said that every day she relived the night her son did not come home, and recalled getting the first phone call from one of his friends after the attack at the party. ""He was frantic, saying Dom and Ben had been stabbed and we needed to get there quickly because he thought they were going to die,"" she said. She said she went to the house with her son's twin sister Holly. ""I just needed Dom to know I was there,"" she said. At that point she rang Ben Gillham-Rice's mother Suzanne. Ben Gillham-Rice loved football, basketball, street dancing and was the ""most laid-back person you could meet,"" his family said Ms Gillham said: ""It was 12 o'clock and I was watching Kinky Boots. ""She [Tracey Ansah] was hysterical and said Ben had been stabbed. ""Tracey rang again and said they were on their way to the hospital. ""Dominic came in an ambulance, but Ben just wasn't coming."" The two boys had met at Oxley Park Academy in 2006, when they were four years old Tracey Ansah said: ""We were taken to the hospital where we were so fortunate to get three hours with him before he died. ""He had time with his sister and then he left."" Meanwhile, the moment Suzanne Gillham had been dreading arrived - a police woman told her Ben had died at the scene. ""I don't think we could understand,"" she said. ""That wasn't ever going to happen to our Ben. It couldn't. He didn't hurt people.""

"Covid patients 'could reach double April peak'The boss of NHS Wales says he us ""genuinely concerned"" about the resilience of the health service.","This video can not be played Intensive care consultant Dr Matt Morgan says the pandemic is like an ""ultramarathon"" for staff The number of patients in Welsh hospitals with Covid-19 could reach twice the number seen in April, if current trends continue. NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall said there are already almost 2,800 Covid-related patients, taking up more than a third of all hospital beds. His warning comes amid rapid increases in cases in north Wales. The number of critical care patients in one north Wales hospital has doubled since Christmas Eve. Speaking at a press conference, NHS Wales chief executive Dr Goodall said the number of Covid-related patients in hospital was 4% higher than last week and is the highest on record. ""If this trend continues, very soon the number of coronavirus related patients in hospital will be twice the peak we saw during the first wave in April,"" he said. This video can not be played This map shows the pattern of death rates involving Covid-19 by week since the pandemic began Two health boards are close to 50% of their beds occupied by Covid-related patients. Dr Goodall said he was ""genuinely concerned"" about the resilience of the health service. ""We are not able to deliver a complete range of NHS services with such high rates of coronavirus in our communities or hospitals,"" he said. Easing Christmas Covid rules 'makes no sense' New variant blamed for Wrexham Covid spike Party plea as hospital Covid cases hit new levels An intensive care consultant at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, said the Welsh NHS could be facing its ""hardest month"" since it was established in 1948. Dr Matt Morgan said: ""January will be the hardest month in the pandemic so far and possibly the hardest month in the 73 years since Aneurin Bevan started the NHS"". ""That's not just about ICUâ¦ it's for the whole hospital system."" This video can not be played Cases risk being double the first peak warns Welsh NHS chief Dr Andrew Goodall More patients are in critical care across Wales than during the peak of the first wave in April. Dr Richard Pugh, of Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighsire, said fatality rates were rising, with 40% of Covid patients needing intensive care not surviving. He told Radio Wales Breakfast: ""Our unit is essentially full and the number of patients in north Wales has doubled since Christmas Eve."" Dr Richard Pugh: People are very tired and exhausted Dr Pugh, who is also head of the Welsh Intensive Care Society, said patients were arriving in critical care sicker than at any other time in the pandemic. ""Wales was not in a robust position going in to coronavirus. We are already maxed out in terms of our capacity and the cases keep coming."" In Glan Clwyd, half the patients in critical care are there because of Covid, he said, and they included previously healthy younger people. ""I've looked after patients in their thirties who've previously been fit and well,"" the specialist said. ""And people in their 40s and 50s who've unfortunately succumbed to coronavirus."" Across the six north Wales counties, only Gwynedd has seen a decrease in infection rates over the last seven days, and is the only north Wales county under 100 cases for 100,000 population. But Dr Pugh added: ""I have concerns that in north-west Wales, it won't be long before we're seeing a rise again unfortunately."" Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Wales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Atherton said the situation in parts of north Wales was very serious. ""There are signs cases are rising in many parts of the country,"" he said. ""In north Wales, in particular, we are seeing quite rapid increases in Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire."" He said this was a result of the new variant strain of the virus and ""too much population mixing"". Dr Atherton said around 70% of Covid-19 cases in north Wales are related to the fast-spreading variant of the virus - he said the region was a ""hotspot"" for the variant. There were 140 people being treated on invasive ventilated beds, including in critical care, for confirmed or suspected coronavirus on Tuesday. This is the highest number since 20 April, just after the peak, which saw 164 patients in critical care with Covid. Cardiff and Vale had 34 patients in critical care or on invasive ventilation. These are the highest numbers it has seen since mid-April There were 29 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, 25 critical patients in Swansea Bay, 20 in Betsi Cadwaladr hospitals - the highest since mid-May, 19 in Aneurin Bevan - where there were no vacant critical care beds - and 13 in the Hywel Dda area. The number of recovering patients in hospital - those too sick to go home due to the effects of Covid - is at a record of nearly 1,000 patients. A third of these are in Cwm Taf Morgannwg. There were also 55 new cases of Covid linked to hospital infection within the health board in the week up to 3 January, according to Public Health Wales. Dr Pugh believed it was too early to tell what the impact of mixing at Christmas might be but was ""grateful"" the Welsh Government had reduced the relaxation in mixing rules from five days to one. He highlighted the strain the pandemic was having on staff. ""People are putting on a brave face. It's been a difficult time and people are very tired and exhausted,"" he said. ""I often catch colleagues who are close to the edge at work and the end isn't quite in sight yet.""

Covid-19: Welsh Government updateDetails and reaction to a briefing by Wales' chief medical officer and the head of NHS Wales.,"Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton and NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall have been giving a Welsh Government briefing on the pandemic The number of patients in Welsh hospitals with Covid-19 could reach twice the number seen in the peak last April, Dr Goodall says Another 76 people have died with Covid-19 in Wales, taking the official total to 3,738, according to Public Health Wales There are calls for clarity for university students in Wales, after students in England were told not to return to college until mid-February Some children are being denied access to a laptop for home-schooling during lockdown because of means testing, a charity says Swansea University researchers say they are developing the world's first coronavirus 'smart patch', to inject the vaccine and monitor its effect Prime Minister Boris Johnson wishes Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens a 'full and speedy recovery' as she remains in hospital with coronavirus Nicola Bryan and Andy Roberts That's all from our live coverage of today's updates from the Welsh Government and Public Health Wales. Here are the main developments:  Thanks for joining us - you can keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Lockdowns have worked before,but can we expect the new one to do the same? It feels like we are back in March or April last year, when the strict controls on all our lives led to a fairly quick decline in levels of coronavirus. But one of the crucial differences this time is the new variant, which is thought to spread between 50 and 70% faster than previous forms of the virus. Experts warn there are now no guarantees that lockdown will be enough to bring the variant under control. ""It still would not have been easy, but it would have been a much easier situation if it had not been for the new variant,"" Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told Inside Health. ""That really pushes the bounds of our ability to control the spread of the virus, even with measures that were previously relatively quite effective."" Travellers to the UK from abroad couldsoon be required to prove they have had a negative coronavirus test. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the measure is one of several being considered to ""prevent the spread of Covid-19 across the UK border"". ""Additional measures, including testing before departure, will help keep the importation of new cases to an absolute minimum,"" the department added. It is thought that haulage drivers coming through ports would be exempt. However, the DfT said full details are still to be agreed and will be set out in ""due course"". Any such measure would be a devolved issue, so the the DfT would need to agree a path forward with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to make it UK-wide. Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant has called on Boris Johnson to prioritise communities such as his for coronavirus vaccines. He said Rhondda Cynon Taf had the highest
rate of death per 100,000 of any local authority, a ""very large
percentage"" of people who are extremely vulnerably, and a ""higher
than average percentage"" of NHS workers. He asked the prime minister to prioritise
areas like Rhondda and ensure surgeries there ""are not just getting 70
or 80 doses of vaccine a week, but hundreds"". Mr Johnson said many people in Rhondda would ""naturally fall into the high qualifying groups"". Wales currently receives its allocation of
the vaccine based on its UK population share, and the Welsh Government has said it will follow a list of priority groups in delivering the jabs. The Welsh Government needs to have âa clear planâ on the delivery of vaccines, Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones has said. âWe think vaccines are giving us hope but we need a clear plan, a clear public idea, from the Welsh Government on exactly how that is going to be rolled out and to which priorities,"" she told BBC Wales. âWe need some action to address what seems to be differences from region to region on vaccinesâ. Ms Jones also urged the Welsh Government to change its position on students returning to universities, saying it was ""completely untenable"". ""Students from England are being told to stay at home until mid-February, while those studying in universities in Wales are being offered a phased return starting next week. ""No wonder many students do not know what to do for the best."" The NHS in Wales could be facing the âhardest monthâ since it was set up in 1948. The stark warning came from Dr Matt Morgan, an Intensive care consultant at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. âLetâs not sugar-coat it, January already is such a hard monthâ, he told BBC Wales. âJanuary will be the hardest month in the pandemic so far and possibly the hardest month in the 73 years since Aneurin Bevan started the NHS. âThatâs not just about ICUâ¦itâs for the whole hospital system."" However, he added: ""There is hope - we will get through this."" Clap for Carersis to return under a new name of Clap for Heroes, the initiative's founder has said. The weekly applause for front-line NHS staff and other key workers ran for 10 weeks during the UK's first coronavirus lockdown last spring. Founder Annemarie Plas tweeted that it would return at 20:00 GMT on Thursday. She said she hoped the initiative would ""lift the spirit of all of us"" including ""all who are pushing through this difficult time"". Allow Twitter content?

There are hopes the new year could herald a new dawn in the fight against coronavirus after a second vaccine began its roll-out on Monday. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine comes after one created by Pfizer BioNTech was given the go-ahead at the start of December. But when can people expect to receive the jab? The Welsh Government has said it will work through a list of priorities, starting with elderly residents of care homes and those who work there, front-line health and social care workers, and anyone over the age of 80. A Plaid Cymru MP has accused the UK Government of ""wilful misrepresentation"" by announcing this week that Wales would get Â£227m in ""additional funding"" due to the pandemic. It comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was providingnew funding to support business grants in Englandon Tuesday. The Treasury said this meant extra money would be given to the administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Wales Office Minister David TC Davies also tweeted: ""This announcement from the Chancellor means an extra Â£227m in funding for Wales."" But it was later clarified that this was part of the Â£5.2bn extra funding already guaranteed for Wales as part of the latest funding top-up announced on 23 December. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said he was sorry if this had not been made clear. However, Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader Liz Saville Roberts said the Treasury announcement ""deliberately misinforms desperate businesses in Wales"". She was rebuked by Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle for her use of the word ""wilful"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The total number of Covid deaths since the start of the pandemic now stands at 3,738, figures from Public Health Wales (PHW) show. This map shows the number of deaths announced by each of Wales' health boards. The chief executive of the Welsh NHS says he is âgenuinely concernedâ about the resilience of the service in the face of coronavirus. Dr Andrew Goodall added that there were âplans and preparations to respondâ to rising numbers of Covid cases but added there would be an âimpact on other servicesâ. He said: âWe are obviously managing the normal operational pressures of winter - we would not normally be responding to those pressures with 2,800 beds occupied by patients with Covid. âThese patients are staying longer than our typical emergency patients who will come into the system, so we are genuinely concerned about the resilience of the NHS system. âWe do have the plans and preparations to respond, but it comes with impact on other services and other access points for our patients in Wales."" Dr Goodall added: âThis is going to be a very challenging and difficult period of time ahead of us."" The number of cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 people over the most recent seven-day periodincreased in each local authority area in the latest figures. Bridgend continues to have the highest rate of any Welsh council area, and had 978.1 cases per 100,00 people over the week between Boxing Day and New Year's Day. It was followed by Wrexham (838.5), Merthyr Tydfil (717.8), Newport (611) and Flintshire (598.3). Gwynedd (73.1) remains the only local authority in Wales with a rate of less than 100 cases per 100,000 people. The overall case rate in Wales stands at 484.3. Wales will see a noticeable ""increase in activity"" in January of Covid vaccination, NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says. He stressed that although the NHS has experience in delivering vaccinations it's never been done to ""a whole population to these types of timescales"". ""But there is a very significant commitment and ambition from the NHS to be able to step up to this, to protect the world's population, and of course to ensure that we can move through those cohorts [priority groups] as well"", Dr Goodall said. ""We will see increasing volumes of activity taking place, certainly as those supplies materially and visibly increase during the month of January."" Wales' Chief Medical Offier Dr Frank Atherton added that the NHS is ""going to go as fast as we can"" on vaccination. Closing nurseries in Wales would cause âa crisis in the workforceâ for the essential workers who rely on them, the chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton was addressing a question about why the decision had been made to close schools but not nurseries. On Monday it was announced thatall schools and colleges in Wales would need to move to online learning until 18 January. Speaking to journalists, Dr Atherton said that many essential workers in Wales were reliant on nursery provision. ""If we were to close all the nurseries then we would really have a crisis in the workforce - not just in healthcare but in social care and beyond,"" he said. Wales' chief medical officer has defended plans to extend the gap to 12 weeks between doses of the Covid vaccines. Wales and the rest of the UK will give both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs. The British Medical Association has raised concerns about the plan. But Dr Frank Atherton said: âI donât share that concern."" He said it was âreally important get the first dose into as many people as possibleâ. Wales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said the ""evidence so far"" is that there is not a risk that the new variant of coronavirus, now spreading rapidly in the UK, is not as responsive to the current vaccines. He said the evidence is that ""the antibody response to the vaccines does cover both the original virus and the variant virus"". ""Of course, there's also a T-cell immunity, so there's both types of immunity, we believe, that work with the new variant as well as the original virus,"" he said. Dr Atherton said there was ""always a risk over time that new variants will emerge and that they'll be 
less susceptible and less amenable to vaccine control"". He said in the future the approach may need to be similar to that with flu, where people are ""protected by different vaccines over time"". Dr Atherton said that was an issue ""for the future"" and that the ""pressing need now is to deal with the virus that we know we have and get the vaccine rolled out as quickly as we can"". The UK Government has beencriticised for announcing Wales would get Â£227m in ""additional funding"" on Tuesday. The funding is part of Â£5.2bn already guaranteed since the beginning of the pandemic as a result of extra spending in England, and is not new cash. On Tuesday the Chancellor Rishi Sunak announcednew funding to support business grants in England. Wales minister David TC Davies tweeted on Tuesday: ""This announcement from the Chancellor means an extra Â£227m in funding for Wales."" Labour Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said there was not a ""single extra penny for Wales"". It was later clarified that the Â£227m for Wales was part of the Â£5.2bn extra funding already guaranteed for Wales as part of the latest funding top-up announced on 23 December. Conservative Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said he was ""sorry"" if this had not been clear. There are 140 people with coronavirus in critical care, NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says. He added: âThis is the highest we have seen during this second wave. âIntensive care units are under enormous pressure at the moment. âOur critical care capacity is operating at almost 140% of its normal occupancy. âWe can expand it further, but this means other clinical services are disrupted. Dr Goodall said ""difficult choices"" were being made as services and staff were ""stretched"". There is no evidence that the new covid variant causes a more serious illness, Wales' Chief Medical Office Dr Frank Atherton says. But he said the Welsh Government was worried because it was ""so infectious and can be easily passed from person to personâ. âEven with restrictions in place, this new strain appears to be driving an increase in cases across the UK and could be the reason why we are seeing more people being admitted to hospital,â Dr Atherton said. âItâs one of the reasons why the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and I agreed to raise the risk level for the UK on Monday night to the highest level."" Dr Atherton said the chief medical officers were âvery concernedâ about the health serviceâs ability to handle a further sustained rise in of coronavirus cases. He said that without further action, âthere is a material risk of the NHS being overwhelmed over the next 21 days, in several areas of the UKâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

Teachers' grades will replace exams in England,"Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He told MPs he would ""trust in teachers rather than algorithms"", a reference to the U-turn over last year's exams. For primaries, he confirmed there would be no Year 6 Sats tests this year. Mr Williamson promised parents it would be ""mandatory"" for schools to provide ""high-quality remote education"" of three to five hours per day. He said this would be ""enforced"" by Ofsted, with inspections where there were ""serious concerns"" about what was provided for children now studying at home. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, accused Mr Williamson of ""chaos and confusion"" - and said he had failed to listen to the ""expertise of professionals on the front line"". She said he had given a ""cast-iron commitment"" that exams would go ahead - and Ms Green said: ""At that moment, we should have known they were doomed to be cancelled."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams this week Mr Williamson, in a statement to the House of Commons, said there would be ""training and support"" for teachers in estimating grades, ""to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently"". He also told MPs there would be no Sats tests for those at the end of primary school. ""I can absolutely confirm that we won't be proceeding with Sats this year. We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a ""vague statement"" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a ""dereliction of duty"" that it was not already prepared. And he warned against repeating the ""shambles"" of last summer's cancelled exams. Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say students Northern Ireland cancels GCSEs and A-levels Exams cancelled in England's latest lockdown Vocational exams allowed to go ahead The big exam U-turn of the summer The education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown. The exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places. Simon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered. A consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner. Last year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades. And without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates. On vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was ""failing to show leadership on exams in January"". Vocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion. If students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have ""enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression"", says the awarding body Pearson. An Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, ""to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances"". The exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades. Mr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. Education Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday. Scotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers. GCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November.

Greggs faces first loss for 36 years amid lockdown,"Greggs expects up to a Â£15m loss for the year, which would be its first annual loss since it listed its shares on the stock exchange in 1984. The bakery chain said it does not expect profits to return to pre-Covid levels until 2022 at the earliest. It has been battling a sales slump due to the coronavirus pandemic, but sales declines have been lessening. Greggs made 820 job cuts at the end of last year, after its sales were hit by coronavirus lockdowns and restrictions. Chief executive Roger Whiteside said the impact of the Covid-19 crisis had been ""enormous"" and that a fresh lockdown meant ""significant uncertainties remain in the near term"". Coronavirus restrictions towards the end of last year led to ""variable trading conditions across the UK"", he said. Sales in the final three months of the year fell by nearly a fifth, but this decline was less than its sales slump in the third quarter. In September, Greggs, which is based in Newcastle, said it was in talks with staff to cut hours in an effort to minimise job losses. But it still decided to cut 820 jobs because of ""lockdown levels of business"" as High Streets were hit by the crisis. ""Looking ahead, the significant uncertainty over the duration of social restrictions, along with the impact of higher unemployment levels, makes it difficult to predict performance,"" the firm said. ""However, we do not expect that profits will return to pre-Covid levels until 2022 at the earliest."" Greggs said on Wednesday that total sales for the year were down nearly a third to Â£811m, but government support had helped to limit pre-tax losses. It said it had developed its takeaway business and a delivery tie-up with Just Eat, and had also seen ""strong sales"" through its partnership with retailer Iceland. ""We have taken action to position Greggs to withstand further short-term shocks and are optimistic about our prospects for growth once social restrictions are lifted,"" Mr Whiteside added. Greggs wants to open about 100 new stores, on a net basis, over the year ahead. Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency consultants Begbies Traynor, said: ""The latest national lockdown will be unwelcome news for Greggs, which has operated shrewdly during the past year in spite of a lack of footfall, with non-essential stores forced to close and millions working from home. ""The bakery chain has had to adapt its business model and invest digitally to accommodate for the rapid change in shopping habits, offering click-and-collect purchases, as well as a nationwide delivery service through its partnership with Just Eat. ""This should provide a solid base for the business to expand when government restrictions are eased and the world returns to some normality."" What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now?

'Very little' virus risk at nurseries - minister,"Vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi suggested nursery children were not spreading the virus Nursery schools present ""very little risk"" and are Covid-safe, vaccine minister Nadhim Zahawi has said, as he defended keeping them open. Mr Zahawi contrasted nurseries with schools, which were closed because they had been ""vectors for the new variant"". Early years providers have called for mass testing and for their staff to be prioritised for vaccination. The Unison union called for nurseries to close to all but vulnerable children and those of key workers. Announcing the national lockdown for England on Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised: ""Everyone will still be able to access early years settings such as nurseries."" In Scotland and Northern Ireland, nurseries are closed along with other schools. But in Wales they also remain open. 'Scared' nursery staff turn up for work Lockdown: 'Nurseries feel like an afterthought' Why are nurseries still open this time around? One nursery owner in Weston-super-Mare, Somerset, told the BBC that a prolonged closure carried the risk of going out of business but said it was hard to reassure staff on safety when he did not have ""any of the facts"". ""I've come in this morning and I've got staff crying and saying they are scared of this new variant,"" said Paul Trauberman, of the Rainbow Smiles nursery. The Early Years Alliance, which represents nursery providers, said most nurseries wanted to stay open but do not feel confident they have the support and protection they need. Some which share sites with schools have been given discretion to close by the government guidance and some others have independently decided to shut, the alliance said. ""If the government wants the sector to remain open, it must now put forward specific evidence about the risks of doing so, including the rates of transmission of the new variant of Covid-19 in early years settings - not just for children but also for adults working there,"" said chief executive Neil Leitch. The alliance is calling for mass testing at nurseries and priority access to vaccines for their staff - they say many are aged over 50. By Smitha Mundasad, BBC health reporter In general, a child's risk of becoming seriously ill from the virus is tiny and considerably less than an adult's. That has remained true throughout the pandemic. And younger children have had the lowest admission rates to hospital compared to all other age groups. The advice that will have steered the government towards keeping nurseries open is that younger children are also considered to be less likely to pass on coronavirus than older children. In the Sage minutes from 22 December, the government scientific advisers say the ""closure of secondary schools [is] likely to have a greater effect than closure of primary schools"". The concern is that it is older children - particularly teenagers - who may be able to pass the virus on even without symptoms - and drive it further into communities. Unison backed the call for vaccine priority and mass testing, but said nurseries should be shut, alongside schools across the UK, to protect staff and communities. The union's head of education Jon Richards said: ""Social distancing is impossible with young children and the government has yet to publish the scientific evidence to justify ânurseries being treated differently to schools."" Emma, a nursery worker in South Cambridgeshire, told the BBC: ""Everybody at the nursery feels let down. We feel as though we have been kicked to one side."" She said when children develop symptoms, staff have to stay with them until their parents can pick them up for self-isolation. ""Many members of staff are putting their lives at risk on a daily basis,"" Emma said. Asked about concerns from staff about keeping early years education open, Mr Zahawi told BBC Breakfast: ""It's the right thing to do."" TEACHERS:Are they are at risk with schools reopening? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:How do I get a virus test? He said that at nurseries with the very youngest children ""there is very little risk"". ""The nursery sector has taken tremendous care in making sure the premises are Covid-safe,"" he added. Moving education at primary and secondary schools online for all but the children of key workers and those deemed vulnerable was ""a last resort"", the minister said. He said: ""The schools are safe but they can act as vectors for the new variant which is much more transmissible in community settings."" In the House of Commons, Labour MP Paula Barker asked Education Secretary Gavin Williamson why nurseries were staying open, saying she had been ""inundated"" with queries from concerned parents and staff. Mr Williamson said evidence from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) found that early years education had a smaller impact on transmission rates than primary schools. Bristol mother-of-three Eleni Franklin said she could see the case for treating schools and nurseries differently, having seen only one case at her daughter's nursery, while her older child's school had experienced several. Kara Willetts, from Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, said her three-year-old daughter ""really suffered"" from isolation during the first lockdown. She said she had full confidence in her nursery's Covid measures.

Post-primary transfer tests cancelled in NIIt comes as schools close until mid-February as part of efforts to stem the surge in coronavirus cases.Northern Ireland,"Transfer tests are used to select pupils by the majority of NI grammar schools Post-primary transfer tests have been cancelled in Northern Ireland amid a Covid-19 surge. The decision was announced just four days before thousands of pupils were due to sit the first of a series of exams on Saturday. The tests are used to select pupils by the majority of NI grammar schools. It comes as schools are likely to shut until after the half-term break in mid-February as part of efforts to stem the soaring number of coronavirus cases. Northern Ireland is in the second week of a six-week lockdown in which non-essential retail is closed. With more than 12,000 new cases of Covid-19 over the last seven days,further restrictions are comingand Stormont ministers are meeting later to discuss them. Parents angry at 'eleventh hour' move on tests On Tuesday, the Department of Health reported a further 1,378 people had tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours. There have also been 18 more Covid-19 related deaths. The number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK hastopped 60,000 for the first timesince the pandemic started. According to government figures on Tuesday, the number of people who have tested positive reached 60,916. COVIDCare NI Mobile App is now providingdaily updates of the latest statistics related to coronavirus,external. The transfer tests are run by the Association for Quality Education (AQE) and the Post Primary Transfer Consortium (PPTC). The AQE tests were due to go ahead on 9, 16 and 23 January. The PPTC test was due to take place on Saturday 30 January with a supplementary test on Saturday 6 February. LIVE: Follow rolling coverage of Tuesday's coronavirus news Stay-at-home order set to be given legal force NI Covid-19 restrictions: Your questions answered In a statement to BBC News NI, AQE said the tests would not take place in January due to the executive's decision to close schools. It said it would now consult with the 34 grammar schools that use its tests about a way forward. Schools in England, Scotland and Wales have also been closed to most pupils The PPTC said an expected announcement by the executive that schools would move to remote learning for many pupils until late February meant their tests would not proceed. ""If no pupils are able to sit the Entrance Assessment on 30 January 2021 because of Covid restrictions, and these restrictions would not have ended before 6 February 2021 then PPTC will be unable to provide an assessment for any pupils,"" said a PPTC statement. ""The responsibility falls on PPTC schools to ensure that their admissions criteria cover this contingency. ""PPTC accept that this decision may be disappointing to many children who would have welcomed the opportunity to take the assessment."" Some grammar schools had already outlined how they would admit pupilsusing ""Covid-19 criteria"" if transfer tests were cancelled. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, whose party Sinn FÃ©in is opposed to the transfer test, was among those who had been calling for the exams to be cancelled. Shetweeted,external: ""The decision to cancel transfer tests due to take place this week is welcome. ""This year has been emotionally and mentally challenging enough for children without the burden of these exams. ""DUP minister now needs to provide clarity on other exams."" Colin Torrens, principal of Lisnagelvin Primary School in Londonderry, said the decision to cancel at such a late stage was ""shocking"" but it was the right decision. ""Children have been put through 12 months of all that hard work only to have it all called off at the last minute,"" he said. ""They have worked over Christmas, they have worked over holidays and this really should have all been sorted in May."" The executive is to meet later to discuss more Covid-19 restrictionsincluding arrangements for schools. The Department for Education (DE) is proposing many pupils should switch to remote learning for a prolonged period. But schools will be expected to remain open to admit vulnerable children and the children of key workers. It is also likely that nursery schools and pre-school settings will close although they are likely also to be asked to admit vulnerable children and the children of key workers. But whether special schools should remain open to all pupils is among the measures as yet undecided, BBC News NI understands. Ms O'Neill saiddetails of what the executive agreed on Mondaywould be formalised at an executive meeting on Tuesday, where the health and education ministers will bring separate papers. Ministers are then due to brief the Northern Ireland Assembly on Wednesday. Northern Ireland's Education Minister Peter Weir had previously announceda staggered return to school for pupilsduring the month of January. Schools in England, Scotland and Wales are closed to most pupils, and the government in the Republic of Ireland is considering a proposal to close schools for the rest of January. Alternative arrangements for GCSE, AS, A-level and vocational exams will also be discussed by the executive on Tuesday. There have already been a number of changes, includingfewer exams and reduced content in many courses. However, the government in England announced on Tuesday that GCSE and A-level exams would be cancelled there. It is not yet clear what alternative arrangements will be put in place in England, with the Education Minister Gavin Williamsonto make an announcement on that on Wednesday. The Scottish and Welsh governments announced last month that they would scrap the exams in 2021. Justin McCamphill, of teachers' union the NASUWT, said the education minister should scrap GCSEs and A-level exams in Northern Ireland. ""If GCSEs and A-levels can't run in England I really don't see why they would continue to run here,"" said Mr McCamphill. ""We are not going to be looking at a level playing field and it would not be good for our young people if they were being judged by a different system than children across the rest of UK.""

Mr Sharp spent 23 years working for the banking giant and was reportedly Chancellor Rishi Sunak's boss there. He has recently been acting as an unpaid economic adviser to Mr Sunak during the coronavirus pandemic. His new role will see him lead negotiations with the government over the future of the licence fee. The licence fee is due to stay in place until at least 2027, when the BBC's Royal Charter ends, with a debate about how the broadcaster should be funded after that. The government is currently reviewing whether its cost, currently Â£157.50, should continue rising with inflation from 2022, and whether non-payment should remain a criminal offence. BBC chairman warns over subscription fee What changes will 2021 bring for the media? Mr Sharp's career at Goldman Sachs culminated as chairman of its principal investment business in Europe before his departure in 2007. He was then on the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee for six years until 2019. As an advisor to the Treasury about its pandemic response, the 63-year-old reportedly played a key role in the Â£1.57bn arts rescue package, and the film and television production restart scheme. Mr Sharp is a former donor to the Conservative party. He was chairman of the Royal Academy of Arts from 2007 to 2012, and founded the charity London Music Masters. Sir David Clementi, the current BBC chairman, steps down in February. The post-holder is officially appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the government. Julian Knight, the chair of the DCMS Committee, said in a statement: ""It is disappointing to see this news about the next BBC chairman has leaked out ahead of a formal announcement from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The Committee previously expressed some concerns over the appointments process, calling for it to be fair and transparent. ""The DCMS Committee looks forward to questioning the preferred candidate for the post in a pre-appointment hearing next week on their views at a critical time for the BBC about its role and the future of public service broadcasting more generally."" His views on the BBC itself are unknown. But like new director general Tim Davie, who he met a few weeks before Christmas, he has a commercial background. Just as the relationship between Lord Hall, Davie's predecessor, and Sir David was strong, so the bond between the new DG and chair will be critical. Whether Sharp supports the licence fee as the pillar of a future BBC settlement is unclear. The last time the BBC's future was negotiated with a sceptical Conservative government, the relationship between the director general and the chancellor - then George Osborne - was critical, as Lord Hall explained to mein his exit interview. This time, Davie will go into that negotiation with a very close ally of the current chancellor - though Sharp's first duty is to support Davie, and the BBC, and not his old mentee.

Born in Memphis, Tennessee, Dickey started out as a software developer in the aerospace industry. Being laid off from that job gave him a chance to take writing classes and see whether he could make it as an author. He emerged during a boom for African-American literature in the 1990s, and his 1996 debut Sister, Sister - about the lives and loves of three siblings - was recently named one ofthe 50 Most Impactful Black Books of the Last 50 Years by Essence magazine,external. He was particularly praised for his ability to write ""believable"" female characters, and many of his readers were women. When the New York Times profiled him in 2004,external, it billed him as the ""chick lit king"". Patrik Henry Bass, Essence's books editor, told the paper: ""He is singular in the way he is tapping into the African-American female psyche."" And Calvin Reid, an editor at trade magazine Publishers Weekly, said: ""He captures black language and black middle-class characters with more depth than you often see in commercial fiction."" By that time, he was selling 500,000 books a year. He was nominated four times for the NAACP Image Award for best work of fiction, winning in 2015 for A Wanted Woman. By then, he had branched out into stories of crime, suspense, thrills and spills as well as the steamy and tangled relationships with which he made his name. He had four daughters, but said he never based his plots on his own life. ""I avoid my life,"" he once said. ""It bores me. Trust me. A book about me would be a snoozefest."" His final novel, The Son of Mr Suleman, will be published in April. At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Teachers' grades will replace exams in EnglandGavin Williamson says cancelled A-levels and GCSEs will be replaced by grades from teachers.Family & Education,"Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson. He told MPs he would ""trust in teachers rather than algorithms"", a reference to the U-turn over last year's exams. For primaries, he confirmed there would be no Year 6 Sats tests this year. Mr Williamson promised parents it would be ""mandatory"" for schools to provide ""high-quality remote education"" of three to five hours per day. He said this would be ""enforced"" by Ofsted, with inspections where there were ""serious concerns"" about what was provided for children now studying at home. Labour's Shadow Education Secretary, Kate Green, accused Mr Williamson of ""chaos and confusion"" - and said he had failed to listen to the ""expertise of professionals on the front line"". She said he had given a ""cast-iron commitment"" that exams would go ahead - and Ms Green said: ""At that moment, we should have known they were doomed to be cancelled."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson cancelled exams this week Mr Williamson, in a statement to the House of Commons, said there would be ""training and support"" for teachers in estimating grades, ""to ensure these are awarded fairly and consistently"". He also told MPs there would be no Sats tests for those at the end of primary school. ""I can absolutely confirm that we won't be proceeding with Sats this year. We do recognise that this will be an additional burden on schools Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said rather than a ""vague statement"" of how A-levels and GCSEs would be graded, ministers should already have a system ready in place - and it was a ""dereliction of duty"" that it was not already prepared. And he warned against repeating the ""shambles"" of last summer's cancelled exams. Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say students Northern Ireland cancels GCSEs and A-levels Exams cancelled in England's latest lockdown Vocational exams allowed to go ahead The big exam U-turn of the summer The education secretary confirmed to MPs that GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown. The exams watchdog Ofqual will draw up proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, for qualifications that could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places. Simon Lebus, the watchdog's interim head, said evidence for replacement grades could include tests, homework, mock exams and teachers' observations - and would take into account how much of the syllabus had been covered. A consultation is expected to begin next week, with plans to be decided by the end of February or possibly sooner. Last year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades. And without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' assessments, with some process of moderation between schools, will be used for this summer's candidates. On vocational qualifications, Labour's Ms Green said the education secretary was ""failing to show leadership on exams in January"". Vocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them - but college leaders had complained that there needed to be a national decision to avoid confusion. If students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will still be awarded a grade, if they have ""enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression"", says the awarding body Pearson. An Ofqual spokeswoman said they would consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, ""to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances"". The exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades. Mr Williamson's statement in the Commons came as all GCSE, AS and A-level exams in Northern Ireland were  cancelled due to the Covid-19 crisis. Education Minister Peter Weir announced the decision in the Stormont assembly on Wednesday. Scotland has already cancelled its Nationals, Highers and Advanced Highers. GCSEs  and A-levels in Wales were scrapped in November.

Bosses 'earn average worker's salary in 34 hours',"Bosses of Britain's biggest companies will earn more in the first three days of this week than the average worker's annual wage, research claims. By 17:30 GMT on Wednesday, the pay of FTSE 100 chiefs will have overtaken the Â£31,461 annual median wage for full time workers, the High Pay Centre says. Bosses' pay was flat last year, while average wages generally rose slightly. That meant that FTSE chief executives had to work 34 hours to beat median annual pay, not the 33 hours in 2020. The High Pay Centre think-tank based its annual calculations on analysis of disclosures in companies' annual reports, combined with government statistics. High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said chief executive pay is about 120 times that of the typical UK worker, up significantly from two decades ago. ""Estimates suggest it was around 50 times at the turn of the millennium or 20 times in the early 1980s,"" he said. ""Factors such as the increasing role played by the finance industry in the economy, the outsourcing of low-paid work and the decline of trade union membership have widened the gaps between those at the top and everybody else over recent decades."" He said the figures should raise concern about the governance of Britain's biggest companies. ""They should also prompt debate about the effects that high levels of inequality can have on social cohesion, crime, and public health and wellbeing,"" he said. Median FTSE 100 chief executive pay was Â£3.61m in 2019, the last year for which a full set of data is available, the High Pay Centre said. The centre said its analysis was based on chief executives' average working day being 12 hours. However, critics said such analysis just fuels the politics of envy without looking at why chief executives matter and the contribution they make. Daniel Pryor, head of programmes at the Adam Smith Institute, said: ""Good management is more important than ever in a globalised world and small differences in top talent make a big impact on a business' bottom line. ""That bottom line makes a big difference to workers across the UK, anyone with a private pension, and shareholders."" He pointed out that there is strong, if morbid, evidence about chief executive deaths that shows why the corporate and investment world believe leadership makes a huge difference to the fortunes of their companies. ""In the past 60 years, unexpected CEO deaths have consistently affected stock price, profitability, investment and sales growth - for better or worse,"" he said, adding: ""Which is why it makes sense for firms to open their wallets to attract the best talent.""

Just some of the terms used by members of Congress to describe those who invaded the seat of US government on Wednesday. This video can not be played The words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot The storming of the US Capitol building in Washington DC stunned viewers around the world. But how did Americans feel seeing the seat of their government being ransacked? A new US citizen, a diehard Trump supporter, an anti-Trump Republican and a young Black Lives Matter protester - all members of our BBC voter panel - weighed in. Read what they said. Almost 60 Democratic members of the US House of Representatives have backed new articles of impeachment against the Republican president over Wednesday's unrest. Congresswoman Ilhan Omar said in a tweet on Thursday that dozens of lawmakers had offered their support to the resolution that she and other members, including Rashida Tlaib, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Cori Bush, had prepared.

Donald Trump, who leaves office on 20 January, was impeached by the Democratic-held House in 2019 after he was accused of abusing his power and obstructing Congress. He was acquitted by the Republican-led Senate. Leading Democrats have also called for the president to be removed under the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. It would require Vice-President Mike Pence and at least eight cabinet members to break with Mr Trump and invoke the amendment - something they have so far seemed unlikely to do. In a short press briefing that ran less than two minutes, White House press secretary Kayleigh McEnany condemned the armed insurrection at the US Capitol ""in the strongest possible terms"". Speaking ""on behalf of the entire White House"", she called the violence ""appalling, reprehensible and antithetical to the American way"". McEnany left the briefing room without taking any questions. President Trump has not been seen in public today and his social media accounts remain suspended. Washington DC's top prosecutor has not ruled out the possibility that the president himself could be investigated over the Capitol riot. Acting attorney general for the District of Columbia, Michael Sherwin, said ""all actors"" will be looked at. Asked whether this included Trump, Sherwin responded: âWeâre looking at all actors here and anyone that had a role and, if the evidence fits the elements of the crime, theyâre going to be charged."" The president had urged his supporters at a rally outside the White House to march on Congress, while pushing unfounded claims of electoral fraud. As events spiralled out of control, he tweeted urging them to ""remain peaceful"". The Association of Flight Attendants - a labour union that represents nearly 50,000 air crew - says it is ""taking a hard line for flight safety"" after problems aboard several flights to Washington DC. Citing the Capitol riot and the possibility that some participants might soon be flying back home, AFA President Sara Nelson suggested the culprits should be banned from planes. ""Acts against our democracy, our government, and the freedom we claim as 
Americans must disqualify these individuals from the freedom of flight."" In a video that went viral on social media, Trump supporters on a packed flight to the DC area heckled Senator Mitt Romney with chants of ""Traitor"". Trump's former chief of staff, John Kelly, has said he would vote to remove the president from office if he were still part of the cabinet. ""Yes, I would,"" Kelly, who served under Trump from 2017-18, told CNN's Jake Tapper in an interview on Thursday. ""The one thing we have going for us here, Jake, is that it's only 13 more days"", he added in reference to Biden's inauguration on 20 January. Wednesday's invasion of the Capitol has revived political talk of removing Trump from office via a constitutional amendment. Here's our explainer: What is the 25th Amendment? Allow Twitter content?

Today, the Senate's top Democrat joined voices calling for Trump's presidential powers to be removed immediately after his supporters violently stormed the US Capitol on Wednesday. Under the 25th Amendment, the vice-president can become acting president when a president is unable to continue his duties, if for example, he or she becomes incapacitated due to a physical or mental illness. The part of the amendment being discussed is section four, which allows the vice-president and a majority of the cabinet to declare President Trump unable to perform his duties. Find out more about the 25th Amendment here. The day before she died, Ashli Babbitt wrote on social media about the gathering of Trump supporters in the US capital. ""Nothing will stop us,"" she wrote. ""They can try and try and try but the storm is here and it is descending upon DC in less than 24 hours."" Babbitt, 35, was among the mob that breached the US Capitol on Wednesday. She has been identified by US Capitol Police as one of four people who died amid the chaos. A veteran of the US Air Force, Babbitt served two tours in Afghanistan and Iraq before later deployments with the National Guard to Kuwait and Qatar, her ex-husband, Timothy McEntee, told US media. A native of San Diego, California, Ms Babbitt had recently remarried, and worked at a pool service company with her husband, Aaron Babbitt. On social media, Babbitt described herself as a libertarian and patriot. She posted frequently about President Trump, expressing ardent support for him and echoing his unproven claims of wide-scale voter fraud. ""She had a personality that you either loved or hated,"" McEntee told NPR. ""She wasn't apologetic about it... she was proud of it, just like she was proud of her country and proud to be an American."" Read the full story here. Former First Lady Michelle Obama said Wednesday's events at the US Capitol ""desecrated the centre of American government"". In a lengthy statement released on social media, Obama said: ""Seeing the gulf between the responses to yesterday's riot and this 
summer's peaceful protests and the larger movement for racial justice is
 so painful. It hurts."" Decrying the sight of ""the traitorous flag of the Confederacy"", she lamented the ""cracked skulls and mass arrests"" that she said had been seen at Black Lives Matter protests. ""Millions voted for a man so obviously willing to burn down our democracy for his own ego,"" she said. She called on social media platforms to ""stop enabling this monstrous behaviour"" and permanently ban Trump. Obama also urged people to engage in ""the uncomfortable, sometimes painful process"" of ""putting America back together"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

As violent Trump supporters surged past barricades and into the US Capitol, news agency photographers - who were there to document the vote certifying Joe Biden's election win - captured extraordinary scenes. The last time government buildings were breached in Washington was in 1814 and the invaders were British soldiers. But in 2021 a Trump supporter, carrying the Confederate flag, is walking freely through the halls near the entrance to the Senate, encountering little resistance. Another image showed a rioter holding a podium bearing the seal of the Speaker of the House, while a third showed a man with a boot on the desk of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. Yesterday's riots took place at the US Capitol - one of the country's most important buildings. It's the area of Washington DC - the capital city of the United States - where Congress is situated. This is where the US government writes, debates and passes laws. The Hill is centred around the US Capitol building - the main location protesters broke into. This is where elected officials in the Senate and the House of Representatives sit when debating and voting on laws, making up the upper and lower chambers of Congress. As well as these chambers, there are other office buildings where lawmakers and their staff work and meet to do their business. Find out more here. With his ban on Facebook and Instagram extended, President Donald Trump was notably absent on Wednesday as the US took stock of yesterday's events at the Capitol. According to the White House, one of his tasks for the day included presenting the country's highest civilian award, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, to three golfers - among them Babe Zaharias, who was honoured posthumously. Annika Sorenstam and Gary Player also received the honour. If you're just joining our live coverage, here are the top stories of the day so far: The
 US is reeling after supporters of President Trump stormed the Capitol 
building in Washington DC on the day Congress was meeting to confirm Joe
 Biden's election victory. Lawmakers
 were forced to take shelter, the building was put into lockdown and 
four people died in the chaos that followed a pro-Trump rally near the 
White House. Here's a breakdown of how events unfolded on Wednesday. Nga PhamBBC News South Vietnam flags were seen during the unrest On Wednesday, as protesters gathered outside before
swarming the Capitol building, the
yellow flags of the old South Vietnam regime could be seen. In fact, the yellow flags of the former South Vietnam are a common sight at
pro-Trump rallies across the United States. Vietnamese Americans, especially those of the older generation who fled Vietnam after
Saigon fell in 1975, are known for their support for the Republican party and
Donald Trump. A pre-election survey by the group Asian and Pacific Islander
American Vote found thatVietnamese Americans are the only major East Asian ethnic community that favoured Trump over Biden,external. Trumpâs anti-China and anti-communist rhetoric resonated greatly with the former refugees who risked their lives to escape
communism. But the support
for President Trump has also become an increasingly divisive issue amongst the
Vietnamese American community. Hours after the
Capitol riot, there are still calls on pro-Trump internet forums like
the ""ABC Trump"" Facebook page for Vietnamese Americans to âtake to
the streets in support of President Trumpâ as âthe battle
continuesâ. But there have also been condemnations. âThis is embarrassing,â
one young Vietnamese American wrote on Twitter, adding: âTheyâve brought shame to
the flagâ. Frank GardnerBBC Security Correspondent Saudi Arabia has been a close ally of the Trump administration Jihadist supporters of both the Islamic State group (IS) and al-Qaeda have been celebrating online the scenes of chaos and violence in Washington. The extremists and proponents of violent jihad - who view the US as their number one enemy - have been sharing images and videos from Capitol Hill, mocking American democracy and expressing hope that division will spread across the country. There was no immediate comment from either groupâs leadership on their official media outlets. The events will have deeply worried Americaâs allies in the Middle East, for whom the US acts as a security guarantor. Saudi Arabiaâs leaders, who had a close relationship with the Trump administration and who waited days before congratulating President-elect Joe Biden, will now be hoping for a period of calm. Sergeant-at-arms Paul Irving, who was responsible for maintaining law and order in the US House of Representatives, has resigned. His resignation was announced by Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi at her press conference moments ago. The top Democrat also said that she is calling for the resignation of Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund, who she says has not spoken to her on the phone once since violence was unleashed on the Capitol yesterday. Earlier today, her counterpart in the Senate, Chuck Schumer, said he would fire the Senate's sergeant-at-arms once Democrats become the majority in the chamber. Members of the Washington DC National Guard protect the Capitol on Wednesday night At a press conference earlier, Washington DC's mayor described yesterday's protests as ""textbook terrorism"" and ""an affront to democracy"". Mayor Muriel Bowser, a Democrat, squarely blamed Trump for inciting the violence seen yesterday. During the press conference, police also identified all four people that died during the chaos. Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old military veteran from California, was shot by a plainclothes Capitol police officer, according to Washington DC Police Chief Robert Contee. Benjamin Phillips, 50, Kevin Greeson, 55, and Rosanne Boyland, 34, also died after suffering ""medical emergencies"", he said. The three travelled from Pennsylvania, Alabama and Georgia respectively. This video can not be played Pelosi: 'President incited armed insurrection against US' Top Democrat Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the House of Representatives, is giving a news conference now where she says she has a message for Trump's cabinet members. ""Do they stand by these actions? Are they ready to say for the next 13 days that this dangerous man can do more harm to our democracy?"" Pelosi goes on to say that the House may be forced to file of articles of impeachment due to Trump's recent ""seditious acts"". ""Although it's only 13 days left, any day could be a horror show,"" she tells reporters. Pelosi adds that Democrats are contacting her, demanding another attempt to remove Trump from office. To remind you, Trump has already been impeached once, by the Democrat-led House in December 2019 over allegations he improperly sought help from Ukraine to boost his chances of re-election. If impeached again, he would be the first president in US history to be impeached twice. ""My phone is exploding with 'impeach impeach impeach',"" she says. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Ramsay leads tributes to culinary 'legend' RouxGordon Ramsay remembers late chef Albert Roux as ""the man who installed gastronomy in Britain"".Entertainment & Arts","Albert Roux pictured in the kitchen of Le Gavroche in 1989 Chef and restaurateur Albert Roux, who brought great French cooking to the UK with his brother Michel, has died at the age of 85. The pair made gastronomic history in 1982 when their London restaurant, Le Gavroche, became the first in Britain to earn three Michelin stars. Albert's death comes almost a year afterMichel died at the age of 78. Gordon Ramsay, one of many leading chefs who earned their stripes in Le Gavroche's kitchen, led the tributes. ""So so sad the hear about the passing of this legend, the man who installed Gastronomy in Britain,""Ramsay wrote on Instagram.,external Marco Pierre White, Marcus Wareing, Pierre Koffman and Monica Galetti are among the other chefs who rose through the ranks at Le Gavroche.

A family statement said: ""The Roux family has announced the sad passing of Albert Roux, OBE, KFO, who had been unwell for a while, at the age 85 on 4th January 2021. ""Albert is credited, along with his late brother Michel Roux, with starting London's culinary revolution with the opening of Le Gavroche in 1967."" His son Michel Roux Jr, who now runs Le Gavroche and is a former judge on MasterChef: The Professionals, said: ""He was a mentor for so many people in the hospitality industry, and a real inspiration to budding chefs, including me.""

Albert and Michel Roux came from a family of butchers in eastern France, and trained to be patissiers before moving to the UK. Albert arrived in the mid-1950s, and in 1967 put his Â£3,000 savings with money borrowed from friends to open the first Gavroche off Sloane Square in Chelsea. With uncompromising standards, elaborate presentation and first-rate service, it raised the standards of haute cuisine in a then-limited English restaurant scene. It moved to Mayfair in 1981, and soon became the first British-based establishment to carry the maximum three Michelin stars. ""An Olympic gold medal,"" Albert said at the time. ""I have had no other ambition.""

The brothers also launched the Roux Scholarship, an annual chef competition, in 1983, with many scholars having gone on to win Michelin stars themselves.

Democrats poised to seize control of US SenateThe party of President-elect Joe Biden is narrowly ahead in two run-off elections in Georgia.,"This video can not be played If confirmed, Mr Warnock will be the first black senator for the state of Georgia The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia. Pastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other. If they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda. He said it was ""time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity"". Follow our live updates from Georgia and Congress The election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win. None of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. Why Georgia wins would be huge for Biden Who is Georgia's Reverend Raphael Warnock? Georgia election: Trump voter fraud claims and others fact-checked With 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. Mr Warnock's and Mr Ossoff's positions have been boosted by Joe Biden's presidential election win in Georgia Control of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off. Mr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. He serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached. Claiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said. If both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives. Mr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years. A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. Final results are expected later on Wednesday. The margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler. Edison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. More than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? More than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Although the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers. The two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency. If it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state. But Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state. It turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate.

'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before',"The US is facing another huge election - one that could define how much new president Joe Biden can get done in his first term. More than 100 people are gathered in the grey and damp cold in Stone Mountain. It's a miserable start to the New Year but this city near Georgia's capital, Atlanta, feels anything but sleepy or hung over. Voter Jonathan Gardner has turned up early. ""The energy we get here in Georgia is something I've never seen before,"" says Mr Gardner, who was born and raised in local DeKalb County. ""We've had other Senate races and I'm just excited."" He is joined by fellow Democratic supporters who are singing and dancing outside a house-turned-campaign centre. It's to rally support for the two men who are probably President-elect Joe Biden's most important friends right now: Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock. Georgia Democratic Senate candidates Rev Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff This traditionally Republican state was won by Mr Biden in November's election - but there were no clear winners for the state's two Senate seats. Now there is a run-off between the top candidates in each race. If the two Democrats, Mr Ossoff and Rev Warnock, beat incumbent Republicans David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, Mr Biden's party effectively controls the Senate. Shirley Shepphard is handing out stickers, with a smile and confidence. ""The Democrats can win! Yes we can, yes we can, yes we can!"" she says. There's a huge cheer as Mr Ossoff's large blue bus makes its way down the road and pulls up opposite the house. He is only 33 years old and, in case his youth wasn't clear enough, he makes a point of jogging on to the small stage. During a polished speech he exclaims: ""The place we demand better is at the ballot box."" If Mr Ossoff wins, he'd be the youngest member of the Senate - a title once held by Joe Biden himself. Why is the Georgia election so important? No pressure, but I put to him that the fate of Mr Biden's presidency is in his hands. If he loses, is Mr Biden a weakened president before he's even begun? Without missing a beat, Mr Ossoff says: ""We will win."" Fellow Democrat and Senate candidate Mr Warnock could make history alongside him. He could become Georgia's first black senator, in a state that has a higher proportion of black people than any other in the US. Rallies have been held for all four candidates, including this one featuring the US vice-president Georgia has also found itself becoming the final battleground for an aggrieved President Donald Trump. The Republican Senate candidates here - Mr Perdue and Ms Loeffler - are his last foot soldiers. Both appeared at his rally the previous night, where he focused on repeating his unsubstantiated claims of election fraud. ""There's no way we lost Georgia, that was a rigged election,"" were the first words out of his mouth. ""We run all over the world telling people how to run their elections and we don't even know how to run ours."" Mr Trump has also gone after Georgia's Republican governor and begged another official here, in an astonishing phone call, to find votes to overturn Mr Biden's victory. The president has also called the Georgia Senate races ""invalid and illegal"" without any evidence. There are concerns from some Republicans he's putting people off voting on Tuesday. I asked supporters at Trump's rally why they would take part in an election process if they didn't believe it was fair. Some hesitated and suggested it was their civic duty. For those who won't vote, it's an advantage that may work for the Democrats. When I ask two Ossoff and Warnock supporters about the claims of election fraud, both women throw their heads back, burst into a long laugh in perfect unison and shake their heads bemused: ""Yeah, that's a good one."" There's another factor in this runoff - teenagers. Valerie Ponomarev, 18, is a first-time voter Since the 3 November presidential election, more than 23,000 people will have turned 18 in the state and can now vote in this Senate race. Many young voters have been holding live-streaming events in counties across Georgia. Valerie Ponomarev just turned 18 and is very excited at getting to vote. She was upset she couldn't cast a ballot in the recent presidential election. ""I did the math in my head and was short by a month as I was born in December,"" she says. ""I was mad at my mum that I hadn't been born sooner!"" She said at first, she didn't even realise the Senate runoff was so crucial in Georgia. She's voting for the Democrats, Ms Ponomarev says, adding that a lot of younger people have shown support for Mr Ossoff. ""I think the youth finally want representation in government because we're so often underrepresented and now that we have Jon Ossoff who is closer to our age,"" she says. Michael Guisto found himself in the same situation as Ms Ponomarev - too young to cast a ballot in November - and says missing out on that vote was painful. ""It feels like a redemption,"" he says of this Senate race. The polls are suggesting it's a very tight race. But this state knows that whatever it decides, it will have an impact on the country as a whole. Mr Guisto says even though he missed out on the November election, this vote matters. ""I get to in some ways influence the country but this time it's a bit closer to home.""

Hospital's ICU patients 'doubled since Christmas',"This video can not be played Intensive care consultant Dr Matt Morgan says the pandemic is like an ""ultramarathon"" for staff The number of patients in Welsh hospitals with Covid-19 could reach twice the number seen in April, if current trends continue. NHS Wales boss Dr Andrew Goodall said there are already almost 2,800 Covid-related patients, taking up more than a third of all hospital beds. His warning comes amid rapid increases in cases in north Wales. The number of critical care patients in one north Wales hospital has doubled since Christmas Eve. Speaking at a press conference, NHS Wales chief executive Dr Goodall said the number of Covid-related patients in hospital was 4% higher than last week and is the highest on record. ""If this trend continues, very soon the number of coronavirus related patients in hospital will be twice the peak we saw during the first wave in April,"" he said. This video can not be played This map shows the pattern of death rates involving Covid-19 by week since the pandemic began Two health boards are close to 50% of their beds occupied by Covid-related patients. Dr Goodall said he was ""genuinely concerned"" about the resilience of the health service. ""We are not able to deliver a complete range of NHS services with such high rates of coronavirus in our communities or hospitals,"" he said. Easing Christmas Covid rules 'makes no sense' New variant blamed for Wrexham Covid spike Party plea as hospital Covid cases hit new levels An intensive care consultant at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff, said the Welsh NHS could be facing its ""hardest month"" since it was established in 1948. Dr Matt Morgan said: ""January will be the hardest month in the pandemic so far and possibly the hardest month in the 73 years since Aneurin Bevan started the NHS"". ""That's not just about ICUâ¦ it's for the whole hospital system."" This video can not be played Cases risk being double the first peak warns Welsh NHS chief Dr Andrew Goodall More patients are in critical care across Wales than during the peak of the first wave in April. Dr Richard Pugh, of Glan Clwyd Hospital in Bodelwyddan, Denbighsire, said fatality rates were rising, with 40% of Covid patients needing intensive care not surviving. He told Radio Wales Breakfast: ""Our unit is essentially full and the number of patients in north Wales has doubled since Christmas Eve."" Dr Richard Pugh: People are very tired and exhausted Dr Pugh, who is also head of the Welsh Intensive Care Society, said patients were arriving in critical care sicker than at any other time in the pandemic. ""Wales was not in a robust position going in to coronavirus. We are already maxed out in terms of our capacity and the cases keep coming."" In Glan Clwyd, half the patients in critical care are there because of Covid, he said, and they included previously healthy younger people. ""I've looked after patients in their thirties who've previously been fit and well,"" the specialist said. ""And people in their 40s and 50s who've unfortunately succumbed to coronavirus."" Across the six north Wales counties, only Gwynedd has seen a decrease in infection rates over the last seven days, and is the only north Wales county under 100 cases for 100,000 population. But Dr Pugh added: ""I have concerns that in north-west Wales, it won't be long before we're seeing a rise again unfortunately."" Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing on Wednesday, Wales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Atherton said the situation in parts of north Wales was very serious. ""There are signs cases are rising in many parts of the country,"" he said. ""In north Wales, in particular, we are seeing quite rapid increases in Wrexham, Flintshire and Denbighshire."" He said this was a result of the new variant strain of the virus and ""too much population mixing"". Dr Atherton said around 70% of Covid-19 cases in north Wales are related to the fast-spreading variant of the virus - he said the region was a ""hotspot"" for the variant. There were 140 people being treated on invasive ventilated beds, including in critical care, for confirmed or suspected coronavirus on Tuesday. This is the highest number since 20 April, just after the peak, which saw 164 patients in critical care with Covid. Cardiff and Vale had 34 patients in critical care or on invasive ventilation. These are the highest numbers it has seen since mid-April There were 29 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, 25 critical patients in Swansea Bay, 20 in Betsi Cadwaladr hospitals - the highest since mid-May, 19 in Aneurin Bevan - where there were no vacant critical care beds - and 13 in the Hywel Dda area. The number of recovering patients in hospital - those too sick to go home due to the effects of Covid - is at a record of nearly 1,000 patients. A third of these are in Cwm Taf Morgannwg. There were also 55 new cases of Covid linked to hospital infection within the health board in the week up to 3 January, according to Public Health Wales. Dr Pugh believed it was too early to tell what the impact of mixing at Christmas might be but was ""grateful"" the Welsh Government had reduced the relaxation in mixing rules from five days to one. He highlighted the strain the pandemic was having on staff. ""People are putting on a brave face. It's been a difficult time and people are very tired and exhausted,"" he said. ""I often catch colleagues who are close to the edge at work and the end isn't quite in sight yet.""

Democrats poised to seize control of US Senate,"This video can not be played If confirmed, Mr Warnock will be the first black senator for the state of Georgia The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia. Pastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other. If they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda. He said it was ""time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity"". Follow our live updates from Georgia and Congress The election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win. None of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. Why Georgia wins would be huge for Biden Who is Georgia's Reverend Raphael Warnock? Georgia election: Trump voter fraud claims and others fact-checked With 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. Mr Warnock's and Mr Ossoff's positions have been boosted by Joe Biden's presidential election win in Georgia Control of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off. Mr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. He serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached. Claiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said. If both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives. Mr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years. A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. Final results are expected later on Wednesday. The margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler. Edison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. More than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? More than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Although the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers. The two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency. If it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state. But Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state. It turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate.

Developing 'world's first' vaccine smart patch,"This video can not be played Covid: Can smart patches give coronavirus vaccine? The first coronavirus vaccine 'smart patch' is being developed at a Welsh university, researchers say. The disposable device uses micro-needles to both administer the vaccine and monitor its efficacy by measuring the body's immune response. A prototype will be developed by the end of March in the hope it can be put forward for clinical trials. Swansea University researchers aim to make the device commercially available within three years. The project received Welsh Government and European funding as part of the global response to the pandemic, though it it hoped it can be used to treat other infectious diseases. Micro-needles administer the vaccine and monitor the body's immune response The smart patches' millimetre-long micro-needles, made from polycarbonate or silicon, will penetrate the skin to administer a vaccine and held in place with a strap or tape for up to 24 hours. It will simultaneously measure a patient's inflammatory response to the vaccination by monitoring biomarkers in the skin. The device is then scanned, providing a data reading that can be used to understand the efficacy of the vaccine and the body's response to it. How does the Pfizer/ BioNTech Covid vaccine work? What is the Oxford vaccine and how does it work? Dr Sanjiv Sharma says work on the smart patch could be expanded to other infectious diseases Dr Sanjiv Sharma, a senior lecturer in medical engineering at Swansea University, said the body's production of immunoglobulins are ""good markers"" of showing the efficacy of vaccination. Immunoglobulins are antibodies which form a critical part of our immune defences. Dr Sharma said: ""What we expect in response to the self-administration of this vaccine patch is to see the production of immunoglobulins, which the device will be able to detect. ""This low-cost vaccine administration device will ensure a safe return to work and management of subsequent Covid-19 outbreaks. ""Beyond the pandemic, the scope of this work could be expanded to apply to other infectious diseases as the nature of the platform allows for quick adaption to different infectious diseases."" He said there are no other devices commercially available which provide this function, though are similar to ""continuous glucose monitoring sensors"" used by people with diabetes. What progress are we making on Covid treatments? Covid vaccine update: When will others be ready? Benefit to those 'scared of needles' PhD student Olivia Howells said the device is a cheaper alternative to hypodermic needles PhD student, Olivia Howells, said the device could benefit people who are scared of needles and injections. ""They do not penetrate as deeply into the skin and they do not stimulate the pain receptors, so they're less painful than a hypodermic needle,"" she said. Ms Howells said the patches are a cheaper alternative to hypodermic needles, which could also help countries ""which don't have huge resources for vaccine rollout"". The team at the university's IMPACT research centre hope to carry out human clinical studies on the transdermal delivery of the vaccine in partnership with Imperial College London.

Neil Young sells song rights in '$150m' deal,"An investment firm has bought 50% of the rights to all Neil Young's songs. Hipgnosis Songs Fund spent an estimated $150m (Â£110m) on 1,180 songs written by the Canadian folk rocker. The fund, which lets people invest in hit songs, has previously splashed out about Â£1bn snapping up rights to songs from the likes of Mark Ronson, Chic, Barry Manilow and Blondie. Founded by music industry veteran Merck Mercuriadis, Hipgnosis turns music royalties into an income stream. Bob Dylan sells song rights to UMG All I want for Christmas is... 33,000 songs Can hit songs be worth more than gold? ""This is a deal that changes Hipgnosis forever,"" said Mr Mercuriadis. ""I bought my first Neil Young album aged seven. Harvest was my companion and I know every note, every word, every pause and silence intimately. ""Neil Young, or at least his music, has been my friend and constant ever since."" Hipgnosis has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since July 2018. When songs owned by the fund get played on the radio or placed in a film or TV show, it makes money. Before setting up Hipgnosis, Mr Mercuriadis managed artists such as BeyoncÃ©, Elton John, Iron Maiden and Guns 'N' Roses. In his view, songs are ""as investible as gold or oil"". He says hit songs are a stable investment because their revenue is unaffected by fluctuations in the economy. The sale of song catalogues has become a booming business during the Covid-19 pandemic, with investors seeing music as a relatively stable asset in an otherwise turbulent market. Earlier this week, Hipgnosis bought 100% of the rights to Lindsey Buckingham's 161 songs for an undisclosed amount. The songs include hits that Buckingham wrote or co-wrote for Fleetwood Mac, including Go Your Own Way and The Chain. The group's Stevie Nicks sold 80% of her publishing rights last year to Hipgnosis rival Primary Wave for about $80m. Last month, Universal Music Group announced it had bought 100% of Bob Dylan's 600 songs for between an estimated $200m and $450m (Â£150m-Â£340m). The singer-songwriter was the latest of a number of artists to join up with the Los Angeles-based Universal, following other big names such as Bruce Springsteen, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone. Neil Young rose to prominence in the 1960s and 70s and is one of the most influential songwriters of all time. He is known not only for his work as a solo artist, but also with the bands Buffalo Springfield, Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Young has released almost 50 studio albums and more than 20 live albums, of which 18 have been certified gold, seven are platinum and three are multi-platinum. Seven of his albums were included on Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time chart: Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, After The Gold Rush, DÃ©jÃ  Vu (with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Harvest, On The Beach, Tonight's the Night and Rust Never Sleeps. ""I built Hipgnosis to be a company Neil would want to be a part of,"" said Mr Mercuriadis. ""We have a common integrity, ethos and passion born out of a belief in music and these important songs. ""There will never be a 'Burger of Gold', but we will work together to make sure everyone gets to hear them on Neil's terms.""

"Lockdown won't end 'with a bang', PM warns","This video can not be played The prime minister says schools will be the first places to reopen The end of England's lockdown will not happen with a ""big bang"" but will instead be a ""gradual unwrapping"", Boris Johnson has told MPs. The prime minister made the comments in the Commons ahead of a retrospective vote later on the lockdown measures. He said the legislation runs until 31 March to allow a ""controlled"" easing of restrictions back into local tiers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's decisions ""have led us to the position we're now in"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were now 30,074 patients with coronavirus in UK hospitals. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. It came as the UK reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus,the highest daily death toll since April. Clap for Carers to return for new lockdown Can lockdown stop the new variant? The UK's new lockdown rules explained In a statement to the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new variant had ""led to more cases than we've seen ever before"" and that this had left the government with ""no choice but to return to national lockdown"". He said the legislation ran until the end of March ""not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis"". He said this would happen ""brick-by-brick... without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us"". But in response to MPs' questions, he said there was a ""cautious presumption"" that restrictions could start being eased from mid-February. ""And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping,"" he added. This video can not be played ""We need a plan"", Keir Starmer told MPs while declaring Labour would support new lockdown Under the measures, which came into force legally on Wednesday, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, for exercise outdoors only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close. Police have the powers to enforce the new restrictions with a Â£200 fine for each breach, doubling on every offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400 - and a Â£10,000 penalty for mass gatherings. Officers in London arrested at least a dozen people in Parliament Square after a protest against the new measures on Wednesday. The need to debate and vote on the restrictions means the Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. With Sir Keir saying Labour will support the motion, the measures are expected to pass with ease. The restrictions will be kept under ""continuous review"", Mr Johnson added, with a statutory requirement to reconsider them every two weeks. Addressing the closure of schools, the PM said ""we did everything in our power to keep them open as long as possible"" and that was why schools were the ""very last thing to close"". They would be the ""very first thing to reopen"" after lockdown - that could be after the February half term - but ""we must be very cautious"" about the timetable, he said. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams would be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades. ""This year, we're going to put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms,"" he said, referencing controversy overthe way exam grades were awardedto some students last year. All national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are now cancelled, Mr Williamson confirmed. He said every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week. The prime minister wasted no time in emphasising the ""fundamental difference"" between this and previous lockdowns. To keep opposition from his own MPs at bay he needs to demonstrate that the government's aim to vaccinate the most at-risk groups by mid-February is viable. He is also under pressure to give a sense of how quickly restrictions might be lifted after that. The course of the pandemic has changed swiftly at times, though, and may do so again, so it's unlikely we'll get any firm new timelines from Boris Johnson today. Most Conservative backbenchers seem resigned to the need for this new national lockdown and agree the prime minister had ""no choice"" but to act. But MPs on all sides are impatient to hear how soon things may start returning to something like life as normal at last. Mr Johnson said unlike in March last year, during the first lockdown, vaccines offered ""the means of our escape"". But he said there was now a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. ""After the marathon of last year, we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Every needle in every arm makes a difference."" Earlier, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""confident"" the government would meet its ""ambitious"" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a ""significant increase"" in the number of people who have received the jab. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK hadbeen vaccinatedso far. Mr Zahawi also said nursery schools presented ""very little risk"", are Covid-safe and hedefended the decision to keep them open during England's lockdown. People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half-term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League football can continue Responding to the prime minister's statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party will support the new restrictions and urged people to comply with them. ""The virus is out of control, over a million people in England now have Covid, the number of hospital admissions is rising, tragically so are the numbers of people dying,"" he said. ""It's only the early days of January and the NHS is under huge strain. In those circumstances, tougher restrictions are necessary."" But he added ""this is not just bad luck, it's not inevitable, it follows a pattern"" of the government being slow to respond. ""These are the decisions that have led us to the position we're now in - and the vaccine is now the only way out and we must all support the national effort to get it rolled out as quickly as possible.""

Medics' fears over change to Covid vaccination plan,"Doctors in Scotland have raised concerns about plans to delay the second dose of the Pfizer vaccine. All four UK nations will now leave up to 12 weeks between the first and second doses of the jab rather than giving both within 21 days. Dr Lewis Morrison, head of the BMA in Scotland, said members had concerns about the potential impact of leaving such a big gap between the two doses. But the UK's chief medical officers havedefended the move. They said that the first dose of either the Pfizer or the Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccines - the only two so far approved for use in the UK - will give people substantial protection against the virus within two to three weeks of being administered. And they said that the second dose was ""likely to be very important for duration of protection, and at an appropriate dose interval may further increase vaccine efficacy"". Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? Scotland hopes to accelerate vaccine rollout 12-week vaccine gap defended by UK medical chiefs The Joint Committee of Vaccination and Immunisation, which advises UK health departments and recommended the new strategy, said data showed that one dose of the Pfizer vaccine would be ""90% effective"". But the World Health Organization (WHO) has said it would not recommend following the UK's decision to delay giving the second Pfizer dose, saying there was no evidence to support the decision. Pfizer has said it has tested the vaccine's efficacy only when the two doses were given up to 21 days apart. The Pfizer vaccine was the first to be approved for use in the UK, with more than a million people having already been given the first dose. The change to the vaccination strategy has meant health boards have had to change plans and cancel people booked in for their second doses of the Pfizer jabs. This includes medics who are among the priority groups for Covid vaccinations. Dr Lewis Morrison, chairman of the British Medical Association's Scottish Council, raised concerns about the logistical impact of changing the vaccination strategy Dr Morrison told the BBC's Good Morning Scotland programme that some doctors had told him they would have waited for the AstraZeneca jab, which has been proven to work in the longer timetable, if they had known the second Pfizer dose was going to be delayed. He said: ""We are concerned because there's clearly disagreement about the effectiveness of the second dose of Pfizer after that period of time. ""Furthermore I think if you give more people the first dose when you don't know what vaccine supplies are going to be within that 12-week window, that's a worry that has been expressed to me by a lot of doctors. ""If we give more people the first dose, do we definitely know that the second one is coming? ""The announcement about this before a four-day NHS holiday weekend left many places with great difficulty in reorganising vaccinations, with a real risk that vaccination numbers might perversely drop because of the organisational issues."" Opposition parties want the Scottish government to publish daily figures for how many people have been vaccinated It comes as NHS staff were left queueing for hours outside Glasgow Royal Infirmary on Tuesday after an ""scheduling error"" meant vaccination staff did not turn up. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde has apologised to those affected and said it was rearranging the appointments. The Scottish government has said it aims to have given at least one vaccine dose to everyone over the age of 50 and younger people with underlying health conditions by the start of May. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said on Tuesday that the timetable could be accelerated if there were sufficient supplies of the jab. The Scottish government is being pressured to provide daily figures on the number of people being vaccinated, as the UK government has already pledged to do. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross said: ""There are now no excuses left for the SNP government to dodge publishing daily vaccination rates alongside the daily infection numbers as soon as possible. ""The SNP's evasion to try and avoid scrutiny is nothing new but on something so important, the Scottish public must have the same information as will be provided across the UK."" His call was echoed by Scottish Labour health spokeswoman Monica Lennon, who added: ""It is simply unacceptable that scores of NHS staff were left queueing outside in the cold for hours, and well into the evening. ""It's time for Health Secretary Jeane Freeman to get to grips with the vaccination programme, publish daily figures on the number of vaccinations available and administered, and ensure that our NHS staff do not pay the price of a bungled rollout.""

England's new national lockdown becomes law,"London's Regent Street, normally packed with people and traffic, is deserted England's third national lockdown has legally come into force, with MPs set to vote retrospectively on it later. The measures, which include,externala stay-at-home order and the closure of schools to most pupils, were announced by the prime minister on Monday. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. On Tuesday the number of new daily confirmed cases of Covid in the UKtopped 60,000 for the first time. And it is thought one in 50 people in private households in England had the virus last week - rising to one in 30 in London. Figures fromthe Office for National Statistics,externalalso suggested more than one million people in England had Covid between 27 December and 2 January. At a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had ""no choice"" but to impose the new lockdown, with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak. He would not guarantee that all children would be back in school before the summer holidays but insisted he was full of ""optimism and fundamental hope"" that things would be different in the spring. The need to debate and vote on the measures means the House of Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Mr Johnson will update MPs, most of whom will not physically be in the chamber, on the new rules before the vote, which is due in the evening. The regulations, whichallow the lockdown to be in place until the end of March, are expected to pass with ease - as Labour is set to support the motion. Under the measures, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, exercise outdoors will be allowed only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close. Meanwhile, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a ""significant increase"" in the number of people who have received the jab. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK hadbeen vaccinatedso far. The government has set the target to immunise all over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February - some 13 million people - which would require around two million vaccinations a week. Mr Zahawi said he was ""confident"" the government would meet the ""ambitious"" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. ""We will make sure that community pharmacies and the independent sector are involved and that we deliver what I think is a credible plan that the NHS has put together to hit that target of 13 million vaccinations ... by mid-February,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On the same programme, Royal Pharmaceutical Society president Sandra Gidley accused the government of ignoring an ""army"" of small pharmacies. Thousands of high street chemists were ""ready, willing and able"" to help, she said. In other developments, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is to make a Commons statement later aboutthe cancellation of A-Level and GCSE exams in England. England's lockdown came into force legally overnight. But it's actually today that the measures will be brought before MPs. Any rebellion by Conservative MPs is expected to be smaller than those seen late last year on restrictions. However, some do want more of a say in the next couple of months over how long the regulations might last. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson said that by mid-February - with hopes for the vaccine rollout - there is the ""prospect"" of beginning the relaxation of some measures. But at the same news conference, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said we shouldn't ""kid ourselves"" that the virus will disappear with the spring - and suggested a ""few"" restrictions might have to be brought in next winter. People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half-term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League football can continue Elsewhere in the UK, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also announced a new lockdown on Monday - across mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gighafor the rest of January. Level three restrictions apply in the remaining areas of the nation. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December, and schools and colleges in the nationwill remain closed until at least 18 January. In Northern Ireland - which entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December - ""stay at home"" restrictionswill be brought back into law from Friday. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We've now vaccinated over 1.3m people across the UK"" The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, urged people to take the ""stay at home"" rules seriously and warned that the country is facing a ""really serious emergency"". He cited the ONS data for England as showing how widespread the virus is. ""We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,"" he said. He also said some restrictions may have to be introduced again next winter. Prof Graham Medley, a member of Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said ""we're in for a long haul"" with coronavirus. He told Today: ""Vaccination is a way out, but I think he's right to raise that possibility that there could be - next winter or even the winter after - the possibility that we will see a resurgence of Covid to such an extent that government again has to take measures to prevent another large outbreak."" That latest estimates include: One in 30 for London One in 45 for south-east England, eastern England and north-west England One in 50 for the East Midlands One in 60 for north-east England One in 65 for the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber One in 135 for south-west England Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for the government to use the lockdown to create a ""round-the-clock"" vaccination scheme in order to end ""this nightmare"". In a televised address to the nation, Sir Keir also confirmed he would back the new restrictions on Wednesday. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Ambulance service records busiest day on record,"Ambulances wait outside City Hospital in Birmingham An ambulance service has experienced its busiest day of calls on record. On Monday, West Midlands Ambulance Service dealt with 5,383 calls in 24 hours. The previous record was 5,001 calls in March 2018. Seven hundred of those calls came from London as its calls system struggled, according to BBC health correspondent Michele Paduano. The ambulance service said Covid-19 and winter weather had resulted in hospitals being ""extremely busy"". At the hosptials, the longest a patient waited was five hours and 39 minutes, with two of the longest waits at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham. A combination of Covid-19 and winter weather has resulted in hospitals being ""extremely busy"" At one point on Monday night, 15 ambulances were waiting to hand over patients outside New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton. A source told the BBC it was ""a very challenging day"" and in total, handovers had accounted for 759 hours of crews' time, equivalent to taking 63 ambulances off the road. While another said at 06:00 GMT on Tuesday, ambulances were still responding to emergency calls from the night before. Traditionally, the first Monday after New Year is always busy. GP surgeries have been closed and people wait until after the festivities to get medical treatment. This year, the number of calls was exacerbated by the service taking about 700 calls for the London ambulance service after its system struggled. There was also the perfect storm of snow and ice coupled with coronavirus - made worse because many of our trusts, particularly University Hospitals Birmingham have been struggling with capacity for many months. Usually hospitals would put patients on corridors, they can't because of Covid risks. They also have fewer beds due to wider spacing to prevent infection and fewer staff on duty. Hence patients left for hours on ambulances outside. West Midlands Ambulance Service is the best performing in the country, but even with near to 500 ambulances a day on the road, it cannot keep up with demand. Prof David Loughton, the chief executive of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, warned its capacity would ""soon be compromised"". ""The numbers are ramping up enormously and I don't think we've seen the full impact of what happened on Christmas Day yet, that will take time to come through,"" Prof Loughton said. He added a two-week ""lag"" meant things could get worst before they get better. ""As I always say today's Covid rate is my order book for intensive care in two weeks' time."" Grow up and take Covid seriously: Doctor 'Horrendous' ambulance delays at hospitals Latest news and updates for the West Midlands A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ""A combination of Covid-19 and winter weather has resulted in hospitals being extremely busy which unfortunately resulted in hospital handover delays. ""We work closely with the hospitals to try and ensure our crews are able to handover patients quickly and safely, but due to the extremely high demand some patients did wait longer to be handed over than we would normally see."" In a statement London Ambulance Service NHS Trust said : ""As is standard practice during periods of high demand and high levels of staff sickness, ambulance services provide support for each other, which includes answering 999 calls.""

"Neil Young sells song rights in '$150m' dealInvestment company Hipgnosis buys a half share of 1,180 songs by the Canadian folk rocker.","An investment firm has bought 50% of the rights to all Neil Young's songs. Hipgnosis Songs Fund spent an estimated $150m (Â£110m) on 1,180 songs written by the Canadian folk rocker. The fund, which lets people invest in hit songs, has previously splashed out about Â£1bn snapping up rights to songs from the likes of Mark Ronson, Chic, Barry Manilow and Blondie. Founded by music industry veteran Merck Mercuriadis, Hipgnosis turns music royalties into an income stream. Bob Dylan sells song rights to UMG All I want for Christmas is... 33,000 songs Can hit songs be worth more than gold? ""This is a deal that changes Hipgnosis forever,"" said Mr Mercuriadis. ""I bought my first Neil Young album aged seven. Harvest was my companion and I know every note, every word, every pause and silence intimately. ""Neil Young, or at least his music, has been my friend and constant ever since."" Hipgnosis has been listed on the London Stock Exchange since July 2018. When songs owned by the fund get played on the radio or placed in a film or TV show, it makes money. Before setting up Hipgnosis, Mr Mercuriadis managed artists such as BeyoncÃ©, Elton John, Iron Maiden and Guns 'N' Roses. In his view, songs are ""as investible as gold or oil"". He says hit songs are a stable investment because their revenue is unaffected by fluctuations in the economy. The sale of song catalogues has become a booming business during the Covid-19 pandemic, with investors seeing music as a relatively stable asset in an otherwise turbulent market. Earlier this week, Hipgnosis bought 100% of the rights to Lindsey Buckingham's 161 songs for an undisclosed amount. The songs include hits that Buckingham wrote or co-wrote for Fleetwood Mac, including Go Your Own Way and The Chain. The group's Stevie Nicks sold 80% of her publishing rights last year to Hipgnosis rival Primary Wave for about $80m. Last month, Universal Music Group announced it had bought 100% of Bob Dylan's 600 songs for between an estimated $200m and $450m (Â£150m-Â£340m). The singer-songwriter was the latest of a number of artists to join up with the Los Angeles-based Universal, following other big names such as Bruce Springsteen, Billie Eilish, Kendrick Lamar and Post Malone. Neil Young rose to prominence in the 1960s and 70s and is one of the most influential songwriters of all time. He is known not only for his work as a solo artist, but also with the bands Buffalo Springfield, Crazy Horse and Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young. Young has released almost 50 studio albums and more than 20 live albums, of which 18 have been certified gold, seven are platinum and three are multi-platinum. Seven of his albums were included on Rolling Stone Magazine's 500 Greatest Albums of All Time chart: Everybody Knows This is Nowhere, After The Gold Rush, DÃ©jÃ  Vu (with Crosby, Stills, Nash & Young) Harvest, On The Beach, Tonight's the Night and Rust Never Sleeps. ""I built Hipgnosis to be a company Neil would want to be a part of,"" said Mr Mercuriadis. ""We have a common integrity, ethos and passion born out of a belief in music and these important songs. ""There will never be a 'Burger of Gold', but we will work together to make sure everyone gets to hear them on Neil's terms."" Bob Dylan sells song rights to UMG All I want for Christmas is... 33,000 songs Blondie duo's song rights sold in 'Atomic' deal Can hit songs be worth more than gold?

"LiveLiveLockdown will help vaccine 'sprint' to beat virus, says PM5 minutes ago","MPs in the House of Commons back the government's decision to impose a lockdown across England amid surging coronavirus infections MPs approve regulations enabling the new national lockdown in England by 524 votes to 16, a majority of 508 The number of patients in UK hospitals with Covid is now above 30,000 - and 1,041 new deaths are reported, the highest daily figure since April Teachers' estimated grades will be used to replace cancelled GCSEs and A-levels in England this summer, says Education Secretary Gavin Williamson PM Boris Johnson emphasises that England's third lockdown is different from the first, saying that this will be a ""sprint"" to the finish rather than a ""marathon"" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer says the government has been ""repeatedly too slow to act"" and that has left the NHS under an unprecedented strain European regulators approves the Moderna vaccine - making it the second vaccine to be recommended for use in the EU Edited by Marie Jackson We're wrapping up our live updates on the coronavirus pandemic for now, but we will be back again on Thursday. Today's updates were brought to you by Sophie Williams, Lauren Turner, Emma Harrison, Paul Seddon, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Scott and Victoria Bisset. The page was edited by Helier Cheung, Sarah Collerton, John Hand, Suzanne Leigh and Marie Jackson. Thank you for joining us. Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?"" Dr Clarke, who is also an author, said ministers should not have ""ignored"" the independent advisory group Sage when they suggested as early as September that a ""circuit breaker"" was required  - and before Christmas to have a lockdown.

Asked by a member of the public on the BBC's Question Time programme why there appeared to be a ""lack of joined-up planning"" compared to other countries, Nadhim Zahawi highlighted the target to vaccinate just under 14 million people by the middle of February. He said: ""Between the 4 of January and the 11 January you'll see another step up.""

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection. ""It's a universal right,"" President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters news agency. ""We would do it."" He gave no details about how such a plan would be implemented, or who would  be eligible to receive a vaccine. Many undocumented migrants in the US are from Mexico. The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"". He added Johnson also ""outlined his vision for building back better from the pandemic"". Downing Street said Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Trade Secretary Liz Truss also joined the call. He said: ""The chancellor also spoke about his optimism for the UK economy in 2021 and committed to using all the levers at his disposal to drive growth across the entire UK which meets our climate ambitions."" The conversation also took in the Brexit trade deal, No 10 said, as well as the government's ""urgent ambition to unite and level up across the country by investing in education, skills, technology and infrastructure"". Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external. It says members of the public should first be encouraged to comply with the law. ""Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" it says. For participation in gatherings, fixed penalty notices start at Â£100 and can rise to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. There are fines of Â£10,000 for organisers of restricted gatherings. It also says, in addition to businesses already closed, aquariums and zoos, including safari parks and wildlife centres, are among the attractions that must close. MPs have voted to approve the law which introduced a new lockdown in England this morning. A total of 524 MPs voted in favour of the restrictions, compared to 16 who voted against. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month. Here's a closer look at the data: Itâs been a busy day so far and MPs are continuing to debate
the new lockdown in England in the House of Commons. Weâre not expecting a vote
until about 19:00 GMT, but weâll continue to bring you the latest on our live
page. Hereâs a round-up of the main coronavirus headlines in the UK:  Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne is making his criticism of lockdowns very clear in his allotted time in the Commons. He calls it a ""situation of state capture"" where the government is ""completely enthralled to a lobby driving a policy that has manifestly failed"" - slamming the ""increasing iterations of this policy with ever tighter controls and restrictions in the hope it may finally work"". After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame. ""And on that occasion at least, they will be right."" Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin correspondent The Irish government has announced a raft of measures to fight the coronavirus including school closures. Non-essential construction will also be shut down and air passengers must have negative Covid-19 PCR tests 72 hours before flying into the state. PCR tests are regarded as the ""gold standard"" of testing. The travel restriction will apply to passengers from Britain and South Africa before an anticipated extension to all visitors. The Taoiseach (Irish PM) has told a news conference that public compliance with the measures will reflect on how many people may die. MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said he expected people to ""face the coming month with steely determination and resolve."" Read the full story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Lockdown won't end 'with a bang', PM warnsBoris Johnson says there will be a ""gradual unwrapping"" of England's lockdown ahead of a vote on the plans.","This video can not be played The prime minister says schools will be the first places to reopen The end of England's lockdown will not happen with a ""big bang"" but will instead be a ""gradual unwrapping"", Boris Johnson has told MPs. The prime minister made the comments in the Commons ahead of a retrospective vote later on the lockdown measures. He said the legislation runs until 31 March to allow a ""controlled"" easing of restrictions back into local tiers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's decisions ""have led us to the position we're now in"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were now 30,074 patients with coronavirus in UK hospitals. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. It came as the UK reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus,the highest daily death toll since April. Clap for Carers to return for new lockdown Can lockdown stop the new variant? The UK's new lockdown rules explained In a statement to the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new variant had ""led to more cases than we've seen ever before"" and that this had left the government with ""no choice but to return to national lockdown"". He said the legislation ran until the end of March ""not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis"". He said this would happen ""brick-by-brick... without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us"". But in response to MPs' questions, he said there was a ""cautious presumption"" that restrictions could start being eased from mid-February. ""And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping,"" he added. This video can not be played ""We need a plan"", Keir Starmer told MPs while declaring Labour would support new lockdown Under the measures, which came into force legally on Wednesday, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, for exercise outdoors only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close. Police have the powers to enforce the new restrictions with a Â£200 fine for each breach, doubling on every offence up to a maximum of Â£6,400 - and a Â£10,000 penalty for mass gatherings. Officers in London arrested at least a dozen people in Parliament Square after a protest against the new measures on Wednesday. The need to debate and vote on the restrictions means the Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. With Sir Keir saying Labour will support the motion, the measures are expected to pass with ease. The restrictions will be kept under ""continuous review"", Mr Johnson added, with a statutory requirement to reconsider them every two weeks. Addressing the closure of schools, the PM said ""we did everything in our power to keep them open as long as possible"" and that was why schools were the ""very last thing to close"". They would be the ""very first thing to reopen"" after lockdown - that could be after the February half term - but ""we must be very cautious"" about the timetable, he said. Meanwhile, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Commons that GCSEs, A-level and AS-level exams would be cancelled this year in England, replaced by a form of teacher-assessed grades. ""This year, we're going to put our trust in teachers, rather than algorithms,"" he said, referencing controversy overthe way exam grades were awardedto some students last year. All national curriculum tests for primary school children, often known as Sats, are now cancelled, Mr Williamson confirmed. He said every school will be expected to provide between three and five hours of virtual teaching each day and that 750,000 laptop and tablet devices will have been distributed by the end of next week. The prime minister wasted no time in emphasising the ""fundamental difference"" between this and previous lockdowns. To keep opposition from his own MPs at bay he needs to demonstrate that the government's aim to vaccinate the most at-risk groups by mid-February is viable. He is also under pressure to give a sense of how quickly restrictions might be lifted after that. The course of the pandemic has changed swiftly at times, though, and may do so again, so it's unlikely we'll get any firm new timelines from Boris Johnson today. Most Conservative backbenchers seem resigned to the need for this new national lockdown and agree the prime minister had ""no choice"" but to act. But MPs on all sides are impatient to hear how soon things may start returning to something like life as normal at last. Mr Johnson said unlike in March last year, during the first lockdown, vaccines offered ""the means of our escape"". But he said there was now a race to vaccinate vulnerable people quickly, with the government setting a target of immunising the four most vulnerable groups - some 13 million people - by mid-February. ""After the marathon of last year, we are indeed now in a sprint, a race to vaccinate the vulnerable faster than the virus can reach them,"" Mr Johnson said. ""Every needle in every arm makes a difference."" Earlier, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said he was ""confident"" the government would meet its ""ambitious"" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a ""significant increase"" in the number of people who have received the jab. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK hadbeen vaccinatedso far. Mr Zahawi also said nursery schools presented ""very little risk"", are Covid-safe and hedefended the decision to keep them open during England's lockdown. People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half-term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League football can continue Responding to the prime minister's statement, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said his party will support the new restrictions and urged people to comply with them. ""The virus is out of control, over a million people in England now have Covid, the number of hospital admissions is rising, tragically so are the numbers of people dying,"" he said. ""It's only the early days of January and the NHS is under huge strain. In those circumstances, tougher restrictions are necessary."" But he added ""this is not just bad luck, it's not inevitable, it follows a pattern"" of the government being slow to respond. ""These are the decisions that have led us to the position we're now in - and the vaccine is now the only way out and we must all support the national effort to get it rolled out as quickly as possible.""

Johnson warns lockdown won't end 'with a bang',"This video can not be played The prime minister says schools will be the first places to reopen The end of England's lockdown will not happen with a ""big bang"" but will instead be a ""gradual unwrapping"", Boris Johnson has told MPs. The prime minister made the comments in the Commons ahead of a retrospective vote later on the lockdown measures. He said the legislation runs until 31 March to allow a ""controlled"" easing of restrictions back into local tiers. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the government's decisions ""have led us to the position we're now in"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock said there were now 30,074 patients with coronavirus in UK hospitals. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. It came as the UK reported a further 1,041 people have died with coronavirus,the highest daily death toll since April. Clap for Carers to return for new lockdown Can lockdown stop the new variant? The UK's new lockdown rules explained In a statement to the Commons, Mr Johnson said the new variant had ""led to more cases than we've seen ever before"" and that this had left the government with ""no choice but to return to national lockdown"". He said the legislation ran until the end of March ""not because we expect the full national lockdown to continue until then, but to allow a steady, controlled and evidence-led move down through the tiers on a regional basis"". He said this would happen ""brick-by-brick... without risking the hard-won gains that protections have given us"". But in response to MPs' questions, he said there was a ""cautious presumption"" that restrictions could start being eased from mid-February. ""And as was the case last spring, our emergence from the lockdown cocoon will be not a big bang but a gradual unwrapping,"" he added. This video can not be played ""We need a plan"", Keir Starmer told MPs while declaring Labour would support new lockdown Under the measures, which came into force legally on Wednesday, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, for exercise outdoors only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close.

Cancelled exams for England must avoid 'shambles',"There are warnings that replacement grades must avoid the problems that saw protests and U-turns last summer Head teachers have warned a replacement system for cancelled exams in England must avoid the ""shambles"" of last year's results. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is to make a statement on ""alternative arrangements"" for GCSE and A-level exams cancelled in the pandemic. This could include using teachers' estimated grades. A replacement system must not ""inflict further disadvantage on students"", says the exams watchdog Ofqual. Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union, said there were ""no easy answers"" in picking an approach - but it had to avoid repeating the ""disaster"" of last summer's cancelled exam season. He said there was a ""real need for urgency"" to allow schools time to plan - and that any system for grading had to show ""fairness and consistency"". Cancelled exams a 'big disappointment' say students Northern Ireland cancels GCSEs and A-levels Exams cancelled in England's latest lockdown Vocational exams allowed to go ahead The big exam U-turn of the summer Written papers for GCSEs and A-levels are not going ahead - after this week's decision that it was no longer feasible with so much time lost in the Covid pandemic and the latest lockdown. Mr Williamson will instruct the exams watchdog to come up with proposals for an alternative way of deciding results, which could be used for jobs, staying on in school or university places. Last year's attempts to find an alternative approach to exam results, which initially used an algorithm, descended into chaos - and eventually switched to using teachers' grades. And without any exam papers or standardised mock exams, the use of teachers' grades, with some process of moderation, is likely to be a key option once again. Vocational exams, such as BTecs, are carrying on, if schools and colleges decide to continue with them. But if students cannot take BTec exams this month as planned, they will be able to take them at a later date or otherwise still be awarded a grade, if they have ""enough evidence to receive a certificate that they need for progression"", says the awarding body Pearson. An Ofqual spokeswoman said they could consider options for replacement exam results, academic and vocational, ""to ensure the fairest possible outcome in the circumstances"". Although the process is only formally beginning, with a consultation likely on proposals, it is understood that contingency planning had already started to find a back-up if exams were cancelled. The exams watchdog's decisions will face much scrutiny - with the previous head of Ofqual resigning after last summer's U-turns over grades. ""We are discussing alternative arrangements with the Department for Education. We know that many are seeking clarity as soon as possible,"" said Simon Lebus, Ofqual's interim chief regulator.

"Ambulance service records busiest day on recordOne hospital boss said a two-week ""lag"" meant things could get worse before they get better.England","Ambulances wait outside City Hospital in Birmingham An ambulance service has experienced its busiest day of calls on record. On Monday, West Midlands Ambulance Service dealt with 5,383 calls in 24 hours. The previous record was 5,001 calls in March 2018. Seven hundred of those calls came from London as its calls system struggled, according to BBC health correspondent Michele Paduano. The ambulance service said Covid-19 and winter weather had resulted in hospitals being ""extremely busy"". At the hosptials, the longest a patient waited was five hours and 39 minutes, with two of the longest waits at the Royal Shrewsbury Hospital and Heartlands Hospital in Birmingham. A combination of Covid-19 and winter weather has resulted in hospitals being ""extremely busy"" At one point on Monday night, 15 ambulances were waiting to hand over patients outside New Cross Hospital in Wolverhampton. A source told the BBC it was ""a very challenging day"" and in total, handovers had accounted for 759 hours of crews' time, equivalent to taking 63 ambulances off the road. While another said at 06:00 GMT on Tuesday, ambulances were still responding to emergency calls from the night before. Traditionally, the first Monday after New Year is always busy. GP surgeries have been closed and people wait until after the festivities to get medical treatment. This year, the number of calls was exacerbated by the service taking about 700 calls for the London ambulance service after its system struggled. There was also the perfect storm of snow and ice coupled with coronavirus - made worse because many of our trusts, particularly University Hospitals Birmingham have been struggling with capacity for many months. Usually hospitals would put patients on corridors, they can't because of Covid risks. They also have fewer beds due to wider spacing to prevent infection and fewer staff on duty. Hence patients left for hours on ambulances outside. West Midlands Ambulance Service is the best performing in the country, but even with near to 500 ambulances a day on the road, it cannot keep up with demand. Prof David Loughton, the chief executive of the Royal Wolverhampton NHS Trust, warned its capacity would ""soon be compromised"". ""The numbers are ramping up enormously and I don't think we've seen the full impact of what happened on Christmas Day yet, that will take time to come through,"" Prof Loughton said. He added a two-week ""lag"" meant things could get worst before they get better. ""As I always say today's Covid rate is my order book for intensive care in two weeks' time."" Grow up and take Covid seriously: Doctor 'Horrendous' ambulance delays at hospitals Latest news and updates for the West Midlands A West Midlands Ambulance Service spokesman said: ""A combination of Covid-19 and winter weather has resulted in hospitals being extremely busy which unfortunately resulted in hospital handover delays. ""We work closely with the hospitals to try and ensure our crews are able to handover patients quickly and safely, but due to the extremely high demand some patients did wait longer to be handed over than we would normally see."" In a statement London Ambulance Service NHS Trust said : ""As is standard practice during periods of high demand and high levels of staff sickness, ambulance services provide support for each other, which includes answering 999 calls.""

Former banker Richard Sharp to become BBC chairman,"Former Goldman Sachs banker Richard Sharp is set to be named the BBC's next chairman, the corporation's media editor Amol Rajan says. Mr Sharp spent 23 years working for the banking giant and was reportedly Chancellor Rishi Sunak's boss there. He has recently been acting as an unpaid economic adviser to Mr Sunak during the coronavirus pandemic. His new role will see him lead negotiations with the government over the future of the licence fee. The licence fee is due to stay in place until at least 2027, when the BBC's Royal Charter ends, with a debate about how the broadcaster should be funded after that. The government is currently reviewing whether its cost, currently Â£157.50, should continue rising with inflation from 2022, and whether non-payment should remain a criminal offence. BBC chairman warns over subscription fee What changes will 2021 bring for the media? Mr Sharp's career at Goldman Sachs culminated as chairman of its principal investment business in Europe before his departure in 2007. He was then on the Bank of England's Financial Policy Committee for six years until 2019. As an advisor to the Treasury about its pandemic response, the 63-year-old reportedly played a key role in the Â£1.57bn arts rescue package, and the film and television production restart scheme. Mr Sharp is a former donor to the Conservative party. He was chairman of the Royal Academy of Arts from 2007 to 2012, and founded the charity London Music Masters. Sir David Clementi, the current BBC chairman, steps down in February. The post-holder is officially appointed by the Queen on the recommendation of the government. Julian Knight, the chair of the DCMS Committee, said in a statement: ""It is disappointing to see this news about the next BBC chairman has leaked out ahead of a formal announcement from the Department of Digital, Culture, Media and Sport. The Committee previously expressed some concerns over the appointments process, calling for it to be fair and transparent. ""The DCMS Committee looks forward to questioning the preferred candidate for the post in a pre-appointment hearing next week on their views at a critical time for the BBC about its role and the future of public service broadcasting more generally."" His views on the BBC itself are unknown. But like new director general Tim Davie, who he met a few weeks before Christmas, he has a commercial background. Just as the relationship between Lord Hall, Davie's predecessor, and Sir David was strong, so the bond between the new DG and chair will be critical. Whether Sharp supports the licence fee as the pillar of a future BBC settlement is unclear. The last time the BBC's future was negotiated with a sceptical Conservative government, the relationship between the director general and the chancellor - then George Osborne - was critical, as Lord Hall explained to mein his exit interview. This time, Davie will go into that negotiation with a very close ally of the current chancellor - though Sharp's first duty is to support Davie, and the BBC, and not his old mentee.

Greggs expects first annual loss since 1984,"Greggs expects up to a Â£15m loss for the year, which would be its first annual loss since it listed its shares on the stock exchange in 1984. The bakery chain said it does not expect profits to return to pre-Covid levels until 2022 at the earliest. It has been battling a sales slump due to the coronavirus pandemic, but sales declines have been lessening. Greggs made 820 job cuts at the end of last year, after its sales were hit by coronavirus lockdowns and restrictions. Chief executive Roger Whiteside said the impact of the Covid-19 crisis had been ""enormous"" and that a fresh lockdown meant ""significant uncertainties remain in the near term"". Coronavirus restrictions towards the end of last year led to ""variable trading conditions across the UK"", he said. Sales in the final three months of the year fell by nearly a fifth, but this decline was less than its sales slump in the third quarter. In September, Greggs, which is based in Newcastle, said it was in talks with staff to cut hours in an effort to minimise job losses. But it still decided to cut 820 jobs because of ""lockdown levels of business"" as High Streets were hit by the crisis. ""Looking ahead, the significant uncertainty over the duration of social restrictions, along with the impact of higher unemployment levels, makes it difficult to predict performance,"" the firm said. ""However, we do not expect that profits will return to pre-Covid levels until 2022 at the earliest."" Greggs said on Wednesday that total sales for the year were down nearly a third to Â£811m, but government support had helped to limit pre-tax losses. It said it had developed its takeaway business and a delivery tie-up with Just Eat, and had also seen ""strong sales"" through its partnership with retailer Iceland. ""We have taken action to position Greggs to withstand further short-term shocks and are optimistic about our prospects for growth once social restrictions are lifted,"" Mr Whiteside added. Greggs wants to open about 100 new stores, on a net basis, over the year ahead. Julie Palmer, a partner at insolvency consultants Begbies Traynor, said: ""The latest national lockdown will be unwelcome news for Greggs, which has operated shrewdly during the past year in spite of a lack of footfall, with non-essential stores forced to close and millions working from home. ""The bakery chain has had to adapt its business model and invest digitally to accommodate for the rapid change in shopping habits, offering click-and-collect purchases, as well as a nationwide delivery service through its partnership with Just Eat. ""This should provide a solid base for the business to expand when government restrictions are eased and the world returns to some normality."" What's the guidance for Covid in the UK now?

LiveLiveCovid-19: Welsh Government update3 minutes ago,"Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton and NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall have been giving a Welsh Government briefing on the pandemic The number of patients in Welsh hospitals with Covid-19 could reach twice the number seen in the peak last April, Dr Goodall says Another 76 people have died with Covid-19 in Wales, taking the official total to 3,738, according to Public Health Wales There are calls for clarity for university students in Wales, after students in England were told not to return to college until mid-February Some children are being denied access to a laptop for home-schooling during lockdown because of means testing, a charity says Swansea University researchers say they are developing the world's first coronavirus 'smart patch', to inject the vaccine and monitor its effect Prime Minister Boris Johnson wishes Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens a 'full and speedy recovery' as she remains in hospital with coronavirus Nicola Bryan and Andy Roberts That's all from our live coverage of today's updates from the Welsh Government and Public Health Wales. Here are the main developments:  Thanks for joining us - you can keep up to date via the BBC News website and social media channels. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Lockdowns have worked before,but can we expect the new one to do the same? It feels like we are back in March or April last year, when the strict controls on all our lives led to a fairly quick decline in levels of coronavirus. But one of the crucial differences this time is the new variant, which is thought to spread between 50 and 70% faster than previous forms of the virus. Experts warn there are now no guarantees that lockdown will be enough to bring the variant under control. ""It still would not have been easy, but it would have been a much easier situation if it had not been for the new variant,"" Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told Inside Health. ""That really pushes the bounds of our ability to control the spread of the virus, even with measures that were previously relatively quite effective."" Travellers to the UK from abroad couldsoon be required to prove they have had a negative coronavirus test. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the measure is one of several being considered to ""prevent the spread of Covid-19 across the UK border"". ""Additional measures, including testing before departure, will help keep the importation of new cases to an absolute minimum,"" the department added. It is thought that haulage drivers coming through ports would be exempt. However, the DfT said full details are still to be agreed and will be set out in ""due course"". Any such measure would be a devolved issue, so the the DfT would need to agree a path forward with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to make it UK-wide. Rhondda Labour MP Chris Bryant has called on Boris Johnson to prioritise communities such as his for coronavirus vaccines. He said Rhondda Cynon Taf had the highest
rate of death per 100,000 of any local authority, a ""very large
percentage"" of people who are extremely vulnerably, and a ""higher
than average percentage"" of NHS workers. He asked the prime minister to prioritise
areas like Rhondda and ensure surgeries there ""are not just getting 70
or 80 doses of vaccine a week, but hundreds"". Mr Johnson said many people in Rhondda would ""naturally fall into the high qualifying groups"". Wales currently receives its allocation of
the vaccine based on its UK population share, and the Welsh Government has said it will follow a list of priority groups in delivering the jabs. The Welsh Government needs to have âa clear planâ on the delivery of vaccines, Plaid Cymru's Helen Mary Jones has said. âWe think vaccines are giving us hope but we need a clear plan, a clear public idea, from the Welsh Government on exactly how that is going to be rolled out and to which priorities,"" she told BBC Wales. âWe need some action to address what seems to be differences from region to region on vaccinesâ. Ms Jones also urged the Welsh Government to change its position on students returning to universities, saying it was ""completely untenable"". ""Students from England are being told to stay at home until mid-February, while those studying in universities in Wales are being offered a phased return starting next week. ""No wonder many students do not know what to do for the best."" The NHS in Wales could be facing the âhardest monthâ since it was set up in 1948. The stark warning came from Dr Matt Morgan, an Intensive care consultant at the University Hospital of Wales, Cardiff. âLetâs not sugar-coat it, January already is such a hard monthâ, he told BBC Wales. âJanuary will be the hardest month in the pandemic so far and possibly the hardest month in the 73 years since Aneurin Bevan started the NHS. âThatâs not just about ICUâ¦itâs for the whole hospital system."" However, he added: ""There is hope - we will get through this."" Clap for Carersis to return under a new name of Clap for Heroes, the initiative's founder has said. The weekly applause for front-line NHS staff and other key workers ran for 10 weeks during the UK's first coronavirus lockdown last spring. Founder Annemarie Plas tweeted that it would return at 20:00 GMT on Thursday. She said she hoped the initiative would ""lift the spirit of all of us"" including ""all who are pushing through this difficult time"". Allow Twitter content?

There are hopes the new year could herald a new dawn in the fight against coronavirus after a second vaccine began its roll-out on Monday. The Oxford/AstraZeneca vaccine comes after one created by Pfizer BioNTech was given the go-ahead at the start of December. But when can people expect to receive the jab? The Welsh Government has said it will work through a list of priorities, starting with elderly residents of care homes and those who work there, front-line health and social care workers, and anyone over the age of 80. A Plaid Cymru MP has accused the UK Government of ""wilful misrepresentation"" by announcing this week that Wales would get Â£227m in ""additional funding"" due to the pandemic. It comes after Chancellor Rishi Sunak said he was providingnew funding to support business grants in Englandon Tuesday. The Treasury said this meant extra money would be given to the administrations in Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Wales Office Minister David TC Davies also tweeted: ""This announcement from the Chancellor means an extra Â£227m in funding for Wales."" But it was later clarified that this was part of the Â£5.2bn extra funding already guaranteed for Wales as part of the latest funding top-up announced on 23 December. Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said he was sorry if this had not been made clear. However, Plaid Cymru's parliamentary leader Liz Saville Roberts said the Treasury announcement ""deliberately misinforms desperate businesses in Wales"". She was rebuked by Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle for her use of the word ""wilful"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The total number of Covid deaths since the start of the pandemic now stands at 3,738, figures from Public Health Wales (PHW) show. This map shows the number of deaths announced by each of Wales' health boards. The chief executive of the Welsh NHS says he is âgenuinely concernedâ about the resilience of the service in the face of coronavirus. Dr Andrew Goodall added that there were âplans and preparations to respondâ to rising numbers of Covid cases but added there would be an âimpact on other servicesâ. He said: âWe are obviously managing the normal operational pressures of winter - we would not normally be responding to those pressures with 2,800 beds occupied by patients with Covid. âThese patients are staying longer than our typical emergency patients who will come into the system, so we are genuinely concerned about the resilience of the NHS system. âWe do have the plans and preparations to respond, but it comes with impact on other services and other access points for our patients in Wales."" Dr Goodall added: âThis is going to be a very challenging and difficult period of time ahead of us."" The number of cases of Covid-19 per 100,000 people over the most recent seven-day periodincreased in each local authority area in the latest figures. Bridgend continues to have the highest rate of any Welsh council area, and had 978.1 cases per 100,00 people over the week between Boxing Day and New Year's Day. It was followed by Wrexham (838.5), Merthyr Tydfil (717.8), Newport (611) and Flintshire (598.3). Gwynedd (73.1) remains the only local authority in Wales with a rate of less than 100 cases per 100,000 people. The overall case rate in Wales stands at 484.3. Wales will see a noticeable ""increase in activity"" in January of Covid vaccination, NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says. He stressed that although the NHS has experience in delivering vaccinations it's never been done to ""a whole population to these types of timescales"". ""But there is a very significant commitment and ambition from the NHS to be able to step up to this, to protect the world's population, and of course to ensure that we can move through those cohorts [priority groups] as well"", Dr Goodall said. ""We will see increasing volumes of activity taking place, certainly as those supplies materially and visibly increase during the month of January."" Wales' Chief Medical Offier Dr Frank Atherton added that the NHS is ""going to go as fast as we can"" on vaccination. Closing nurseries in Wales would cause âa crisis in the workforceâ for the essential workers who rely on them, the chief medical officer says. Dr Frank Atherton was addressing a question about why the decision had been made to close schools but not nurseries. On Monday it was announced thatall schools and colleges in Wales would need to move to online learning until 18 January. Speaking to journalists, Dr Atherton said that many essential workers in Wales were reliant on nursery provision. ""If we were to close all the nurseries then we would really have a crisis in the workforce - not just in healthcare but in social care and beyond,"" he said. Wales' chief medical officer has defended plans to extend the gap to 12 weeks between doses of the Covid vaccines. Wales and the rest of the UK will give both parts of the Oxford and Pfizer vaccines 12 weeks apart, having initially planned to leave 21 days between the Pfizer jabs. The British Medical Association has raised concerns about the plan. But Dr Frank Atherton said: âI donât share that concern."" He said it was âreally important get the first dose into as many people as possibleâ. Wales' Chief Medical Officer Dr Frank Atherton said the ""evidence so far"" is that there is not a risk that the new variant of coronavirus, now spreading rapidly in the UK, is not as responsive to the current vaccines. He said the evidence is that ""the antibody response to the vaccines does cover both the original virus and the variant virus"". ""Of course, there's also a T-cell immunity, so there's both types of immunity, we believe, that work with the new variant as well as the original virus,"" he said. Dr Atherton said there was ""always a risk over time that new variants will emerge and that they'll be 
less susceptible and less amenable to vaccine control"". He said in the future the approach may need to be similar to that with flu, where people are ""protected by different vaccines over time"". Dr Atherton said that was an issue ""for the future"" and that the ""pressing need now is to deal with the virus that we know we have and get the vaccine rolled out as quickly as we can"". The UK Government has beencriticised for announcing Wales would get Â£227m in ""additional funding"" on Tuesday. The funding is part of Â£5.2bn already guaranteed since the beginning of the pandemic as a result of extra spending in England, and is not new cash. On Tuesday the Chancellor Rishi Sunak announcednew funding to support business grants in England. Wales minister David TC Davies tweeted on Tuesday: ""This announcement from the Chancellor means an extra Â£227m in funding for Wales."" Labour Rhondda MP Chris Bryant said there was not a ""single extra penny for Wales"". It was later clarified that the Â£227m for Wales was part of the Â£5.2bn extra funding already guaranteed for Wales as part of the latest funding top-up announced on 23 December. Conservative Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said he was ""sorry"" if this had not been clear. There are 140 people with coronavirus in critical care, NHS Wales Chief Executive Dr Andrew Goodall says. He added: âThis is the highest we have seen during this second wave. âIntensive care units are under enormous pressure at the moment. âOur critical care capacity is operating at almost 140% of its normal occupancy. âWe can expand it further, but this means other clinical services are disrupted. Dr Goodall said ""difficult choices"" were being made as services and staff were ""stretched"". There is no evidence that the new covid variant causes a more serious illness, Wales' Chief Medical Office Dr Frank Atherton says. But he said the Welsh Government was worried because it was ""so infectious and can be easily passed from person to personâ. âEven with restrictions in place, this new strain appears to be driving an increase in cases across the UK and could be the reason why we are seeing more people being admitted to hospital,â Dr Atherton said. âItâs one of the reasons why the chief medical officers for England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and I agreed to raise the risk level for the UK on Monday night to the highest level."" Dr Atherton said the chief medical officers were âvery concernedâ about the health serviceâs ability to handle a further sustained rise in of coronavirus cases. He said that without further action, âthere is a material risk of the NHS being overwhelmed over the next 21 days, in several areas of the UKâ. Â© 2025 BBC.

No speeding fines issued for breaking 50mph limit,"The limits were introduced to reduce nitrogen dioxide emissions from vehicles No speeding fines have been issued to drivers breaking the 50mph limit on three stretches of main road and two sections of the M4 motorway in Wales. The limits were introduced as a trial in June 2018 to cut nitrogen dioxide levels and made permanent in 2019. Advisory notices will begin to be issued to speeding drivers to explain the reasons for the 50mph limit. The Welsh Government said this was the ""second phase"" of ""promoting compliance"", after a monitoring phase. Road safety charity Brake said it urges ""more stringent enforcement"". A stretch of the M4 through Port Talbot is one of the roads with a 50mph limit Transport Minister Ken Skates' decision to issue advisory letters will apply to the following roads, in which the 50mph restrictions were introduced to reduce emissions: M4 Junction 41 to Junction 42, Port Talbot M4 Beaufort Road/Rembrandt Way Overbridge to Junction 26, Newport A470 Upper Boat Interchange to Bridge Street Interchange, Pontypridd A483 Junction 5 to Junction 6, Wrexham A494 Wales/England border to St David's Park Interchange, Deeside South Wales Police said management of cameras within environmental 50mph limits in its force area currently lay with the Welsh Government. ""GoSafe is working with the Welsh Government to bring the schemes under GoSafe management,"" said a spokesperson. ""In the meantime therefore, no Notices of Intended Prosecution (NIPs) have been issued for speeding offences within these camera systems by GoSafe."" Road safety partnership GoSafe confirmed it had not issued any NIPs within those specific areas. The Welsh Government is trying to cut nitrogen dioxide levels on roads where they are above legal limits. The High Court hadordered ministers to act after they failed to meet EU targets on air pollution. The usual minimum penalty for speeding is a Â£100 fine and three penalty points added to your licence The minimum penalty for speeding is usually a Â£100 fine and three penalty points added to your licence. A Welsh Government spokeswoman said the advisory notices would have a ""strong emphasis"" on giving guidance about the reasons for the reducing speed, such as public health and air quality benefits. She explained that ""a phased approach to promoting compliance with the 50mph speed limits has been undertaken - issuing advisory notices is the second phase"". ""The police have been enforcing the speed limits on these routes where driver behaviour/speeds are considered dangerous. ""This phased partnership approach will ensure the small minority of drivers who do not comply with the speed limit are given the opportunity to do so before any sanctions are applied."" Joshua Harris, of road safety charity Brake, backed the trial 50mph limits to improve air quality and road safety but urged more stringent enforcement. ""Breaking the speed limit is a crime and until road crime is treated like real crime, we will never truly shift the dial on road safety,"" he said. In January 2018, the Welsh Government conceded a case brought by environmental campaign group Client Earth which said ministers had failed to meet EU targets to cut pollution. The Welsh Government's latestannual report on roadside nitrogen dioxide concentrations,externallast March 2020 said that although the annual trend of NO2 was falling at all five stretches of road, the situation still remained ""complicated"". ""Air quality is sensitive to a number of issues including the weather/seasonal effects, traffic flows including volume, speeds and fleet mix,"" it said. The report also noted that ""while the average speeds are below 50mph and compliance is much greater, there still remains a certain percentage of drivers exceeding the 50mph at certain times of the day"". Last month, a nine-year-old girl who died following an asthma attack became the first person in the UK to haveair pollution listed as a cause of death.

Dozens held in largest crackdown on HK opposition,"Lester Shum was first barred from running for office, then arrested More than 50 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested in the biggest crackdown since China imposed a draconian security law last year. About 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city. Those held helped run an unofficial ""primary"" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections. They are accused of trying to ""overthrow"" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent. China's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Beijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop ""external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security"". But the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are ""the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment"". Dozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures. Police fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include: long-established opposition figures James To, Lam Cheuk-ting, Claudio Mo and Benny Tai, one of the initiators of the primaries young pro-democracy campaigners Lester Shum, Gwyneth Ho, Tiffany Yuen and Jeffrey Andrews Human rights lawyer John Clancey, a US citizen two academics behind the primaries strategy 13 candidates from the primaries Police also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets. Apple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information. Mr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works. Benny Tai was one of the architects of the primaries Hours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of ""overthrowing"" the city's government. The government will not tolerate ""subversive"" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council. If charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison. The BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call ""white terror"" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory. When authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says. In July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament. More than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests The opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms. Hong Kong's leaderCarrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion,externalif the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election. In July, Joshua Wong (on right in poster) and Lester Shum (on left) had still hoped to run for LegCo Several of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo electionwere later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests. Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers resign en masse Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? Most of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament. The crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong. ""Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it. ""I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people,"" Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency. The arrests have been widely condemned internationally. Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick as next US Secretary of State, said they were an ""assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights"". ""The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy."" Antony Blinken said Washington will stand with Hong Kong UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the arrests were a ""grievous attack"" on rights applied under the joint declaration signed with Britain when the territory was handed over in 1997. He said it demonstrated the national security law was ""being used to crush dissent and opposing political views"". Chris Patten, the territory's last British governor, said: ""The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong. Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society."" Maya Wang, China specialist at Human Rights Watch, said China was now ""removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city"". ""Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government,"" she said. Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist who fled the territory in July last year, said the widespread arrests had taken ""the suppression of political freedom and freedom of speech"" to ""another level"". ""Anyone who is still defending the National Security Law and making peace is the enemy of Hong Kong people."" By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai Beijing sees ""vicious plans"" to topple Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government. Supporters of the dozens arrested see another crude crackdown on what's left of the territory's nascent democracy. Despite co-ordinated international criticism, with some targeted retaliation, led by the US and the UK, the authorities have enthusiastically embraced their powers under the new national security law passed last year. How these latest arrests come under that jurisdiction is not yet clear. But it's worth remembering this law is ambiguous and sweeping in its definition, targeting anyone, anywhere in the world. The street protests are now a distant memory. Some prominent figures have fled to friendly countries, almost certainly never to return. The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. It has been widely criticised by rights groups and Western nations as effectively curtailing dissent. A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It retained more civil and political freedoms than the mainland has. Activists say that in recent years, these freedoms have been eroded. Pro-democracy protests have often led to violent clashes with police. Pro-democracy protests have rocked Hong Kong for years The Chinese government has defended the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice Agnes Chow: Hong Kongâs 'real Mulan' After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety and several high profile court cases under the security law have started.

Travellers to UK may soon need negative Covid test,"Travellers to the UK from abroad could soon be required to prove they have had a negative coronavirus test. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the measure is one of several being considered to ""prevent the spread of Covid-19 across the UK border"". ""Additional measures, including testing before departure, will help keep the importation of new cases to an absolute minimum,"" the department added. It is thought that haulage drivers coming through ports would be exempt. However, the DfT said full details are still to be agreed and will be set out in ""due course"". Any such measure would be a devolved issue, so the the DfT would need to agree a path forward with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to make it UK-wide. A spokesperson said: ""With a new strain of the virus on the loose in South Africa and a more infectious variant already widespread in the UK we need to do more."" The measures were being discussed as Boris Johnson imposed the third national lockdown in England to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed. The prime minister has faced some calls to strengthen border protections to prevent the arrival of new cases, particularly of new and concerning strains. However, there was no mention of tougher border controls during his address to the nation on Monday, or press conference on Tuesday. UK daily Covid cases top 60,000 for first time Firms cancel holiday bookings as lockdown begins Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? Earlier on Tuesday, Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove said announcements will come in the days ahead on ""how we will make sure that our ports and airports are safe"". ""It is already the case that there are significant restrictions on people coming into this country and of course we're stressing that nobody should be travelling abroad,"" he told ITV. Currently, international arrivals from countries that are not exempt under the travel corridor programme have to isolate for 10 days. But under the test and release scheme introduced in December, this can be shortened if they have a private test five days after their departure and it comes back negative. It is possible lorry drivers could be exempt, but no final decision has been made During the first lockdown, the government argued against introducing border restrictions while the prevalence was so high in the UK, with experts arguing it would do little to bring down infection rates. A quarantine period, however, was introduced in June after the first peak, when cases were more under control. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel was accused of leaving the ""nation's doors unlocked"" to new coronavirus variants coming to Britain from overseas. Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds wrote to Ms Patel calling for an ""urgent review and improvement plan"" as he raised concerns over checks on the arrival of people who are meant to go into quarantine. He wrote: ""It is especially worrying given the concerns regarding mutation of the virus that emerged in South Africa, which the health secretary rightly said is 'incredibly worrying'. ""However, the lack of a robust quarantine system as a result of shortcomings from the government mean that it is virtually impossible to keep a grip on this spread or other variants that may come from overseas, leaving the UK defenceless, and completely exposed, with the nation's doors unlocked to further Covid mutations."" The Home Office defended its ""stringent measures"", and pointed to its move to stop direct flights from South Africa to the UK amid concerns over a new coronavirus variant in high prevalence there.

UK new car sales suffer worst year for decades,"New car registrations fell to their lowest level in nearly three decades last year, according to preliminary figures from the industry's trade body. It was also the biggest one-year fall since World War Two, when factories were being turned over to military production, the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. About 1.63 million new cars were registered in 2020, compared with 2.3 million in 2019 - a decline of 29%. It was the lowest total since 1992. The bulk of the lost sales occurred during the first lockdown in the Spring, when showrooms were forced to close, and factories shut down. ""We lost half a million units from March, April, May - and we never recovered them,"" said the SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes. The restrictions introduced later in the year were less damaging, largely because dealers were able to sell cars remotely, using 'click and collect' services. That remains the case during the new lockdown, announced on Monday. ""We can still do click and collect, which is important, because that's the very minimum we need,"" said Mr Hawes. ""Not just to keep retail going, but also to keep manufacturing going."" Overall, the SMMT said the Covid crisis has cost the car industry some Â£20bn - and cost the exchequer nearly Â£2bn in lost VAT. There are also serious questions about the extent to which the car market can recover this year. Previous forecasts, which had suggested new registrations could rise to about 2 million in 2021, have been thrown into doubt by the latest restrictions. But while the market as a whole has suffered over the past year, sales of electric cars have risen dramatically, increasing their share of the market from 1.5% to 6.5%. Sales of plug-in hybrids also rose sharply. Car showrooms re-opened from the first lockdown in June ""If we see this continued level of uptake in electric vehicles, then we anticipate that sales of new EVs and plug-in hybrids will overtake diesel cars in 2021,"" said Ian Plummer, commercial director of motoring website Auto Trader. ""Then, pure EVs will overtake those of their internal combustion engine counterparts in 2026."" With the pandemic continuing to inflict serious damage on the industry, Mr Hawes says the trade deal between the UK and the EU came as a ""massive relief"". It confirmed that cars and car parts could continue to move between the two regions, without tariffs - or taxes - being imposed, provided certain conditions are met. Honda factory temporarily suspends production Fiat Chrysler and PSA shareholders approve merger Shift to electric cars 'requires Herculean effort' The SMMT had previously warned that failing to reach a deal could have cost the industry Â£55bn over five years - and add Â£2,000 to the cost of each vehicle But manufacturers still face potentially significant additional costs due to so-called non-tariff barriers - including border formalities, and the need to obtain extra regulatory approvals for new designs. ""This is not a free deal"", said Mr Hawes. Another consequence of the trade deal is that the UK will need to focus on battery production, if it is to maintain its car industry while phasing out petrol and diesel engines. That's because in order to qualify for tariff-free access to the European market, the value of car components made outside the UK and the EU will have to be strictly limited. Specific rules relating to batteries effectively mean that from 2027, they themselves will have to be made in the EU or the UK. The SMMT believes that, based on current investment plans, UK battery factories will have a capacity of 15 gigawatt-hours (GWh) by 2024. That is more than seven times the current level, and would be enough to produce 250,000 electric cars per year. But the SMMT insists much more is needed: 60GWh in order to produce 1 million cars per year by 2030, and 120GWh to produce 2mby 2040. That, says Mr Hawes, will require ""massive investment"".

French chef Albert Roux dies aged 85,"Albert Roux pictured in the kitchen of Le Gavroche in 1989 Chef and restaurateur Albert Roux, who brought great French cooking to the UK with his brother Michel, has died at the age of 85. The pair made gastronomic history in 1982 when their London restaurant, Le Gavroche, became the first in Britain to earn three Michelin stars. Albert's death comes almost a year afterMichel died at the age of 78. Gordon Ramsay, one of many leading chefs who earned their stripes in Le Gavroche's kitchen, led the tributes. ""So so sad the hear about the passing of this legend, the man who installed Gastronomy in Britain,""Ramsay wrote on Instagram.,external Marco Pierre White, Marcus Wareing, Pierre Koffman and Monica Galetti are among the other chefs who rose through the ranks at Le Gavroche. In his tribute, TV chefJames Martin described Albert Roux,externalas ""a true titan of the food scene in this country [who] inspired and trained some of the best and biggest names in the business"". A family statement said: ""The Roux family has announced the sad passing of Albert Roux, OBE, KFO, who had been unwell for a while, at the age 85 on 4th January 2021. ""Albert is credited, along with his late brother Michel Roux, with starting London's culinary revolution with the opening of Le Gavroche in 1967."" His son Michel Roux Jr, who now runs Le Gavroche and is a former judge on MasterChef: The Professionals, said: ""He was a mentor for so many people in the hospitality industry, and a real inspiration to budding chefs, including me."" Albert and Michel Roux received honorary OBEs in 2002 Food critic Jay Raynerdescribed Albert Roux,externalas ""an extraordinary man who left a massive mark on the food story of his adopted country"". He added: ""The roll call of chefs who went through the kitchens of Le Gavroche alone, is a significant slab of a part of modern UK restaurant culture."" Chef Tom Kitchin wrote that,external""one of the true culinary greats has left us"", and baker and food writerDan Lepard said,externalit was the ""end of an era"". Albert and Michel Roux came from a family of butchers in eastern France, and trained to be patissiers before moving to the UK. Albert arrived in the mid-1950s, and in 1967 put his Â£3,000 savings with money borrowed from friends to open the first Gavroche off Sloane Square in Chelsea. With uncompromising standards, elaborate presentation and first-rate service, it raised the standards of haute cuisine in a then-limited English restaurant scene. It moved to Mayfair in 1981, and soon became the first British-based establishment to carry the maximum three Michelin stars. ""An Olympic gold medal,"" Albert said at the time. ""I have had no other ambition."" The Roux dynasty (left-right): Alain Roux, Michel Roux Jnr, Michel Roux and Albert Roux in 2009 Its kitchen would also become the training ground for a new, enlightened generation of British chefs. ""If cooking is an art form, Le Gavroche was the Royal College of Music, Central Saint Martins College of Art & Design, Rada and the Courtauld and Warburg institutes all rolled up into one, poached, wrapped in a puff pastry shell with foie gras and served with truffle sauce,""The Guardian wrote in 2010,external. The brothers also launched the Roux Scholarship, an annual chef competition, in 1983, with many scholars having gone on to win Michelin stars themselves. Albert and Michel opened a string of other restaurants, fronted a 13-part TV series on BBC Two in 1990, and published a series of best-selling books about French cookery.

'Scared' nursery staff turn up for work,"Paul Trauberman from Rainbow Smiles said it was hard to give reassurance without knowing the facts about the new variant Nursery staff say they are being ""treated like the bottom of the rung"" after schools in England were told to shut to reduce the virus transmission. Paul Trauberman, of Rainbow Smiles in Weston-super-Mare, said despite his staff being ""scared"" about the new Covid-19 variant they had come to work. The governmentannounced a strict lockdown across the countryon Monday. It was after the UK moved toCovid-19 threat level five, meaning there is a risk the NHS could be overwhelmed. Mr Trauberman, who took over Rainbow Smiles nursery in 2016, said he felt conflicted. ""I've come in this morning and I've got staff crying and saying they are scared of this new variant."" ""We don't have PPE, we can't social distance, on the other hand we still have a business that is operational and we are not going bankrupt."" He said prolonged closure also carried the risk of going out of business but it was difficult to reassure staff when ""you don't have any of the facts"". ""One minute it is fine and the schools are going back, and two days later they are sending everyone home. ""It makes the staff feel insecure and... they just feel like they are being treated like the bottom of the rung. Schools are expected to remain closed until after the February half-term ""With this new variant ... they are having to deal with very close contact with children, with a virus around, which they are saying is very, very bad, but with no more information than that."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Early years settings remain low risk environments for children and staff and there is no evidence that the new variant of coronavirus disproportionately affects young children."" Nurseries, schools and sport: Why are the rules different this time? It said keeping nurseries open supported parents and delivered crucial education for children as Bristol mother-of-three Eleni Franklin has found. She said she ""really valued"" Acorns Nursery in Henbury Hill, being open as she and her husband are both key workers - so their children, Allegra, five, Aria, two and Rafe nine-months-old, will attend school and nursery throughout the lockdown. ""I can see that nurseries are different to schools. There has been one case at Aria's nursery during this whole period, whereas in school there has been quite a few,"" she said. Eleni Franklin said she could see why nurseries were being treated differently to schools ""The nursery have been pretty good and although I understand there is a risk to staff, they have put a lot of measures in place to keep people safe."" One of the biggest challenges for nurseries - with some staff now unable to work because of their own childcare responsibilities - is maintaining child-to-staff ratios. Mr Trauberman said they worked on a basis of one-to-three for babies, one-to-four for under-three's and one-to-eight with under five-year-olds. ""We are trying to maintain these bubbles, but normally we would move staff around to accommodate highs and lows of staff and children, to balance it out, but we are unable to do that to enable these bubbles,"" he said. His nursery is now identifying families that could potentially keep their children at home if they were unable to meet those ratios. Mr Trauberman, who is a member of an online group for nursery owners, said some people were calling for nurseries to shut, but said if that happened they risked ""not having a business to come back to"". ""Small businesses are the backbone of the country and if a lot of those go under, the financial implications for the whole country are going to be catastrophic."" Mother-of-two Kara Willetts, from Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, said she felt it was important her daughter Isobel continued going to nursery as she noticed her behaviour had changed when she had to stop going during the first lockdown in March. ""Isobel is a really sociable, outgoing child and she really suffered with not going in and seeing her friends during the first lockdown. Her mental health suffered and she displayed behaviour I had never seen from her before,"" she said. Kara Willetts said her daughter Isobel's mental health suffered when nurseries closed during the first lockdown Mrs Willetts said she had full confidence in the measures introduced at the nursery three-and-a-half-year-old Isobel attends in Cheltenham. She said that with her husband working from home and a seven-month-old son also at home, the option of Isobel going to nursery was ""beneficial to the whole family"". ""It is quite difficult for my husband to concentrate on work with two kids at home. Transmission rates in young children are very low and if I had any safety concerns I wouldn't send Isobel there,"" she added. Tom Shea, a former advisor to the Early Year's minister, said: ""The biggest issue is that as a society we regard childcare as something like babysitting, rather than the start of the early year's development of learning. ""Sadly it seems the main reason for keeping us open is for protecting employment rather than protecting children."" Mr Shea owns Child First Nursery in Worksop and said he thought there was a ""hierarchy"" among key workers in terms of vaccination priorities. He said ""sensibly"" the first priority was NHS staff, followed by social carers for the elderly. He said teachers ranked a ""reasonable"" third, but that Early Years workers did not feature at all. ""They are expected just to work, and I am not sure if the government thinks that we are invisible,"" he said. He called for early vaccination of Early Years workers to allow them to stay open and be protected. ""The irony now is that we are being told to keep open even though we are private businesses, we are dictated to about the funding we can receive and how we receive itâ¦ and if parents are frightened of their children going into the childcare setting then suddenly we don't get paid for that, so you find nurseries half empty being forced to open and it is not economical to do that."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We are funding nurseries as usual and all children are able to attend their early years setting in all parts of England. ""Working parents on coronavirus support schemes will still remain eligible for childcare support even if their income levels fall below the minimum requirement.""

Democrat 'set to win' Georgia Senate run-off race,"This video can not be played If confirmed, Mr Warnock will be the first black senator for the state of Georgia The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia. Pastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other. If they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda. He said it was ""time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity"". Follow our live updates from Georgia and Congress The election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win. None of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. Why Georgia wins would be huge for Biden Who is Georgia's Reverend Raphael Warnock? Georgia election: Trump voter fraud claims and others fact-checked With 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. Mr Warnock's and Mr Ossoff's positions have been boosted by Joe Biden's presidential election win in Georgia Control of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off. Mr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. He serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached. Claiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said. If both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives. Mr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years. A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. Final results are expected later on Wednesday. The margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler. Edison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. More than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? More than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Although the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers. The two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency. If it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state. But Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state. It turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate.

Today's updates were brought to you by Sophie Williams, Lauren Turner, Emma Harrison, Paul Seddon, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Scott and Victoria Bisset. The page was edited by Helier Cheung, Sarah Collerton, John Hand, Suzanne Leigh and Marie Jackson. Thank you for joining us. Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?"" Dr Clarke, who is also an author, said ministers should not have ""ignored"" the independent advisory group Sage when they suggested as early as September that a ""circuit breaker"" was required  - and before Christmas to have a lockdown.

He said: ""Between the 4 of January and the 11 January you'll see another step up.""

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection. ""It's a universal right,"" President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters news agency. ""We would do it."" He gave no details about how such a plan would be implemented, or who would  be eligible to receive a vaccine. Many undocumented migrants in the US are from Mexico. The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"". He added Johnson also ""outlined his vision for building back better from the pandemic"". Downing Street said Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Trade Secretary Liz Truss also joined the call. He said: ""The chancellor also spoke about his optimism for the UK economy in 2021 and committed to using all the levers at his disposal to drive growth across the entire UK which meets our climate ambitions."" The conversation also took in the Brexit trade deal, No 10 said, as well as the government's ""urgent ambition to unite and level up across the country by investing in education, skills, technology and infrastructure"". Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external. It says members of the public should first be encouraged to comply with the law. ""Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" it says. For participation in gatherings, fixed penalty notices start at Â£100 and can rise to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. There are fines of Â£10,000 for organisers of restricted gatherings. It also says, in addition to businesses already closed, aquariums and zoos, including safari parks and wildlife centres, are among the attractions that must close. MPs have voted to approve the law which introduced a new lockdown in England this morning. A total of 524 MPs voted in favour of the restrictions, compared to 16 who voted against. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month. Here's a closer look at the data: Itâs been a busy day so far and MPs are continuing to debate
the new lockdown in England in the House of Commons. Weâre not expecting a vote
until about 19:00 GMT, but weâll continue to bring you the latest on our live
page. Hereâs a round-up of the main coronavirus headlines in the UK:  Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne is making his criticism of lockdowns very clear in his allotted time in the Commons. He calls it a ""situation of state capture"" where the government is ""completely enthralled to a lobby driving a policy that has manifestly failed"" - slamming the ""increasing iterations of this policy with ever tighter controls and restrictions in the hope it may finally work"". After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame. ""And on that occasion at least, they will be right."" Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin correspondent The Irish government has announced a raft of measures to fight the coronavirus including school closures. Non-essential construction will also be shut down and air passengers must have negative Covid-19 PCR tests 72 hours before flying into the state. PCR tests are regarded as the ""gold standard"" of testing. The travel restriction will apply to passengers from Britain and South Africa before an anticipated extension to all visitors. The Taoiseach (Irish PM) has told a news conference that public compliance with the measures will reflect on how many people may die. MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said he expected people to ""face the coming month with steely determination and resolve."" Read the full story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection. ""It's a universal right,"" President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters news agency. ""We would do it."" He gave no details about how such a plan would be implemented, or who would  be eligible to receive a vaccine. Many undocumented migrants in the US are from Mexico. The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"". He added Johnson also ""outlined his vision for building back better from the pandemic"". Downing Street said Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Trade Secretary Liz Truss also joined the call. He said: ""The chancellor also spoke about his optimism for the UK economy in 2021 and committed to using all the levers at his disposal to drive growth across the entire UK which meets our climate ambitions."" The conversation also took in the Brexit trade deal, No 10 said, as well as the government's ""urgent ambition to unite and level up across the country by investing in education, skills, technology and infrastructure"". Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external.

The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month. Here's a closer look at the data: Itâs been a busy day so far and MPs are continuing to debate

After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame.

Bosses 'earn average worker's salary in 34 hours'FTSE 100 chiefs will by Wednesday have earned more this year than the average worker's annual wage.,"Bosses of Britain's biggest companies will earn more in the first three days of this week than the average worker's annual wage, research claims. By 17:30 GMT on Wednesday, the pay of FTSE 100 chiefs will have overtaken the Â£31,461 annual median wage for full time workers, the High Pay Centre says. Bosses' pay was flat last year, while average wages generally rose slightly. That meant that FTSE chief executives had to work 34 hours to beat median annual pay, not the 33 hours in 2020. The High Pay Centre think-tank based its annual calculations on analysis of disclosures in companies' annual reports, combined with government statistics. High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said chief executive pay is about 120 times that of the typical UK worker, up significantly from two decades ago. ""Estimates suggest it was around 50 times at the turn of the millennium or 20 times in the early 1980s,"" he said. ""Factors such as the increasing role played by the finance industry in the economy, the outsourcing of low-paid work and the decline of trade union membership have widened the gaps between those at the top and everybody else over recent decades."" He said the figures should raise concern about the governance of Britain's biggest companies. ""They should also prompt debate about the effects that high levels of inequality can have on social cohesion, crime, and public health and wellbeing,"" he said. Median FTSE 100 chief executive pay was Â£3.61m in 2019, the last year for which a full set of data is available, the High Pay Centre said. The centre said its analysis was based on chief executives' average working day being 12 hours. However, critics said such analysis just fuels the politics of envy without looking at why chief executives matter and the contribution they make. Daniel Pryor, head of programmes at the Adam Smith Institute, said: ""Good management is more important than ever in a globalised world and small differences in top talent make a big impact on a business' bottom line. ""That bottom line makes a big difference to workers across the UK, anyone with a private pension, and shareholders."" He pointed out that there is strong, if morbid, evidence about chief executive deaths that shows why the corporate and investment world believe leadership makes a huge difference to the fortunes of their companies. ""In the past 60 years, unexpected CEO deaths have consistently affected stock price, profitability, investment and sales growth - for better or worse,"" he said, adding: ""Which is why it makes sense for firms to open their wallets to attract the best talent.""

Today's updates were brought to you by Sophie Williams, Lauren Turner, Emma Harrison, Paul Seddon, Alex Kleiderman, Jennifer Scott and Victoria Bisset. The page was edited by Helier Cheung, Sarah Collerton, John Hand, Suzanne Leigh and Marie Jackson. Thank you for joining us. Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?"" Dr Clarke, who is also an author, said ministers should not have ""ignored"" the independent advisory group Sage when they suggested as early as September that a ""circuit breaker"" was required  - and before Christmas to have a lockdown.

BBC Question Time The UK has an ""ambitious"" vaccine delivery plan, the minister in charge of the roll out has insisted. Asked by a member of the public on the BBC's Question Time programme why there appeared to be a ""lack of joined-up planning"" compared to other countries, Nadhim Zahawi highlighted the target to vaccinate just under 14 million people by the middle of February. He said: ""Between the 4 of January and the 11 January you'll see another step up."" Prof Mark Walport, a member of the independent government's advisory group Sage, told the programme: ""We are in a race between getting people vaccinated and this new more transmissible variant.""

Democrat 'set to win' Georgia Senate run-off raceUS TV networks project Raphael Warnock will become the first black senator for the southern state.,"This video can not be played If confirmed, Mr Warnock will be the first black senator for the state of Georgia The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia. Pastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other. If they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda. He said it was ""time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity"". Follow our live updates from Georgia and Congress The election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win. None of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. Why Georgia wins would be huge for Biden Who is Georgia's Reverend Raphael Warnock? Georgia election: Trump voter fraud claims and others fact-checked With 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. Mr Warnock's and Mr Ossoff's positions have been boosted by Joe Biden's presidential election win in Georgia Control of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off. Mr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. He serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached. Claiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said. If both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives. Mr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years. A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. Final results are expected later on Wednesday. The margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler. Edison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. More than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? More than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Although the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers. The two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency. If it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state. But Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state. It turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate.

WHO Covid investigators denied entry to ChinaVisas had not been cleared for team members already en route to probe the origins of the virus.China,"It was initially believed that Covid-19 originated at a market in Wuhan A World Health Organization (WHO) team due to investigate the origins of Covid-19 in the city of Wuhan has been denied entry to China. Two members were already en route, with the WHO saying the problem was a lack of visa clearances. However, China has challenged this, saying details of the visit, including dates, were still being arranged. The long-awaited probe was agreed upon by Beijing after many months of negotiations with the WHO. The virus was first detected in Wuhan in late 2019, with the initial outbreak linked to a market. WHO to investigate Covid origins in China's Wuhan WHO chief Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said he was ""very disappointed"" that China had not yet finalised the permissions for the team's arrivals ""given that two members had already begun their journeys and others were not able to travel at the last minute"".

""Chinese authorities are in close co-operation with WHO but there has been some minor outbreaks in multiple places around the world and many countries and regions are busy in their work preventing the virus and we are also working on this,"" she said.

This video can not be played Covid-19: How everyday life has changed in Wuhan The WHO has been working to send a 10-person team of international experts to China for months with the aim of probing the animal origin of the pandemic and exactly how the virus first crossed over to humans. Last month it was announced that the investigation would begin in January 2021. The two members of the international team that had already departed for China had set off early on Tuesday, said the WHO. According to Reuters news agency, WHO emergencies chief Mike Ryan said one had turned back and one was in a third country. Covid-19 was first detected in the Chinese city of Wuhan in central Hubei province in late 2019. It was initially believed the virus originated in a market selling exotic animals for meat. It was suggested that this was where the virus made the leap from animals to humans. But the origins of the virus remain deeply contested. Some experts now believe the market may not have been the origin, and that it was instead only amplified there. Some research has suggested that coronaviruses capable of infecting humans may have been circulating undetected in bats for decades. It is not known, however, what intermediate animal host transmitted the virus between bats and humans.

"Travellers to UK may soon need negative Covid testThe government says it is considering the move to prevent the virus spreading ""across the UK border"".Business","Travellers to the UK from abroad could soon be required to prove they have had a negative coronavirus test. The Department for Transport (DfT) said the measure is one of several being considered to ""prevent the spread of Covid-19 across the UK border"". ""Additional measures, including testing before departure, will help keep the importation of new cases to an absolute minimum,"" the department added. It is thought that haulage drivers coming through ports would be exempt. However, the DfT said full details are still to be agreed and will be set out in ""due course"". Any such measure would be a devolved issue, so the the DfT would need to agree a path forward with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland to make it UK-wide. A spokesperson said: ""With a new strain of the virus on the loose in South Africa and a more infectious variant already widespread in the UK we need to do more."" The measures were being discussed as Boris Johnson imposed the third national lockdown in England to prevent the NHS being overwhelmed. The prime minister has faced some calls to strengthen border protections to prevent the arrival of new cases, particularly of new and concerning strains. However, there was no mention of tougher border controls during his address to the nation on Monday, or press conference on Tuesday. UK daily Covid cases top 60,000 for first time Firms cancel holiday bookings as lockdown begins Cough, fever or loss of smell: Could it be Covid? Earlier on Tuesday, Cabinet Office Secretary Michael Gove said announcements will come in the days ahead on ""how we will make sure that our ports and airports are safe"". ""It is already the case that there are significant restrictions on people coming into this country and of course we're stressing that nobody should be travelling abroad,"" he told ITV. Currently, international arrivals from countries that are not exempt under the travel corridor programme have to isolate for 10 days. But under the test and release scheme introduced in December, this can be shortened if they have a private test five days after their departure and it comes back negative. It is possible lorry drivers could be exempt, but no final decision has been made During the first lockdown, the government argued against introducing border restrictions while the prevalence was so high in the UK, with experts arguing it would do little to bring down infection rates. A quarantine period, however, was introduced in June after the first peak, when cases were more under control. Earlier, Home Secretary Priti Patel was accused of leaving the ""nation's doors unlocked"" to new coronavirus variants coming to Britain from overseas. Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds wrote to Ms Patel calling for an ""urgent review and improvement plan"" as he raised concerns over checks on the arrival of people who are meant to go into quarantine. He wrote: ""It is especially worrying given the concerns regarding mutation of the virus that emerged in South Africa, which the health secretary rightly said is 'incredibly worrying'. ""However, the lack of a robust quarantine system as a result of shortcomings from the government mean that it is virtually impossible to keep a grip on this spread or other variants that may come from overseas, leaving the UK defenceless, and completely exposed, with the nation's doors unlocked to further Covid mutations."" The Home Office defended its ""stringent measures"", and pointed to its move to stop direct flights from South Africa to the UK amid concerns over a new coronavirus variant in high prevalence there.

Democrat 'set to win' Georgia Senate run-off raceUS TV networks project Raphael Warnock will become the first black senator for the southern state.US Election 2020,"This video can not be played If confirmed, Mr Warnock will be the first black senator for the state of Georgia The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia. Pastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other. If they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda. He said it was ""time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity"". Follow our live updates from Georgia and Congress The election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win. None of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. Why Georgia wins would be huge for Biden Who is Georgia's Reverend Raphael Warnock? Georgia election: Trump voter fraud claims and others fact-checked With 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. Mr Warnock's and Mr Ossoff's positions have been boosted by Joe Biden's presidential election win in Georgia Control of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off. Mr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. He serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached. Claiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said. If both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives. Mr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years. A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. Final results are expected later on Wednesday. The margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler. Edison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. More than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? More than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Although the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers. The two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency. If it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state. But Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state. It turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate.

'Scared' nursery staff turn up for workThe government closed schools to help reduce the virus spread but says nurseries should stay open.Somerset,"Paul Trauberman from Rainbow Smiles said it was hard to give reassurance without knowing the facts about the new variant Nursery staff say they are being ""treated like the bottom of the rung"" after schools in England were told to shut to reduce the virus transmission. Paul Trauberman, of Rainbow Smiles in Weston-super-Mare, said despite his staff being ""scared"" about the new Covid-19 variant they had come to work. The governmentannounced a strict lockdown across the countryon Monday. It was after the UK moved toCovid-19 threat level five, meaning there is a risk the NHS could be overwhelmed. Mr Trauberman, who took over Rainbow Smiles nursery in 2016, said he felt conflicted. ""I've come in this morning and I've got staff crying and saying they are scared of this new variant."" ""We don't have PPE, we can't social distance, on the other hand we still have a business that is operational and we are not going bankrupt."" He said prolonged closure also carried the risk of going out of business but it was difficult to reassure staff when ""you don't have any of the facts"". ""One minute it is fine and the schools are going back, and two days later they are sending everyone home. ""It makes the staff feel insecure and... they just feel like they are being treated like the bottom of the rung. Schools are expected to remain closed until after the February half-term ""With this new variant ... they are having to deal with very close contact with children, with a virus around, which they are saying is very, very bad, but with no more information than that."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""Early years settings remain low risk environments for children and staff and there is no evidence that the new variant of coronavirus disproportionately affects young children."" Nurseries, schools and sport: Why are the rules different this time? It said keeping nurseries open supported parents and delivered crucial education for children as Bristol mother-of-three Eleni Franklin has found. She said she ""really valued"" Acorns Nursery in Henbury Hill, being open as she and her husband are both key workers - so their children, Allegra, five, Aria, two and Rafe nine-months-old, will attend school and nursery throughout the lockdown. ""I can see that nurseries are different to schools. There has been one case at Aria's nursery during this whole period, whereas in school there has been quite a few,"" she said. Eleni Franklin said she could see why nurseries were being treated differently to schools ""The nursery have been pretty good and although I understand there is a risk to staff, they have put a lot of measures in place to keep people safe."" One of the biggest challenges for nurseries - with some staff now unable to work because of their own childcare responsibilities - is maintaining child-to-staff ratios. Mr Trauberman said they worked on a basis of one-to-three for babies, one-to-four for under-three's and one-to-eight with under five-year-olds. ""We are trying to maintain these bubbles, but normally we would move staff around to accommodate highs and lows of staff and children, to balance it out, but we are unable to do that to enable these bubbles,"" he said. His nursery is now identifying families that could potentially keep their children at home if they were unable to meet those ratios. Mr Trauberman, who is a member of an online group for nursery owners, said some people were calling for nurseries to shut, but said if that happened they risked ""not having a business to come back to"". ""Small businesses are the backbone of the country and if a lot of those go under, the financial implications for the whole country are going to be catastrophic."" Mother-of-two Kara Willetts, from Tewkesbury in Gloucestershire, said she felt it was important her daughter Isobel continued going to nursery as she noticed her behaviour had changed when she had to stop going during the first lockdown in March. ""Isobel is a really sociable, outgoing child and she really suffered with not going in and seeing her friends during the first lockdown. Her mental health suffered and she displayed behaviour I had never seen from her before,"" she said. Kara Willetts said her daughter Isobel's mental health suffered when nurseries closed during the first lockdown Mrs Willetts said she had full confidence in the measures introduced at the nursery three-and-a-half-year-old Isobel attends in Cheltenham. She said that with her husband working from home and a seven-month-old son also at home, the option of Isobel going to nursery was ""beneficial to the whole family"". ""It is quite difficult for my husband to concentrate on work with two kids at home. Transmission rates in young children are very low and if I had any safety concerns I wouldn't send Isobel there,"" she added. Tom Shea, a former advisor to the Early Year's minister, said: ""The biggest issue is that as a society we regard childcare as something like babysitting, rather than the start of the early year's development of learning. ""Sadly it seems the main reason for keeping us open is for protecting employment rather than protecting children."" Mr Shea owns Child First Nursery in Worksop and said he thought there was a ""hierarchy"" among key workers in terms of vaccination priorities. He said ""sensibly"" the first priority was NHS staff, followed by social carers for the elderly. He said teachers ranked a ""reasonable"" third, but that Early Years workers did not feature at all. ""They are expected just to work, and I am not sure if the government thinks that we are invisible,"" he said. He called for early vaccination of Early Years workers to allow them to stay open and be protected. ""The irony now is that we are being told to keep open even though we are private businesses, we are dictated to about the funding we can receive and how we receive itâ¦ and if parents are frightened of their children going into the childcare setting then suddenly we don't get paid for that, so you find nurseries half empty being forced to open and it is not economical to do that."" A Department for Education spokesperson said: ""We are funding nurseries as usual and all children are able to attend their early years setting in all parts of England. ""Working parents on coronavirus support schemes will still remain eligible for childcare support even if their income levels fall below the minimum requirement.""

Bosses 'earn average worker's salary in 34 hours'FTSE 100 chiefs will by Wednesday have earned more this year than the average worker's annual wage.BusinessCan Scotland hold an election during the pandemic?Scotland is due to go to the polls in May - although the election is likely to be very different than usual.Scotland politics,"Bosses of Britain's biggest companies will earn more in the first three days of this week than the average worker's annual wage, research claims. By 17:30 GMT on Wednesday, the pay of FTSE 100 chiefs will have overtaken the Â£31,461 annual median wage for full time workers, the High Pay Centre says. Bosses' pay was flat last year, while average wages generally rose slightly. That meant that FTSE chief executives had to work 34 hours to beat median annual pay, not the 33 hours in 2020. The High Pay Centre think-tank based its annual calculations on analysis of disclosures in companies' annual reports, combined with government statistics. High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said chief executive pay is about 120 times that of the typical UK worker, up significantly from two decades ago. ""Estimates suggest it was around 50 times at the turn of the millennium or 20 times in the early 1980s,"" he said. ""Factors such as the increasing role played by the finance industry in the economy, the outsourcing of low-paid work and the decline of trade union membership have widened the gaps between those at the top and everybody else over recent decades."" He said the figures should raise concern about the governance of Britain's biggest companies. ""They should also prompt debate about the effects that high levels of inequality can have on social cohesion, crime, and public health and wellbeing,"" he said. Median FTSE 100 chief executive pay was Â£3.61m in 2019, the last year for which a full set of data is available, the High Pay Centre said. The centre said its analysis was based on chief executives' average working day being 12 hours. However, critics said such analysis just fuels the politics of envy without looking at why chief executives matter and the contribution they make. Daniel Pryor, head of programmes at the Adam Smith Institute, said: ""Good management is more important than ever in a globalised world and small differences in top talent make a big impact on a business' bottom line. ""That bottom line makes a big difference to workers across the UK, anyone with a private pension, and shareholders."" He pointed out that there is strong, if morbid, evidence about chief executive deaths that shows why the corporate and investment world believe leadership makes a huge difference to the fortunes of their companies. ""In the past 60 years, unexpected CEO deaths have consistently affected stock price, profitability, investment and sales growth - for better or worse,"" he said, adding: ""Which is why it makes sense for firms to open their wallets to attract the best talent.""

Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?""

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection. ""It's a universal right,"" President AndrÃ©s Manuel LÃ³pez Obrador told a news conference on Wednesday, according to Reuters news agency. ""We would do it."" He gave no details about how such a plan would be implemented, or who would  be eligible to receive a vaccine. Many undocumented migrants in the US are from Mexico. The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"". He added Johnson also ""outlined his vision for building back better from the pandemic"". Downing Street said Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Trade Secretary Liz Truss also joined the call. He said: ""The chancellor also spoke about his optimism for the UK economy in 2021 and committed to using all the levers at his disposal to drive growth across the entire UK which meets our climate ambitions."" The conversation also took in the Brexit trade deal, No 10 said, as well as the government's ""urgent ambition to unite and level up across the country by investing in education, skills, technology and infrastructure"". Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external. It says members of the public should first be encouraged to comply with the law. ""Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" it says. For participation in gatherings, fixed penalty notices start at Â£100 and can rise to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. There are fines of Â£10,000 for organisers of restricted gatherings. It also says, in addition to businesses already closed, aquariums and zoos, including safari parks and wildlife centres, are among the attractions that must close. MPs have voted to approve the law which introduced a new lockdown in England this morning. A total of 524 MPs voted in favour of the restrictions, compared to 16 who voted against. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month. Here's a closer look at the data: Itâs been a busy day so far and MPs are continuing to debate
the new lockdown in England in the House of Commons. Weâre not expecting a vote
until about 19:00 GMT, but weâll continue to bring you the latest on our live
page. Hereâs a round-up of the main coronavirus headlines in the UK:  Tory MP Sir Desmond Swayne is making his criticism of lockdowns very clear in his allotted time in the Commons. He calls it a ""situation of state capture"" where the government is ""completely enthralled to a lobby driving a policy that has manifestly failed"" - slamming the ""increasing iterations of this policy with ever tighter controls and restrictions in the hope it may finally work"". After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame. ""And on that occasion at least, they will be right."" Shane HarrisonBBC News Dublin correspondent The Irish government has announced a raft of measures to fight the coronavirus including school closures. Non-essential construction will also be shut down and air passengers must have negative Covid-19 PCR tests 72 hours before flying into the state. PCR tests are regarded as the ""gold standard"" of testing. The travel restriction will apply to passengers from Britain and South Africa before an anticipated extension to all visitors. The Taoiseach (Irish PM) has told a news conference that public compliance with the measures will reflect on how many people may die. MÃ­cheÃ¡l Martin said he expected people to ""face the coming month with steely determination and resolve."" Read the full story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

US Congress set to certify Biden win amid protests,"This video can not be played Police place US Capitol Building on lockdown after Trump supporters breached security lines Violent supporters of President Donald Trump have breached the Capitol in Washington, as lawmakers met to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's poll win. In dramatic scenes, demonstrators swarmed the building as Congress members were escorted out by police. Mr Biden said it was an ""insurrection"", and Mr Trump released a video message asking supporters to go home. The joint session of Congress certifying Mr Biden's win has been suspended and forced into recess. There are reports of guns drawn in the building and at least one person shot. A woman was reported to be in a critical condition and several police were injured. There has been an armed confrontation at the doors of the House of Representatives. Tear gas has also been used. Follow our live updates from Washington US Capitol stormed - in pictures World leaders react to 'horrifying' scenes in Washington Rioters were seen marching through the building chanting ""We want Trump"" and one was photographed in the Senate president's chair. Washington police said it was clear the crowd was intent on using chemical irritants to force entry to the building. Tear gas is used to disperse protesters at the Capitol building After an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement. But there is little sign that the protesters are obeying Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT). Mr Trumprecorded a video message on Twitter,externalcalling on supporters to leave the Capitol, but continuing to make unsubstantiated claims that Democrats had stolen the election. ""I know your pain, I know you're hurt,"" he said. ""You have to go home now, we have to have peace... we don't want anybody hurt."" Mr Biden said the demonstration ""borders on sedition and it must end now"". ""At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault,"" he said. Political figures across the world expressed shock.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned ""disgraceful scenes""and called for a ""peaceful and orderly transfer of power"". Mr Trump's spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, tweeted that the National Guard was being deployed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Troops and police have also been mobilised in neighbouring states, and the FBI has been deployed to help Capitol police. There are also reports of protests at state legislatures around the country. By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington On the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters are packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers keep a watchful eye. The mood here is tense and defiant. ""We're not [expletive] Antifa!"" one man screams at the police, referring to the loose coalition of ""anti-fascist"" activists that oppose Mr Trump. Trump loyalists near him wave placards that say ""show us the ballots"". ""All we want is for the Capitol police to stand down, and surrender the building to us,"" says one man to news cameras, as he is filmed by other Trump supporters. The conviction here is that the election was stolen from President Trump, and the lawmakers inside the building should do their duty and somehow award the election to him. Never mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence. It's a siege mentality here, as word spreads through the crowd that the National Guard is on its way to the Capitol. A joint session of Congress was being held to certify Mr Biden's election victory on 3 November. The proceedings are usually brief and ceremonial but Republican lawmakers have been objecting to some results. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters For days Mr Trump had also been putting pressure on Mr Pence, who is presiding over the session, to block certification of the result. The people who still believe Trump won Can rebel Republicans overturn the election? What is the electoral college? But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said that he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". The protesters arrived at the Capitol from a ""Save America Rally"", where Mr Trump had urged them to support those legislators opposing Mr Biden's confirmation. Mr Trump has refused to concede the 3 November election, repeatedly alleging fraud without providing any evidence. Police have been taking up position inside the Capitol building On Wednesday, he said again: ""We will never give up. We will never concede."" He has also tried to throw doubt on the integrity of Tuesday's Senate run-off votes in the southern, traditionally Republican, state of Georgia.Projections by US TV networks suggest the Democrats have won one of the seatsand are neck-and-neck for the second seat. If the Democrats win both they will gain effective control of the Senate - something that will help Mr Biden push forward his agenda after he is inaugurated as president on 20 January.

'Deepfake porn images still give me nightmares',"Helen Mort was told no action could be taken over the deepfake porn images A woman who has been the victim of deepfake pornography is calling for a change in the law. Last year, Helen Mort discovered that non-sexual images of her had been uploaded to a porn website. Users of the site were invited to edit the photos, merging Helen's face with explicit and violent sexual images. Speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live's Mobeen Azhar, Helen said she wanted to see the creation and distribution of these images made an offence. ""This is a crime which in many cases is going on invisibly,"" Helen said. ""Those images of me had been out there for years and I didn't know about them, and I'm still having nightmares about some of them now. It's an incredibly serious form of abuse."" Deepfakes are realistic computer-generated images or video, based on a real person. This video can not be played Actress Bella Thorne opens up about her experience of deepfake abuse Helen, a poet and writer from Sheffield, was alerted to the deepfake images by an acquaintance. The original images were taken from her social media and included holiday pictures and photos from her pregnancy. She said although some of the images were clearly manipulated, there were a few more ""chilling"" examples that were a ""lot more plausible'. ""You go through different phases with things like this,"" she said. ""There was one point where I was just trying to laugh about the almost ridiculous nature of some of it. ""But obviously, the underlying feeling was shock and actually I initially felt quite ashamed, as if I'd done something wrong. That was quite a difficult thing to overcome. And then for a while I got incredibly anxious about even leaving the house."" She alerted the police to the images but was told that no action could be taken. Dr Aislinn O'Connell, a lecturer in law at Royal Holloway University of London, explained that Helen's case fell outside the current law. ""In England and Wales, under section 33 of the Criminal Justice and Courts Act 2015, it is an offence to non-consensually distribute a private sexual photograph or film with the intent to cause distress to the person depicted,"" she said. ""But this only applies where the original photo or video was private and sexual. ""In Helen's situation, where non-sexual photos were merged with sexual photos, this isn't covered by the criminal offence. ""Furthermore, as the photos were not shared with Helen directly, nor did the intention seem to be to cause distress to Helen, the second element is not fulfilled - even though it did, evidently, cause distress. The other potential criminal offence would be harassment, but given the perpetrator here did not direct it at Helen herself, this didn't apply either."" This video can not be played Deepfake videos: Can you really believe what you see? The independent Law Commission is currently reviewing the law as it applies to taking, making and sharing intimate images without consent. The outcome of the consultation is due to be published later this year. However, Dr O'Connell said the process of changing the law would take years which she says is ""too long"". Helen hopes to use her experience to raise awareness around deepfake pornography and has launched a petition calling for a change in the law. It has received more than 3,400 signatures. She has also written a poem in response to the images. ""I'm a writer by trade,"" she said. ""And I thought the only thing that is going to allow me to reclaim any sense of agency here is to say something about it using my art form. That's the only power that I have. ""The intention of this person, as they said in their post, was to humiliate. They said they wanted to see this person humiliated, and I thought well actually I'm not humiliated, and I'm going to speak out about it because I shouldn't be the one who feels ashamed."" The Home Office said it was taking steps to tackle new and emerging forms of violence against women and girls, including intimate image abuse, ""whether this be cyber flashing, revenge porn or deep fake videos."" ""We are currently consulting on the development of our new strategy to tackle violence against women and girls and we encourage people to give their views,"" a spokesperson said. ""This new strategy will ensure victims and survivors are supported, and that perpetrators are identified and brought to justice.""

The president's comments come after Nebraska Governor Pete Ricketts, a Republican, said undocumented workers at the state's meat-packing plants would probably be excluded from receiving vaccinations. ""You're supposed to be a legal resident of the country to be able to be working in those plants, so I do not expect that illegal immigrants will be part of that vaccine programme,"" Ricketts said, according to Reuters news agency. Business leaders have been thanked for their efforts helping to keep the UK moving during the pandemic, in a call with the prime minister and chancellor. A spokesman said the PM opened the call with 250 executives by ""recognising 2020 has been a tough year for businesses across the country, thanking them for their huge efforts helping to keep the country moving and looking ahead to the rollout of the vaccine as a source of hope this year"". He added Johnson also ""outlined his vision for building back better from the pandemic"". Downing Street said Business Secretary Alok Sharma and Trade Secretary Liz Truss also joined the call. He said: ""The chancellor also spoke about his optimism for the UK economy in 2021 and committed to using all the levers at his disposal to drive growth across the entire UK which meets our climate ambitions."" The conversation also took in the Brexit trade deal, No 10 said, as well as the government's ""urgent ambition to unite and level up across the country by investing in education, skills, technology and infrastructure"". Helen CattPolitical correspondent Few MPs rebelled on the new national lockdown restrictions. Most agree they are needed now, even if they don't like them. The start of the vaccination programme does seem to have changed the political landscape too. This vote means the government will not have to face MPs again on these restrictions until March. The questions from some Tory backbenchers suggest there will be pressure on the government to start lifting them long before then though - perhaps as soon as next month if the vaccination programme goes to plan. MPs have also indicated they will be watching its progress with close attention  The College of Policing and National Police Chief's Councilhas published its guidance on England's lockdown restrictions,external. It says members of the public should first be encouraged to comply with the law. ""Enforcement can follow without repeated attempts to encourage people to comply with the law,"" it says. For participation in gatherings, fixed penalty notices start at Â£100 and can rise to Â£6,400 for the sixth and subsequent offences. There are fines of Â£10,000 for organisers of restricted gatherings. It also says, in addition to businesses already closed, aquariums and zoos, including safari parks and wildlife centres, are among the attractions that must close. MPs have voted to approve the law which introduced a new lockdown in England this morning. A total of 524 MPs voted in favour of the restrictions, compared to 16 who voted against. The Greek Orthodox Patriarch of Jerusalem led a service at Bethlehem's Church of the Nativity While we await the results of the vote, let's see how Orthodox Christians around the world have been marking Christmas. The festival is celebrated on 6 January every year by worshippers from Russia and Greece to Syria and the West Bank. In many countries the effect of the pandemic could be seen, with many people wearing face masks during Christmas church services. Worshippers in  St Petersburg, Russia, wore face masks Branches were burned during traditional Christmas celebrations in Montenegro Members of the Armenian Orthodox Church attended a service in the Syrian capital Damascus After debating the new lockdown law in England for over four hours, MPs are now voting on whether to approve it. Members do have the power to reject the regulations, even though they have already come into force, and a few vocal Tory backbenchers have made it clear they will vote against their government. But with Labour pledging its support to the measures, we expect it to pass with a handsome majority. We should get the result in around 15 minutes so we will let you know as soon as we can. Health Minister Helen Whately is the last person to speak in today's debate. She says the government does not want to impose the restrictions but they are necessary to protect the NHS. ""But we must be ready to lift them as soon as we are able to do so,"" she adds. Whately says the letter of the law provides for a lockdown to last until 31 March, but that is not the plan. Instead, the government wants to allow for a ""steady, controlled and evidence-led move down the tiers on a basis"" as cases fall, and she promises the lockdown ""will be kept under continuous review"". She appeals to MPs - including on her own benches - to support the law, adding: ""We do have some difficult weeks ahead... but we are now in the final stretch with the end in sight."" The debate is now coming to an end, with both the main parties being able to make final comments. Labour's shadow health minister Alex Norris says the daily figures of deaths - 1,041 - are ""sobering"", and his party will support the lockdown for England. He says the new restrictions were not ""inevitable"", but adds: ""It is clear we are in a very challenging moment indeed"", saying locking down was in the ""national interest"" to protect the NHS. Norris says the previous tier system ""failed"" and it is ""a characterisation [of the government] acting too slow and always short, trying to do the bare minimum and never doing enough"". He calls on the government to use the lockdown to fix the problems it faces, such as ensuring those self-employed people who have not had support get help, to improve test and trace, and to improve Covid measures at the border and airports. The shadow minister concludes with ""a simple message"" - ""stay at home, protect the NHS and vaccinate Britain"".  Lebanon has announced a record number of new cases for the second day in a row, as the country prepares to enter a new lockdown. According to the Ministry of Health, 4,166 new daily infections were recorded on Wednesday, while 21 people also died. The news comes ahead of the country's third lockdown, which is due to come into force on Thursday and will last until the end of January. The rules include travel restrictions and an overnight curfew. There are concerns over the potential impact of the latest rise in infections, which come as the country struggles to deal with the fallout from a deadly explosion in the capital Beirut in August and a crippling economic crisis. The UK has reported its highest daily death toll since April last year. Meanwhile, the number of Covid patients in hospitals is more than a third higher than the previous peak - recorded in the same month.

the new lockdown in England in the House of Commons. Weâre not expecting a vote

After making it clear he shall vote against his own government, Sir Desmond gives a warning to his colleagues who will back the law ""buoyed up by opinion pollsters telling them that actually the voters are in favour"". He says: ""I will point out that when the devastating economic consequences of this policy come home to roost... those same voters who were so enthusiastic will abandon them and they will be back to point a finger of blame.

Trump bans Alipay and seven other Chinese appsThe latest executive order by the US president will only take effect after he has left office.Business,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese apps. The apps include popular payments platform Alipay, as well as QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay. The order, which takes effect in 45 days, says that the apps are being banned because they are a threat to US national security.

Itâs been another busy day of developments in the UK, with the prime minister, health and education secretary all addressing the Commons. The highest daily death toll since April was also recorded. Hereâs a round-up of the main headlines: Here's a reminder of the day's top international stories: An NHS hospital doctor has criticised the governmentâs decision not to bring in a lockdown before Christmas. Speaking on the BBC's Question Time programme, Dr Rachel Clarke said conditions in hospitals were ""unimaginable"". She said: ""We have ambulances queuing up outside - patients we can't get them out of the ambulances into hospitals because every single bed in intensive care, in the wards, in A&E is full."" She added: ""Tonight I had messages from a doctor in London to tell me that police cars are delivering critically-ill Covid patients into his hospital in London because there are no ambulances. ""That is how bad things are. How could the government have allowed things to get so bad?"" Dr Clarke, who is also an author, said ministers should not have ""ignored"" the independent advisory group Sage when they suggested as early as September that a ""circuit breaker"" was required  - and before Christmas to have a lockdown.

Asked by a member of the public on the BBC's Question Time programme why there appeared to be a ""lack of joined-up planning"" compared to other countries, Nadhim Zahawi highlighted the target to vaccinate just under 14 million people by the middle of February. He said: ""Between the 4 of January and the 11 January you'll see another step up."" Prof Mark Walport, a member of the independent government's advisory group Sage, told the programme: ""We are in a race between getting people vaccinated and this new more transmissible variant.""

Fergus WalshMedical editor I'm standing in what should be an operating theatre - but instead it's been converted into an intensive care unit for Covid-19 patients on ventilators. This is the first time I have seen it full of patients like this. Normally this theatre would be busy with major cancer surgery, but that's been transferred to another building. A children's recovery area, still decorated with colourful stickers of cartoons, is once again filled with desperately sick adults. Every day, more wards are being transformed into ICU - ready for the next influx of patients. We have been given access to University College Hospital, in central London. This is the same intensive care unit that I visited in April, during the first peak. It is one of the busiest hospitals in the capital and intensive care here is expanding across a hospital that is under pressure like never before, from a relentless rise in Covid admissions. I am struck by the toll the pandemic is taking on staff. It's immense - both physically and mentally. They are shell-shocked. ""My emotions are all over the place. Scared, sad, petrified, worried,"" one ICU nurse tells me. They have got three times as many critically ill patients in the hospital as normal. The number of Covid admissions to London hospitals has doubled in just two weeks - they're more stretched now than at the peak last April. Senior staff are worried. Read the full story here. Mexico's president has said his country is ready to vaccinate undocumented migrants living in the US, after a US governor said they would be unlikely to receive an injection.

No police officers charged in Jacob Blake shootingWisconsin's district attorney says no-one will face charges over the shooting of the black man in August.,"Jacob Blake (left) was shot several times in the back No police officer will face charges over the shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin - an incident which sparked protests in the US. Mr Blake was left paralysed from the waist down after being shot several times in the back as he got into a car where his three children were sitting. The shooting of Mr Blake, a black man, by white policeman Rusten Sheskey on 23 August aggravated racial tensions. Two people died and one was injured in another shooting in Kenosha days later. Should Wisconsin police have used different tactics? Paralysed Jacob Blake 'released from handcuffs' Kyle Rittenhouse, now 18, denied six charges including first-degree reckless homicide over those shootings when he appeared at a virtual arraignment with his lawyer, Mark Richards, on Tuesday. He was among many armed civilians who descended on the city in answer to calls from right-wing militia after Jacob Blake was shot. Kenosha County District Attorney Michael Graveley announced that no criminal charges would be brought against Officer Sheskey. The shooting was captured on video by a bystander. The district attorney said he ""would have to disprove the clear expression of these officers that they had to fire a weapon to defend themselves"". ""I do not believe the state... would be able to prove that the privilege of self-defence is not available,"" he said,quoted by the Associated Press,external. Mr Graveley added that he had informed Mr Blake of the news before announcing his decision publicly. The Kenosha police union said Mr Blake had been armed with a knife and Officer Sheskey had ordered him several times to drop it but he had refused. The police officer's lawyer, Brendan Matthews, said Officer Sheskey had fired because Mr Blake had started turning towards him while holding a knife. However, state investigators said only that officers had seen a knife on the floor of the car and did not say whether Mr Blake had threatened anyone with it. The police officers involved were not equipped with body cameras. This video can not be played Jacob Blake's sister: 'I have been watching police murder people that look like me for years' The person who shot the video, Raysean White, told CNN that before he had begun filming, he had seen police wrestle, punch and Taser Mr Blake.

As he opens the door and leans into the car, one officer can be seen grabbing his shirt and opening fire. Seven shots can be heard in the video, as witnesses shout and scream. Mr White told AP he had heard police officers shout ""Drop the knife!"" before gunfire erupted but said he had not seen a knife in Mr Blake's hands.

Trump bans Alipay and seven other Chinese apps,"US President Donald Trump has signed an executive order banning transactions with eight Chinese apps. The apps include popular payments platform Alipay, as well as QQ Wallet and WeChat Pay. The order, which takes effect in 45 days, says that the apps are being banned because they are a threat to US national security. It flags the possibility that the apps could be used to track and build dossiers on US federal employees. Tencent QQ, CamScanner, SHAREit, VMate and WPS Office are also included within the order, which only kicks in after Mr Trump has left office. ""The United States must take aggressive action against those who develop or control Chinese connected software applications to protect our national security,"" the order said. NYSE does a U-turn on Chinese telecoms delistings We're proud of what we've done, says Trump's trade chief China escalates tit-for-tat trade war with US President Trump's order says ""by accessing personal electronic devices such as smartphones, tablets, and computers, Chinese connected software applications can access and capture vast swaths of information from users, including sensitive personally identifiable information and private information."" The Trump administration has ratcheted up pressure on Chinese companies in its final months in office, including those it considers a national security risk. President Trump has signed executive orders against a range of Chinese firms arguing they could share data with the Chinese government. This video can not be played Panorama: How safe is TikTok for young users? Chinese social media app TikTok and telecoms giant Huawei have been among the casualties of Washington's crackdown. Last month, the Commerce Department added dozens of Chinese companies, including the country's top chipmaker SMIC and drone manufacturer DJI Technology, to a trade blacklist. The administration also restricted a number of Chinese and Russian companies with alleged military ties from buying sensitive US goods and technology. China has consistently denied claims that these firms share their data with the Chinese government and has responded by imposing its own export laws restricting the export of military technology. In August, the US ordered ByteDance, the owner of social media app TikTok, to either shut down or sell off its US assets. Despite missing a deadline to complete the sale, the US is yet to shut down the app and negotiations continue over its future. The latest ban comes as the White House quietly pushed the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) to consider a second U-turn on its decision to delist three Chinese telecoms giants. Last week the NYSE announced it would delist the China Mobile, China Telecom and China Unicom in line with another executive order. On Monday, however, the NYSE reversed that decision, announcing it had decided not to delist the three companies after further consultation with US regulators. The NYSE made the decision based on ambiguity about whether the securities were actually covered by the order. However, the exchange has come under pressure over its decision. The US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin called the NYSE President Stacey Cunningham to tell her he disagrees with the decision, according to Reuters. Republican Senator and China hardliner Marco Rubio has also spoken out, saying that the NYSE's refusal to delist the companies was an ""outrageous effort"" to undermine the President's executive order. The NYSE is owned by Atlanta-based Intercontinental Exchange (ICE), which is run by billionaire Jeffrey Sprecher. His wife Kelly Loeffler is one of two Republican senators facing run-off elections on Tuesday in Georgia.

Georgia Senate races on a knife-edge in vote count,"This video can not be played If confirmed, Mr Warnock will be the first black senator for the state of Georgia The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia. Pastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other. If they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda. He said it was ""time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity"". Follow our live updates from Georgia and Congress The election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win. None of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. Why Georgia wins would be huge for Biden Who is Georgia's Reverend Raphael Warnock? Georgia election: Trump voter fraud claims and others fact-checked With 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. Mr Warnock's and Mr Ossoff's positions have been boosted by Joe Biden's presidential election win in Georgia Control of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off. Mr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. He serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached. Claiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said. If both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives. Mr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years. A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. Final results are expected later on Wednesday. The margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler. Edison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. More than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? More than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Although the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers. The two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency. If it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state. But Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state. It turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate.

Bosses 'earn average workers' salary in 34 hours',"Bosses of Britain's biggest companies will earn more in the first three days of this week than the average worker's annual wage, research claims. By 17:30 GMT on Wednesday, the pay of FTSE 100 chiefs will have overtaken the Â£31,461 annual median wage for full time workers, the High Pay Centre says. Bosses' pay was flat last year, while average wages generally rose slightly. That meant that FTSE chief executives had to work 34 hours to beat median annual pay, not the 33 hours in 2020. The High Pay Centre think-tank based its annual calculations on analysis of disclosures in companies' annual reports, combined with government statistics. High Pay Centre director Luke Hildyard said chief executive pay is about 120 times that of the typical UK worker, up significantly from two decades ago. ""Estimates suggest it was around 50 times at the turn of the millennium or 20 times in the early 1980s,"" he said. ""Factors such as the increasing role played by the finance industry in the economy, the outsourcing of low-paid work and the decline of trade union membership have widened the gaps between those at the top and everybody else over recent decades."" He said the figures should raise concern about the governance of Britain's biggest companies. ""They should also prompt debate about the effects that high levels of inequality can have on social cohesion, crime, and public health and wellbeing,"" he said. Median FTSE 100 chief executive pay was Â£3.61m in 2019, the last year for which a full set of data is available, the High Pay Centre said. The centre said its analysis was based on chief executives' average working day being 12 hours. However, critics said such analysis just fuels the politics of envy without looking at why chief executives matter and the contribution they make. Daniel Pryor, head of programmes at the Adam Smith Institute, said: ""Good management is more important than ever in a globalised world and small differences in top talent make a big impact on a business' bottom line. ""That bottom line makes a big difference to workers across the UK, anyone with a private pension, and shareholders."" He pointed out that there is strong, if morbid, evidence about chief executive deaths that shows why the corporate and investment world believe leadership makes a huge difference to the fortunes of their companies. ""In the past 60 years, unexpected CEO deaths have consistently affected stock price, profitability, investment and sales growth - for better or worse,"" he said, adding: ""Which is why it makes sense for firms to open their wallets to attract the best talent.""

UK new car sales suffer worst year for decadesNew 2020 car registrations sink to a 30-year low and see biggest one-year drop since the Second World WarBusiness,"New car registrations fell to their lowest level in nearly three decades last year, according to preliminary figures from the industry's trade body. It was also the biggest one-year fall since World War Two, when factories were being turned over to military production, the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. About 1.63 million new cars were registered in 2020, compared with 2.3 million in 2019 - a decline of 29%. It was the lowest total since 1992. The bulk of the lost sales occurred during the first lockdown in the Spring, when showrooms were forced to close, and factories shut down. ""We lost half a million units from March, April, May - and we never recovered them,"" said the SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes. The restrictions introduced later in the year were less damaging, largely because dealers were able to sell cars remotely, using 'click and collect' services. That remains the case during the new lockdown, announced on Monday. ""We can still do click and collect, which is important, because that's the very minimum we need,"" said Mr Hawes. ""Not just to keep retail going, but also to keep manufacturing going."" Overall, the SMMT said the Covid crisis has cost the car industry some Â£20bn - and cost the exchequer nearly Â£2bn in lost VAT. There are also serious questions about the extent to which the car market can recover this year. Previous forecasts, which had suggested new registrations could rise to about 2 million in 2021, have been thrown into doubt by the latest restrictions. But while the market as a whole has suffered over the past year, sales of electric cars have risen dramatically, increasing their share of the market from 1.5% to 6.5%. Sales of plug-in hybrids also rose sharply. Car showrooms re-opened from the first lockdown in June ""If we see this continued level of uptake in electric vehicles, then we anticipate that sales of new EVs and plug-in hybrids will overtake diesel cars in 2021,"" said Ian Plummer, commercial director of motoring website Auto Trader. ""Then, pure EVs will overtake those of their internal combustion engine counterparts in 2026."" With the pandemic continuing to inflict serious damage on the industry, Mr Hawes says the trade deal between the UK and the EU came as a ""massive relief"". It confirmed that cars and car parts could continue to move between the two regions, without tariffs - or taxes - being imposed, provided certain conditions are met. Honda factory temporarily suspends production Fiat Chrysler and PSA shareholders approve merger Shift to electric cars 'requires Herculean effort' The SMMT had previously warned that failing to reach a deal could have cost the industry Â£55bn over five years - and add Â£2,000 to the cost of each vehicle But manufacturers still face potentially significant additional costs due to so-called non-tariff barriers - including border formalities, and the need to obtain extra regulatory approvals for new designs. ""This is not a free deal"", said Mr Hawes. Another consequence of the trade deal is that the UK will need to focus on battery production, if it is to maintain its car industry while phasing out petrol and diesel engines. That's because in order to qualify for tariff-free access to the European market, the value of car components made outside the UK and the EU will have to be strictly limited. Specific rules relating to batteries effectively mean that from 2027, they themselves will have to be made in the EU or the UK. The SMMT believes that, based on current investment plans, UK battery factories will have a capacity of 15 gigawatt-hours (GWh) by 2024. That is more than seven times the current level, and would be enough to produce 250,000 electric cars per year. But the SMMT insists much more is needed: 60GWh in order to produce 1 million cars per year by 2030, and 120GWh to produce 2mby 2040. That, says Mr Hawes, will require ""massive investment"".

Mass arrests among Hong Kong pro-democracy camp,"Lester Shum was first barred from running for office, then arrested More than 50 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested in the biggest crackdown since China imposed a draconian security law last year. About 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city. Those held helped run an unofficial ""primary"" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections. They are accused of trying to ""overthrow"" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent. China's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Beijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop ""external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security"". But the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are ""the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment"". Dozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures. Police fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include: long-established opposition figures James To, Lam Cheuk-ting, Claudio Mo and Benny Tai, one of the initiators of the primaries young pro-democracy campaigners Lester Shum, Gwyneth Ho, Tiffany Yuen and Jeffrey Andrews Human rights lawyer John Clancey, a US citizen two academics behind the primaries strategy 13 candidates from the primaries Police also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets. Apple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information. Mr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works. Benny Tai was one of the architects of the primaries Hours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of ""overthrowing"" the city's government. The government will not tolerate ""subversive"" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council. If charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison. The BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call ""white terror"" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory. When authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says. In July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament. More than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests The opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms. Hong Kong's leaderCarrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion,externalif the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election. In July, Joshua Wong (on right in poster) and Lester Shum (on left) had still hoped to run for LegCo Several of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo electionwere later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests. Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers resign en masse Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? Most of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament. The crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong. ""Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it. ""I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people,"" Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency. The arrests have been widely condemned internationally. Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick as next US Secretary of State, said they were an ""assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights"". ""The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy."" Antony Blinken said Washington will stand with Hong Kong UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the arrests were a ""grievous attack"" on rights applied under the joint declaration signed with Britain when the territory was handed over in 1997. He said it demonstrated the national security law was ""being used to crush dissent and opposing political views"". Chris Patten, the territory's last British governor, said: ""The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong. Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society."" Maya Wang, China specialist at Human Rights Watch, said China was now ""removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city"". ""Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government,"" she said. Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist who fled the territory in July last year, said the widespread arrests had taken ""the suppression of political freedom and freedom of speech"" to ""another level"". ""Anyone who is still defending the National Security Law and making peace is the enemy of Hong Kong people."" By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai Beijing sees ""vicious plans"" to topple Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government. Supporters of the dozens arrested see another crude crackdown on what's left of the territory's nascent democracy. Despite co-ordinated international criticism, with some targeted retaliation, led by the US and the UK, the authorities have enthusiastically embraced their powers under the new national security law passed last year. How these latest arrests come under that jurisdiction is not yet clear. But it's worth remembering this law is ambiguous and sweeping in its definition, targeting anyone, anywhere in the world. The street protests are now a distant memory. Some prominent figures have fled to friendly countries, almost certainly never to return. The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. It has been widely criticised by rights groups and Western nations as effectively curtailing dissent. A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It retained more civil and political freedoms than the mainland has. Activists say that in recent years, these freedoms have been eroded. Pro-democracy protests have often led to violent clashes with police. Pro-democracy protests have rocked Hong Kong for years The Chinese government has defended the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice Agnes Chow: Hong Kongâs 'real Mulan' After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety and several high profile court cases under the security law have started.

US Congress set to certify Biden win amid protestsDonald Trump says he will address supporters protesting against the certification of his defeat.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Police place US Capitol Building on lockdown after Trump supporters breached security lines Violent supporters of President Donald Trump have breached the Capitol in Washington, as lawmakers met to confirm President-elect Joe Biden's poll win. In dramatic scenes, demonstrators swarmed the building as Congress members were escorted out by police. Mr Biden said it was an ""insurrection"", and Mr Trump released a video message asking supporters to go home. The joint session of Congress certifying Mr Biden's win has been suspended and forced into recess. There are reports of guns drawn in the building and at least one person shot. A woman was reported to be in a critical condition and several police were injured. There has been an armed confrontation at the doors of the House of Representatives. Tear gas has also been used. Follow our live updates from Washington US Capitol stormed - in pictures World leaders react to 'horrifying' scenes in Washington Rioters were seen marching through the building chanting ""We want Trump"" and one was photographed in the Senate president's chair. Washington police said it was clear the crowd was intent on using chemical irritants to force entry to the building. Tear gas is used to disperse protesters at the Capitol building After an occupation lasting several hours, the sergeant-at-arms - the executive office of the Senate - announced that the building had been secured by law enforcement. But there is little sign that the protesters are obeying Mr Trump's call to go home, despite a citywide curfew declared by the city mayor from 18:00 to 06:00 (23:00 to 11:00 GMT). Mr Trumprecorded a video message on Twitter,externalcalling on supporters to leave the Capitol, but continuing to make unsubstantiated claims that Democrats had stolen the election. ""I know your pain, I know you're hurt,"" he said. ""You have to go home now, we have to have peace... we don't want anybody hurt."" Mr Biden said the demonstration ""borders on sedition and it must end now"". ""At this hour our democracy is under unprecedented assault,"" he said. Political figures across the world expressed shock.UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson condemned ""disgraceful scenes""and called for a ""peaceful and orderly transfer of power"". Mr Trump's spokeswoman, Kayleigh McEnany, tweeted that the National Guard was being deployed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Troops and police have also been mobilised in neighbouring states, and the FBI has been deployed to help Capitol police. There are also reports of protests at state legislatures around the country. By Laura Trevelyan, BBC News, Washington On the steps of Capitol Hill, hundreds of loyal Trump supporters are packed closely together, as nearby armed police officers keep a watchful eye. The mood here is tense and defiant. ""We're not [expletive] Antifa!"" one man screams at the police, referring to the loose coalition of ""anti-fascist"" activists that oppose Mr Trump. Trump loyalists near him wave placards that say ""show us the ballots"". ""All we want is for the Capitol police to stand down, and surrender the building to us,"" says one man to news cameras, as he is filmed by other Trump supporters. The conviction here is that the election was stolen from President Trump, and the lawmakers inside the building should do their duty and somehow award the election to him. Never mind that election officials have certified the results and the courts have thrown out Trump campaign lawsuits alleging fraud because there's no evidence. It's a siege mentality here, as word spreads through the crowd that the National Guard is on its way to the Capitol. A joint session of Congress was being held to certify Mr Biden's election victory on 3 November. The proceedings are usually brief and ceremonial but Republican lawmakers have been objecting to some results. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters For days Mr Trump had also been putting pressure on Mr Pence, who is presiding over the session, to block certification of the result. The people who still believe Trump won Can rebel Republicans overturn the election? What is the electoral college? But in a letter to Congress on Wednesday, Mr Pence said that he had no ""unilateral authority to decide which electoral votes should be counted"". The protesters arrived at the Capitol from a ""Save America Rally"", where Mr Trump had urged them to support those legislators opposing Mr Biden's confirmation. Mr Trump has refused to concede the 3 November election, repeatedly alleging fraud without providing any evidence. Police have been taking up position inside the Capitol building On Wednesday, he said again: ""We will never give up. We will never concede."" He has also tried to throw doubt on the integrity of Tuesday's Senate run-off votes in the southern, traditionally Republican, state of Georgia.Projections by US TV networks suggest the Democrats have won one of the seatsand are neck-and-neck for the second seat. If the Democrats win both they will gain effective control of the Senate - something that will help Mr Biden push forward his agenda after he is inaugurated as president on 20 January.

"Criticism of death sentence on former China tycoonThe harsh penalty for a former finance chief is a ""major step backwards"" says human rights activists.","The death penalty handed out to a former Chinese finance chief found guilty of corruption has been heavily criticised by human rights groups. Lai Xiaomin was arrested in 2018 on charges of taking 1.8bn yuan (Â£200m, $280m) in bribes over a 10-year period. It is one of the most severe sentences to stem from President Xi Jinping's anti-corruption drive. Human Rights Watch said ""China is clearly taking a major step backwards."" Chinese officials said crimes committed by Mr Lai were during his time as chairman of Huarong Asset Management. The financial firm was set up in 1999 to to take bad debts off China's largest state-owned banks. How many countries still have the death penalty? Man sentenced to death in Singapore via Zoom China sentences ex-Interpol chief to 13 years jail On Tuesday, a court in the northern city of Tianjin, said his crimes had ""caused serious losses to the interests of the country"". ""Imposing the death sentence on Lai Xiaomin for financial crimes, such as bribe taking, is outrageous and unacceptable and clearly violates China's commitments to respect international human rights standards,"" Phil Robertson, Deputy Asia Director at Human Rights Watch told the BBC. Mr Robertson said the death penalty should be immediately commuted to prison time. ""By imposing this sentence, China is clearly taking a major step backwards on rights in what appears to be an effort to create fear among businessmen."" Human Rights Watch calls the tactic 'killing the chicken to show it to the monkeys' so it ""makes an example of one person to instil obedience in all the others."" Yaqiu Wang, a China researcher at Human Rights Watch, added that President Xi ""has little intention to end or slow down the campaign"" to stamp out corruption. Human Rights Watch added that it opposes the death penalty in all circumstances as ""inherently cruel, and believes it violates of the right to life and fundamental dignity that all human beings possess."" The group has called on the Chinese government to impose an immediate moratorium on its use. Under Mr Lai's leadership, Huarong raised vast amounts of capital and expanded aggressively into investment banking services. The asset management company which is listed on the Hong Kong stock exchange, also developed its own brokerage, insurance and leasing arms. Caixin, a finance magazine in China, reported that 100 properties developed by a Huarong subsidiary in south China were distributed to Mr Lai's ex-wife and mistresses. China's Communist Party has taken an increasingly tough stance on corruption among government officials and corporate executives, with more than one million punished. In 2016, China raised the threshold for capital punishment related to corruption to 3m yuan from 100,000 yuan, but the penalty has seldom been used. ""China's leaders clearly continue to rely on the death penalty as a deterrent, but it seems they have a message to send to the broader public about their willingness to use it,"" Joshua Rosenzweig, head of Amnesty International's China team, told the BBC. ""If this signals a return to the so-called 'strike hard' approach to crime, then it could have really serious consequences for China,"" he added.

US intelligence accuses Russia of cyber-hack,"US intelligence agencies have said they believe Russia was behind the ""serious"" cyber compromise revealed in December. President Trump had previously suggested China might have been behind the hack, although other members of his administration had pointed the finger at Moscow. In a joint statement, the intelligence bodies say they currently believe fewer than 10 US government agencies saw their data compromised, although other organisations outside of government were also affected. They say work is still going on to understand the scope of the incident, which appears to have been aimed at gathering intelligence and which they say is ""ongoing"" a month after details first emerged. The update on the investigation came in a statement from a task force called the Cyber Unified Coordination Group which was set up to deal with the incident. It comprises intelligence and law enforcement agencies including the FBI and NSA. The group said it was still working to understand the scope of what had taken place. SolarWinds: Why the Sunburst hack matters Five Russian hacks that transformed US cyber-security 'Don't weaponise the net' warns former cyber-chief Eighteen thousand customers who used Orion product from the company Solar Winds were exposed but US intelligence says it believes a much smaller number saw follow-on activity from the hackers in which they stole data. The US Treasury was among those which previously acknowledged being targeted. ""This is a serious compromise that will require a sustained and dedicated effort to remediate,"" the statement said. Many organisations are having to scour their systems for signs that they may have been compromised. The incident sent shockwaves across the US partly because the breach was undiscovered for many months and was potentially far-reaching in terms of who it might have affected. It also suggested a degree of sophistication and stealth which was widely seen as a trademark of hackers from the SVR, Russia's foreign intelligence agency. This video can not be played Experts have been warning for years that it's not a matter of if, but when, hackers will kill somebody Soon after the incident was revealed, President Trump raised the possibility that China might be responsible, but members of his own administration including the secretary of state and attorney general pointed the finger at Moscow. The latest statement shows the assessment of US intelligence agencies is that Russia was behind it, although it does not go so far as accusing the Russian state itself, saying only that the actor was ""likely Russian in origin"". Moscow has denied playing any part. President-elect Joe Biden has previously said it was important to take ""meaningful steps"" to hold those responsible to account. It is not yet clear, though, what that might involve. While some US politicians suggested the breach might even be compared to an ""act of war"", most cyber-experts disputed this and the US intelligence community has now played down suggestions that it could have had destructive impact. Why US spy world is feeling so uneasy right now US cyber-security firm hit by 'state-sponsored' attack ""At this time, we believe this was, and continues to be, an intelligence-gathering effort,"" the latest statement says. This is significant since it suggests no evidence has been found that this was preparatory activity for a more destructive cyber-attack which might switch off systems. This may limit the US response since espionage operations do not breach the cyber norms the US itself promotes (largely because it too carries out such intelligence-gathering operations against other nations). In December UK officials say they believed a small number of UK organisations were affected but said they did not believe they were in the public sector.

Grammy Awards postponed until March,"Dua Lipa has been nominated for six awards in this year's Grammys The 2021 Grammy Awards has been postponed due to coronavirus concerns, say the organisers. The ceremony, one of the music industry's biggest awards, was due to take place on 31 January. The event will now take place on 14 March, due to rising infection numbers in Los Angeles and the state of California. BeyoncÃ©, Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa led the nominations for this years awards, which were announced in November. Grammys 2021: BeyoncÃ© and Dua Lipa lead nominations Grammys drop 'urban' from major award category Will concerts come back in 2021? ""Nothing is more important than the health and safety of those in our music community and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly on producing the show,"" said a statement from the Recording Academy, which runs the Grammys. It is unclear whether comedian Trevor Noah, who was set to host the show, will still take part in this year's ceremony. The Grammys' new date clashes with the previously-announced Screen Actors' Guild awards. The actors union said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the scheduling conflict. ""We announced the same date for the SAG Awards last July with the intent to give the greatest possible scheduling consideration for other awards shows,"" it said in a statement. ""We expect the same consideration from sister organizations throughout the industry."" It said it was in conversation with the Recording Academy in an attempt to resolve the situation. This year's Grammys were already due to be a virtual event, in line with other recent award shows, such as the MTV VMAs and the Billboard Awards. Other major ceremonies, including the Oscars, the Golden Globes and the Brit Awards have already been postponed. The US state of California has been particularly hard hit by the spread of coronavirus, withambulance workers in Los Angeles County being told not to transport patients with extremely low chances of survivalto hospital.

Mass arrests in Hong Kong 'over primary vote',"Lester Shum was first barred from running for office, then arrested More than 50 of Hong Kong's most prominent pro-democracy activists and politicians have been arrested in the biggest crackdown since China imposed a draconian security law last year. About 1,000 police took part in morning raids on 72 premises across the city. Those held helped run an unofficial ""primary"" to pick opposition candidates ahead of postponed 2020 elections. They are accused of trying to ""overthrow"" the government. Activists say the new law aims to quash dissent. China's government imposed the legislation on the semi-autonomous territory in June, saying it was necessary to curb months of sometimes violent pro-democracy protests. Beijing defended Wednesday's arrests, with Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying saying they were needed to stop ""external forces and individuals [colluding] to undermine China's stability and security"". But the crackdown appeared to confirm the fears of many who warned about the reach of the law, with Amnesty International saying the arrests are ""the starkest demonstration yet of how the national security law has been weaponised to punish anyone who dares to challenge the establishment"". Dozens have been arrested under the security law since it was enacted in June, but never have so many been rounded up at the same time as on Wednesday, which marked a major escalation in the crackdown and sent a chill through pro-democracy figures. Police fanned out around the city and in early morning raids detained 53 people who represent a who's who of democratic forces in the former British colony, young and old. They include: long-established opposition figures James To, Lam Cheuk-ting, Claudio Mo and Benny Tai, one of the initiators of the primaries young pro-democracy campaigners Lester Shum, Gwyneth Ho, Tiffany Yuen and Jeffrey Andrews Human rights lawyer John Clancey, a US citizen two academics behind the primaries strategy 13 candidates from the primaries Police also searched the home of already detained activist Joshua Wong, as well as three news outlets. Apple Daily and Stand News, which had co-organised election forums for the primaries candidates, and In-Media, which ran ads around the primaries, were ordered to hand over information. Mr Clancy, a veteran legal activist and long-time resident of Hong Kong, is chairman of the Asian Human Rights Commission and the first US citizen held under the new law. He was detained when police searched the offices of law firm Ho Tse Wai & Partners where he works. Benny Tai was one of the architects of the primaries Hours after the dawn arrests John Lee, Hong Kong's security secretary, confirmed a group of people had been arrested as part of an operation targeting those suspected of ""overthrowing"" the city's government. The government will not tolerate ""subversive"" acts, he said, speaking at the city's Legislative Council. If charged under the new national security law, the detainees could face life in prison. The BBC's Danny Vincent in Hong Kong says the legislation has spread what activists call ""white terror"" across the city. It has all but silenced the street protest movement and led to a growing number of activists fleeing the territory. When authorities introduced the law, they claimed it would target only a small number of activists, but the wide-ranging nature of Wednesday's operation has led many to fear the authorities are now trying to eliminate the entire opposition camp, he says. In July last year, an alliance of opposition parties ran independently organised primaries to see which of their candidates had the best chances in September's election for the Legislative Council (LegCo), Hong Kong's parliament. More than 600,000 people voted in the primaries. The election was later postponed, with officials citing concerns over the coronavirus pandemic as the reason for the delay. China's new law: Why is Hong Kong worried? The background you need on Hong Kong's protests The opposition groups had hoped that winning more seats would give them enough power to block government proposals and increase pressure for democratic reforms. Hong Kong's leaderCarrie Lam had warned at the time the primaries could amount to subversion,externalif the candidates intended to obstruct government policies through their election. In July, Joshua Wong (on right in poster) and Lester Shum (on left) had still hoped to run for LegCo Several of the opposition figures planning to stand in the LegCo electionwere later disqualified from running, including Joshua Wong, Lester Shum and Gwyneth Ho, a former journalist who rose to prominence covering the 2019 protests. Hong Kong pro-democracy lawmakers resign en masse Can Hong Kong's democracy fight survive the walkout? Most of the opposition lawmakers in the current LegCo resigned in November in protest at four of them being dismissed from parliament. The crackdown has stunned people in Hong Kong. ""Seeing the news today I feel completely shocked. I feel very disappointed. It seems that such major things are happening in Hong Kong and there's nothing we can do about it. ""I feel very unhappy and it seems that even during the epidemic the government can still do so many things to terrorise people,"" Mannie Ng, a Hong Kong resident, told Reuters news agency. The arrests have been widely condemned internationally. Antony Blinken, President-elect Joe Biden's pick as next US Secretary of State, said they were an ""assault on those bravely advocating for universal rights"". ""The Biden-Harris administration will stand with the people of Hong Kong and against Beijing's crackdown on democracy."" Antony Blinken said Washington will stand with Hong Kong UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said the arrests were a ""grievous attack"" on rights applied under the joint declaration signed with Britain when the territory was handed over in 1997. He said it demonstrated the national security law was ""being used to crush dissent and opposing political views"". Chris Patten, the territory's last British governor, said: ""The Chinese Communist Party has further turned the screw in Hong Kong. Liberal democracies around the world must continue to speak out against the brutal destruction of a free society."" Maya Wang, China specialist at Human Rights Watch, said China was now ""removing the remaining veneer of democracy in the city"". ""Beijing once again has failed to learn from its mistakes in Hong Kong: that repression generates resistance, and that millions of Hong Kong people will persist in their struggle for their right to vote and run for office in a democratically elected government,"" she said. Nathan Law, a prominent Hong Kong activist who fled the territory in July last year, said the widespread arrests had taken ""the suppression of political freedom and freedom of speech"" to ""another level"". ""Anyone who is still defending the National Security Law and making peace is the enemy of Hong Kong people."" By Robin Brant, BBC News, Shanghai Beijing sees ""vicious plans"" to topple Hong Kong's semi-autonomous government. Supporters of the dozens arrested see another crude crackdown on what's left of the territory's nascent democracy. Despite co-ordinated international criticism, with some targeted retaliation, led by the US and the UK, the authorities have enthusiastically embraced their powers under the new national security law passed last year. How these latest arrests come under that jurisdiction is not yet clear. But it's worth remembering this law is ambiguous and sweeping in its definition, targeting anyone, anywhere in the world. The street protests are now a distant memory. Some prominent figures have fled to friendly countries, almost certainly never to return. The security law punishes what China broadly defines as secession, subversion, terrorism and collusion with foreign forces with up to life in jail. It has been widely criticised by rights groups and Western nations as effectively curtailing dissent. A former British colony, Hong Kong was handed back to China in 1997. It retained more civil and political freedoms than the mainland has. Activists say that in recent years, these freedoms have been eroded. Pro-democracy protests have often led to violent clashes with police. Pro-democracy protests have rocked Hong Kong for years The Chinese government has defended the law, saying it will help return stability to the territory, which has been shaken by pro-democracy protests, and bring it more into line with the Chinese mainland. Hong Kong's rebel mogul and pro-democracy voice Agnes Chow: Hong Kongâs 'real Mulan' After the law was introduced, a number of pro-democracy groups disbanded out of fears for their safety and several high profile court cases under the security law have started.

"UK daily Covid cases top 60,000 for first time","The number of new daily confirmed cases of coronavirus in the UK has topped 60,000 for the first time since the pandemic started. According to government figures on Tuesday,,externalthe number of people who tested positive was 60,916. One in 50 people in private households in England had Covid last week - and one in 30 in London, according to estimates based on the latest data. A further 830 people have also died within 28 days of a positive test. It comes as England and Scotland announced new strict lockdowns, with people told to stay at home. What the rules where you live? Can we really jab our way out of lockdown? When will you be eligible for the vaccine? At a press conference at Downing Street on Tuesday, Boris Johnson said 1.3 million peoplehad now been vaccinatedin the UK - including 23% of over 80s in England, some 650,000 people. But he said more than one million people were currently infected - with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak. The government's chief medical adviser Prof Chris Whitty cited theOffice for National Statistics' random sampling data,externalfor England as showing how widespread the virus is. ""We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,"" he said. That latest estimates include: One in 30 for London One in 45 for south-east England, eastern England and north-west England One in 50 for the East Midlands One in 60 for north-east England One in 65 for the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber One in 135 for south-west England This video can not be played Professor Chris Whitty: ""No evidence"" the new variant is ""more dangerous"" The number of new daily cases has consistently been above 50,000 since 29 December. Back in the first peak of the pandemic in the spring, the number of daily confirmed cases never went above 7,000. However, it is thought the true number of cases then was much higher but not picked up because testing capacity was limited. It was estimated there were about 100,000 new infections a day at the end of March - but there was not the testing to detect it. Hospital admissions of people with Covid-19 in England also reached another record high on Tuesday, NHS England figures show. At a hospital in Lincolnshire, a ""critical"" incidenthas been declaredafter a sharp rise in patients requiring admission. This video can not be played How NHS nurses and doctors are struggling to cope with Covid as cases continue to rise in England And potentially life-saving cancer operationshave been put on holdat a major London NHS trust because of the number of beds taken by Covid patients. However, Cancer Research UK said such cancellations did not appear to be widespread across the country. In a statement after the case numbers were released, Public Health England medical director Yvonne Doyle said the rapid rise in cases was ""highly concerning and will sadly mean yet more pressure on our health services in the depths of winter"". After seven consecutive days of more than 50,000 cases being confirmed, the fact that more than 60,000 have been recorded should not come as a surprise. It will take a week, if not more, for the impact of lockdown to be felt. And all the evidence suggests the new variant of coronavirus, which is more transmissible than previous ones, means the impact is likely to be more limited than it was in previous ones. The figures are also a warning about what the NHS is facing. Some of this week's infections are next week's hospital admissions. About three in 10 beds are now occupied by Covid patients. In some hospitals more than six in 10 are. Hospitals are now busy making more spaces on their wards - that means cancelling planned work, including in some places cancer treatment. Boris Johnson and Scottish First Minister Nicola Sturgeon both announced new lockdowns on Monday. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December and Northern Ireland entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December. Restrictions are also being tightened further in Northern Ireland,and an order for people to stay at home will become legally enforceable from Friday. In a televised address to the nation,Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer urged the government to use the lockdown to create a ""round the clock"" vaccination programme. He also called on people to ""recapture the spirit"" of the beginning of the pandemic. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters At the press conference on Tuesday, Mr Johnson repeated his suggestion that there is a ""prospect"" of the lockdown being eased in mid-February. ""But you will also appreciate there are a lot of caveats, a lot of ifs built into that, the most important of which is that we all now follow the guidance,"" he said. Earlier, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told Sky News he could not say exactly when the lockdown in England would end, but ""as we enter March we should be able to lift some of these restrictions but not necessarily all"". Mr Whitty said the virus ""is not going to go away, just as flu doesn't go away, just as many other viruses don't go away"". ""We shouldn't kid ourselves that this just disappears with spring,"" he said. Mr Whitty said although hopefully there would be nearly no measures needed from the spring onwards, the government might have to bring in a few restrictions next winter. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We've now vaccinated over 1.3m people across the UK"" On Monday the UK's chief medical officers recommended the Covid threat level be increased to five - its highest level.

England's third national lockdown becomes law,"London's Regent Street, normally packed with people and traffic, is deserted England's third national lockdown has legally come into force, with MPs set to vote retrospectively on it later. The measures, which include,externala stay-at-home order and the closure of schools to most pupils, were announced by the prime minister on Monday. All of the UK is now under strict virus curbs, with Wales, Northern Ireland and most of Scotland also in lockdown. On Tuesday the number of new daily confirmed cases of Covid in the UKtopped 60,000 for the first time. And it is thought one in 50 people in private households in England had the virus last week - rising to one in 30 in London. Figures fromthe Office for National Statistics,externalalso suggested more than one million people in England had Covid between 27 December and 2 January. At a Downing Street news conference on Tuesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said he had ""no choice"" but to impose the new lockdown, with the number of patients in hospitals 40% higher than in the first peak. He would not guarantee that all children would be back in school before the summer holidays but insisted he was full of ""optimism and fundamental hope"" that things would be different in the spring. The need to debate and vote on the measures means the House of Commons has been recalled from its Christmas break for the second time - the first being for the post-Brexit trade deal with the EU. Mr Johnson will update MPs, most of whom will not physically be in the chamber, on the new rules before the vote, which is due in the evening. The regulations, whichallow the lockdown to be in place until the end of March, are expected to pass with ease - as Labour is set to support the motion. Under the measures, people in England will only be able to go out for essential reasons, exercise outdoors will be allowed only once a day, and outdoor sports venues must close. Meanwhile, Covid vaccine deployment minister Nadhim Zahawi said new daily vaccination figures for the UK - which will be released for the first time on Monday - will show there has been a ""significant increase"" in the number of people who have received the jab. On Tuesday, Mr Johnson said 1.3 million people in the UK hadbeen vaccinatedso far. The government has set the target to immunise all over-70s, the most clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers by mid-February - some 13 million people - which would require around two million vaccinations a week. Mr Zahawi said he was ""confident"" the government would meet the ""ambitious"" target, adding that community pharmacies would be brought in to assist the vaccination programme. ""We will make sure that community pharmacies and the independent sector are involved and that we deliver what I think is a credible plan that the NHS has put together to hit that target of 13 million vaccinations ... by mid-February,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. On the same programme, Royal Pharmaceutical Society president Sandra Gidley accused the government of ignoring an ""army"" of small pharmacies. Thousands of high street chemists were ""ready, willing and able"" to help, she said. In other developments, Education Secretary Gavin Williamson is to make a Commons statement later aboutthe cancellation of A-Level and GCSE exams in England. England's lockdown came into force legally overnight. But it's actually today that the measures will be brought before MPs. Any rebellion by Conservative MPs is expected to be smaller than those seen late last year on restrictions. However, some do want more of a say in the next couple of months over how long the regulations might last. On Tuesday, Boris Johnson said that by mid-February - with hopes for the vaccine rollout - there is the ""prospect"" of beginning the relaxation of some measures. But at the same news conference, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said we shouldn't ""kid ourselves"" that the virus will disappear with the spring - and suggested a ""few"" restrictions might have to be brought in next winter. People cannot leave their homesexcept for certain reasons, like the first lockdown last March These includeessential medical needs, food shopping, exerciseand work for those who cannot do so from home All schools and colleges will close to most pupils from Tuesdaywith remote learning until February half-term Early years settings such asnurseries will stay open End-of-year examswill not take place this summer as normal Elsewhere,university students should not returnto campuses and will be taught online Restaurants can continue to offer food delivery, buttakeaway alcohol will be banned Outdoor sports venues - such asgolf courses, tennis courts and outside gyms - must close Butoutdoor playgrounds will remain open Amateur team sports are not allowed, but elite sport such asPremier League football can continue Elsewhere in the UK, Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon also announced a new lockdown on Monday - across mainland Scotland, Skye, Arran, Bute and Gighafor the rest of January. Level three restrictions apply in the remaining areas of the nation. Wales has been in a national lockdown since 20 December, and schools and colleges in the nationwill remain closed until at least 18 January. In Northern Ireland - which entered a six-week lockdown on 26 December - ""stay at home"" restrictionswill be brought back into law from Friday. This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""We've now vaccinated over 1.3m people across the UK"" The UK government's chief medical adviser, Prof Chris Whitty, urged people to take the ""stay at home"" rules seriously and warned that the country is facing a ""really serious emergency"". He cited the ONS data for England as showing how widespread the virus is. ""We're now into a situation where across the country as a whole, roughly one in 50 people have got the virus, higher in some parts of the country, lower in others,"" he said. He also said some restrictions may have to be introduced again next winter. Prof Graham Medley, a member of Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said ""we're in for a long haul"" with coronavirus. He told Today: ""Vaccination is a way out, but I think he's right to raise that possibility that there could be - next winter or even the winter after - the possibility that we will see a resurgence of Covid to such an extent that government again has to take measures to prevent another large outbreak."" That latest estimates include: One in 30 for London One in 45 for south-east England, eastern England and north-west England One in 50 for the East Midlands One in 60 for north-east England One in 65 for the West Midlands and Yorkshire and the Humber One in 135 for south-west England Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer called for the government to use the lockdown to create a ""round-the-clock"" vaccination scheme in order to end ""this nightmare"". In a televised address to the nation, Sir Keir also confirmed he would back the new restrictions on Wednesday. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Can lockdown stop the new variant?,"Lockdowns have worked before, but can we expect the new one to do the same? It feels like we are back in March or April last year, when the strict controls on all our lives led to a fairly quick decline in levels of coronavirus. But one of the crucial differences this time is the new variant, which is thought to spread between 50 and 70% faster than previous forms of the virus. Experts warn there are now no guarantees that lockdown will be enough to bring the variant under control. ""It still would not have been easy, but it would have been a much easier situation if it had not been for the new variant,"" Prof Neil Ferguson, from Imperial College London, told Inside Health. ""That really pushes the bounds of our ability to control the spread of the virus, even with measures that were previously relatively quite effective."" Listen: Prof Neil Ferguson on BBC Radio 4's Inside Health What are England's new lockdown rules? New coronavirus variant: What do we know? The coronavirus spreads when we come into contact with each other so moving classrooms online, telling people to stay at home and closing shops breaks many of those opportunities for human contact. If we consider the R number - the average number of people each infected person passes the virus on to - it was about 3.0 in the run up to the first lockdown and anything above 1.0 means cases are climbing. What is the R number? R fell to 0.6 during the first lockdown. Then every 1,000 infected people passed the virus on to 600 others, who passed it on to 360 others and so on. But if the new variant is 50% more transmissible then the R number, in the same lockdown conditions, would be about 0.9. Then 1,000 infected people would pass the virus onto 900 others, then 810 and so on. As you can see this leads to far slower decline. And that assumes lockdown can get R down to 0.9 in areas where the new variant has become the most common form of the virus. If, as some studies suggest, the variant is about 70% more transmissible then R may stay above 1.0 and cases may not fall at all. ""We'd at best flatten the curve, keep numbers at a roughly constant level, and that's frankly why there is so much emphasis on getting vaccine into people's arms as quickly as possible,"" said Prof Ferguson. It is hard to lock down even harder as there are some parts of society - hospitals, supermarkets - that need to be kept open. What happens to the number of cases over the coming weeks will be closely monitored. If this lockdown is less effective then we will have to live with it for longer. There have been some encouraging signs over the Christmas break, which was a bit like a lockdown due to school holidays and other restrictions. ""We are in a very difficult situation here, but my initial assessment of the last few days is that the rate is slowing which is good news,"" Prof John Edmunds, London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, told the BBC. He added: ""It looks likes those restrictions should be sufficient to stop the increase, whether they will be sufficient to bring cases down sufficiently we are yet to see."" Eventually the vaccine will give people immunity so we do not need the same controls on our lives. Now more than ever this is a race between the virus and the vaccine.

Georgia Senate races on a knife-edge as polls close,"This video can not be played If confirmed, Mr Warnock will be the first black senator for the state of Georgia The Democratic Party of US President-elect Joe Biden is on the verge of taking control of the Senate as results come in from two elections in Georgia. Pastor Raphael Warnock is projected to win one seat. Fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff leads narrowly in the other. If they both win, Mr Biden will control Congress fully and have a much better chance of pushing through his agenda. He said it was ""time to turn the page. The American people demand action and they want unity"". Follow our live updates from Georgia and Congress The election is being rerun because of Georgia's rule that a candidate must take 50% of the vote in order to win. None of the candidates in November's general election met that threshold. Why Georgia wins would be huge for Biden Who is Georgia's Reverend Raphael Warnock? Georgia election: Trump voter fraud claims and others fact-checked With 98% of votes counted, US TV networks and the Associated Press news agency called the first of the two races for Mr Warnock. Mr Warnock's and Mr Ossoff's positions have been boosted by Joe Biden's presidential election win in Georgia Control of the Senate in the first two years of Mr Biden's term will be determined by the outcome of the second run-off. Mr Warnock is set to become the first black senator for the state of Georgia - a slavery state in the US Civil War - and only the 11th black senator in US history. He serves as the reverend of the Atlanta church where assassinated civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr grew up and preached. Claiming victory, he paid tribute to his mother, Verlene, who as a teenager worked as a farm labourer. This video can not be played What's in store for US President-elect Biden in 2021? Senior North America reporter Anthony Zurcher looks ahead ""The other day - because this is America - the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else's cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,"" he said. If both Democrats win, the Senate will be evenly split 50-50, allowing incoming Democratic Vice-President Kamala Harris the tie-breaking vote. The Democrats narrowly control the House of Representatives. Mr Ossoff has also claimed victory in his race against Republican Senator David Perdue, but that race is even tighter. At 33, he would be the Senate's youngest member for 40 years. A Democrat has not won a Senate race in Georgia in 20 years but the party has been boosted by Mr Biden's presidential election win over Mr Trump there. Mr Biden's margin of victory was about 12,000 votes among five million cast. Mr Biden is due to be inaugurated as president on 20 January. He won 306 votes to Mr Trump's 232 in the US electoral college, which confirms the president. Mr Biden won at least seven million more votes than the president. Final results are expected later on Wednesday. The margins are extremely tight. Mr Warnock is projected to have won his race by 50.6% to 49.4% over incumbent Senator Kelly Loeffler. Edison Research, which supplies election results to news organisations including the BBC, says Mr Ossoff is leading by 50.2%, to 49.8% over Mr Perdue. More than 98% of ballots from Georgia's 159 counties have now been counted. The remaining votes come from the Atlanta suburbs, which are projected to go heavily for the Democrats. 'I've never seen this energy in Georgia before' Why is the Georgia election so important? More than three million voters - about 40% of those registered in Georgia - voted before Tuesday. Early voting benefited Mr Biden in November's White House election. Senators Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue are the candidates for the Republican Party Although the results are not final, it appears Republican worries about the two run-off elections in Georgia were well-founded. Their voters did not show up in the kinds of numbers they were hoping. Democrats turned out at higher levels. In county after county, both Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock outperformed their general election numbers. The two Democrats, at times running as a team, appeared to complement each other's electoral coalitions. Mr Warnock energised black voters across the state. Although Mr Ossoff slightly underperformed his Democratic counterpart, he still attracted the kind of white suburban voters around Atlanta who have been moving away from the Republican Party during the Trump presidency. If it turns out both prevail, Donald Trump will receive considerable blame for the Republican defeats. The party that loses the White House usually does better in subsequent congressional elections, not worse. And Georgia, despite Joe Biden's victory there, is still a traditionally conservative state. But Mr Trump spent most of his time and energy disputing his electoral defeat and lobbing attacks at Republican leaders in the state. It turns out that may not have been a wise electoral strategy - and it could cost Republicans control of the Senate.

Grammy Awards postponed until MarchThe awards were set to take place this month but have been moved over coronavirus fears.Entertainment & Arts,"Dua Lipa has been nominated for six awards in this year's Grammys The 2021 Grammy Awards has been postponed due to coronavirus concerns, say the organisers. The ceremony, one of the music industry's biggest awards, was due to take place on 31 January. The event will now take place on 14 March, due to rising infection numbers in Los Angeles and the state of California. BeyoncÃ©, Taylor Swift and Dua Lipa led the nominations for this years awards, which were announced in November. Grammys 2021: BeyoncÃ© and Dua Lipa lead nominations Grammys drop 'urban' from major award category Will concerts come back in 2021? ""Nothing is more important than the health and safety of those in our music community and the hundreds of people who work tirelessly on producing the show,"" said a statement from the Recording Academy, which runs the Grammys. It is unclear whether comedian Trevor Noah, who was set to host the show, will still take part in this year's ceremony. The Grammys' new date clashes with the previously-announced Screen Actors' Guild awards. The actors union said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the scheduling conflict. ""We announced the same date for the SAG Awards last July with the intent to give the greatest possible scheduling consideration for other awards shows,"" it said in a statement. ""We expect the same consideration from sister organizations throughout the industry."" It said it was in conversation with the Recording Academy in an attempt to resolve the situation. This year's Grammys were already due to be a virtual event, in line with other recent award shows, such as the MTV VMAs and the Billboard Awards. Other major ceremonies, including the Oscars, the Golden Globes and the Brit Awards have already been postponed. The US state of California has been particularly hard hit by the spread of coronavirus, withambulance workers in Los Angeles County being told not to transport patients with extremely low chances of survivalto hospital.

UK new car sales suffer worse year for decades,"New car registrations fell to their lowest level in nearly three decades last year, according to preliminary figures from the industry's trade body. It was also the biggest one-year fall since World War Two, when factories were being turned over to military production, the Society for Motor Manufacturers and Traders said. About 1.63 million new cars were registered in 2020, compared with 2.3 million in 2019 - a decline of 29%. It was the lowest total since 1992. The bulk of the lost sales occurred during the first lockdown in the Spring, when showrooms were forced to close, and factories shut down. ""We lost half a million units from March, April, May - and we never recovered them,"" said the SMMT's chief executive, Mike Hawes. The restrictions introduced later in the year were less damaging, largely because dealers were able to sell cars remotely, using 'click and collect' services. That remains the case during the new lockdown, announced on Monday. ""We can still do click and collect, which is important, because that's the very minimum we need,"" said Mr Hawes. ""Not just to keep retail going, but also to keep manufacturing going."" Overall, the SMMT said the Covid crisis has cost the car industry some Â£20bn - and cost the exchequer nearly Â£2bn in lost VAT. There are also serious questions about the extent to which the car market can recover this year. Previous forecasts, which had suggested new registrations could rise to about 2 million in 2021, have been thrown into doubt by the latest restrictions. But while the market as a whole has suffered over the past year, sales of electric cars have risen dramatically, increasing their share of the market from 1.5% to 6.5%. Sales of plug-in hybrids also rose sharply. Car showrooms re-opened from the first lockdown in June ""If we see this continued level of uptake in electric vehicles, then we anticipate that sales of new EVs and plug-in hybrids will overtake diesel cars in 2021,"" said Ian Plummer, commercial director of motoring website Auto Trader. ""Then, pure EVs will overtake those of their internal combustion engine counterparts in 2026."" With the pandemic continuing to inflict serious damage on the industry, Mr Hawes says the trade deal between the UK and the EU came as a ""massive relief"". It confirmed that cars and car parts could continue to move between the two regions, without tariffs - or taxes - being imposed, provided certain conditions are met. Honda factory temporarily suspends production Fiat Chrysler and PSA shareholders approve merger Shift to electric cars 'requires Herculean effort' The SMMT had previously warned that failing to reach a deal could have cost the industry Â£55bn over five years - and add Â£2,000 to the cost of each vehicle But manufacturers still face potentially significant additional costs due to so-called non-tariff barriers - including border formalities, and the need to obtain extra regulatory approvals for new designs. ""This is not a free deal"", said Mr Hawes. Another consequence of the trade deal is that the UK will need to focus on battery production, if it is to maintain its car industry while phasing out petrol and diesel engines. That's because in order to qualify for tariff-free access to the European market, the value of car components made outside the UK and the EU will have to be strictly limited. Specific rules relating to batteries effectively mean that from 2027, they themselves will have to be made in the EU or the UK. The SMMT believes that, based on current investment plans, UK battery factories will have a capacity of 15 gigawatt-hours (GWh) by 2024. That is more than seven times the current level, and would be enough to produce 250,000 electric cars per year. But the SMMT insists much more is needed: 60GWh in order to produce 1 million cars per year by 2030, and 120GWh to produce 2mby 2040. That, says Mr Hawes, will require ""massive investment"".

Can I go for a walk with friends in lockdown? And other questions,"The government has announced the end of all legal Covid restrictions in England, and Scotland has taken similar steps. Here are some of your questions on the changes: Because your son is in a clinical risk group - and as long as he is over five - he shouldsoon be offered two doses of the Pfizer vaccine. You should be contacted by your GP or specialist team to arrange this. With regard to the dangers of mixing, the UK has also recommended that Covid vaccines are offered to all children aged 5 to 11, not just those at high clinical risk. This is likely to start in England in April. Children are generally at much lower risk of becoming seriously ill from a Covid infection, although some do still get sick and need hospital care. Over-12s can already be vaccinated, and it's hoped that extending the rollout to younger age groups will help protect even more children from the risk of catching and spreading Covid. Schools are expected to work with and support families who have concerns about a pupil returning to the classroom. It is compulsory for school-age children to attend, even if they were previously shielding - the only exception is a small number of children whose clinician or GP has advised them not to attend. If you have concerns about this, you should talk to your doctor. If you live in England and are not in a vulnerable group yourself, it is unlikely that you will be entitled to a free test after 1 April. From that point, lateral flow tests should be available to buy from pharmacies and other retailers. The government says it will continue to provide free tests to the oldest age groups and those most vulnerable to Covid. We don't have the details of how this will work yet, but your mother and her care workers should still be eligible for free tests. Care homes are responsible for their own visiting policies, but at the moment across the UK, all visitors are expected to test for Covid before arrival. The chief scientific adviser Patrick Vallance has warned that further variants of Covid are expected - and that they could be more severe than previous ones. Therefore, although most of the free testing system is being dismantled in England, the government insists that the UK will continue to do detailed checks and surveillance to look for resurgences of Covid and any concerning new variants which may emerge. For example, some people in the community will still be asked to do regular tests for Covid as part of theOffice for National Statisticsâ Infection Survey. Positive test results collected this way can be analysed to identify the type of Covid people have. Throughout the pandemic, scientists have learned a great deal about how to track the virus, and the government says it will be possible to scale up such operations again in the future if necessary. Trials are already underway to test updated vaccines that could be a better match for the virus as it continues to change. The UK government also says it will also help support other countries in developing their own surveillance capabilities, because a new variant can emerge anywhere. NHS England says patients and staff should continue to wear face masks in GP practiceseven though they are no longer mandatory in public places. Face coverings also remain compulsory in healthcare settings in Scotland and Wales, and it is ""strongly advised"" that people wear them in Northern Ireland. Your doctor will be able to advise about what tests you will need before you have an operation. You may need to have a Covid test, and the government has said free testing will still be available in certain settings, such as hospitals. Infection control measures will continue to help keep people safe and limit the spread of the virus. SYMPTOMS:How do I know I've got Covid?

How to be the school of Mum and Dad (again),"School's out. What next? With schools once again closing their doors to most pupils, parents, many juggling work and childcare, are having to step in to fill the gap. If your child's school already puts work online, via Google Classroom, for example, this will probably continue. But these sort of tools tend to be used more by secondary schools than primaries. So older pupils are more likely to be in the routine of checking their school's chosen platform and completing work. And they are more likely to have their own laptops. Some schools are asking older children to follow their existing timetables, with some active lessons, involving Google Hangouts and virtual classrooms, and some passive ones, in which children work independently. And depending on the individual school, there will probably be a system to allow children to submit work and have it marked. Classrooms may be empty but learning can continue, experts say ParentKind,externalhas published a list of free online resources, as hasOak National Academy,external, which is collated by teachers. Many schools are also providing lists of resources on a range of topics, to help parents navigate this difficult time, such as: BrainPop,external- animated videos on topics in maths, science and English Tynker,external- coding lessons Creative Bug,external- craft lessons, from knitting to jewellery-making, drawing and origami YouTube's Free School,external- videos on subjects as diverse as the US constitution, coral reefs and the solar system Many schools already pay for online resources, so it is worth checking which ones you can access, as these will follow the curriculum. About half of UK schools use sites such asMathsWatch,external, for example, which caters for children from Year 4 up to A-level. BBC Bitesizehas lots of content divided into subject and age categories, with much new material added since March. The BBC will also show curriculum content on TVevery weekday from Monday, 11 January: primary-school programming, including BBC Live Lessons and BBC Bitesize Daily, from 09:00 to 12:00 on CBBC at least two hours of programming to support the GCSE curriculum on BBC Two The government, meanwhile, unlike during the first national lockdown, will expect schools to deliver their own online learning. If parents have any concerns about their child's education, the government says they should raise it with a teacher in the first instance. If the matter is still not resolved, parents can contact the schools watchdog, Ofsted. The key will be to establish a routine and make sure there are fun things to do too Little and often is the advice from MathsWatch co-founder Ken Smith, a teacher for 34 years. ""Even an hour's lesson at school is broken down by teachers,"" he says. ""And parents need to do the same. ""It is much better to do a little bit every day."" Online schooling: calls to cut data fees during lockdown Covid 19: School closures and mental health tips Schools closed with 'the heaviest of hearts' Remote learning: how do you feel about more studying at home? But like the school day, it is important to establish a routine, says Sarah Dove, a teacher who works online with children who cannot attend school. ""The key is finding out what works for you as a family but have a delineation between home life and school,"" she says. ""Don't spend all day in pyjamas. ""Come together for a mindfulness session rather than an assembly and do topic-based work too."" Even at school, children are not working from 09:00 to 15:00, Ms Wespieser says. So expecting them ""to sit at the table with paper and pen"" all day is unrealistic. But it is important parents think about themselves as well. It is important for children of all ages to get away from screens and grab some fresh air ""One of the biggest challenges parents have reported to us is balancing their own work with school work,"" she says. ""And employers may be a bit less sympathetic this time. ""Parents need to look after their own wellbeing and take the time to find what works for you. ""And schools should be giving a lot more advice."" In the last lockdown, there were concerns about a digital divide between affluent families with access to laptops and those who did not have devices and may have struggled to get their children online at all. Add to that the cost of broadband and the fact some parts of the country still don't have access to decent internet speeds, and home-schooling has been a nightmare for many families. The Department for Education says that more than 700,000 devices have been delivered to schools in England so far during the pandemic - 100,000 of which were delivered last week. It saysit has bought a further 300,000 laptops and tabletswhich will be delivered to schools for distribution. There are tons of learning resources online Teaching unions have said more still needs to be done, while others have called for data costs on educational apps and websites to be deducted from broadband charges. Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said that the government is working with mobile phone operators to provide free data for key educational sites, Customers using BT Mobile, EE, and Plusnet Mobilewill be able to access BBC Bitesize content from the end of January without eating into their dataallowance. The Department for Education already runs a scheme for disadvantaged children who do not have access to a home broadband connection,while some internet providers are also helping out.

Can my boss force me to go to work?,"Scotland and England have lifted their guidance to work from home. However, people in Northern Ireland and Wales are still advised to work remotely where possible. InEnglandthe government isno longer asking people to work from home. It had previously asked people to do so, to help tackle the spread of Omicron. InScotland,similar guidance has now been relaxed. The government wants firms to let workers return gradually - allowing them to spend some time in the office and some time at home. InNorthern Ireland, current guidance is to work from home where you can. Offices no longer need to take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing, although risk assessments should still be carried out. InWales, the government says it remains important to work from home if you can. A legal restriction to work from home unless unavoidable - with Â£60 fines for anyone who did not comply - has been scrapped. Employers are asked to followofficial safety guidance,externaland carry out Covid risk assessments for those staff who are in the office. Safety measures can include: improving ventilation additional cleaning turning away people with Covid There ismore detailed advice,externalfor some industries - including construction, hospitality and manufacturing, plus specific advice for employers inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalandNorthern Ireland,external. Face-coveringsremain mandatory for staff and customers in shops and on public transportacross the UK, apart from England. Northern Ireland, Wales and Scotland haveCovid passport schemeswhich are partly designed to protect staff who work in hospitality and events. If employees feel unsafe, they can raise concerns with their local authority,Citizens Advice,externalor theHealth and Safety Executive (HSE),external. Working from home is one of the most effective ways to reduce exposure to Covid, according to the government'sScientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage),external. It greatly limits face-to-face contact - both with colleagues and on public transport. Much of the riskdepends on how crowded it is and your distance from other people. Wearing a mask helps, as does keeping windows open, and avoiding peak journey times where possible. In 2020,37% of working UK adults did at least some work from home,external, up from 27% the previous year.

Does the NHS have enough protective gear?,"Personal protective equipment (PPE), like masks and gloves, helps stop the spread of coronavirus and saves lives. With a new, more contagious variant of Covid circulating in the UK, doctors and nurses are calling formore kit that provides the highest protection. Anyone in close contact with patients should wear some form of protection. That includes staff in care homes, prisons and the community, as well as in GP surgeries or hospitals. People giving vaccines will also use PPE. The type of PPE required depends on the level of risk. Millions of high-grade NHS masks withdrawn over safety concerns Guidelines say all hospital staff,externalshould wear a face mask, while people visiting hospital or attending outpatient departments should wear a face covering. Face coverings, unlike surgical face masks,are not classed as PPE,externalas they are not usually made to a recognised standard and do not provide a proven level of protection for work. In hospitals, anyone working within 2m (6ft) of a confirmed or suspected Covid-19 patient should wear an apron, gloves, a surgical mask and eye protection. Clinicians carrying out tasks that could generate airborne droplets of saliva loaded with the virus should use an even higher standard of protection. This includes disposable gowns, filtering respirators and face-shielding visors. That would include intensive care doctors getting a patient ready to go on a ventilator to support their breathing. Ambulance staff driving the ambulance (if the cab is closed off from the patient compartment) do not need to wear any PPE. The rest of the crew should wear PPE appropriate to their likely risk of exposure. Pharmacy staff who cannot keep 2m away from possible patients should wear a surgical mask. Some staff in other higher-risk occupations likecleaners,,externalmortuary workers,externalandmembers of the prison service,externalmay need to use PPE and should follow guidelines. The NHS needs billions of items each month. There are about 1.6 million NHS staff in UK hospitals and the community, who need varying amounts of PPE. Ordering is done on a UK-wide level, but different parts of the NHS have different levels of stock. The government says 32 billion items, including masks, visors and gowns, have been bought. Almost three quarters of expected demand for PPE will be met by UK manufacturers, it says. Before coronavirus, in 2019, the NHS and social care sector in England received around 2.4 billion items of PPE. Since the start of the pandemic, more than 8.4 billion items have been delivered to the health and social care system inEngland. That includes body bags, swabs, clinical waste containers, cleaning equipment and detergent as well as masks, gowns and gloves. Abreakdown of PPE,externaldelivered in the week to 6 November 2020 included: 35.5 million masks 40 million aprons 1.1 million gowns 156 million gloves (supplied and counted individually rather than as pairs) Since March,more than 908 million items of PPE have been delivered,externalin the NHS inScotland. In the week to 30 December, this included: 1.9 million masks 2.3 million aprons 35,000 gowns 5.7 million gloves Since March, nearly630 million items of PPE,externalhave been delivered to the health and social care sectors inWales. In the week to 20 December, this included: 77,000 masks 2.6 million aprons 101,000 gowns 10 million gloves InNorthern Ireland,more than376.5 million items of PPE,externalwere sent between March and the end of January 2021. In the week to 27 November, this included: 1.3 million masks 1.2 million aprons 53,500 gowns 4.6 million gloves Some bits of kit can only be used once per patient. Others can be used for whole sessions, such as during a ward round visit to many patients. All PPE worn during the highest-risk situations - where there will be lots of splatter from infectious droplets - should be single use, unless they can be decontaminated. Aprons, gloves and surgical masks should usually be disposed of after a single use or session. When there are shortages,guidelines say NHS staff can reuse some kit where it is safe to do so,external, even if it is labelled as single use by the manufacturer. The Health and Safety Executive says it recognises ""some compromise"" is needed when there are extreme shortages of kit. For example, some gowns could be washed by the hospital laundry and reused. TheRoyal College of Nursing,externaland theBritish Medical Association,externalsay PPE guidance should take a more precautions to stop airborne spreading. Both say members can refuse to treat patients as a ""last resort"" if there is not adequate PPE. UK anaesthetic and intensive care bodies says doctors should carefully evaluate the risks before deciding whether to provide care. The government said it was monitoring evidence on airborne transmission and would update advice ""where necessary"". SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now?

Vocational exams allowed to go ahead in EnglandVocational exams such as BTECs are not being cancelled by the lockdown like GCSEs and A-levels.Family & Education,"Vocational exams, including BTEcs, are to go ahead this month in England - despite calls for them to be cancelled alongside GCSEs and A-levels. ""Schools and colleges can continue with the vocational and technical exams that are due to take place in January, where they judge it right to do so,"" said a Department for Education spokeswoman. Further education college leaders had complained this was unfair to students. They said students would face ""stress"" from taking exams in the lockdown. The Association of Colleges warned the decision, giving schools and colleges the option on whether to carry on with BTecs, would create more confusion. 'Why haven't our exams been cancelled too?' say BTec students 'Cancelled exams a big disappointment' Schools and colleges closed and GCSEs and A-levels cancelled Chief executive David Hughes said some colleges would cancel exams and others would continue - but without any clarity about what would happen to ""students in colleges which do cancel for safety reasons"". ""A national decision would have allowed for more fairness,"" said Mr Hughes. The announcement from the Department for Education has left it open for schools and colleges to decide whether to go ahead with vocational and technical exams. ""Schools and colleges have already implemented extensive protective measures to make them as safe as possible,"" said the DFE's spokeswoman. The Department for Education said it recognised ""this is a difficult time"" but wanted to allow students who had prepared for exams and assessments to continue, including those who needed to take hands-on practical tests for qualifications for jobs. A joint statement from the mayors of Manchester and Liverpool said it was wrong to go ahead with these vocational exams when other academic exams had been cancelled. ""It is unfair to ask these students to go into colleges when everyone else is being told to stay at home. ""This will cause unnecessary anxiety and concern just when they need to be able to focus,"" said the statement from Andy Burnham and Steve Rotheram. The mayors highlighted that students taking BTecs were more likely to be from ""working-class backgrounds and ethnic minority communities"" and they should not be treated any less well than those following an ""academic route"" in exams.
