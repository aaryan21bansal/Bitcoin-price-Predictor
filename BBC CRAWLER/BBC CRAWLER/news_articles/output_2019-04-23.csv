"Labour vows to end 'slum' office housingIt says current planning rules allow developers in England to convert offices into ""rabbit hutch"" homes.Business","This video can not be played The families living in converted office blocks in Harlow Labour says it would scrap a government scheme that allows offices and industrial buildings to be converted into homes without planning permission. The party said changes to permitted development rules in England had led to the creation of ""slum housing and rabbit hutch flats"". It also said developers had been able to avoid building affordable homes. The Conservatives said the plans would ""cut house building and put a stop to people achieving home ownership"". In 2013, the government changed planning rules to allow developers to turn offices, warehouses and industrial buildings into residential blocks without getting permission from the local council, in a bid to boost house building. Barnet House in North London is being converted to 254 flats The rules have since been further relaxed, leading to 42,000 new dwellings being created from former offices in the last few years. However, permitted development schemes are exempt from official space standards and also from any requirement to provide affordable homes. 'I don't want my kids thinking this is normal' 'Micro-homes could solve' housing crisis Labour said the policy had seen the loss of more than 10,000 affordable homes, and meant that flats ""just a few feet wide"" were now counted in official statistics as new homes. It said its policy was still to build 250,000 new homes a year in England with 100,000 being ""genuinely affordable"". ""This Conservative housing free-for-all gives developers a free hand to build what they want but ignore what local communities need,"" said John Healey, Labour's shadow housing secretary. ""Labour will give local people control over the housing that gets built in their area and ensure developers build the low-cost, high-quality homes that the country needs."" Police figures show crime recorded at Terminus House, and the car park which sits beneath the housing, rose 45% in the first 10 months of it opening In one permitted development scheme at Newbury House in Ilford, an office block has been turned into 60 flats measuring as little as 13 sq metres each. According to national space standards, the minimum floor area for a new one-bedroom one-person home is 37 sq metres. Critics say the schemes can be damaging to residents' mental wellbeing, as well as being miles from amenities and conducive to crime. At Terminus House - a converted office block in Harlow -crime jumped 45% in the first 10 monthsafter people moved in and by 20% within that part of the town centre. But some developers warn that without permitted development many office to residential schemes would no longer be viable. The government says the rules are helping tackle the housing crisis and allowing people to get on the housing ladder. Of the 13,526 homes delivered under permitted development last year, more than three quarters were built outside of London Marcus Jones, Conservative vice-chair for Local Government, said: ""Labour's plans would cut house building and put a stop to people achieving homeownership. ""We are backing permitted development rights, which are converting dormant offices into places families can call home. ""Whilst Labour put politics before our families, the Conservatives are delivering the houses this country needs so every family has a place to call home.""

Woman wakes after 27 years in a coma,"Prolonged disorders of consciousness are usually caused by a sudden brain injury A woman from the United Arab Emirates (UAE) who was seriously injured in a traffic accident in 1991 has made a seemingly miraculous recovery after emerging from a 27-year-long coma. Munira Abdulla, who was aged 32 at the time of the accident, suffered a severe brain injury after the car she was travelling in collided with a bus on the way to pick up her son from school. Omar Webair, who was then just four years old, was sitting in the back of the vehicle with her, but was left unscathed as his mother cradled him in her arms moments before the accident. Ms Abdulla - who was being driven by her brother-in-law - was left seriously injured, but last year regained consciousness in a German hospital. Omar has opened up about the accident and about his mother's progress following years of treatment in an interview with the UAE-based newspaper The National. ""I never gave up on her because I always had a feeling that one day she would wake up,external,"" Omar told the newspaper on Monday. ""The reason I shared her story is to tell people not to lose hope on their loved ones; don't consider them dead when they are in such a state,"" he added. ""My mother was sitting with me in the back seat. When she saw the crash coming, she hugged me to protect me from the blow."" Fireman's recovery stuns doctors,external Pole wakes up from 19-year coma,external Von Bulow dies after 28-year coma,external He was unharmed, suffering just a bruise to the head, but his mother was left untreated for hours. Ms Abdulla was eventually taken to hospital, and later transferred to London. There, she was declared to be in a vegetative state - unresponsive, but able to sense pain - The National reports. She was then returned to Al Ain, a city in the UAE on the border with Oman where she lived, and moved to various medical facilities according to insurance requirements. She remained there for a few years, fed through a tube and kept alive. She underwent physiotherapy to ensure her muscles would not weaken through lack of movement. In 2017, the family was offered a grant by the Crown Prince Court, a government body in Abu Dhabi, for Ms Abdulla to be transferred to Germany. There, she underwent a number of surgeries to correct her severely shortened arm and leg muscles, and she was given medication to improve her state, including her wakefulness. A year later, her son was involved in an argument in her hospital room, which seemed to prompt his mother to stir. ""There was a misunderstanding in the hospital room and she sensed I was at risk, which caused her a shock,"" Omar said. ""She was making strange sounds and I kept calling the doctors to examine her, they said everything was normal. ""Then, three days later, I woke up to the sound of someone calling my name. ""It was her! She was calling my name, I was flying with joy; for years I have dreamt of this moment, and my name was the first word she said."" She became more responsive, and can now feel pain and have some conversations. She has returned to Abu Dhabi, where she is undergoing physiotherapy and further rehabilitation - mainly to improve her posture when sitting and prevent muscles from contracting. There are only a few cases of people recovering consciousness after several years - and even then, recovery can be protracted. It is impossible to predict the chances of someone in a state of impaired consciousness improving,external, says the UK's National Health Service. People who do regain consciousness often have severe disabilities caused by damage to their brain. One notable recovery case is that of Terry Wallis,an American man who was involved in a car accident when he was 19, and made a dramatic recovery after spending 19 years in a near-vegetative state,external. It was thought he had been able to re-grow brain tissue.

Nasa lander 'detects first Marsquake',"The sensors were developed in France and the UK The American space agency's InSight lander appears to have detected its first seismic event on Mars. The faint rumble was picked up by the probe's sensors on 6 April - the 128th Martian day, or sol, of the mission. It is the first seismic signal detected on the surface of a planetary body other than the Earth and its Moon. Scientists say the source for this ""Marsquake"" could either be movement in a crack inside the planet or the shaking from a meteorite impact. Nasa's InSight probetouched down on the Red Planet in November last year. It aims to identify multiple quakes, to help build a clearer picture of Mars' interior structure. Researchers can then compare this with Earth's internal rock layering, to learn something new about the different ways in which these two worlds have evolved through the aeons. Probe deploys 'Marsquake' instrument Mars rover named after Rosalind Franklin Interestingly, InSight's scientists say the character of the rumble reminds them very much of the type of data the Apollo sensors gathered on the lunar surface.

The vibrations picked up by InSight's sensors are made audible in this video, and record three different types of signal. (1) The wind on Mars; (2) the reported 6 April event; and (3) the movement of the probe's robot arm as it takes photos. Astronauts installed five seismometers that measured thousands of quakes while operating on the Moon between 1969 and 1977. InSight's seismometer system incorporates French (low-frequency) and British (high-frequency) sensors. Known as the Seismic Experiment for Interior Structure (SEIS), the instrument was lifted on to the Martian surface by the probe's robotic arm on 19 December. Both parts of the system observed the 6 April signal, although it wasn't possible to extract any information to make a more definitive statement about the likely source or the distance from the probe to the event. ""It's probably only a Magnitude 1 to 2 event, perhaps within 100km or so. There are a lot of uncertainties on that, but that's what it's looking like,"" said Prof Tom Pike, who leads the British side of the seismometer package. This video can not be played Prof Tom Pike: ""The signal had a startling similarity to what's been seen with Moonquakes"" The UK high-frequency sensors are cut from silicon Dr Bruce Banerdt is Nasa's chief scientist on the InSight mission. He added: ""This particular Marsquake - the first one we've seen - is a very, very small one. In fact, if you live in Southern California like I do, you wouldn't even notice this one in your day-to-life. But since Mars is so quiet, this is something that we're able to pick up with our instrument."" Listen to Bruce Banerdt describe the first detected Marsquake The team is investigating three other signals picked up only by the low-frequency sensors - on 14 March (Sol 105), 10 April (Sol 132) and 11 April (Sol 133). However, these were even smaller than the Sol 128 event, and the InSight scientists do not have the confidence yet to claim them as real seismic events. The probe's prime mission is set to run for two Earth years - a little more than one Martian year. Given the time taken to make this first detection, it might suggest InSight should record another dozen or so seismic signals in the initial operating period, explained Prof Pike. ""When you've got one, you don't know whether you were just lucky, but when we see two or three we will have a better idea,"" the Imperial College London researcher told BBC News. ""Of course, if the other three are confirmed then we could be looking at quite a large number of detections over the next two years."" SEIS was developed and provided for InSight by the French space agency (CNES). The UK Space Agency funded the Â£5m British involvement. Sue Horne, the UKSA's head of space exploration, commented: ""Thanks to the Apollo missions of the 1960s we know that Moonquakes exist. So, it's exciting to see the Mars results coming in, now indicating the existence of Marsquakes which will lead to a better understanding of what's below the surface of the Red Planet.""

"Child held near cliff edge prompts warningThe National Trust urges people to ""act sensibly"" as people perch on the edge of an unstable cliff.Sussex","Among those perched near the cliff edge, a man was spotted lifting a child to peer down below The National Trust has warned people to ""act sensibly"" after pictures emerged of a man holding a child inches from an unstable cliff edge. The pair were pictured on Monday at Seven Sisters near Eastbourne, East Sussex. In 2017, 50,000 tonnes of the cliff crumbled and fell to the beach below. The following day a 23-year-old South Korean tourist fell to her death when she jumped in the air for a picture and lost her footing on the edge. The chalk cliffs are unstable and sections have eroded and collapsed in the past Others were also seen near the edge and the Trust spokeswoman said: ""It isn't safe to stand or sit on the cliff edge. ""The cliffs are unstable in places and there are undercuts in the chalk, which people may be unaware of from the top. ""We advise visitors to act sensibly."" There are permanent signs in place warning people of the danger. MP for Lewes Maria Caulfield said the warm weather made an ""ideal time to visit the coast"". However, she said it was ""disappointing and concerning"" to see people on the edge or ""dangling children on the edge"". ""We know how dangerous those cliff edges are. We know people have been injured, and we've had tragic loss of life in the past."" People enjoying the Bank Holiday sun got precariously close to the end of the cliff Ms Caulfield said she will speak to local councils on how to tackle the safety issues in future. Previously, some havecriticised the signage for not standing out, and there have beencalls for signs in foreign languagesas tourism from the Far East increases. Ms Caulfield said: ""It's a difficult balance... if you put too much fencing or signage you destroy the beauty of the place. ""But it's clear, despite the efforts of the local councils, the signs that are there are not enough to deter people from going close to the cliff edge.""

"UK is 'irresponsible' on climate, says Greta","MPs applauded climate change activist Greta Thunberg Teenage activist Greta Thunberg has described the UK's response to climate change as ""beyond absurd"". In a speech to MPs, the Swedish 16-year-old criticised the UK for supporting new exploitation of fossil fuels and exaggerating cuts to carbon emissions. She was invited to Westminster after inspiring the school climate strikes movement. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said ""we have not done nearly enough"". In her speech in Parliament on Tuesday, Miss Thunberg said the UK was supporting shale gas fracking, greater exploitation of North Sea oil and gas fields and expanding airports. ""This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind,"" she said. She also described the UK's carbon emissions reduction as the result of ""very creative"" accounting. The country's reported 37% reduction in emissions since 1990 was only 10% when aviation, shipping, imports and exports were counted, she said. How might ministers win over protesters? Greta Thunberg: 'Climate fight will never stop' Climate protesters stage museum 'die-in' Who is Greta Thunberg? Miss Thunberg said her generation's future had been ""stolen"" so that ""a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money"". She told MPs: ""You don't listen to the science because you are only interested in the answers that will allow you to carry on as if nothing has happened."" Mr Gove said that although governments have not done enough to tackle climate change, ""in the past few years it has become inescapable that we have to act"". He said: ""The time to act is now, the challenge could not be clearer - Greta, you have been heard."" An empty seat was left for Theresa May as Miss Thunberg met politicians Earlier, an empty chair was left for Prime Minister Theresa May as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and Green Party leader Caroline Lucas met the environmental campaigner for a round-table discussion. The Westminster leaders of the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, were also at the meeting. Mrs May was chairing a cabinet meeting and Downing Street said it had received no official request to attend. Ms Lucas told Miss Thunberg there was a growing ""sense of urgency"" and that ""more than ever, politicians have our ears open to your message"". During Miss Thunberg's visit to the UK she has also spoken at the Extinction Rebellion climate protests and given media interviews. The teenager sparked an international youth movement after she staged a ""School Strike for Climate"" in front of the Swedish Parliament in August last year. Since then she has met the Pope and addressed the European Parliament. Speaking about her newfound fame, she said: ""It's unbelievable, I can't really take it in.""

She has said thather generation will not be able to fly except in emergencies,external""if we are the least bit serious"" about preventing global warming greater than 1.5C. Earlier, Miss Thunberg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her message for politicians was: ""Listen to the science, listen to the scientists. Invite them to talk."" She said it was important for politicians to act because ""most emissions aren't caused by individuals, they're caused by corporations and states"". Her arrival in the UK comes as Extinction Rebellion activiststook over part of the Natural History Museumon Monday andmarched on Parliamenton Tuesday morning. More than 1,000 people have been arrested since their protests began in central London a week ago. Speaking in the House of Commons, energy minister Claire Perry said she had ""mixed emotions"" about the protests, which had raised important issues but risked leaving people ""fearful for the future rather than hopeful"". Miss Thunberg, who spoke to the crowds in Marble Arch on Sunday, told the BBC that disruptive action ""definitely has a lot of impact"". Asked whether it was necessary, she said: ""As long as it's non-violent, I think that could definitely make a difference."" Miss Thunberg said she first heard about climate change aged about eight years old. ""I was just very moved,"" she said. ""When I was 11 I became very depressed,"" she added. ""It had a lot to do with the climate and ecological crisis. I thought everything was just so wrong and nothing was happening and there's no point in anything."" After realising she could make a difference, she said she promised herself that ""I was going to do something good with my life"". This video can not be played Environmental activist Greta Thunberg says climate change is 'an existential crisis' The teenager also admitted that, when she first told her parents of her plan to miss school every Friday, they ""weren't very fond of that idea"". In the wide-ranging BBC interview, Miss Thunberg said that having Asperger's had helped her in life: ""It makes me different, and being different is a gift, I would say. It also makes me see things from outside the box. ""I don't easily fall for lies, I can see through things. If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike, for instance."" Asked what she would say if she met US President Donald Trump, she said: ""I can't really say anything to him that he hasn't heard before. ""Obviously he's not listening to the science and to what we have to say, so I wouldn't be able to change his mind.""

'New IRA' admits responsibility for killing 'Her commitment to truth was absolute' Timeline of Irish dissident activity They added that her ""personal philosophy"" was that the ""only way to overcome hatred and intolerance was with love, understanding and kindness"". Prime Minister Theresa May will attend the funeral at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast They described her as having a ""warm and innocent heart"", adding that she was ""the greatest listener and someone who had time for everyone"".

Sinead Quinn said friends of Ms McKee would be wearing T-shirts like this one to the funeral They said they were thankful for the huge outpouring of sympathy in recent days, and that she should be remembered as ""someone who spoke to and made friends with anybody and everybody, no matter what their background"". That will be one of the themes of the funeral service, with Protestant and Catholic clergy taking part and politicians from across the political divide in attendance. The journalist and campaigner for LGBT rights is survived by her partner, mother, two brothers and three sisters. Her funeral is to be held at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast, and the service will be led jointly by the Anglican dean of Belfast, the Very Reverend Stephen Forde, and Fr Martin Magill at 13.00 BST. By Mark Simpson, BBC News NI In life and in death, Lyra McKee is bringing people together in Belfast. The funeral of this 29-year-old woman, from a Catholic background, is taking place in a Protestant cathedral. Her family chose the cathedral due to its reputation as a ""shared space"" in a divided city. It may be Church of Ireland in its status and governance, but it has strong ecumenical links and even has a chapel of unity. The death of Ms McKee was a horrific reminder of the old Northern Ireland. Many are hoping that her funeral will be a symbol of something new. Ms McKee's partner, Sara Canning, said the service would be a ""celebration of her life"". ""If people would like to wear Hufflepuff, Harry Potter or Marvel related T-shirts I know she would love it,"" Ms Canning said. Secretary of State Karen Bradley will be among the dignitaries attending the funeral, while the Irish government's representatives include the foreign minister, Simon Coveney. Dissident republican group the New IRAadmitted responsibility for the journalist's murder, according to the Irish News. Three people have been arrested over the shooting, but all have been released without charge. Fr Joe Gormley, who anointed Ms McKee after she was shot dead, told BBC News NI there was still a ""great deal of shock"" in Derry. Sara Canning (centre) was ""planning to grow old"" with her partner Lyra McKee ""But people are also reflecting and they know that we are faced with a choice in life,"" he said. ""We either go back to the dark days or move forward."" He said he was willing to ""sit down and talk"" to those responsible. Lyra McKee, who was also a campaigner for LGBT rights, gave a TED talk in 2017 Fellow members of the National Union of Journalists (NUJ) are to form a guard of honour at the cathedral. The union described Ms McKee as ""one of the most promising journalists"" in Northern Ireland. CiarÃ¡n Ã MaolÃ¡in, the union's Belfast secretary, described her as ""intelligent, determined and very witty"". There will be a gathering at Guildhall Square in Derry at 13:00 BST for those who cannot attend her funeral.

We need to move the dial. People need to have a say."" Interim leader Heidi Allen told the event in Bristol: ""These elections are a chance to send the clearest possible message - we demand a People's Vote and the right to campaign to remain in the European Union. We are not afraid to say it as clearly as that. ""This is no rebel alliance. This is the home of the Remain alliance."" Cross-party Brexit talks to resume Labour 'must back second Brexit vote' The life of MEPs in Brexit limbo Former BBC correspondent Gavin Esler is also a candidate. He said UK politics was ""a worldwide joke"", and accused pro-Brexit campaigners, such as Nigel Farage, of ""stealing our patriotism"". ""We know Britain is better than the brain-dead politics of the past. We know Change UK is the only all-UK party to bring about changes. ""Ask yourself, what time is it? It is time for a change - it is time for Change UK."" BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley says Change UK want to be the number one choice for those unhappy with Brexit. But he said it would not be easy because plenty of other more established parties - namely the Lib Dems, the Greens, the SNP and Plaid Cymru - will be making a similar pitch. Following the launch,the Independent reported,externalthat a potential Change UK candidate, Ali Sadjady, had tweeted a derogatory comment about Romanians in November 2017. The tweet has now been deleted. The party later said that ""following discussions"", Mr Sadjady, had ""reflected on his inappropriate tweet from 2017 and agreed to stand down"". Mr Sadjadyposted an apology on Twitter,external, saying it was not representative of who he was. A number of parties have begun launching their campaigns for the European Parliamentary elections after Theresa May agreed a Brexit delay until 31 October with the EU. Mrs May said the UK could still exit before this date if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament. But, if not, the country is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May. The Independent Group was formed after eight Labour MPs and three Tory MPs left their parties in February. The three Conservative MPs blamed ""a shift to the right"" in their party and the government's ""disastrous handling of Brexit"", while Labour MP cited their party's stance on leaving the EU, along with the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism. In March, the group applied to become a party with the name Change UK and was given approval in April, meaning they could field candidates in the European elections. After about 3,700 applications, 70 candidates were picked.

""If MPs can change their minds and change their votes, so can the British people. It is undemocratic, it is plain wrong, to deny people the rights of this country that are enjoyed in Parliament."" The sister of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is a writer and newspaper columnist. She has previously said she joined the Conservatives in 2008, inspired by a dinner party discussion with David Cameron, but left in 2011, complaining she was treated ""like the brainwashed member of a cult"". In April 2017, she joined the Liberal Democrats, saying that the country could ""be going over a cliff in a hard Brexit"". Ms Johnson was a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother in 2018. Glasgow-born Gavin Esler started a career in journalism at the The Belfast Telegraph before joining the BBC during the Northern Ireland Troubles. During a long career at the corporation, he was the BBC's chief North America correspondent, based in Washington, and a presenter of Newsnight. He left in 2017. He has written five novels and two non-fiction books, and is currently Chancellor of the University of Kent. He spoke in favour of a ""final say on the Brexit deal"" at a rally for the People's Vote campaign in Scotland in August last year. Last week, ex-UKIP leader Mr Faragelaunched his new Brexit Party,and on Tuesday, the party announced five new candidates for the European elections. They include left-wing activist Claire Fox, former Royal Marine James Glancy and charity CEO Matthew Patten. Nigel Farage said the group would be targeting areas with Labour MPs that voted Leave in the referendum. He added: ""Brexit is not about left or right. It is about right and wrong."" The European Parliamentary elections are expected to take place in the UK on 23 May - if the UK has not left the EU by that date. The UK is divided into 12 regions, each represented by between three and 10 MEPs depending on population size. Seats in England, Scotland and Wales are awarded to parties according to their share of the vote, to candidates on lists drawn up by the parties. Northern Ireland elects MEPs using asingle transferable vote system, with voters able to rank candidates in order of preference.

"Boy, 6, reading book died in window fall","William Coy died in hospital after falling from a window at a house in Lindum Avenue, Lincoln A six-year-old boy died after he fell from an open second floor window as he read a Mr Men book during last year's heatwave, an inquest heard. William Coy died in hospital following the fall at his Lincoln home in July. He was sitting on the window sill in his bedroom, which had become ""unbearably hot"", and was reading his book when he fell to the ground. Coroner Richard Marshall recorded a verdict of accidental death at the inquest in Boston. William was found lying unconscious on the concrete patio at the back of the rented terraced house by his sister Lydia, 11, in the evening of 17 July, the inquest heard. He suffered a severe traumatic brain injury as a result and died two days later. Pupils at Monks Abbey Primary School, where William attended, produced artwork in his memory In a statement read to the inquest, William's father Richard Coy, 37, said his son had gone to bed at about 19:30 BST but 30 minutes later, his daughter asked him why her brother was ""asleep outside"". ""I opened the back door to see William was laid on the floor. His glasses were on the floor beside him,"" he said. ""I started to scream and panic and tried to wake William up but he didn't open his eyes."" The Mr Men book was later found underneath a bench on the patio. More from Lincolnshire The court heard the new UPVC window had been fitted without safety catches. Lincolnshire Police said it believed William's parents were ""very loving towards their children and it was a good family unit"", and his death was not suspicious. Mr Coy, an adult care adviser at Lincolnshire County Council, said his son would ""often sit on the window sill of his bedroom and read his books or play with his things"". Both of William's parents were not at the inquest but they described him as their ""little hero"" and said his organs were donated to help save other people. Mr Marshall said: ""This is one of the most tragic cases I think I have ever dealt with and I add my condolences to the family on their loss.""

US dilutes UN rape-in-conflict resolution,"This video can not be played ""Justice is not inevitable"": Amal Clooney spoke at the UN Security Council meeting The Trump administration's opposition to abortion has led to the watering-down of a UN resolution on ending sexual violence in war. The US removed all references to sexual and reproductive health. The Security Council resolution, submitted by Germany, dropped all such references. The US, along with China and Russia, had threatened to veto it. The Trump administration opposed a phrase on the grounds that it implies support for abortion. The amended resolution passed 13-0, with Russia and China abstaining. French UN ambassador Francois Delattre was scathing of the decision to exclude the reference to sexual health, saying it undermined the dignity of women. ""It is intolerable and incomprehensible that the Security Council is incapable of acknowledging that women and girls who suffered from sexual violence in conflict, and who obviously didn't choose to become pregnant, should have the right to terminate their pregnancy,"" he said. The removed phrase read: ""Recognizing the importance of providing timely assistance to survivors of sexual violence, urges United Nations entities and donors to provide non-discriminatory and comprehensive health services, in line with Resolution 2106."" This line was thought to be a compromise from an earlier version, which included a more detailed description of the health services, ""including sexual and reproductive health, psychosocial, legal, and livelihood support"". This language had been used before in previous resolutions related to sexual violence, US media report. Sierra Leone declares rape emergency World powers condemn new Libya fighting Nobel Peace Prize for anti-rape activists The new resolution condemns the use of rape as a weapon of war and expresses the Security Council's concern at the slow progress in addressing sexual violence in conflict. Jonathan Cohen, acting US ambassador to the United Nations, at the Security Council meeting But while it urges improved justice for victims, the final version also removed a reference to a UN monitoring body that would report acts of sexual violence. The initial resolution had garnered widespread support. Human rights lawyer Amal Clooney attended Tuesday's Security Council meeting and urged members to vote in favour. ""This is your Nuremberg moment,"" Mrs Clooney said. ""Your chance to stand on the right side of history."" Ms Clooney was joined by two 2018 Nobel Peace Prize winners, both anti-rape activists: Congolese gynaecologist Denis Mukwege and Nadia Murad, an Iraqi Yazidi who was tortured and raped by Islamic State militants. German foreign minister Heiko Maas also joined actress and activist Angelina Jolie in writing an article in the Washington Post on 22 April advocating the resolution. Nobel Peace Prize winners Nadia Murad and Denis Mukwege both supported the UN resolution International figures have denounced the US for weakening the resolution. UK Labour MP Emily Thornberry cited the resolution as cause for concern in light of President Donald Trump's recently announced visit to the UK. ""It beggars belief that on the very same day Donald Trump is threatening to veto a United Nations resolution against the use of rape as a weapon of war, Theresa May is pressing ahead with her plans to honour him with a state visit to the UK,"" Ms Thornberry, the opposition's spokesperson on foreign affairs said. The US was represented by acting ambassador to the UN, Jonathan Cohen. The ambassador post has remained vacant since the resignation of Nikki Haley last year. Mr Trump nominated Kelly Knight Craft, current US ambassador to Canada, for the job in February.

"False expenses claim MP fined ÃÂ£1,500","Chris Davies's defence said the MP did not intend to make ""personal gain"" or act in a ""dishonest way"" An MP convicted of making a false expenses claim has been ordered to do 50 hours unpaid work and fined Â£1,500. Conservative MP for Brecon and RadnorshireChris Davies pleaded guiltyto providing false or misleading information for allowances claims and attempting to do so in March. Davies, 51, made an ""unreserved apology"" following his sentencing at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday. He nowfaces a recall petitionamid calls for his resignation. Davies must complete the community order within 12 months and was also ordered to pay Â£2,500 in costs. Tom Forster QC, defending, said it was likely Mr Davies's career was in ""tatters"" Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for him to resign, but in a statement Davies said he wanted to ""move on and continue"" his role as an MP. ""I have accepted today's ruling and want to take this opportunity to make an unreserved apology,"" he said. ""I would like to reiterate that I made a mistake and at no point did I at any time try to make any financial gain."" The Conservatives said Mr Davies has been given ""formal warning"" from the chief whip Julian Smith. A party spokesman said ""it is right that the people of Brecon and Radnorshire now get to have their say about whether they still support Mr Davies"". The court heard Chris Davies's political career is likely to be in ""tatters"" The charges related to when he was setting up his constituency office following the 2015 general election. In 2016, he tried to split a genuine cost of Â£700 for photographs for his office between two budgets by faking two separate invoices. The court heard only one of them, for Â£450, was reimbursed, from a start-up budget that only had about Â£480 remaining in it and was not due to roll over and otherwise may have been lost. Davies would have been allowed to claim the whole amount from a separate budget for office costs. Another invoice for the remaining Â£250 to be claimed from that budget was not submitted, the court heard, after his office manager noticed the discrepancy. The prosecution did not allege he was seeking falsely to profit from the invoices, but said the forged documents ""involved some sophistication and took effort to create"" and there was ""also the matter of breach of public trust"". Mr Forster said he was ""new to the system"" and had paid back any money given to him. He said there was a ""likelihood that his political career is in tatters"" and Davies was the ""author of his own misfortune"". Mr Justice Edis said the case was different ""from the expenses scandals from 10 years ago"" Mr Justice Edis said the MP's actions were ""highly discreditable"" and it ""remains shocking that when confronted with a simple accounting problem you thought the simplest thing to do was to forge documents"". The office for the Commons' Speaker John Bercow is now expected to ask officials to open a recall petition - a by-election will be held if 10% of the MP's constituents sign it. The figure needed to trigger a by-election is yet to be confirmed, but it is thought about 5,300 names would be required.

Huge wildfire will 'take days' to put out,"About 100 people are now involved in the operation A huge wildfire which has destroyed more than 20 square miles of grassland in Moray will ""take days"" to put out, according to the fire service. About 70 firefighters have spent a second day tackling the blaze which is close to two wind farms. The alarm was raised shortly before 15:00 on Monday after flames were spotted near Paul's Hill wind farm at Knockando, south west of Elgin. Fire chiefs called it a ""significant, fast-moving fire"". Major wildfire threatens wind farm Fire crews tackle large grass blazes There have been no reports of casualties but the fire has destroyed about 60 square kilometres (23 square miles) of grassland and woodland. Scottish Fire and Rescue Area manager Bruce Farquharson said up to 100 people were now involved in fighting the fire. Police, ambulance and local estate staff joined the efforts, along with Forestry Commission staff and local windfarm workers. He said: ""This is one of the largest fires we have had in the last couple of years - the area and the intensity of the fire. ""It has passed through one windfarm and is impinging on a second. ""We have had to evacuate a couple of farms for safety purposes,  to the south of Dallas. ""The fuel is extremely dry after the winter and the sun we have enjoyed over the Easter weekend has created the perfect environment for fires to take hold and spread very quickly."" Mr Farquharson explained that SFRS cannot deploy firefighters into a woodland fire, and that it needed to be tackled from above using helicopters to drop water. The fire is close to two wind farms He said it would take days to put the fire out completely. The blaze is burning on four different fronts. The Paul's Hill wind farm, which consists of 28 turbines, is operated by Fred Olsen Renewables. There was a large grass fire in the same area last weekend. Firefighters have also tackled a separate wildfire affecting about 75 acres of land in Lochaber, and at Bonhill in West Dunbartonshire. Allow Twitter content?

Teenage neo-Nazi admits terror offences,"Michal Szewczuk produced propaganda for a neo-Nazi group called the Sonnenkrieg Division A teenage neo-Nazi who suggested Prince Harry should be shot for marrying a woman of mixed race has pleaded guilty to terror offences at the Old Bailey. Michal Szewczuk, 19, of Leeds, admitted two counts of encouraging terrorism and five of possessing documents useful to a terrorist. The charges relate to a neo-Nazi group called the Sonnenkrieg Division. Co-defendant Oskar Dunn-Koczorowski, 18, from west London, pleaded guilty in December to encouraging terrorism. Both of them were granted conditional bail and are due to be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 17 June. The pair produced Sonnenkrieg propaganda that, among other things, said Prince Harry was a ""race traitor"" who should be shot and lionised the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik. They publicised the propaganda on the social media site Gab, including on a page for the Sonnenkrieg group itself. Szewczuk, hiding behind a pseudonym, also used a separate account to posts links to self-authored diatribes that called for the ""systematic slaughtering"" of women and the rape of babies. Detectives found Szewczuk in possession of bomb-making instructions, documents describing how to conduct Islamist terror attacks, and a ""white resistance"" manual. The Sonnenkrieg group, which was exposed last year bya BBC investigation, was created as a British version of the American neo-Nazi organisation Atomwaffen Division, which has been linked to five murders. Oskar Dunn-Koczorowki admitted two counts of encouraging terrorism in December Szewczuk and Dunn-Koczorowski were arrested the morning after the BBC investigation was broadcast. At the time, Szewczuk was a university student in Portsmouth. Another man was also arrested and has since been released under investigation. The group's ideology, which is influenced by figures such as the murderous cult leader Charles Manson, is a strain of neo-Nazism that openly encourages criminality and acts of terrorism. Online propaganda and private chat logs show members engaging in extreme misogyny, as well as exalting jihadist terrorism and a violent strand of Satanism. Some private messages seen by the BBC suggest Sonnenkrieg members encouraged young women to engage in acts of self-harm. The Sonnenkrieg Division grew out of a split in the now largely defunct System Resistance Network, which was created after the neo-Nazi group National Action was banned under anti-terror laws in 2016. Sonnenkrieg and System Resistance Network both contained one-time members of National Action, including Dunn-Koczorowski.

Landfill ban could see waste sent to England,"Scottish rubbish may have to be sent to England in order to meet a planned ban on household waste going to landfill by 2021. The Scottish government wants to stop traditional black bag waste and a range of recyclable materials being buried in the ground. But a new study has found the cost of the ban could be more than Â£1bn. Less than half of Scotland's 32 councils have plans in place to meet the 2021 target. The study of waste markets predicts there will be insufficient capacity to meet the expected level of need, with a gap predicted of one million tonnes of waste per year in 2021. That could fall to 90,000 tonnes by 2035 if councils take action to reduce waste and build more energy-from-waste processing facilities. But if this does not happen quickly enough then the waste would need to be exported out of Scotland. The report, commissioned by Scottish ministers, states:  ""Excluding consideration of waste minimisation and recycling, the ban will result in significant economic costs to Scotland due to the need to export an increased amount of residual waste - whether as an interim solution until new thermal treatment capacity comes online, or as a long-term solution."" If this involved payment in tax or to private processing facilities, then at least the penalty would be circulated within the Scottish economy but instead, the report points out, that the payments would go elsewhere: ""This has the effect of exporting revenue to English or continental landfill or treatment providers."" The amount of household waste sent to landfill has decreased for six consecutive years and it is hoped recycling initiatives will boost this further ahead of the 2021 ban Researchers modelled the likely costs of the landfill ban, which ranged from Â£414m to Â£1.156bn. The independent study also found that, as of 2017, only 14 out of 32 councils had plans in place to process all their expected biodegradable waste and avoid sending it to landfill. This is despite the ""significant notice"" given of the planned ban, announced in 2012. Local authority body Cosla hasalready warnedthat ""as it stands it seems unlikely that the 2021 ban will be fully achievable"". The Scottish Environment Protection Agency last year warned landfill operators that they will have the statutory duty to check what is being placed in their dumps, to ensure that none of it is biodegradable. The amount of Scottish household waste recycled now exceeds the amount sent to landfill Opposition politicians criticised the Scottish government's handling of the ban. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""It would make a mockery of the law if the SNP's solution to meeting their own landfill ban is to ship it to England or abroad."" Scottish Conservative environment spokesman Maurice Golden said the target was an ""SNP gimmick"". He said: ""This damning report shows that their target is wildly off-schedule."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The Scottish government is committed to ending the practice of sending biodegradable municipal waste to landfill. ""This will contribute to progress on climate change targets and increase incentives to deal with waste in a more sustainable way. We have been working closely with local authorities and commercial bodies to assess and support progress towards implementing the ban. ""Our focus now is on working with authorities who do not yet have a solution in place to identify ways, such as collaborative procurement and improved recycling, in which they can comply with the ban.""

"False expenses claim MP fined Â£1,500","Chris Davies's defence said the MP did not intend to make ""personal gain"" or act in a ""dishonest way"" An MP convicted of making a false expenses claim has been ordered to do 50 hours unpaid work and fined Â£1,500. Conservative MP for Brecon and RadnorshireChris Davies pleaded guiltyto providing false or misleading information for allowances claims and attempting to do so in March. Davies, 51, made an ""unreserved apology"" following his sentencing at Southwark Crown Court on Tuesday. He nowfaces a recall petitionamid calls for his resignation. Davies must complete the community order within 12 months and was also ordered to pay Â£2,500 in costs. Tom Forster QC, defending, said it was likely Mr Davies's career was in ""tatters"" Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for him to resign, but in a statement Davies said he wanted to ""move on and continue"" his role as an MP. ""I have accepted today's ruling and want to take this opportunity to make an unreserved apology,"" he said. ""I would like to reiterate that I made a mistake and at no point did I at any time try to make any financial gain."" The Conservatives said Mr Davies has been given ""formal warning"" from the chief whip Julian Smith. A party spokesman said ""it is right that the people of Brecon and Radnorshire now get to have their say about whether they still support Mr Davies"". The court heard Chris Davies's political career is likely to be in ""tatters"" The charges related to when he was setting up his constituency office following the 2015 general election. In 2016, he tried to split a genuine cost of Â£700 for photographs for his office between two budgets by faking two separate invoices. The court heard only one of them, for Â£450, was reimbursed, from a start-up budget that only had about Â£480 remaining in it and was not due to roll over and otherwise may have been lost. Davies would have been allowed to claim the whole amount from a separate budget for office costs. Another invoice for the remaining Â£250 to be claimed from that budget was not submitted, the court heard, after his office manager noticed the discrepancy. The prosecution did not allege he was seeking falsely to profit from the invoices, but said the forged documents ""involved some sophistication and took effort to create"" and there was ""also the matter of breach of public trust"". Mr Forster said he was ""new to the system"" and had paid back any money given to him. He said there was a ""likelihood that his political career is in tatters"" and Davies was the ""author of his own misfortune"". Mr Justice Edis said the case was different ""from the expenses scandals from 10 years ago"" Mr Justice Edis said the MP's actions were ""highly discreditable"" and it ""remains shocking that when confronted with a simple accounting problem you thought the simplest thing to do was to forge documents"". The office for the Commons' Speaker John Bercow is now expected to ask officials to open a recall petition - a by-election will be held if 10% of the MP's constituents sign it. The figure needed to trigger a by-election is yet to be confirmed, but it is thought about 5,300 names would be required. Following the sentencing, the Welsh Liberal Democrats said Davies ""should resign immediately and give Brecon and Radnorshire the chance to elect a new voice to represent them in Parliament"".

Landfill ban could see Scotland's waste sent to England,"Scottish rubbish may have to be sent to England in order to meet a planned ban on household waste going to landfill by 2021. The Scottish government wants to stop traditional black bag waste and a range of recyclable materials being buried in the ground. But a new study has found the cost of the ban could be more than Â£1bn. Less than half of Scotland's 32 councils have plans in place to meet the 2021 target. The study of waste markets predicts there will be insufficient capacity to meet the expected level of need, with a gap predicted of one million tonnes of waste per year in 2021. That could fall to 90,000 tonnes by 2035 if councils take action to reduce waste and build more energy-from-waste processing facilities. But if this does not happen quickly enough then the waste would need to be exported out of Scotland. The report, commissioned by Scottish ministers, states:  ""Excluding consideration of waste minimisation and recycling, the ban will result in significant economic costs to Scotland due to the need to export an increased amount of residual waste - whether as an interim solution until new thermal treatment capacity comes online, or as a long-term solution."" If this involved payment in tax or to private processing facilities, then at least the penalty would be circulated within the Scottish economy but instead, the report points out, that the payments would go elsewhere: ""This has the effect of exporting revenue to English or continental landfill or treatment providers."" The amount of household waste sent to landfill has decreased for six consecutive years and it is hoped recycling initiatives will boost this further ahead of the 2021 ban Researchers modelled the likely costs of the landfill ban, which ranged from Â£414m to Â£1.156bn. The independent study also found that, as of 2017, only 14 out of 32 councils had plans in place to process all their expected biodegradable waste and avoid sending it to landfill. This is despite the ""significant notice"" given of the planned ban, announced in 2012. Local authority body Cosla hasalready warnedthat ""as it stands it seems unlikely that the 2021 ban will be fully achievable"". The Scottish Environment Protection Agency last year warned landfill operators that they will have the statutory duty to check what is being placed in their dumps, to ensure that none of it is biodegradable. The amount of Scottish household waste recycled now exceeds the amount sent to landfill Opposition politicians criticised the Scottish government's handling of the ban. Scottish Liberal Democrat leader Willie Rennie said: ""It would make a mockery of the law if the SNP's solution to meeting their own landfill ban is to ship it to England or abroad."" Scottish Conservative environment spokesman Maurice Golden said the target was an ""SNP gimmick"". He said: ""This damning report shows that their target is wildly off-schedule."" A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The Scottish government is committed to ending the practice of sending biodegradable municipal waste to landfill. ""This will contribute to progress on climate change targets and increase incentives to deal with waste in a more sustainable way. We have been working closely with local authorities and commercial bodies to assess and support progress towards implementing the ban. ""Our focus now is on working with authorities who do not yet have a solution in place to identify ways, such as collaborative procurement and improved recycling, in which they can comply with the ban.""

Child held near cliff edge prompts warning,"Among those perched near the cliff edge, a man was spotted lifting a child to peer down below The National Trust has warned people to ""act sensibly"" after pictures emerged of a man holding a child inches from an unstable cliff edge. The pair were pictured on Monday at Seven Sisters near Eastbourne, East Sussex. In 2017, 50,000 tonnes of the cliff crumbled and fell to the beach below. The following day a 23-year-old South Korean tourist fell to her death when she jumped in the air for a picture and lost her footing on the edge. The chalk cliffs are unstable and sections have eroded and collapsed in the past Others were also seen near the edge and the Trust spokeswoman said: ""It isn't safe to stand or sit on the cliff edge. ""The cliffs are unstable in places and there are undercuts in the chalk, which people may be unaware of from the top. ""We advise visitors to act sensibly."" There are permanent signs in place warning people of the danger. MP for Lewes Maria Caulfield said the warm weather made an ""ideal time to visit the coast"". However, she said it was ""disappointing and concerning"" to see people on the edge or ""dangling children on the edge"". ""We know how dangerous those cliff edges are. We know people have been injured, and we've had tragic loss of life in the past."" People enjoying the Bank Holiday sun got precariously close to the end of the cliff Ms Caulfield said she will speak to local councils on how to tackle the safety issues in future. Previously, some havecriticised the signage for not standing out, and there have beencalls for signs in foreign languagesas tourism from the Far East increases. Ms Caulfield said: ""It's a difficult balance... if you put too much fencing or signage you destroy the beauty of the place. ""But it's clear, despite the efforts of the local councils, the signs that are there are not enough to deter people from going close to the cliff edge.""

Council defends NI's highest rates hike,"Council say the rise will ensure social, economic and environmental improvement across the district Derry City and Strabane District Council has defended Northern Ireland's steepest hike in district rates. On 1 April, the council increased rates by 3.46%, the biggest annual increase across all 11 councils. Rates in Northern Ireland pay for public services and projects; bills are calculated on property value. Derry and Strabane Council said the hike ensured the district's ""continued social, economic and environmental improvement"". Some ratepayers say the rise is unjustified. Paul Howie, who lives in Derry's Waterside, said his annual rates bill had risen significantly in recent years. Some of the money from rates goes towards services such as bin collections ""There may well be others who feel they are getting their money's worth, but it doesn't seem that way for me,"" Mr Howie told BBC news NI. ""Now that one of my sons has gone off to university, I don't even leave my bin out once a week anymore. ""The council is great at putting on the big events and marketing the city has become so much better since the 2013 City of Culture year, but in a town with such high unemployment and such low disposable income, the level of the rise is pretty hard to take."" Davy Ralston from Strabane said ratepayers there often feel more money is directed towards Derry. The council said a number of capital projects were being prioritised, including the Riverine project that could transform 47 acres of Strabane ""We are not seeing any benefit to the rising rates of recent years,"" he said. ""Derry looks to be thriving and that's great, it's a brilliant city, but here in Strabane it does seem we are treated like the poor cousin."" He said he had no issue with paying rates because ""we all want the best public services"". ""The issue is that the rise here is higher than anywhere else and we are seeing nothing or little back."" Antrim and Newtownabbey - 0.99% Ards and North Down - 2.9% Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon - 1.96% Belfast - 1.98% Causeway Coast and Glens - 1.5% Derry and Strabane - 3.46% Fermanagh and Omagh - 2.3% Lisburn and Castlereagh - 2.29% Mid and East Antrim - 1.98% Mid Ulster - 1.49% Newry, Mourne and Down - 1.99% A Derry and Strabane District council spokeswoman said the council had ""already embarked on a portfolio of projects that are transforming local communities and additional rates investment will provide the necessary resources and capital match funding required to continue this drive for positive growth"". She said priorities for the year ahead included: Greenway projects in the city Wider greenway schemes linking Derry and Strabane to Donegal in the Republic of Ireland Seven community centre projects earmarked for areas of Derry Play and sports facilities across the district Strabane's Riverine project ProgressingDerry's city deal proposal In 2015, a new 11 council model replaced Northern Ireland's longstanding 26 local authorities. The new system promised to make efficiency savings of some Â£438m over a 25-year period. The first term of the new system comes to a close in the coming weeks with fresh elections taking place in May. Before that, householders will receive their annual rates bills. Using the Department of Finance's (DoF) online rates calculator and based on a Â£150,000 house, the BBC recorded the rates bill in the first year of each new council (2015/16) and the most recent year (2019/20). Back in 2015/16, the average rates bill for a Â£150,000 house was Â£1,049.25. This year it will be Â£1169.59. That represents an increase of around 11.5%. There are multiple reasons for differing rates in different council areas - everything from property prices, council income, population change, planned investment and legacy debt all have a bearing. Derry City and Strabane Council also subsidises an airport. Not only does that council have the highest rate, but rates bills there have increased by more than any other.

'First malaria vaccine' test starts,"The vaccine has already been tested in smaller trial programmes A large-scale pilot of what has been called the world's first malaria vaccine to give partial protection to children has begun in Malawi. The RTS,S vaccine trains the immune system to attack the malaria parasite, which is spread by mosquito bites. Earlier, smaller trials showed thatnearly 40% of the 5-to-17-month-olds who received it were protected,external. Malaria cases appear to be on the rise again after a decade of success in combating the deadly disease. ""This is a landmark moment for immunisations, malaria control, and public health,"" Dr Kate O'Brien, Director of Immunisation and Vaccines at the World Health Organization, told the BBC. According to the most recent annual figures, global malaria cases are no longer falling, sparking concerns about its resurgence.  435,000died of malaria worldwide 219m infectedAfrica saw more than 90% of cases and deaths Malawi is the first of three countries chosen for the pilot to roll out the vaccine. It aims to immunise 120,000 children aged two years and below.  The other two countries, Ghana and Kenya, will introduce the vaccine in the coming weeks. The three countries were picked because they already run large programmes to tackle malaria, including the use of bed nets, yet still have high numbers of cases. Malaria kills some 435,000 people around the world each year,the majority of them children,external. Most of these deaths are in Africa, where more than 250,000 children die every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr O'Brien said that malaria is ""a really difficult disease to develop a vaccine against"". An early trial of the vaccine began in 2009. ""There were seven countries participating in a large trial where over 15,000 children participated,"" Dr David Schellenberg, who has been working on the development of the vaccine with the WHO, told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""[The trial] showed pretty clearly that this vaccine is safe and it is efficacious in terms of its ability to prevent clinical malaria episodes and also severe malaria episodes,"" he said. RTS,S has been more than three decades in the making, with scientists from drugs company GSK creating it in 1987. Years of testing supported by a host of organisations, including the Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and costing an estimated $1bn (Â£770m), have led to this point. Campaigners have long been calling for an effective way to deal with malaria The nearly 40% efficacy is not high in comparison with vaccines for other diseases, but Dr Schellenberg says RTS,S will add to the preventative measures, such as bed nets and insecticides, already being used. ""Nobody is suggesting that this is a magic bullet,"" Dr Schellenberg said. ""It may not sound like much but we're talking about 40% reduction in severe malaria which unfortunately still has high mortality even when you have good access to good treatment,"" he added. Dr O'Brien said the vaccine lasted for at least for seven years and would target infants because they are most at risk. The vaccine needs to be given four times - once a month for three months and then a fourth dose 18 months later. Dr Schellenberg accepted that it might be a challenge for mothers in some areas to take their children to clinics for all four doses. This stage of the trial is expected to be completed by 2023,external, according to Path.

Donald Trump set for state visit in June,"This video can not be played Remember President Trump's last UK visit in July 2018? US President Donald Trump will make a three-day state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June, Buckingham Palace has announced. The president and First Lady Melania Trump will be guests of the Queen and attend a ceremony in Portsmouth to mark 75 years since the D-Day landings. He will also have official talks with the prime minister at Downing Street. Mr Trump previously met the Queen at Windsor Castle when he came to the UK in July 2018 on a working visit. The White House said the upcoming trip would reaffirm the ""steadfast and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom"". The president was promised a state visit by Prime Minister Theresa May after he was elected in 2016 - but no date was set. Mrs May said June's state visit was an ""opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship in areas such as trade, investment, security and defence, and to discuss how we can build on these ties in the years ahead"". But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry voiced concerns about the visit, saying: ""It beggars belief that on the very same day Donald Trump is threatening to veto a United Nations resolution against the use of rape as a weapon of war, Theresa May is pressing ahead with her plans to honour him with a state visit to the UK."" Trump's UK 'working' visit in nine moments Trump meets the Queen at Windsor Castle Representatives of other countries invited to the Portsmouth event on 5 June include those from Canada, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Greece, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Portsmouth was one of the key embarkation points for many of the landing craft on D-Day, when, during World War Two, Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France marking the beginning of the end for Adolf Hitler's domination of Europe. The June gathering on Southsea Common will involve live performances, military displays and tributes to the Allied troops who fought in Normandy, including at least 11 Royal Navy vessels in the Solent and a flypast of 26 RAF aircraft. After leaving the UK, Mr Trump and his wife will travel to France for a series of D-Day anniversary events on 6 June itself. First Lady Melania Trump, her husband and Theresa May on the steps of Blenheim Palace on July 12, 2018 The president's last visit to the UK - when he had talks with Mrs May at Chequers before heading to Scotland, where he owns the Turnberry golf course - was marked by demonstrations. In London, thousands of people took to the streets tovoice their concerns. And in Scotland, people showed their displeasure,both in Edinburgh and at Turnberry. Bercow: Trump should not speak in Parliament Policing Trump's UK visit cost nearly Â£18m The National Police Chiefs' Council estimated that the police operation for the president's 2018 visit cost nearly Â£18m. It said 10,000 officers from across the country were needed to cover the occasion. The campaigners behind the 2018 protests - the Stop Trump Coalition and Stand Up To Trump - have vowed to mobilise ""huge numbers"" once again in response to the visit. Shaista Aziz from the Stop Trump Coalition criticised the US president's ""politics of hate and bigotry"", while Sabby Dhalu from Stand Up To Trump called for people to ""take to the streets and say clearly that Donald Trump is not welcome here"". But Sarah Elliott, chair of Republicans Abroad, denied that President Trump courted the support of racists, telling the BBC he won in many areas that had elected Barack Obama twice. ""He spoke to the people and what they wanted to hear,"" she said. A spokeswoman for Commons Speaker John Bercow said a request for Mr Trump to address Parliament - an event often associated with a state visit - would be ""considered in the usual way"", but did not say whether a request had yet been received. Mr Bercow - who, as Speaker, has the power to veto who addresses Parliament - previously said he would be ""strongly opposed"" to Mr Trump addressing the Houses of Parliament during a state visit.

BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said Mr Trump avoided London on his last visit and made it clear he did not particularly want to come to the capital if he was going to face protests. However, our correspondent said a key part of a state visit is the procession down the Mall in front of Buckingham Palace and it is thought protesters will gather there - not a first for a state visit. Once inside Buckingham Palace, it is expected the Queen will host a banquet for around 150 guests in Mr Trump's honour. The Queen has hosted two previous state visits from US presidents - George W Bush in November 2003, and Barack Obama in May 2011. A Trump ""baby blimp"" hovered above Parliament Square during the 2018 protest The Queen welcomed President Barack Obama to Buckingham Palace in 2011 A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. State visits are grand occasions, but they are not just ceremonial affairs. They have political purpose and are used by the government of the day to further what it sees as Britain's national interests. Once the location and dates are confirmed, the government, the visiting government and the royal household will agree on a detailed schedule. The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There is usually a state banquet, and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included. The Speaker of the House of Commons is one of three ""key holders"" to Westminster Hall, and as such, effectively holds a veto over who addresses Parliament. The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state a year. She has hosted 112 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952. The last state visit to the UK was in October, when King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands came for two days. The official website of the Queen and the Royal Family has a full list of all state visits since then, including details of how the ceremonies unfold. Remember Trump's last UK visit?

Barrister strike threat over 'low pay',"Criminal barristers in England and Wales are threatening to walk out of trials or refuse new work over a pay row with the Crown Prosecution Service. The Criminal Bar Association says rates for prosecution work have not risen in 20 years and barristers can receive as little as Â£46.50 for a day's work. In a CBA survey, 95% of barristers said they would strike to change the rates. The CPS said it was in the process of reviewing barrister fees to make them ""fair, affordable and sustainable"".

""It is unsustainable to carry on like this,"" it added. The CPS said it understood the wish for the review to be agreed quickly but it would take ""at least four months"".

'New IRA' admits Lyra McKee murder,"Lyra McKee was observing rioting in Londonderry's Creggan estate when she was shot The New IRA has admitted carrying out the murder of journalist Lyra McKee,according to the Irish News.,external In a statement given to the paper the group offered ""full and sincere apologies"" to her family and friends. Ms McKee, 29, was shot in the head on Thursday night while observing rioting in Londonderry's Creggan estate. A 57-year-old woman arrested on Tuesday in connection with Ms McKee's death has been released unconditionally. Journalist shot dead during Derry rioting 'Massive' public response to McKee murder Timeline of Irish dissident activity Police say there has been a ""massive response"" to her killing and have urged more members of the public to come forward. The statement from the New IRA comes after the hard-left republican political party Saoradh - which has the support of the New IRA - had previously sought to justify the use of violence on Thursday. In the House of Common on Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said there was nothing that could justify this ""murderous act"". A message of condolence was added to the mural at Free Derry corner in the city ""To those responsible for this act of terrorism, we say: 'We have heard your excuses and your hollow apologies. No-one buys it. This was no accident',"" she added. Mrs Bradley also said she would hold discussions with the leaders of Northern Ireland's political parties later this week. She will be among political leaders who will attend Ms McKee's funeral on Wednesday at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast. Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar will also attend. They will be joined by Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who is already in Northern Ireland meeting some of the Stormont parties after calls on Monday for urgent talks to be convened to restore power-sharing.

Residents return after mountain fire,"This video can not be played The huge fire in Blaenau Ffestiniog was described as ""looking like a volcano"" Families in about 20 homes had to be evacuated after a large fire engulfed a mountain in Snowdonia. About 30 firefighters were tackling the blaze at Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, at its overnight peak. Eyewitness Chris McPhail said: ""As I was driving up I could just see the glow and a load of smoke. It just looked like a volcano."" The alarm was raised just before 20:30 BST on Monday, with residents asked to leave in the early hours of Tuesday. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was still dealing with hotspots flaring up in the area and crews remain at the scene - but say there is no immediate danger to residents. Most residents have returned to their homes but locals are offering their spare rooms to any families still displaced by the fire. Crews tackle 12 national park fires How wildfires start on Welsh hillsides Will extreme weather of 2018 be repeated? Part of the A470 - the main route between north and south Wales - through the town was shut for several hours at Church Street but has now reopened. Allow Twitter content?

The cause of the fire is not yet known Geraint Hughes, who is managing the fire operation on the ground, said his teams had faced substantial challenges tackling the blaze. ""The rugged terrain and the steepness of it makes it difficult to put staff and personnel on the mountain to tackle it with beaters or hose-reels,"" he said. He said fire crews were ""currently managing"" the situation, however some areas were continuing to flare-up. The quarrying terrain has posed challenges to firefighters, says Geraint Hughes from North Wales Fire and Rescue Garreg Ddu - Black Rock - was 'like a volcano' say eyewitnesses Many of the evacuated residents spent the night in a cafe, including Jackie Brunger.

"Our future has been stolen, says Greta","MPs applauded climate change activist Greta Thunberg Teenage activist Greta Thunberg has described the UK's response to climate change as ""beyond absurd"". In a speech to MPs, the Swedish 16-year-old criticised the UK for supporting new exploitation of fossil fuels and exaggerating cuts to carbon emissions. She was invited to Westminster after inspiring the school climate strikes movement. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said ""we have not done nearly enough"". In her speech in Parliament on Tuesday, Miss Thunberg said the UK was supporting shale gas fracking, greater exploitation of North Sea oil and gas fields and expanding airports. ""This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind,"" she said. She also described the UK's carbon emissions reduction as the result of ""very creative"" accounting. The country's reported 37% reduction in emissions since 1990 was only 10% when aviation, shipping, imports and exports were counted, she said. How might ministers win over protesters? Greta Thunberg: 'Climate fight will never stop' Climate protesters stage museum 'die-in' Who is Greta Thunberg? Miss Thunberg said her generation's future had been ""stolen"" so that ""a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money"". She told MPs: ""You don't listen to the science because you are only interested in the answers that will allow you to carry on as if nothing has happened."" Mr Gove said that although governments have not done enough to tackle climate change, ""in the past few years it has become inescapable that we have to act"". He said: ""The time to act is now, the challenge could not be clearer - Greta, you have been heard."" An empty seat was left for Theresa May as Miss Thunberg met politicians Earlier, an empty chair was left for Prime Minister Theresa May as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and Green Party leader Caroline Lucas met the environmental campaigner for a round-table discussion. The Westminster leaders of the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, were also at the meeting. Mrs May was chairing a cabinet meeting and Downing Street said it had received no official request to attend. Ms Lucas told Miss Thunberg there was a growing ""sense of urgency"" and that ""more than ever, politicians have our ears open to your message"". During Miss Thunberg's visit to the UK she has also spoken at the Extinction Rebellion climate protests and given media interviews. The teenager sparked an international youth movement after she staged a ""School Strike for Climate"" in front of the Swedish Parliament in August last year. Since then she has met the Pope and addressed the European Parliament. Speaking about her newfound fame, she said: ""It's unbelievable, I can't really take it in."" Miss Thunberg, who says she gave up flying in 2015,travelled for two days by train,externalto reach the UK. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She has said thather generation will not be able to fly except in emergencies,external""if we are the least bit serious"" about preventing global warming greater than 1.5C. Earlier, Miss Thunberg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her message for politicians was: ""Listen to the science, listen to the scientists. Invite them to talk."" She said it was important for politicians to act because ""most emissions aren't caused by individuals, they're caused by corporations and states"". Her arrival in the UK comes as Extinction Rebellion activiststook over part of the Natural History Museumon Monday andmarched on Parliamenton Tuesday morning. More than 1,000 people have been arrested since their protests began in central London a week ago. Speaking in the House of Commons, energy minister Claire Perry said she had ""mixed emotions"" about the protests, which had raised important issues but risked leaving people ""fearful for the future rather than hopeful"". Miss Thunberg, who spoke to the crowds in Marble Arch on Sunday, told the BBC that disruptive action ""definitely has a lot of impact"". Asked whether it was necessary, she said: ""As long as it's non-violent, I think that could definitely make a difference."" Miss Thunberg said she first heard about climate change aged about eight years old. ""I was just very moved,"" she said. ""When I was 11 I became very depressed,"" she added. ""It had a lot to do with the climate and ecological crisis. I thought everything was just so wrong and nothing was happening and there's no point in anything."" After realising she could make a difference, she said she promised herself that ""I was going to do something good with my life"". This video can not be played Environmental activist Greta Thunberg says climate change is 'an existential crisis' The teenager also admitted that, when she first told her parents of her plan to miss school every Friday, they ""weren't very fond of that idea"". In the wide-ranging BBC interview, Miss Thunberg said that having Asperger's had helped her in life: ""It makes me different, and being different is a gift, I would say. It also makes me see things from outside the box. ""I don't easily fall for lies, I can see through things. If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike, for instance."" Asked what she would say if she met US President Donald Trump, she said: ""I can't really say anything to him that he hasn't heard before. ""Obviously he's not listening to the science and to what we have to say, so I wouldn't be able to change his mind.""

Mass funerals on Sri Lanka's day of mourning,"This video can not be played The footage shows a man wearing a large backpack calmly walking towards St Sebastian's church Sri Lanka has held its first mass funeral amid a day of mourning for the victims of Sunday's bomb blasts. The death toll from the attacks on churches and hotels has risen to 321 with about 500 wounded, police said. A state of emergency is in effect to prevent further attacks. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed the attack on Tuesday via its news outlet. Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ). The country's prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said the government believed there ""may be links"" to IS. ""This could not have been done just locally,"" he said. ""There had been training given and a coordination which we are not seeing earlier."" A BBC correspondent in Sri Lanka says the IS statement should be treated cautiously. As with previous attacks that the group says it carried out, it has provided no evidence for the claim. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who are the victims? Police have now detained 40 suspects in connection with the attack. A spokesman said they included a Syrian who was arrested ""after the interrogation of local suspects"". The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts. Another funeral service was scheduled for later on Tuesday. Earlier, a moment of silence was observed at 08:30, reflecting the time the first of six bombs detonated. Flags were lowered to half-mast and people, many of them in tears, bowed their heads in respect. The death toll has risen to 321 with around 500 injured The state of emergency gives police and the military sweeping powers to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders - powers that were last used during the nation's civil war. The government limited access to Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram after the blasts. Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? NTJ, the group named by the government as the main suspect, has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. At the scene: Ayeshea Perera, BBC News, Negombo Negombo is usually bustling but today is very different. Most of its shops and businesses are shut, there is a heavily-armed military presence and the entire city is bedecked in white flags - a sign of mourning. Everywhere, there is a sense of complete shock. People are discussing what happened in hushed tones. Many take pictures of the banners or try to put up bouquets of flowers between the iron grills on the perimeter of the church. Dispatch: St Anthony's, 'church of miracles' About 150 people are estimated to have been killed during St Sebastian's Easter Mass. There are so many funerals to conduct that they are being carried out in batches. Security is tight - people are not allowed to drive within a 1km radius of the church. St Sebastian's itself is strung with banners. Some have pictures of those who died, others have messages of condolence and condemnation. Huge crowds of people are walking in to pay their respects, many having travelled from outside the city. But there was tension too. An interfaith event organised by the local mosque to condemn the attacks was cut short after a mob surrounded it armed with poles and knives. They were dispersed by police. IS claimed the attack on Tuesday via its Amaq news outlet, saying it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"". It provided no evidence for the claim. Defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament on Tuesday that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI, but he gave no details. The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath He also said ""preliminary investigations"" indicated thatthe bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, but again gave no further information. NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. Meanwhile, police in Colombo have been placed on high alert and told to search for a lorry and a van suspected to be carrying explosives, the BBC Sinhala's Azzam Ameen reports. Mr Wickremesinghe said that only Sri Lankan nationals had been arrested in connection with the attack so far, but that some of the attackers may have travelled abroad before the bombings. Sunday's attacks have highlighted rifts in Sri Lanka's leadership, after it emerged that authorities were warned about an imminent threat. Security agencies had been watching the NTJ jihadist group, reports said, and had notified police about a possible attack. But Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the cabinet were not informed, ministers said. Authorities have declared a state of emergency Cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said the information was not passed to Mr Wickremesinghe due to a rift between the prime minister and President Maithripala Sirisena. However, it was not clear on Monday whether Mr Sirisena had been made aware of the warnings. ""Our understanding is that it was correctly circulated among security and police,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, a senior adviser to Mr Sirisena, told the BBC. He said that the president had appointed a special committee led by a supreme court judge to investigate what had happened. The first reports of explosions came at about 08:45 local time on Sunday with six blasts reported within a small space of time. Sri Lanka is GMT+5.5 21 April 2019 08:45 local time-09:05 Three churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo's Kochchikade district are targeted during Easter services and blasts also rock the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the country's capital. 11:40 local time 13:45 local time 14:15 local time 14:30 local time 14:45 local time 22:00 local time 22 April 2019 06:00 local time About 07:42 local time 08:30 local time At least 290 people, including many foreigners, are now confirmed to have died. More than 500 are injured. About 12:30 local time About 15:27 local time About 16:18 local time Video footage from St Anthony's Shrine, shared by Guardian journalist Michael Safi, showed people running from the area in panic. According to BBC Sinhala's Azzam Ameen, the blast happened while ""security forces personnel... tried to defuse a newly discovered explosives in a vehicle"". Police have not yet released details of how many people were killed and wounded at each location. All the attacks were carried out by suicide bombers, officials said. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' UK dad's tribute to family One of the first victims to be publicly identified was Sri Lankan celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne and her daughter Nisanga Mayadunne, who had posted a picture of the family having breakfast in the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo shortly before the deadly blast. Sri Lankan officials said 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 10 Indian nationals.

IS 'may be linked' to Sri Lanka attacks,"This video can not be played The footage shows a man wearing a large backpack calmly walking towards St Sebastian's church The Islamic State (IS) group may be linked to bomb blasts which killed 321 people and wounded 500 in Sri Lanka, the country's prime minister has said. Ranil Wickremesinghe said the government believed Sunday's attacks could not have been carried out without help from terror groups abroad. IS claimed the attack on Tuesday, although did not provide evidence. Meanwhile Sri Lanka's president vowed to ""completely restructure"" state security after the attacks. In a televised address late on Tuesday, Maithripala Sirisena said he plans to change the heads of defence forces ""within the next 24 hours"". He also admitted threat reports had not been shared with him, and promised to take ""stern action"" against security officials. Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ). But Mr Wickremesinghe said the attacks ""could not have been done just locally"". ""There had been training given and a coordination which we are not seeing earlier,"" he said. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who are the victims? Police have now detained 40 suspects in connection with the attack, all of whom were Sri Lankan nationals. A state of emergency remains in effect to prevent further attacks. Mr Wickremesinghe said that only Sri Lankan nationals had been arrested in connection with the attack so far, but that some of the attackers may have travelled abroad before the bombings. ''We, certainly the security apparatus, are of the view there are foreign links and some of the evidence points to that. So if the IS (Islamic State) claimed it, we will be following up on this claim,"" he added. This video can not be played Volunteers provide water, food and support to those mourning the bombing in Negombo, Sri Lanka The nearly simultaneous attacks targeted three churches packed for Easter services and three major hotels in the capital, Colombo. An attack on a fourth hotel on Sunday was foiled, Mr Wickremesinghe said. He also warned that further militants and explosives could still be ""out there"" following the attack. IS said it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"" via its Amaq news outlet. It provided no evidence for the claim but shared an image on social media of eight men purported to be behind the attack. The group's last territory fell in March but even then experts had warned it does not mean the end of IS or its ideology. Authorities have declared a state of emergency Earlier, the country's defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI. He gave no further details. The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? He also said ""preliminary investigations"" indicated thatthe bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. The Sri Lankan government is facing scrutiny after it emerged the authorities were warned of about a possible attack. Security services had been monitoring the NTJ but the prime minister and the cabinet were not warned, ministers said. Analysis by BBC Security Correspondent Gordon Corera The Sri Lankan government has said locals from two known groups carried out the attack. But from the start - because of the scale and sophistication of it - they have also said they thought there was an external role. In the past, IS has sometimes claimed attacks that it was not involved in or which it simply inspired. But the details from IS would seem to back up the government's assessment. The choice of targets is much more in line with IS ideology than with the traditional types of communal violence seen in Sri Lanka. There are still questions - did the local men affiliate themselves to IS or receive direct support? Did they travel to Syria or to other countries? The Sri Lankan government has said it believes some of them had spent time abroad, but how significant was that to the plot? Answering questions like these will be important not just for Sri Lanka but other countries as they try and understand whether other relatively small, locally focused groups could be capable of transforming a threat into violence on such a massive scale. The first mass funeral was held on Tuesday, as Sri Lanka marked an official day of mourning for the victims. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' UK dad's tribute to family Sri Lankan officials said 38 foreign nationals were among the dead, with another 14 unaccounted for. The death toll includes at least eight British citizens and at least 10 Indian nationals.

Another funeral service was scheduled for later on Tuesday. A moment of silence was also observed at 08:30 on Tuesday, reflecting the time the first of six bombs detonated.

Dad's tribute to family killed in Sri Lanka,"Anita Nicholson and her son Alex, 14, and daughter Annabel, 11, died in the Shangri-La hotel bombing A British husband has paid tribute to his ""wonderful"" wife and their two ""amazing"" children who were among the 310 victims of a wave of bombings in Sri Lanka on Easter Sunday. Ben Nicholson survived the blast at the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo but his wife Anita, 42, their son Alex, 14, and daughter Annabel, 11, were all killed. They had been visiting the country on holiday from their home in Singapore. Five other British citizens were among those killed in eight blasts. They include former firefighter Bill Harrop and his partner, Dr Sally Bradley, from Manchester who were also on holiday. Tributes were also paid to business student Daniel Linsey and his sister, Amelie Linsey, who attended Godolphin and Latymer School in west London. The school said it was ""obviously devastated and shocked"" by the news, while Westminster Kingsway College, which Daniel attended, said it was ""saddened"" to hear of his ""tragic death"". The suicide attacks on churches and hotels in Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa also left 500 people injured. Bill Harrop and his partner Sally Bradley were among those killed in the blasts In Sri Lanka,the first mass funeral has been heldas the nation marks a day of mourning for the victims. Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath. The Islamic State (IS) group later claimed it carried out the attacks - but a BBC correspondent in Sri Lanka said the claim should be treated cautiously. Police have now detained 40 suspects in connection with the attack. A spokesman said they included a Syrian who was arrested ""after the interrogation of local suspects"". Meanwhile, Sri Lanka's defence minister, Ruwan Wijewardene, has said that ""preliminary investigations"" indicate the bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March. He did not give any details. The UK'sForeign Office has updated its travel advice for Sri Lanka,external, warning tourists to avoid crowded public areas, plan any movements carefully and avoid travelling during the newly-implemented nationwide curfew. Mr Nicholson, a partner with law firm Kennedys, said his family were killed at a table in the restaurant of the Shangri-La Hotel, in the capital Colombo. He said he was ""deeply distressed"" at his loss but ""mercifully, all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering"". In pictures: Sri Lanka's deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' He added that his wife, a lawyer for mining firm Anglo American, ""was a wonderful, perfect wife and a brilliant, loving and inspirational mother to our two wonderful children"". ""Alex and Annabel were the most amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful children, and Anita and I were immensely proud of them both and looking forward to seeing them develop into adulthood. ""They shared with their mother the priceless ability to light up any room they entered and bring joy to the lives of all they came into contact with."" He thanked the medical teams in Colombo and the Sri Lankan people he had encountered since. The damaged Shangri-La hotel in the Sri Lankan capital, Colombo, after an explosion Assistant County Fire Officer Dave Keelan, of Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, has paid tribute to his former colleague Mr Harrop after hearing the ""devastating"" news. ""Bill served here for 30 years, retiring at the end of 2012. He was a much loved and respected colleague and friend. He will be greatly missed."" Dr Bradley, who moved to Western Australia in 2012, was the director of clinical services at Rockingham Peel Group in Perth. Executive director Kathleen Smith told 6PR radio: ""She absolutely loved living in Australia. She felt very at home here. ""They (Dr Bradley and Mr Harrop) were soul mates, they just lived for each other. ""He had two boys, which Sally took on as her step-sons. She talked about them as if they were her own."" The team from North Manchester General Hospital, where Sally had previously worked, added: ""Sally was a lovely, kind individual, extremely approachable and gave so much to the NHS in Manchester during her career."" It is not currently known which explosion killed the couple. Most of those killed in the explosions are thought to be Sri Lankan nationals but officials say at least 31 foreigners are among the dead including British, Indian, Danish, Saudi, Chinese and Turkish nationals. Details have started to emerge about some of them, including Sri Lankan celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne and her daughter Nisanga, and three children ofDanish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen. The UK's High Commissioner, James Dauris, confirmed that eight British citizens were known to have died but said there were no further Britons with serious injuries. Mr Dauris said: ""We know there are a small number of foreign nationals who are unaccounted for. We don't know what the nationality of those people is."" He urged those still in the country to contact relatives and to follow instructions from local authorities. Manisha Gunasekera, Sri Lanka's High Commissioner, told the BBC that the large Sri Lankan community in the UK was ""very concerned"". The Queen has offered her condolences to Sri Lanka's president, saying her thoughts and prayers were with all Sri Lankans. She said: ""Prince Philip and I were deeply saddened to learn of the attacks in Sri Lanka yesterday and send our condolences to the families and friends of those who have lost their lives.""

Blasts also rocked the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the country's capital. Police then carried out raids on two addresses and there were explosions at both. One was in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and the other was near the Colombo district of Dematagoda in which three officers were killed.

British siblings among Sri Lanka victims,"Daniel and Amelie Linsey were among eight Britons killed in Sunday's bombings Tributes are being paid to members of three British families who were among more than 300 people killed in Easter Sunday's bombings in Sri Lanka. The deaths of London siblings Daniel and Amelie Linsey have ""shocked"" their schools, staff said. Eight Britons are known to have died in the attacks, including Dr Sally Bradley and Bill Harrop, both from Manchester, who were described as ""soulmates"". Anita Nicholson and her two children also died in a blast at a hotel. The death toll from the wave of attacks on churches and hotels in the Sri Lankan capital Colombo, Negombo and Batticaloa has now risen to 321, with about 500 injured, police say. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the attack was ""complex, highly co-ordinated and designed to cause maximum chaos, damage and heartbreak"". A team of family liaison officers has been sent to Sri Lanka to support the families of British victims and help repatriate the deceased, Mr Hunt said. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who are the victims? The father of Amelie and Daniel Linsey has been describing his desperate attempt to save his two teenage children. In anemotional interview with CNN,,externalMatt Linsey, a London-based American investment banker, said the pair were returning from the hotel buffet when a bomb went off. He said his instinct was to get them out of there but as he tried to do so a second bomb exploded, leaving both unconscious. He said a woman offered to help his daughter, who appeared to be moving, to an ambulance. Meanwhile, Mr Linsey lost his voice yelling for help to get his son, who was not moving, to an ambulance. Mr Linsey accompanied Daniel, 19, in an ambulance to hospital. Amelie, 15, arrived separately at the same hospital but neither could be saved. Amelie's school - Godolphin and Latymer School in west London - issued a statement on behalf of staff and pupils which said: ""We're obviously devastated and shocked and digesting the news at the moment. ""Our priority is supporting her family and the students here,"" staff said. And Westminster Kingsway College, where her brother Daniel was studying business, said it was ""shocked and saddened"", adding that it was offering counselling and support to students and staff who knew him. Bill Harrop and Sally Bradley just lived for each other, said one colleague Dr Bradley and her husband Mr Harrop, a retired firefighter, were on holiday in Sri Lanka when they were killed. The couple, who had lived in Western Australia since Mr Harrop's retirement, were soulmates who ""just lived for each other"", a former colleague of Dr Bradley said. ""She absolutely loved living in Australia. She felt very at home here,"" executive director Kathleen Smith told 6PR radio. She said Dr Bradley, who was director of clinical services at Rockingham Peel Group in Perth, talked of Mr Harrop's two sons as if they were her own. A team from North Manchester General Hospital, where Sally had previously worked, said: ""Sally was a lovely, kind individual, extremely approachable and gave so much to the NHS in Manchester during her career."" Mr Harrop had been in the fire service for 30 years before retiring in 2012, said Assistant County Fire Officer Dave Keelan, of Greater Manchester Fire Service. ""He was a much-loved and respected colleague and friend. He will be greatly missed."" It is not currently known which explosion killed the couple. Anita and her children Alex and Annabel died in the Shangri-La hotel bombing Anita Nicholson and her children Annabel, 11, and Alex, 14, were visiting Sri Lanka on holiday from their home in Singapore where Mrs Nicholson worked as a lawyer. Her husband, Ben Nicholson, who survived the blast, said his family were killed as they ate breakfast in the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo. ""Mercifully all three of them died instantly and with no pain or suffering,"" said Mr Nicholson, who is a partner with law firm Kennedys. He paid tribute to his ""wonderful, perfect wife"", a lawyer for mining firm Anglo American. She was ""a brilliant, loving and inspirational mother to our two wonderful children"", he said. ""Alex and Annabel were the most amazing, intelligent, talented and thoughtful children, and Anita and I were immensely proud of them both and looking forward to seeing them develop into adulthood,"" he added. ""They shared with their mother the priceless ability to light up any room they entered and bring joy to the lives of all they came into contact with."" Chancellor Phillip Hammond said Anita Nicholson was a former legal adviser at the Treasury and would be remembered by colleagues there as ""a brilliant and dedicated lawyer"".

It warns tourists to avoid crowded public areas, plan any movements carefully and not to travel during the newly-implemented nationwide curfew.

As Sri Lanka held its first mass funeral for 30 victims on Tuesday, the Islamic State (IS) group claimed responsibility for the attack via its news outlet. A BBC correspondent in Sri Lanka, however, has said that claim should be treated with caution. Sri Lanka's government had earlier blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ). On Tuesday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""An attack like this on a hotel or a church or any other place is an indiscriminate attack on all of us.""

Cross-party Brexit talks resume,"This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Government changes needed in cross-party talks"" The government says ""progress needs to be made urgently"" on Brexit talks with Labour - but that arranging time with the opposition has been ""difficult"". Senior figures from both sides have been trying to break the deadlock by agreeing a Brexit deal MPs can support. No 10 said talks had ""been difficult in some areas"", including ""timetabling"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government ""really needs to move on"" and change its Brexit agreement to solve the impasse. He said: ""We cannot go on hearing this tired old mantra that the Brexit agreement has to be adhered to."" The deal Theresa May negotiated with the EU has been rejected twice by Parliament, with the withdrawal agreement - the terms on how the UK leaves the bloc, rather than its future relationship with it - defeated a further time. PM to face grassroots no-confidence vote Are Tory members 'taking back control'? Brexit: A really simple guide Weeks of talks resumed between the two parties in Westminster on Tuesday afternoon following the Easter break. Mrs May's de facto deputy David Lidington was expected to lead for the government. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman took part on behalf of Labour. Ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir said ""fundamental issues"" remained between his party and ministers on a number of key issues. Some Tory MPs are angry the discussions with Labour are even taking place. Leading backbencher Nigel Evans called on Mrs May to step down as prime minister ""as soon as possible"", adding that the PM ""had been reaching out to the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn, when she should have been reaching out to the people"". Talks between Labour and the government seem to be faltering on two fronts - timing and substance. Both sides say there has been serious engagement. But the prime minister wants the talks concluded urgently to give her a chance of cancelling the UK's participation in the European parliamentary elections. That means getting a deal through Parliament by 22 May. If it looks like an agreement can't be reached with the opposition quickly, Theresa May wants them jointly to sign up to a series of parliamentary votes that both sides would regard as binding, to try to break the impasse. But Labour doesn't appear willing to be rushed. And the main opposition party says Mrs May still needs to erase her red line on a customs union if she is to make progress. Sources say the issue was discussed at the cabinet today - but, while no votes were taken, there didn't seem to be a majority in favour of doing so. As things stand, the Brexit deadlock continues - and the European election campaigns are getting under way. Senior members of the influential 1922 committee of Tory MPs are meeting in Parliament. Under current party rules, MPs cannot call another no-confidence vote in the prime minister until December - but the committee is expected to discuss whether steps should be taken to try to change that. The group's joint executive secretary Mr Evans told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the calls for the prime minister to quit had become ""a clamour"". ""The only way we're going to break this impasse properly is if we have fresh leadership of the Conservative Party,"" he said. But prisons minister Rory Stewart said Mrs May was doing a ""good job"" and deserved ""praise not blame"". ""It's nothing to do with the individual, it's that people disagree deeply about Brexit,"" he added. Who could replace Theresa May? A leadership hustings in all but name The comments came after it emerged that Mrs May faces a no-confidence challenge from Tory campaigners. More than 70 local association chiefs have called for an extraordinary general meeting to discuss her leadership and a non-binding vote is to be held at the National Conservative Convention EGM in May. If the grass-roots Tory vote showed a lack of confidence - it could put greater pressure on the 1922 Committee to find some way of forcibly removing the PM from office. That pressure could increase further if the Tories poll badly in local and European elections on 2 and 23 May respectively. The UKhas been given an extension to the Brexit process until 31 October.

Malaria cases appear to be on the rise again after a decade of success in combating the deadly disease. ""This is a landmark moment for immunisations, malaria control, and public health,"" Dr Kate O'Brien, Director of Immunisation and Vaccines at the World Health Organization, told the BBC. According to the most recent annual figures, global malaria cases are no longer falling, sparking concerns about its resurgence.  435,000died of malaria worldwide 219m infectedAfrica saw more than 90% of cases and deaths Malawi is the first of three countries chosen for the pilot to roll out the vaccine. It aims to immunise 120,000 children aged two years and below.  The other two countries, Ghana and Kenya, will introduce the vaccine in the coming weeks. The three countries were picked because they already run large programmes to tackle malaria, including the use of bed nets, yet still have high numbers of cases. Malaria kills some 435,000 people around the world each year,the majority of them children,external. Most of these deaths are in Africa, where more than 250,000 children die every year, according to the World Health Organization (WHO). Dr O'Brien said that malaria is ""a really difficult disease to develop a vaccine against"". An early trial of the vaccine began in 2009. ""There were seven countries participating in a large trial where over 15,000 children participated,"" Dr David Schellenberg, who has been working on the development of the vaccine with the WHO, told the BBC's Newsday programme. ""[The trial] showed pretty clearly that this vaccine is safe and it is efficacious in terms of its ability to prevent clinical malaria episodes and also severe malaria episodes,"" he said. RTS,S has been more than three decades in the making, with scientists from drugs company GSK creating it in 1987. Years of testing supported by a host of organisations, including the Path Malaria Vaccine Initiative, and costing an estimated $1bn (Â£770m), have led to this point. Campaigners have long been calling for an effective way to deal with malaria The nearly 40% efficacy is not high in comparison with vaccines for other diseases, but Dr Schellenberg says RTS,S will add to the preventative measures, such as bed nets and insecticides, already being used. ""Nobody is suggesting that this is a magic bullet,"" Dr Schellenberg said. ""It may not sound like much but we're talking about 40% reduction in severe malaria which unfortunately still has high mortality even when you have good access to good treatment,"" he added. Dr O'Brien said the vaccine lasted for at least for seven years and would target infants because they are most at risk. The vaccine needs to be given four times - once a month for three months and then a fourth dose 18 months later. Dr Schellenberg accepted that it might be a challenge for mothers in some areas to take their children to clinics for all four doses. This stage of the trial is expected to be completed by 2023,external, according to Path.

"Cross-party Brexit talks to resumeThe government will meet Labour for further discussions, as a Tory MP calls on the PM to stand down.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Government changes needed in cross-party talks"" The government says ""progress needs to be made urgently"" on Brexit talks with Labour - but that arranging time with the opposition has been ""difficult"". Senior figures from both sides have been trying to break the deadlock by agreeing a Brexit deal MPs can support. No 10 said talks had ""been difficult in some areas"", including ""timetabling"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government ""really needs to move on"" and change its Brexit agreement to solve the impasse. He said: ""We cannot go on hearing this tired old mantra that the Brexit agreement has to be adhered to."" The deal Theresa May negotiated with the EU has been rejected twice by Parliament, with the withdrawal agreement - the terms on how the UK leaves the bloc, rather than its future relationship with it - defeated a further time. PM to face grassroots no-confidence vote Are Tory members 'taking back control'? Brexit: A really simple guide Weeks of talks resumed between the two parties in Westminster on Tuesday afternoon following the Easter break. Mrs May's de facto deputy David Lidington was expected to lead for the government. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman took part on behalf of Labour. Ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir said ""fundamental issues"" remained between his party and ministers on a number of key issues. Some Tory MPs are angry the discussions with Labour are even taking place. Leading backbencher Nigel Evans called on Mrs May to step down as prime minister ""as soon as possible"", adding that the PM ""had been reaching out to the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn, when she should have been reaching out to the people"". Talks between Labour and the government seem to be faltering on two fronts - timing and substance. Both sides say there has been serious engagement. But the prime minister wants the talks concluded urgently to give her a chance of cancelling the UK's participation in the European parliamentary elections. That means getting a deal through Parliament by 22 May. If it looks like an agreement can't be reached with the opposition quickly, Theresa May wants them jointly to sign up to a series of parliamentary votes that both sides would regard as binding, to try to break the impasse.

Sources say the issue was discussed at the cabinet today - but, while no votes were taken, there didn't seem to be a majority in favour of doing so. As things stand, the Brexit deadlock continues - and the European election campaigns are getting under way. Senior members of the influential 1922 committee of Tory MPs are meeting in Parliament. Under current party rules, MPs cannot call another no-confidence vote in the prime minister until December - but the committee is expected to discuss whether steps should be taken to try to change that. The group's joint executive secretary Mr Evans told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the calls for the prime minister to quit had become ""a clamour"". ""The only way we're going to break this impasse properly is if we have fresh leadership of the Conservative Party,"" he said.

More than 70 local association chiefs have called for an extraordinary general meeting to discuss her leadership and a non-binding vote is to be held at the National Conservative Convention EGM in May. If the grass-roots Tory vote showed a lack of confidence - it could put greater pressure on the 1922 Committee to find some way of forcibly removing the PM from office. That pressure could increase further if the Tories poll badly in local and European elections on 2 and 23 May respectively. The UKhas been given an extension to the Brexit process until 31 October.

Change UK launches election campaign,"Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Chris Leslie left their parties to form Change UK Change UK has launched its campaign for the European Parliamentary elections, with 70 candidates including journalist Rachel Johnson - sister of Tory MP and leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson. The party - formerly known as The Independent Group - is made up of11 MPs who quit Labour and the Tories. They are preparing for the European election asthe latest Brexit delaymeans the UK may have to take part. Change UK are a pro-Remain party who back another referendum on Brexit. Ms Johnson, who was most recently a member of the Liberal Democrats, said: ""I'm sure that Boris understands why this is not a vote against Boris. ""This is a vote for change. We need to move the dial. People need to have a say."" Interim leader Heidi Allen told the event in Bristol: ""These elections are a chance to send the clearest possible message - we demand a People's Vote and the right to campaign to remain in the European Union. We are not afraid to say it as clearly as that. ""This is no rebel alliance. This is the home of the Remain alliance."" Cross-party Brexit talks to resume Labour 'must back second Brexit vote' The life of MEPs in Brexit limbo Former BBC correspondent Gavin Esler is also a candidate. He said UK politics was ""a worldwide joke"", and accused pro-Brexit campaigners, such as Nigel Farage, of ""stealing our patriotism"". ""We know Britain is better than the brain-dead politics of the past. We know Change UK is the only all-UK party to bring about changes. ""Ask yourself, what time is it? It is time for a change - it is time for Change UK."" BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley says Change UK want to be the number one choice for those unhappy with Brexit. But he said it would not be easy because plenty of other more established parties - namely the Lib Dems, the Greens, the SNP and Plaid Cymru - will be making a similar pitch. Following the launch,the Independent reported,externalthat a potential Change UK candidate, Ali Sadjady, had tweeted a derogatory comment about Romanians in November 2017. The tweet has now been deleted. The party later said that ""following discussions"", Mr Sadjady, had ""reflected on his inappropriate tweet from 2017 and agreed to stand down"". Mr Sadjadyposted an apology on Twitter,external, saying it was not representative of who he was. A number of parties have begun launching their campaigns for the European Parliamentary elections after Theresa May agreed a Brexit delay until 31 October with the EU. Mrs May said the UK could still exit before this date if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament. But, if not, the country is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May. The Independent Group was formed after eight Labour MPs and three Tory MPs left their parties in February. The three Conservative MPs blamed ""a shift to the right"" in their party and the government's ""disastrous handling of Brexit"", while Labour MP cited their party's stance on leaving the EU, along with the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism. In March, the group applied to become a party with the name Change UK and was given approval in April, meaning they could field candidates in the European elections. After about 3,700 applications, 70 candidates were picked. This video can not be played Gavin Esler: ""Our political system is a joke, it's a worldwide joke"" Change UK MP Anna Soubry said: ""No ifs no buts, no backroom deals... we were never on the fence, we always believed it and now we demand it... a People's Vote. ""If MPs can change their minds and change their votes, so can the British people. It is undemocratic, it is plain wrong, to deny people the rights of this country that are enjoyed in Parliament."" The sister of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is a writer and newspaper columnist. She has previously said she joined the Conservatives in 2008, inspired by a dinner party discussion with David Cameron, but left in 2011, complaining she was treated ""like the brainwashed member of a cult"". In April 2017, she joined the Liberal Democrats, saying that the country could ""be going over a cliff in a hard Brexit"". Ms Johnson was a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother in 2018. Glasgow-born Gavin Esler started a career in journalism at the The Belfast Telegraph before joining the BBC during the Northern Ireland Troubles. During a long career at the corporation, he was the BBC's chief North America correspondent, based in Washington, and a presenter of Newsnight. He left in 2017. He has written five novels and two non-fiction books, and is currently Chancellor of the University of Kent. He spoke in favour of a ""final say on the Brexit deal"" at a rally for the People's Vote campaign in Scotland in August last year. Last week, ex-UKIP leader Mr Faragelaunched his new Brexit Party,and on Tuesday, the party announced five new candidates for the European elections. They include left-wing activist Claire Fox, former Royal Marine James Glancy and charity CEO Matthew Patten. Nigel Farage said the group would be targeting areas with Labour MPs that voted Leave in the referendum. He added: ""Brexit is not about left or right. It is about right and wrong."" The European Parliamentary elections are expected to take place in the UK on 23 May - if the UK has not left the EU by that date. The UK is divided into 12 regions, each represented by between three and 10 MEPs depending on population size. Seats in England, Scotland and Wales are awarded to parties according to their share of the vote, to candidates on lists drawn up by the parties. Northern Ireland elects MEPs using asingle transferable vote system, with voters able to rank candidates in order of preference. The deadline for nominations for candidates is 16:00 BST on Wednesday 24 April for the South West Region (including Gibraltar) and 16:00 on Thursday 25 for all other candidates.

New aircraft rises 'like a balloon',"This video can not be played Future versions of Phoenix could be fitted with cameras and deployed in surveillance work Researchers from the University of the Highlands and Islands (UHI) have helped create a revolutionary new type of aircraft. Phoenix is an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) designed to stay in the air indefinitely using a new type of propulsion. Despite being 15m (50ft) long with a mass of 120kg (19 stone) she rises gracefully into the air. She looks a little like an airship, except airships don't have wings. ""It's a proper aeroplane,"" says the UHI's Professor Andrew Rae. As the project's chief engineer, he has overseen the integration of Phoenix's systems. ""It flies under its own propulsion although it has no engines,"" he says. ""The central fuselage is filled with helium, which makes it buoyant so it can ascend like a balloon. ""And inside that there's another bag with compressors on it that brings air from outside, compresses the air, which makes the aeroplane heavier and then it descends like a glider."" This ability to ""breathe"" - to switch quickly between being heavier or lighter than air - doesn't just make the plane go up and down. It is the key to driving it forward.  Phoenix is the first large-scale aircraft to be powered by variable-buoyancy propulsion. It moves through the air like a porpoise through water. That means it can travel long distances and stay aloft for long periods. The point? To create a cheaper alternative to launching satellites. Prof Andrew Rae says the Phoenix is a ""proper aeroplane"" The wings and tail carry solar panels so there is no need to carry fuel aloft. The quasi-airship shape is based on an aerofoil, meaning it also provides lift like its wings do when the plane moves forward. Prof Rae, using two wind tunnels at UHI's Perth College campus, led the design of its aerodynamics. The technique of variable-buoyancy propulsion is already used underwater. The Scottish Association for Marine Science (also part of UHI) has a small fleet of remotely operated vehicles - they call them gliders - that gather data in the North Atlantic. They dive deep to collect data, then rise to the surface to transmit it via satellite. But air is much less dense than water and this has made the principle a trickier proposition for flight. Phoenix is the first aircraft of its size to use it. The central fuselage of the Phoenix is filled with helium It is 15m (49ft) long with a wingspan of almost 11m (36ft) Production versions would need to be scaled up to reach the altitudes of 20km required to fulfil its intended role. An autonomous vehicle which is self-sufficient in energy could stay in the air for days, weeks, even months. The technical term is ""ultra-long endurance autonomous aircraft"". The team think it could revolutionise the telecommunications industry. The oft-quoted rule of thumb in the space business is that putting a satellite into orbit costs its weight in gold. A Phoenix ""pseudosatellite"" could do the same job from high in the atmosphere at a fraction of the cost. Prof Rae says some aircraft can already do this but are complex and expensive. Phoenix, by contrast, is so cheap as to be ""almost expendable"". In addition to UHI, the Phoenix project involves Bristol, Newcastle, Sheffield and Southampton universities. It also involved four commercial companies and three of the UK's Technology Catapults, and has been part funded by the UK government's innovation agency Innovate UK. The prototype Phoenix has been successfully tested inside the Drystack in Portsmouth, a huge indoor area which normally stores pleasure boats. It was used to shelter the aircraft from the winter winds although production versions would operate in all weathers. The project has involved its partners integrating the solar cells, flight control system, micropumps, carbon fibre wings and tail, reversible hydrogen fuel cell and rechargeable battery. The last of these is what enables a solar-powered vehicle to keep working all night. Now that the prototype has flown successfully, the consortium wants to collaborate with major manufacturers to take Phoenix to the next level.

Sturgeon to issue Brexit and indyref2 update,"Ms Sturgeon's statement will begin at 13:30 on Wednesday Nicola Sturgeon is to make a statement to Holyrood about the prospect of a second independence referendum. The half-hour statement on Wednesday afternoon will see the first minister ""set out a path forward for Scotland amid the ongoing Brexit confusion at Westminster"", her spokesman said. He also said Ms Sturgeon would ""seek to strike an inclusive tone"" in the ""detailed and substantive"" statement. It comes days before the SNP conference, which opens on Saturday. Ms Sturgeon updated her Cabinet on her thinking during a meeting on Tuesday morning. How Brexit is rebooting the case for independence Sturgeon: independence vote 'will happen' She is said to have been given the approval of her Cabinet colleagues, but no further details of what she will say in her statement have so far been released. Speaking to the media following the Cabinet meeting, Ms Sturgeon's spokesman said she will ""explore some of the issues that have arisen as a result of the ongoing Brexit situation and Scotland's constitutional future"". The spokesman added: ""It will be a detailed and substantive statement setting out a path forward for Scotland amid the ongoing Brexit confusion at Westminster. ""The first minister will take time to set out her thoughts on that front and in doing so she will seek to strike an inclusive tone."" He also said that Ms Sturgeon had opted to make the statement ""at the first available opportunity"" since the EU granted a six-month extension to the Article 50 process. Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden said: ""If Nicola Sturgeon wants to give a statement not about schools, the economy or hospitals but about a second independence referendum, then she is making her priorities absolutely clear."" He added: ""So let me be equally clear: we want to move on from the SNP's constitutional grandstanding, and get back to the things that matter to the people of Scotland."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was no evidence that people in Scotland want another independence referendum, and that: ""The answer to challenges of the UK leaving the EU is not and never will be Scotland leaving the UK. ""Leaving the UK would lead to unprecedented austerity for Scotland's public services. Each currency option the first minister has tried simply makes that worse. Downing Street said the prime minister was still of the view that ""now is not the time"" for another independence referendum Ms Sturgeon called for a second referendum on independence immediately after UK voted to leave the EU - but shelved the plans after the SNP lost 21 seats at the general election in 2017. She said in January of this year that she would give an update on her timetable for a referendum within ""weeks"", but has repeatedly said she needs to wait for more clarity about Brexit before doing so. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr last month, Ms Sturgeon predicated that it was ""as inevitable as it is possible to be"" that another independence referendum would be held. But she said she first needed to know whether the UK will be be leaving with or without a deal, or whether there might be another referendum on EU membership. She added: ""Before I set forward a path for Scotland I think it's reasonable for me to know what the starting point of that journey is going to be and the context in which we are going to be embarking on it."" Watch Nicola Sturgeon's statement at 13:30 on Holyrood Live Prime Minister Theresa May has previously insisted that ""now is not the time"" for a fresh vote on independence. And Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in March that the UK government would ""of course""refuse to give its backing to a new votevia a ""section 30 order"", the transfer of powers to Holyrood which underpinned the 2014 referendum. Asked what Mrs May's response would be to any call by Ms Sturgeon for a Section 30 order to pave the way for a second independence referendum, her official spokesman said: ""You know the prime minister's position on that and it has not changed. ""First and foremost, let's wait and see what the first minister says."" Ms Sturgeon is not thought to have notified Mrs May or Downing Street of her planned statement.

Change UK launches election campaignJournalist Rachel Johnson - sister of Boris - and ex-BBC correspondent Gavin Esler are among the candidates.UK Politics,"Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Chris Leslie left their parties to form Change UK Change UK has launched its campaign for the European Parliamentary elections, with 70 candidates including journalist Rachel Johnson - sister of Tory MP and leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson. The party - formerly known as The Independent Group - is made up of11 MPs who quit Labour and the Tories. They are preparing for the European election asthe latest Brexit delaymeans the UK may have to take part. Change UK are a pro-Remain party who back another referendum on Brexit. Ms Johnson, who was most recently a member of the Liberal Democrats, said: ""I'm sure that Boris understands why this is not a vote against Boris. ""This is a vote for change. We need to move the dial. People need to have a say."" Interim leader Heidi Allen told the event in Bristol: ""These elections are a chance to send the clearest possible message - we demand a People's Vote and the right to campaign to remain in the European Union. We are not afraid to say it as clearly as that. ""This is no rebel alliance. This is the home of the Remain alliance."" Cross-party Brexit talks to resume Labour 'must back second Brexit vote' The life of MEPs in Brexit limbo Former BBC correspondent Gavin Esler is also a candidate. He said UK politics was ""a worldwide joke"", and accused pro-Brexit campaigners, such as Nigel Farage, of ""stealing our patriotism"". ""We know Britain is better than the brain-dead politics of the past. We know Change UK is the only all-UK party to bring about changes. ""Ask yourself, what time is it? It is time for a change - it is time for Change UK."" BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley says Change UK want to be the number one choice for those unhappy with Brexit. But he said it would not be easy because plenty of other more established parties - namely the Lib Dems, the Greens, the SNP and Plaid Cymru - will be making a similar pitch. Following the launch,the Independent reported,externalthat a potential Change UK candidate, Ali Sadjady, had tweeted a derogatory comment about Romanians in November 2017. The tweet has now been deleted. The party later said that ""following discussions"", Mr Sadjady, had ""reflected on his inappropriate tweet from 2017 and agreed to stand down"". Mr Sadjadyposted an apology on Twitter,external, saying it was not representative of who he was. A number of parties have begun launching their campaigns for the European Parliamentary elections after Theresa May agreed a Brexit delay until 31 October with the EU. Mrs May said the UK could still exit before this date if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament. But, if not, the country is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May. The Independent Group was formed after eight Labour MPs and three Tory MPs left their parties in February. The three Conservative MPs blamed ""a shift to the right"" in their party and the government's ""disastrous handling of Brexit"", while Labour MP cited their party's stance on leaving the EU, along with the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism. In March, the group applied to become a party with the name Change UK and was given approval in April, meaning they could field candidates in the European elections. After about 3,700 applications, 70 candidates were picked. This video can not be played Gavin Esler: ""Our political system is a joke, it's a worldwide joke"" Change UK MP Anna Soubry said: ""No ifs no buts, no backroom deals... we were never on the fence, we always believed it and now we demand it... a People's Vote. ""If MPs can change their minds and change their votes, so can the British people. It is undemocratic, it is plain wrong, to deny people the rights of this country that are enjoyed in Parliament."" The sister of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is a writer and newspaper columnist. She has previously said she joined the Conservatives in 2008, inspired by a dinner party discussion with David Cameron, but left in 2011, complaining she was treated ""like the brainwashed member of a cult"". In April 2017, she joined the Liberal Democrats, saying that the country could ""be going over a cliff in a hard Brexit"". Ms Johnson was a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother in 2018. Glasgow-born Gavin Esler started a career in journalism at the The Belfast Telegraph before joining the BBC during the Northern Ireland Troubles. During a long career at the corporation, he was the BBC's chief North America correspondent, based in Washington, and a presenter of Newsnight. He left in 2017. He has written five novels and two non-fiction books, and is currently Chancellor of the University of Kent. He spoke in favour of a ""final say on the Brexit deal"" at a rally for the People's Vote campaign in Scotland in August last year. Last week, ex-UKIP leader Mr Faragelaunched his new Brexit Party,and on Tuesday, the party announced five new candidates for the European elections. They include left-wing activist Claire Fox, former Royal Marine James Glancy and charity CEO Matthew Patten. Nigel Farage said the group would be targeting areas with Labour MPs that voted Leave in the referendum. He added: ""Brexit is not about left or right. It is about right and wrong."" The European Parliamentary elections are expected to take place in the UK on 23 May - if the UK has not left the EU by that date. The UK is divided into 12 regions, each represented by between three and 10 MEPs depending on population size. Seats in England, Scotland and Wales are awarded to parties according to their share of the vote, to candidates on lists drawn up by the parties. Northern Ireland elects MEPs using asingle transferable vote system, with voters able to rank candidates in order of preference.

Donald Trump state visit set for JuneBuckingham Palace announces the US president will arrive in the UK for the start of a three-day visit.UK,"This video can not be played Remember President Trump's last UK visit in July 2018? US President Donald Trump will make a three-day state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June, Buckingham Palace has announced. The president and First Lady Melania Trump will be guests of the Queen and attend a ceremony in Portsmouth to mark 75 years since the D-Day landings. He will also have official talks with the prime minister at Downing Street. Mr Trump previously met the Queen at Windsor Castle when he came to the UK in July 2018 on a working visit. The White House said the upcoming trip would reaffirm the ""steadfast and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom"". The president was promised a state visit by Prime Minister Theresa May after he was elected in 2016 - but no date was set. Mrs May said June's state visit was an ""opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship in areas such as trade, investment, security and defence, and to discuss how we can build on these ties in the years ahead"". But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry voiced concerns about the visit, saying: ""It beggars belief that on the very same day Donald Trump is threatening to veto a United Nations resolution against the use of rape as a weapon of war, Theresa May is pressing ahead with her plans to honour him with a state visit to the UK."" Trump's UK 'working' visit in nine moments Trump meets the Queen at Windsor Castle Representatives of other countries invited to the Portsmouth event on 5 June include those from Canada, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Greece, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Portsmouth was one of the key embarkation points for many of the landing craft on D-Day, when, during World War Two, Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France marking the beginning of the end for Adolf Hitler's domination of Europe. The June gathering on Southsea Common will involve live performances, military displays and tributes to the Allied troops who fought in Normandy, including at least 11 Royal Navy vessels in the Solent and a flypast of 26 RAF aircraft. After leaving the UK, Mr Trump and his wife will travel to France for a series of D-Day anniversary events on 6 June itself. First Lady Melania Trump, her husband and Theresa May on the steps of Blenheim Palace on July 12, 2018 The president's last visit to the UK - when he had talks with Mrs May at Chequers before heading to Scotland, where he owns the Turnberry golf course - was marked by demonstrations. In London, thousands of people took to the streets tovoice their concerns. And in Scotland, people showed their displeasure,both in Edinburgh and at Turnberry. Bercow: Trump should not speak in Parliament Policing Trump's UK visit cost nearly Â£18m The National Police Chiefs' Council estimated that the police operation for the president's 2018 visit cost nearly Â£18m. It said 10,000 officers from across the country were needed to cover the occasion. The campaigners behind the 2018 protests - the Stop Trump Coalition and Stand Up To Trump - have vowed to mobilise ""huge numbers"" once again in response to the visit. Shaista Aziz from the Stop Trump Coalition criticised the US president's ""politics of hate and bigotry"", while Sabby Dhalu from Stand Up To Trump called for people to ""take to the streets and say clearly that Donald Trump is not welcome here"". But Sarah Elliott, chair of Republicans Abroad, denied that President Trump courted the support of racists, telling the BBC he won in many areas that had elected Barack Obama twice. ""He spoke to the people and what they wanted to hear,"" she said. A spokeswoman for Commons Speaker John Bercow said a request for Mr Trump to address Parliament - an event often associated with a state visit - would be ""considered in the usual way"", but did not say whether a request had yet been received. Mr Bercow - who, as Speaker, has the power to veto who addresses Parliament - previously said he would be ""strongly opposed"" to Mr Trump addressing the Houses of Parliament during a state visit.

BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said Mr Trump avoided London on his last visit and made it clear he did not particularly want to come to the capital if he was going to face protests. However, our correspondent said a key part of a state visit is the procession down the Mall in front of Buckingham Palace and it is thought protesters will gather there - not a first for a state visit. Once inside Buckingham Palace, it is expected the Queen will host a banquet for around 150 guests in Mr Trump's honour. The Queen has hosted two previous state visits from US presidents - George W Bush in November 2003, and Barack Obama in May 2011. A Trump ""baby blimp"" hovered above Parliament Square during the 2018 protest The Queen welcomed President Barack Obama to Buckingham Palace in 2011 A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. State visits are grand occasions, but they are not just ceremonial affairs. They have political purpose and are used by the government of the day to further what it sees as Britain's national interests. Once the location and dates are confirmed, the government, the visiting government and the royal household will agree on a detailed schedule. The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There is usually a state banquet, and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included. The Speaker of the House of Commons is one of three ""key holders"" to Westminster Hall, and as such, effectively holds a veto over who addresses Parliament. The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state a year. She has hosted 112 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952. The last state visit to the UK was in October, when King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands came for two days. The official website of the Queen and the Royal Family has a full list of all state visits since then, including details of how the ceremonies unfold. Remember Trump's last UK visit?

The alarm was raised just before 20:30 BST on Monday, with residents asked to leave in the early hours of Tuesday. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was still dealing with hotspots flaring up in the area and crews remain at the scene - but say there is no immediate danger to residents. Most residents have returned to their homes but locals are offering their spare rooms to any families still displaced by the fire. Crews tackle 12 national park fires How wildfires start on Welsh hillsides Will extreme weather of 2018 be repeated? Part of the A470 - the main route between north and south Wales - through the town was shut for several hours at Church Street but has now reopened. Allow Twitter content?

What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage?,"The ruthlessness of the suicide attacks has stunned Sri Lankans Sri Lanka is in a state of shock and confusion, trying to understand how a little-known Islamist group may have unleashed the wave of co-ordinated suicide bombings that resulted in the Easter Sunday carnage - the worst since the end of the civil war a decade ago. The South Asian island nation has experience of such attacks - suicide bombers were used by Tamil Tiger rebels during the civil war. But the ruthlessness of the new atrocities has stunned the nation anew. Eventually the government spokesman, Health Minister Rajitha Senaratne, came out and blamed National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ), a home-grown Islamist group, for the bombings. ""There was an international network without which these attacks could not have succeeded,"" he told reporters on Monday. That might go some way to explaining how a group that has been blamed for promoting hate speech may now have been able to scale up its capacity so monumentally. Who are the victims of the Sri Lanka attacks? 'My heart shattered when I saw the bodies' On Tuesday, however, the Islamic State (IS) group said its militants had carried out the attacks. It published a video of eight men the group claimed were behind the attacks. The IS claim should be treated cautiously. It is not clear whether these men were trained by the group or simply inspired by IS ideology. The manner in which NTJ was identified was circuitous. The prime minister said there had been warnings made to officials that hadn't been shared with the cabinet. He said only the president would get such briefings, even though it is not clear if he personally did in this instance. This is not an insignificant statement from a prime minister who was at loggerheads with the president for much of the past year. Many are drawing a conclusion about how political discord can have serious consequences - as well as undermining trust in the messages being put out. If the suicide bombers were local Sri Lankan Muslims, as stated by the government, then it is a colossal failure by the intelligence agencies. Information is also now emerging in the US media that the Sri Lankan government may also have had warnings from US and Indian intelligence about a possible threat. ""Our understanding is that [the warning] was correctly circulated among security and police,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, a senior adviser to President Maithripala Sirisena, said. The Sri Lankan president, who oversees security forces, has now set up a committee to find out what went wrong. Sri Lankan intelligence was credited with foiling several suicide attacks by the Tamil Tiger rebels at the height of the civil war and for penetrating a well-knit and ruthless Tamil Tiger organisation. While this is clearly a security and political failure, there are also questions about the nature of communal strife in Sri Lanka's more recent history. During the civil war, Muslims were also targeted by Tamil Tiger rebels and suffered at their hands. But Muslim community leaders say successive Sri Lankan governments have failed to restore confidence among young Muslims following more recent attacks by some members of the majority Sinhalese Buddhist community. One of the worst incidents was in the town of Digana in central Sri Lanka where one person died when a Sinhalese mob attacked Muslim shops and mosques in March last year. Sri Lanka declared a state of emergency after attacks on mosques and Muslim-owned businesses in 2018 ""After Digana quite a few Muslims lost faith in the government to provide them security. Some of them got the idea that they can defend themselves,"" says Hilmy Ahamed, vice-president of the Sri Lanka Muslim Council. The attacks and what the youths perceived as the lack of action by the government may have led some of them towards groups like NTJ. Some of the radicals were blamed for damaging Buddhist statues in recent years and their leader was arrested last year for offending religious sentiments. He later apologised for offending the sentiments of the Buddhist Sinhalese. Now it is widely believed a new group emerged a few years ago under the leadership of Zaharan Hashim, a radical Muslim preacher from eastern Sri Lanka. Sri Lanka attacks: What we know Who are National Thowheed Jamath? Mr Hashim posted several videos on social media purportedly promoting hatred against non-Muslims. Most of his videos are in the Tamil language. His teachings are said to have attracted several Muslim youths. ""This man was preaching hate with lots of YouTube videos on social media posts. Some of us reported him to the national intelligence services. Once about three years ago and once in January this year,"" says Mr Ahamed. He added that  security services did not take any action against Mr Hashim. Reports say the preacher was one of the suicide bombers though it's yet to be confirmed. Like Muslims, Christians are a minority in Sri Lanka Muslim community leaders say a few youths went to Syria to join IS, and some of them were killed in fighting there. It's important not to overstate this, though, and a former senior military officer Maj Gen (Retired) GA Chandrasiri says ""we have very cordial relationship with the Muslims. Most Muslims are not with these people. They are peace loving people"". There are no reports so far of a high number of jihadists returning to Sri Lanka. But even if a select few jihadists are angry with the majority, why were Christians targeted? In the complex cocktail of Sri Lanka's religious and ethnic tensions, Christians are almost unique for not perpetrating any kind of violence on behalf of their community. After all, it is a religion that crosses ethnic lines. I covered the Sri Lankan civil war for years and reported on many Tamil Tiger suicide attacks. It took years for the group to be able to learn to detonate such devices. So it is intriguing that a lesser-known Islamist group, with a few home-grown radicals, could carry out six - some say even seven - suicide attacks with such pinpoint precision and devastation. None of them failed. Even though connections with global jihadist groups are unclear, the choice of major luxury hotels and Christians as a target - in addition to the sophistication of the operation - makes it plausible that local radicalism has come under the influence of global jihadist networks.  It would be a tried and tested pattern in global attacks. 'Church of miracles' is a symbol of hope 'I thought we left violence behind us' During the Sri Lankan civil war foreign tourists were spared and attacks on outsiders were rare. In the latest bombings, many foreigners were killed and this has raised the spectre of links with al-Qaeda or IS. ""For this type of operation you need lots of assistance from outside. You need finances, training and technique for this kind of work. You can't do these things alone. May be there was some help from outside,"" Gen Chandrasiri said. The number of tourists visiting Sri Lanka has soared after the end of the civil war Violence is not new to Sri Lanka. It went through turbulent times during a left-wing insurrection in the 1970s followed by a nearly three-decade bloody war with the Tamil Tiger rebels. Tens of thousands of people were killed. But the ruthlessness and sophistication of the latest atrocities indicate that it will be challenge for the Sri Lankan security forces to deal with those behind the bombings. The last thing the Sri Lankan public wants is more violence and recrimination.

What is the National Thowheed Jamath?,"Officials inspect the damage caused by a bomb at St Sebastian's Church in Negombo A previously little-known group called the National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) is being accused of having carried out the Easter Sunday attacks in Sri Lanka. Sri Lankan officials pinned the blame on the NTJ at a news conference one day after the attacks. However, the NTJ has not admitted carrying out the wave of bombings which tore through the island, killing at least 250 people. On Tuesday, the Islamic State (IS) group said its militants had carried out the attacks. It did not provide any details. The IS claim should be treated cautiously. The group usually claims an attack very soon afterwards, publishing pictures of those who carried it out on its media portal, Amaq. But still, the allegation raises the question, what is the NTJ? Until Monday, when the Sri Lankan government spokesman mentioned its name, very few people had heard of the NTJ. The group is believed to have splintered off from another hardline Islamist group in the country, the Sri Lanka Thowheed Jamath (SLTJ). It was founded by Zahran Hashim, the suspected leader of the suicide bombers who blew himself up at a hotel in Colombo. However, Hashim is said to have been expelled from the NTJ after making hate speeches and may, in turn, have founded another splinter group. While still relatively unknown, the SLTJ is a bit more established.Its secretary, Abdul Razik, was arrested in 2016,externalfor inciting hatred against Buddhists. He later issued an apology. What we know so far Who are the victims? Children of the Easter Sunday attacks What led to carnage? Some reports have also linked the NTJ to a spate of vandalism last December that targeted Buddhist temples in Mawanella, central Sri Lanka. The faces of Buddha statues that were on display outside the temples were attacked. But the NTJ is an extremist fringe group within an already small religious minority - only 9.7% of Sri Lanka's population of about 21 million are Muslim. Its social media presence is sparse, too. Although it has a Facebook page, it is only updated every few weeks or so. The NTJ Twitter feed has not been updated since March 2018. The group's website is also offline - although it is not clear if it was taken down before or after the attacks. Government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told reporters that there had been ""several warnings from foreign intelligence agencies about the impending attacks"". This is not the only claim that officials had been alerted. Sri Lankan Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando tweeted a document that was reportedly sent by Sri Lanka's police chief earlier in April. That document explicitly names the NTJ as well as a warning that the group was planning to attack churches and the Indian High Commission. The document also names Mohamed Zahran, the group's leader.

Alan Keenan, Sri Lanka director for the International Crisis Group think tank, also told BBC 5Live that the NTJ ""appears to be the same group"" as those behind the Mawanella vandalism. He added: ""The police eventually arrested a group of young men who were said to have been the students of a preacher who's named in the intelligence document that came out yesterday [Sunday]."" Government spokesman Rajitha Senaratne named the NTJ as suspects (file photo) But given how small NTJ are, officials suspect that it was not acting alone. ""We don't see that only a small organisation in this country can do all that,"" Mr Senaratne said. ""We're now investigating the international support for them, and their other links, how they produced the suicide bombers here, and how they produced bombs like this."" And while not naming the NTJ directly, the Sri Lankan president's office echoed this belief that whichever group was behind the attacks had help from abroad. ""The intelligence sections have reported that there are international terror groups which are behind the local terrorists,"" a statement from President Maithripala Sirisena said. ""International assistance will be sought to combat them.""

Donald Trump 'set for state visit to UK',"This video can not be played Remember President Trump's last UK visit in July 2018? US President Donald Trump will make a three-day state visit to the UK from 3 to 5 June, Buckingham Palace has announced. The president and First Lady Melania Trump will be guests of the Queen and attend a ceremony in Portsmouth to mark 75 years since the D-Day landings. He will also have official talks with the prime minister at Downing Street. Mr Trump previously met the Queen at Windsor Castle when he came to the UK in July 2018 on a working visit. The White House said the upcoming trip would reaffirm the ""steadfast and special relationship between the United States and the United Kingdom"". The president was promised a state visit by Prime Minister Theresa May after he was elected in 2016 - but no date was set. Mrs May said June's state visit was an ""opportunity to strengthen our already close relationship in areas such as trade, investment, security and defence, and to discuss how we can build on these ties in the years ahead"". But shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry voiced concerns about the visit, saying: ""It beggars belief that on the very same day Donald Trump is threatening to veto a United Nations resolution against the use of rape as a weapon of war, Theresa May is pressing ahead with her plans to honour him with a state visit to the UK."" Trump's UK 'working' visit in nine moments Trump meets the Queen at Windsor Castle Representatives of other countries invited to the Portsmouth event on 5 June include those from Canada, France, Germany, Australia, New Zealand, Belgium, Luxembourg, Poland, Norway, Denmark, Netherlands, Greece, Slovakia and the Czech Republic. Portsmouth was one of the key embarkation points for many of the landing craft on D-Day, when, during World War Two, Allied forces invaded Nazi-occupied France marking the beginning of the end for Adolf Hitler's domination of Europe. The June gathering on Southsea Common will involve live performances, military displays and tributes to the Allied troops who fought in Normandy, including at least 11 Royal Navy vessels in the Solent and a flypast of 26 RAF aircraft. After leaving the UK, Mr Trump and his wife will travel to France for a series of D-Day anniversary events on 6 June itself. First Lady Melania Trump, her husband and Theresa May on the steps of Blenheim Palace on July 12, 2018 The president's last visit to the UK - when he had talks with Mrs May at Chequers before heading to Scotland, where he owns the Turnberry golf course - was marked by demonstrations. In London, thousands of people took to the streets tovoice their concerns. And in Scotland, people showed their displeasure,both in Edinburgh and at Turnberry. Bercow: Trump should not speak in Parliament Policing Trump's UK visit cost nearly Â£18m The National Police Chiefs' Council estimated that the police operation for the president's 2018 visit cost nearly Â£18m. It said 10,000 officers from across the country were needed to cover the occasion. The campaigners behind the 2018 protests - the Stop Trump Coalition and Stand Up To Trump - have vowed to mobilise ""huge numbers"" once again in response to the visit. Shaista Aziz from the Stop Trump Coalition criticised the US president's ""politics of hate and bigotry"", while Sabby Dhalu from Stand Up To Trump called for people to ""take to the streets and say clearly that Donald Trump is not welcome here"". But Sarah Elliott, chair of Republicans Abroad, denied that President Trump courted the support of racists, telling the BBC he won in many areas that had elected Barack Obama twice. ""He spoke to the people and what they wanted to hear,"" she said. A spokeswoman for Commons Speaker John Bercow said a request for Mr Trump to address Parliament - an event often associated with a state visit - would be ""considered in the usual way"", but did not say whether a request had yet been received. Mr Bercow - who, as Speaker, has the power to veto who addresses Parliament - previously said he would be ""strongly opposed"" to Mr Trump addressing the Houses of Parliament during a state visit.

BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond said Mr Trump avoided London on his last visit and made it clear he did not particularly want to come to the capital if he was going to face protests. However, our correspondent said a key part of a state visit is the procession down the Mall in front of Buckingham Palace and it is thought protesters will gather there - not a first for a state visit. Once inside Buckingham Palace, it is expected the Queen will host a banquet for around 150 guests in Mr Trump's honour. The Queen has hosted two previous state visits from US presidents - George W Bush in November 2003, and Barack Obama in May 2011. A Trump ""baby blimp"" hovered above Parliament Square during the 2018 protest The Queen welcomed President Barack Obama to Buckingham Palace in 2011 A state visit is a formal visit by a head of state and is normally at the invitation of the Queen, who acts on advice from the government. State visits are grand occasions, but they are not just ceremonial affairs. They have political purpose and are used by the government of the day to further what it sees as Britain's national interests. Once the location and dates are confirmed, the government, the visiting government and the royal household will agree on a detailed schedule. The Queen acts as the official host for the duration of the trip, and visitors usually stay at either Buckingham Palace or Windsor Castle. There is usually a state banquet, and a visit to - and speeches at - the Houses of Parliament may be included. The Speaker of the House of Commons is one of three ""key holders"" to Westminster Hall, and as such, effectively holds a veto over who addresses Parliament. The Queen usually receives one or two heads of state a year. She has hosted 112 state visits since becoming monarch in 1952. The last state visit to the UK was in October, when King Willem-Alexander and Queen Maxima of the Netherlands came for two days. The official website of the Queen and the Royal Family has a full list of all state visits since then, including details of how the ceremonies unfold. Remember Trump's last UK visit?

Change UK to launch election campaign,"Chuka Umunna, Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Chris Leslie left their parties to form Change UK Change UK has launched its campaign for the European Parliamentary elections, with 70 candidates including journalist Rachel Johnson - sister of Tory MP and leading Brexiteer Boris Johnson. The party - formerly known as The Independent Group - is made up of11 MPs who quit Labour and the Tories. They are preparing for the European election asthe latest Brexit delaymeans the UK may have to take part. Change UK are a pro-Remain party who back another referendum on Brexit. Ms Johnson, who was most recently a member of the Liberal Democrats, said: ""I'm sure that Boris understands why this is not a vote against Boris. ""This is a vote for change. We need to move the dial. People need to have a say."" Interim leader Heidi Allen told the event in Bristol: ""These elections are a chance to send the clearest possible message - we demand a People's Vote and the right to campaign to remain in the European Union. We are not afraid to say it as clearly as that. ""This is no rebel alliance. This is the home of the Remain alliance."" Cross-party Brexit talks to resume Labour 'must back second Brexit vote' The life of MEPs in Brexit limbo Former BBC correspondent Gavin Esler is also a candidate. He said UK politics was ""a worldwide joke"", and accused pro-Brexit campaigners, such as Nigel Farage, of ""stealing our patriotism"". ""We know Britain is better than the brain-dead politics of the past. We know Change UK is the only all-UK party to bring about changes. ""Ask yourself, what time is it? It is time for a change - it is time for Change UK."" BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley says Change UK want to be the number one choice for those unhappy with Brexit. But he said it would not be easy because plenty of other more established parties - namely the Lib Dems, the Greens, the SNP and Plaid Cymru - will be making a similar pitch. Following the launch,the Independent reported,externalthat a potential Change UK candidate, Ali Sadjady, had tweeted a derogatory comment about Romanians in November 2017. The tweet has now been deleted. The party later said that ""following discussions"", Mr Sadjady, had ""reflected on his inappropriate tweet from 2017 and agreed to stand down"". Mr Sadjadyposted an apology on Twitter,external, saying it was not representative of who he was. A number of parties have begun launching their campaigns for the European Parliamentary elections after Theresa May agreed a Brexit delay until 31 October with the EU. Mrs May said the UK could still exit before this date if her withdrawal agreement is approved by Parliament. But, if not, the country is likely to have to hold European Parliament elections on 23 May. The Independent Group was formed after eight Labour MPs and three Tory MPs left their parties in February. The three Conservative MPs blamed ""a shift to the right"" in their party and the government's ""disastrous handling of Brexit"", while Labour MP cited their party's stance on leaving the EU, along with the leadership's handling of anti-Semitism. In March, the group applied to become a party with the name Change UK and was given approval in April, meaning they could field candidates in the European elections. After about 3,700 applications, 70 candidates were picked. This video can not be played Gavin Esler: ""Our political system is a joke, it's a worldwide joke"" Change UK MP Anna Soubry said: ""No ifs no buts, no backroom deals... we were never on the fence, we always believed it and now we demand it... a People's Vote. ""If MPs can change their minds and change their votes, so can the British people. It is undemocratic, it is plain wrong, to deny people the rights of this country that are enjoyed in Parliament."" The sister of former Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson is a writer and newspaper columnist. She has previously said she joined the Conservatives in 2008, inspired by a dinner party discussion with David Cameron, but left in 2011, complaining she was treated ""like the brainwashed member of a cult"". In April 2017, she joined the Liberal Democrats, saying that the country could ""be going over a cliff in a hard Brexit"". Ms Johnson was a contestant on Celebrity Big Brother in 2018. Glasgow-born Gavin Esler started a career in journalism at the The Belfast Telegraph before joining the BBC during the Northern Ireland Troubles. During a long career at the corporation, he was the BBC's chief North America correspondent, based in Washington, and a presenter of Newsnight. He left in 2017. He has written five novels and two non-fiction books, and is currently Chancellor of the University of Kent. He spoke in favour of a ""final say on the Brexit deal"" at a rally for the People's Vote campaign in Scotland in August last year. Last week, ex-UKIP leader Mr Faragelaunched his new Brexit Party,and on Tuesday, the party announced five new candidates for the European elections. They include left-wing activist Claire Fox, former Royal Marine James Glancy and charity CEO Matthew Patten. Nigel Farage said the group would be targeting areas with Labour MPs that voted Leave in the referendum. He added: ""Brexit is not about left or right. It is about right and wrong."" The European Parliamentary elections are expected to take place in the UK on 23 May - if the UK has not left the EU by that date. The UK is divided into 12 regions, each represented by between three and 10 MEPs depending on population size. Seats in England, Scotland and Wales are awarded to parties according to their share of the vote, to candidates on lists drawn up by the parties. Northern Ireland elects MEPs using asingle transferable vote system, with voters able to rank candidates in order of preference.

Are 'slashies' the future of work?,"Sam Gray working in security - one of her many jobs More than 320,500 self-employed people in Britain are working two or more jobs, new analysis suggests. A study by the Association of Independent Professionals and the Self-Employed (IPSE) -seen by 5 Live's Wake Up To Money- shows that 7% have launched an additional business. Some call it a portfolio career or a multi-hyphenate career. One term that seems to be sticking is ""slashie"", as in: ""I am a chef/blogger/dog walker."" Sam Gray is a so-called ""slashie"", although she dislikes that term and would rather be known as a ""Jack of all trades"". She's a former teacher living in Torquay, and currently works five different jobs. In addition to her own dog-grooming business, Toodles, Sam works as a private tutor, teaches crochet and sells patterns, works security for nightclubs and bars and works two 12-hour night shifts at a local arcade. While she initially took on multiple roles by necessity, she says she now enjoys this way of working. ""As a full-time teacher your job never ends. There is this constant feeling that you could and should be doing more. But with lots of different jobs I have to switch off, I have to stop thinking about what I was doing, because I am getting paid to do something else. Sam Gray runs a dog-grooming business, alongside other roles ""It is a positive choice. If I just worked in a dog grooming salon all day I think I'd probably go a little bit mad, dogs aren't great for conversation. And I love teaching, so tutoring really fills that gap for me."" Working more than one job because money is tight is not new, but many ""slashies"" appear to be doing so for more personal, creative reasons. It's also a bit different to a side-hustle, which is where someone turns their hobby outside their main job into a money-making venture. Many are successful enough to be able to leave their full-time employment to become a ""slashie"". Research carried out by Henley Business School found that one in four workers are running at least one business alongside their main careers. ChloÃ© Jepps, deputy head of research at IPSE, says that for most people it is a choice, not a necessity. ""It's to pursue a passion, try something new and get some extra income while doing something they love,"" she explains. But it's also a way to trial a new business: ""You can test a new idea without leaping straight into it and try things without taking the full risk."" Emma Gannon believes this way of working simply suits many people better, by giving them outlets for different interests. She's a journalist, podcaster and author of The Multi-Hyphen Method, which provides advice on how to manage multiple careers. She says: ""In America, it was always cool to have another role on the side, but in the UK there's a stigma around being a 'Jack of all trades'. Author Emma Gannon helps 'slashies' navigate their working lives ""From school and university, we're told to pick one thing and become an expert, but the job-for-life isn't possible anymore, even if you want that. ""Humans are multifaceted by nature, we have many interests and now we're feeling braver about embracing that."" Emma is confident that rather than ""working in a way that suits the Victorian era, working at a machine for fixed hours"", many more will choose to have a concurrent careers. But she says these ""slashie"" pioneers are at risk of burnout. ""The flip side of enjoying your job can be that you end up working 24 hours a day. There's an increasing trend of merging your job and your life, and if you've got a few different gigs then even more so. ""There isn't enough support for people working this way. The admin side of things can be quite intense, more so if you're running more than one business."" For ""slashie"" Sam Gray, a change is simply as good as a rest. ""I feel refreshed by how I work now,"" she says. ""I don't do anything long enough to get bored with it, everything just feels new.""

Police chief: 60% of crime not pursued,"More than 40% of the crimes reported to Greater Manchester Police are 'screened out' More than 40% of crimes reported to Greater Manchester Police are not fully investigated because of a lack of resources, it has said. Chief constable Ian Hopkins said budget cuts have meant officers had to prioritise more ruthlessly than ever. He said about 430 offences a day, such as thefts from vehicles, were being ""screened out"" and not pursued because ""we don't have enough officers"". The Home Office said it was ""committed"" to ensuring forces have enough funding. The number of frontline police officers across England and Wales has fallen over the past decade,while violent crime is rising. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said it had lost about 2,000 officers during that time, down to about 6,200. ""If your life is in danger, you've been seriously hurt, we will still turn up,"" Mr Hopkins told BBC Radio Manchester. ""If there's an immediate threat we will be there and we will be there in numbers. ""If your shed's been broken into, your bike's stolen, your vehicle's broken into and there's no witnesses, there's no CCTV and there's no opportunity for forensics, we'll be screening that out really quickly. ""Your likelihood of a police officer turning up to deal with that is almost non-existent and that's where the public have really started to feel it. That bit worries me."" One of Mr Hopkins' senior officers, Supt Rick Jackson, said screening out crimes was ""a necessary evil"". Chief Constable Ian Hopkins met Theresa May following the 2017 Manchester Arena attack GMP is not the only force to screen reported crimes on the basis of threat and the likely evidence available. But Mr Hopkins publicly acknowledging the fact that the majority of crimes reported to his force are dropped is thought to be the first time a chief constable has put a figure on this practice. One man told the BBC he had moved from Manchester to Rossendale in Lancashire after ""finally being driven out of the house by crime"". He said: ""I was burgled eight times in five years in Cheetham Hill and had vehicles stolen. ""The police would come round and take notes, but they weren't doing anything. ""You could tell by the attitude, there were no forensics done, there was nobody taking in-depth notes and no follow-up."" He said he was left ""frustrated and annoyed"", adding: ""The police are a waste of time."" Police in Greater Manchester did not find a suspect in more than nine out of 10 bicycle thefts, thefts from people or vehicle crimes and in more than eight out of 10 burglaries. Theft from the person includes bag snatchers and pickpockets but not muggings and robberies. Data for the year March 2018 to February 2019 also shows that investigations into a quarter of violent and sexual offences were completed with no suspect identified. The other outcomes, totalling more than four in every 10 recorded crimes, included everything from suspects sent to court to investigations that were not pursued because it was not in the public interest. The data did not include antisocial behaviour. In 2018, the chief constable of West Midlands Police said budget cuts and falling police numbers meant his forcesometimes provided ""a poor service"". ""We think the public want us to use our time productively and focus our resources where there is greatest harm and where we can secure a positive outcome,"" a National Police Chiefs Council spokesman said. Police chiefs have expressed concern about the impact of falling officer numbers on ""proactive policing that prevents crime, solves problems and helps people feel safe,"" he said. The fall in police numbers is largely the result of changes in centralgovernment funding, which is down by almost a thirdin real terms since 2010. Mr Hopkins said it accounted for about 80% of his budget. ""We've been promised a funding formula review and that hasn't materialised but that needs to happen,"" he said. Increases in council tax, such as that announced in February, which will pay for an extra 320 GMP police officers, ""are never going to give Greater Manchester the resources it needs"", he added. The new additions will take the force's strength to about 6,570, compared with 8,219 in 2010. ""The stark reality is that due to years of central government cuts the police simply cannot investigate every crime and have to take difficult decisions about where best to focus their time and resources,"" said Greater Manchester Deputy Mayor Bev Hughes, who has responsibility for policing in the city region. ""They - and I - wish this were not necessary but unfortunately it is."" Reality Check: Is crime up or down? Police funding: Government pledges extra Â£300m Council Tax increase: why am I paying the police so much? Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell said: ""It's clear that the government's cuts to police funding is having a real impact on the front line, making it extremely difficult for officers to do their jobs effectively and respond to certain types of crime. ""This should be a wake-up call for ministers who should act to increase resources to tackle crime and disorder."" A Home Office spokeswoman said police funding this financial year would rise by the greatest amount since 2010. ""We recognise the impact crime has on victims and want offenders brought to justice. ""We are committed to ensuring police forces have the resources they need to carry out their vital work,"" she said. UPDATE 21:00 BST Tuesday 23 April:In the original version of this story, published at 00:02 BST, we said ""about 60% of crimes"" reported to Greater Manchester Police were not being fully investigated because of a lack of resources. This came from a BBC interview with Chief Constable Ian Hopkins. At 18:24 BST Greater Manchester Police said it had ""reviewed the figures"" and found that ""over the past 12 months, 43.4% of crimes are screened out after an initial investigation, not 60% as previously mentioned.""

Mountain fire prompts evacuation of homes,"This video can not be played The huge fire in Blaenau Ffestiniog was described as ""looking like a volcano"" Families in about 20 homes had to be evacuated after a large fire engulfed a mountain in Snowdonia. About 30 firefighters were tackling the blaze at Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd, at its overnight peak. Eyewitness Chris McPhail said: ""As I was driving up I could just see the glow and a load of smoke. It just looked like a volcano."" The alarm was raised just before 20:30 BST on Monday, with residents asked to leave in the early hours of Tuesday. North Wales Fire and Rescue Service said it was still dealing with hotspots flaring up in the area and crews remain at the scene - but say there is no immediate danger to residents. Most residents have returned to their homes but locals are offering their spare rooms to any families still displaced by the fire. Crews tackle 12 national park fires How wildfires start on Welsh hillsides Will extreme weather of 2018 be repeated? Part of the A470 - the main route between north and south Wales - through the town was shut for several hours at Church Street but has now reopened. Allow Twitter content?

The cause of the fire is not yet known Geraint Hughes, who is managing the fire operation on the ground, said his teams had faced substantial challenges tackling the blaze. ""The rugged terrain and the steepness of it makes it difficult to put staff and personnel on the mountain to tackle it with beaters or hose-reels,"" he said. He said fire crews were ""currently managing"" the situation, however some areas were continuing to flare-up. The quarrying terrain has posed challenges to firefighters, says Geraint Hughes from North Wales Fire and Rescue Garreg Ddu - Black Rock - was 'like a volcano' say eyewitnesses Many of the evacuated residents spent the night in a cafe, including Jackie Brunger. She toldBBC Radio Wales' Good Morning Walesshe was unaware of the blaze until fire crews arrived.

Crews from Bangor used their aerial platform to douse flames Still burning - crews have spent Tuesday damping down hotspots above the town ""We were told to get away as soon as we could, so we took our car and went to the cafe. ""There was ash and bits of flame coming down. How far it has spread, so quickly - it was frightening."" Residents say the town was under a cloud of acrid smoke Resident Jackie Brunger said one firefighter climbed the hillside directly behind her home Sue Roberts opened up De Niros cafe for those told to leave their homes, and helped keep fire crews and police teams fed during the night.

"Cross-party Brexit talks to resumeThe government will meet Labour for further discussions, as a Tory MP calls on the PM to stand down.UK Politics","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""Government changes needed in cross-party talks"" The government says ""progress needs to be made urgently"" on Brexit talks with Labour - but that arranging time with the opposition has been ""difficult"". Senior figures from both sides have been trying to break the deadlock by agreeing a Brexit deal MPs can support. No 10 said talks had ""been difficult in some areas"", including ""timetabling"". But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the government ""really needs to move on"" and change its Brexit agreement to solve the impasse. He said: ""We cannot go on hearing this tired old mantra that the Brexit agreement has to be adhered to."" The deal Theresa May negotiated with the EU has been rejected twice by Parliament, with the withdrawal agreement - the terms on how the UK leaves the bloc, rather than its future relationship with it - defeated a further time. PM to face grassroots no-confidence vote Are Tory members 'taking back control'? Brexit: A really simple guide Weeks of talks resumed between the two parties in Westminster on Tuesday afternoon following the Easter break. Mrs May's de facto deputy David Lidington was expected to lead for the government. Shadow Brexit secretary Keir Starmer, shadow chancellor John McDonnell, shadow business secretary Rebecca Long-Bailey and shadow environment secretary Sue Hayman took part on behalf of Labour. Ahead of the meeting, Sir Keir said ""fundamental issues"" remained between his party and ministers on a number of key issues. Some Tory MPs are angry the discussions with Labour are even taking place. Leading backbencher Nigel Evans called on Mrs May to step down as prime minister ""as soon as possible"", adding that the PM ""had been reaching out to the Labour Party and Jeremy Corbyn, when she should have been reaching out to the people"". Talks between Labour and the government seem to be faltering on two fronts - timing and substance. Both sides say there has been serious engagement. But the prime minister wants the talks concluded urgently to give her a chance of cancelling the UK's participation in the European parliamentary elections. That means getting a deal through Parliament by 22 May. If it looks like an agreement can't be reached with the opposition quickly, Theresa May wants them jointly to sign up to a series of parliamentary votes that both sides would regard as binding, to try to break the impasse. But Labour doesn't appear willing to be rushed. And the main opposition party says Mrs May still needs to erase her red line on a customs union if she is to make progress. Sources say the issue was discussed at the cabinet today - but, while no votes were taken, there didn't seem to be a majority in favour of doing so. As things stand, the Brexit deadlock continues - and the European election campaigns are getting under way. Senior members of the influential 1922 committee of Tory MPs are meeting in Parliament. Under current party rules, MPs cannot call another no-confidence vote in the prime minister until December - but the committee is expected to discuss whether steps should be taken to try to change that. The group's joint executive secretary Mr Evans told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the calls for the prime minister to quit had become ""a clamour"". ""The only way we're going to break this impasse properly is if we have fresh leadership of the Conservative Party,"" he said. But prisons minister Rory Stewart said Mrs May was doing a ""good job"" and deserved ""praise not blame"". ""It's nothing to do with the individual, it's that people disagree deeply about Brexit,"" he added. Who could replace Theresa May? A leadership hustings in all but name The comments came after it emerged that Mrs May faces a no-confidence challenge from Tory campaigners. More than 70 local association chiefs have called for an extraordinary general meeting to discuss her leadership and a non-binding vote is to be held at the National Conservative Convention EGM in May. If the grass-roots Tory vote showed a lack of confidence - it could put greater pressure on the 1922 Committee to find some way of forcibly removing the PM from office. That pressure could increase further if the Tories poll badly in local and European elections on 2 and 23 May respectively. The UKhas been given an extension to the Brexit process until 31 October. Change UK has launched its European election campaignin Bristol, while Nigel Farage's Brexit Party has unveiled more of its candidates in London.

The four-man team from Edinburgh beat Oxford University's St Edmund Hall by 155 points to 140. The University of Edinburgh team is the first from Scotland to win since 1984 and the first non-Oxbridge finalist in six years. Team captain Max Fitz-James hailed his team after winning the coveted prize. Speaking to BBC Scotland's The Nine, he said: ""The main secret is to be good as a team and that came in the selection process; they really made an effort to find people who had a complementary basis of knowledge so it wasn't just down to one person, we did it as a team. ""The best training was watching past episodes and doing it together as a team, so we would get together every Monday and watch past episodes, pause and try and answer the questions before the team.

"Police horse dies at football matchThe horse, named Morecambe, was at the Blackpool v Fleetwood match when it fell onto a metal pole.Lancashire","The police horse, called Morecambe, died outside Blackpool FC's Bloomfield Road stadium A police horse has died and its rider injured in a ""tragic accident"" responding to ""disorder"" at a football match. The horse, named Morecambe, was at the League One game between Blackpool and Fleetwood when it fell on to a metal pole, Lancashire Constabulary said. The 11-year-old animal suffered a serious stomach injury and died at the scene on Seasiders Way on Monday. Its rider was taken to hospital after falling into the side of a horsebox. A force spokesman said the horse was ""fatally injured,externalin a tragic accident whilst responding to reports of disorder at Blackpool"", and there were no suspicious circumstances surrounding its death, which happened at about 17:20 BST. Fans celebrate Blackpool's winner It said Morecambe, which had served for the force for more than four years, slipped on to metal barriers at a pedestrian crossing. Dean Furness said on Facebook he witnessed the ""horrible"" accident. He said: ""The horse lost its footing or a shoe and slipped straight into the pole causing the massive injury to the left hand side of its body. ""The officer riding it did a brilliant job of getting it back to its horse transport box where sadly the horse went down against the side of the horse box, crushing the officer."" The officer was not thought to be seriously hurt. Ch Insp Sue Bushell, of Lancashire Constabulary's mounted branch, said: ""We are all completely devastated by the loss of Morecambe in such tragic circumstances.

"Listen to climate scientists, Greta urges","MPs applauded climate change activist Greta Thunberg Teenage activist Greta Thunberg has described the UK's response to climate change as ""beyond absurd"". In a speech to MPs, the Swedish 16-year-old criticised the UK for supporting new exploitation of fossil fuels and exaggerating cuts to carbon emissions. She was invited to Westminster after inspiring the school climate strikes movement. Environment Secretary Michael Gove said ""we have not done nearly enough"". In her speech in Parliament on Tuesday, Miss Thunberg said the UK was supporting shale gas fracking, greater exploitation of North Sea oil and gas fields and expanding airports. ""This ongoing irresponsible behaviour will no doubt be remembered in history as one of the greatest failures of humankind,"" she said. She also described the UK's carbon emissions reduction as the result of ""very creative"" accounting. The country's reported 37% reduction in emissions since 1990 was only 10% when aviation, shipping, imports and exports were counted, she said. How might ministers win over protesters? Greta Thunberg: 'Climate fight will never stop' Climate protesters stage museum 'die-in' Who is Greta Thunberg? Miss Thunberg said her generation's future had been ""stolen"" so that ""a small number of people could make unimaginable amounts of money"". She told MPs: ""You don't listen to the science because you are only interested in the answers that will allow you to carry on as if nothing has happened."" Mr Gove said that although governments have not done enough to tackle climate change, ""in the past few years it has become inescapable that we have to act"". He said: ""The time to act is now, the challenge could not be clearer - Greta, you have been heard."" An empty seat was left for Theresa May as Miss Thunberg met politicians Earlier, an empty chair was left for Prime Minister Theresa May as Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, Liberal Democrat leader Vince Cable and Green Party leader Caroline Lucas met the environmental campaigner for a round-table discussion. The Westminster leaders of the Scottish National Party and Plaid Cymru, Ian Blackford and Liz Saville Roberts, were also at the meeting. Mrs May was chairing a cabinet meeting and Downing Street said it had received no official request to attend. Ms Lucas told Miss Thunberg there was a growing ""sense of urgency"" and that ""more than ever, politicians have our ears open to your message"". During Miss Thunberg's visit to the UK she has also spoken at the Extinction Rebellion climate protests and given media interviews. The teenager sparked an international youth movement after she staged a ""School Strike for Climate"" in front of the Swedish Parliament in August last year. Since then she has met the Pope and addressed the European Parliament. Speaking about her newfound fame, she said: ""It's unbelievable, I can't really take it in.""

She has said thather generation will not be able to fly except in emergencies,external""if we are the least bit serious"" about preventing global warming greater than 1.5C. Earlier, Miss Thunberg told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her message for politicians was: ""Listen to the science, listen to the scientists. Invite them to talk."" She said it was important for politicians to act because ""most emissions aren't caused by individuals, they're caused by corporations and states"". Her arrival in the UK comes as Extinction Rebellion activiststook over part of the Natural History Museumon Monday andmarched on Parliamenton Tuesday morning. More than 1,000 people have been arrested since their protests began in central London a week ago. Speaking in the House of Commons, energy minister Claire Perry said she had ""mixed emotions"" about the protests, which had raised important issues but risked leaving people ""fearful for the future rather than hopeful"". Miss Thunberg, who spoke to the crowds in Marble Arch on Sunday, told the BBC that disruptive action ""definitely has a lot of impact"". Asked whether it was necessary, she said: ""As long as it's non-violent, I think that could definitely make a difference."" Miss Thunberg said she first heard about climate change aged about eight years old. ""I was just very moved,"" she said. ""When I was 11 I became very depressed,"" she added. ""It had a lot to do with the climate and ecological crisis. I thought everything was just so wrong and nothing was happening and there's no point in anything."" After realising she could make a difference, she said she promised herself that ""I was going to do something good with my life"".

In the wide-ranging BBC interview, Miss Thunberg said that having Asperger's had helped her in life: ""It makes me different, and being different is a gift, I would say. It also makes me see things from outside the box. ""I don't easily fall for lies, I can see through things. If I would've been like everyone else, I wouldn't have started this school strike, for instance."" Asked what she would say if she met US President Donald Trump, she said: ""I can't really say anything to him that he hasn't heard before. ""Obviously he's not listening to the science and to what we have to say, so I wouldn't be able to change his mind.""

Sturgeon to issue Brexit and indyref2 updateThe first minister plans to update the Scottish Parliament on Wednesday about Brexit and Scottish independence.Scotland politics,"Ms Sturgeon's statement will begin at 13:30 on Wednesday Nicola Sturgeon is to make a statement to Holyrood about the prospect of a second independence referendum. The half-hour statement on Wednesday afternoon will see the first minister ""set out a path forward for Scotland amid the ongoing Brexit confusion at Westminster"", her spokesman said. He also said Ms Sturgeon would ""seek to strike an inclusive tone"" in the ""detailed and substantive"" statement. It comes days before the SNP conference, which opens on Saturday. Ms Sturgeon updated her Cabinet on her thinking during a meeting on Tuesday morning. How Brexit is rebooting the case for independence Sturgeon: independence vote 'will happen' She is said to have been given the approval of her Cabinet colleagues, but no further details of what she will say in her statement have so far been released. Speaking to the media following the Cabinet meeting, Ms Sturgeon's spokesman said she will ""explore some of the issues that have arisen as a result of the ongoing Brexit situation and Scotland's constitutional future"". The spokesman added: ""It will be a detailed and substantive statement setting out a path forward for Scotland amid the ongoing Brexit confusion at Westminster. ""The first minister will take time to set out her thoughts on that front and in doing so she will seek to strike an inclusive tone."" He also said that Ms Sturgeon had opted to make the statement ""at the first available opportunity"" since the EU granted a six-month extension to the Article 50 process. Scottish Conservative MSP Maurice Golden said: ""If Nicola Sturgeon wants to give a statement not about schools, the economy or hospitals but about a second independence referendum, then she is making her priorities absolutely clear."" He added: ""So let me be equally clear: we want to move on from the SNP's constitutional grandstanding, and get back to the things that matter to the people of Scotland."" Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said there was no evidence that people in Scotland want another independence referendum, and that: ""The answer to challenges of the UK leaving the EU is not and never will be Scotland leaving the UK. ""Leaving the UK would lead to unprecedented austerity for Scotland's public services. Each currency option the first minister has tried simply makes that worse. Downing Street said the prime minister was still of the view that ""now is not the time"" for another independence referendum Ms Sturgeon called for a second referendum on independence immediately after UK voted to leave the EU - but shelved the plans after the SNP lost 21 seats at the general election in 2017. She said in January of this year that she would give an update on her timetable for a referendum within ""weeks"", but has repeatedly said she needs to wait for more clarity about Brexit before doing so. Speaking to the BBC's Andrew Marr last month, Ms Sturgeon predicated that it was ""as inevitable as it is possible to be"" that another independence referendum would be held. But she said she first needed to know whether the UK will be be leaving with or without a deal, or whether there might be another referendum on EU membership. She added: ""Before I set forward a path for Scotland I think it's reasonable for me to know what the starting point of that journey is going to be and the context in which we are going to be embarking on it."" Watch Nicola Sturgeon's statement at 13:30 on Holyrood Live Prime Minister Theresa May has previously insisted that ""now is not the time"" for a fresh vote on independence. And Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said in March that the UK government would ""of course""refuse to give its backing to a new votevia a ""section 30 order"", the transfer of powers to Holyrood which underpinned the 2014 referendum. Asked what Mrs May's response would be to any call by Ms Sturgeon for a Section 30 order to pave the way for a second independence referendum, her official spokesman said: ""You know the prime minister's position on that and it has not changed. ""First and foremost, let's wait and see what the first minister says."" Ms Sturgeon is not thought to have notified Mrs May or Downing Street of her planned statement.

Murder arrest after mum dies in hit-and-run,"Two girls, aged 13 and four, were among the injured in the crash on Bickershaw Lane A pick-up truck driver has been charged with manslaughter following the death of a mother in a three-vehicle crash. The 34-year-old woman died in Saturday's crash in Bickershaw Lane, Wigan, and two others, including a four-year-old girl, were injured. James Pownall, 26, is also accused of causing death by dangerous driving, kidnap and perverting the course of justice. Steven Fairclough, 22, has been charged with perverting the course of justice. Both men will appear at Manchester and Salford Magistrates' Court. Greater Manchester Police said the driver and passengers of the Volkswagen Amarok pick-up escaped by forcing another motorist to drive them away. The woman, who was driving a Volkswagen Polo, died in hospital. Her passengers, a 29-year-old man and two girls, aged four and 13, were also taken to hospital. The pick-up truck was later found in Bolton House Road. The allegation of manslaughter is understood to be by transferred malice because of the Amarok driver's suspected intentions towards those travelling in a Mercedes also involved in the crash. The occupants of the Mercedes, a 21-year-old man and two 20-year-old men, were initially arrested on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Two of the men have been eliminated from the investigation but arrested for causing criminal damage and released on bail. One of the 20-year-old men remains in custody on suspicion of causing death by dangerous driving. Sgt Lee Westhead appealed for witnesses to the crash to contact police. He added: ""We continue to support the victims of this dreadful incident at this time and my thoughts remain with them.""

Outcry over 'deeply racist' Austrian poem,"Austrian Chancellor Sebastian Kurz called the poem ""deeply racist"" A poem about migration titled The City Rat has drawn condemnation in Austria after it compared humans to rodents. The poem tells migrants to integrate or ""quickly hurry away"". It was written by Christian Schilcher, a deputy mayor from the far-right Freedom Party (FPÃ), which is part of Austria's ruling conservative coalition. Chancellor Sebastian Kurz has demanded that the Freedom Party distance itself from the ""abominable"" poem. The poem was published in an FPÃ newspaper in Braunau am Inn, birthplace of Nazi Germany's leader Adolf Hitler. Mr Kurz told the Austrian Press Agency the poem was ""disgusting, inhuman and deeply racist"" and had no place in Austria. The young Austrian leader sharing power with the far right Is there an Austrian link to New Zealand mosque attacks? ""Just as we live down here, so must other rats,"" the poem states, telling them to ""share with us the way of life, or quickly hurry away"" and saying that if you mix different cultures, ""it's as if you destroy them"". Mr Schilcher - the vice-mayor of Braunau am Inn - said he did not mean to ""insult or hurt anyone"" with his poem. He apologised for ignoring the ""historically burdened"" comparison between rats and humans, saying the poem aimed to describe changes ""which myself and others quite rightly criticise"" from a rat's perspective. Pamela Rendi-Wagner, head of the centre-left Social Democratic Party (SPÃ), said such comparisons were ""customary in Nazi propaganda"". But Vice-Chancellor and FPÃ head Heinz-Christian Strache wrote in a Facebook post that the ""current incitement and campaign"" against his party shows their competitors are ""especially nervous"" ahead of European Parliament elections in May. The FPÃ has been in coalition with Mr Kurz's conservative People's Party (ÃVP) since 2017 and is among just a few far-right parties to have won power in the EU.

Parkinson's implant 'transforms lives',"This video can not be played Gail Jardine: ""I can walk, I can turn... it's really helped me"" A treatment that has restored the movement of patients with chronic Parkinson's disease has been developed by Canadian researchers. Previously housebound patients are now able to walk more freely as a result of electrical stimulation to their spines. A quarter of patients have difficulty walking as the disease wears on, often freezing on the spot and falling. Parkinson's UK hailed its potential impact on an aspect of the disease where there is currently no treatment. Prof Mandar Jog, of Western University and associate scientific director, Lawson Health Research Institute in London, Ontario, told BBC News the scale of benefit to patients of his new treatment was ""beyond his wildest dreams"". Scientists monitor their patients' improvement using sensors on a specially made suit. ""Most of our patients have had the disease for 15 years and have not walked with any confidence for several years,"" he said. ""For them to go from being home-bound, with the risk of falling, to being able to go on trips to the mall and have vacations is remarkable for me to see."" Normal walking involves the brain sending instructions to the legs to move. It then receives signals back when the movement has been completed before sending instructions for the next step. The parts of the brain involved with movement (red on the left-hand scan) are not working properly, but three months into the trial those areas are now functioning Prof Jog believes Parkinson's disease reduces the signals coming back to the brain - breaking the loop and causing the patient to freeze. The implant his team has developed boosts that signal, enabling the patient to walk normally. However, Prof Jog was surprised that the treatment was long-lasting and worked even when the implant was turned off. He believes the electrical stimulus reawakens the feedback mechanism from legs to brain that is damaged by the disease. ""This is a completely different rehabilitation therapy,"" he said. ""We had thought that the movement problems occurred in Parkinson's patients because signals from the brain to the legs were not getting through. ""But it seems that it's the signals getting back to the brain that are degraded."" Brain scans showed that before patients received the electrical treatment, the areas that control movement were not working properly. But a few months into the treatment those areas were restored. Gail Jardine, 66, is among the patients who has benefited from the treatment. Before she received the implant two months ago, Gail kept freezing on the spot, and she would fall over two or three times a day. She lost her confidence and stopped walking in the countryside in Kitchener, Ontario - something she loved doing with her husband, Stan. Now she can walk with Stan in the park for the first time in more than two years. ""I can walk a lot better,"" she said. ""I haven't fallen since I started the treatment. It's given me more confidence and I'm looking forward to taking more walks with Stan and maybe even go on my own"". Guy Alden used to rely on a wheelchair but after his treatment he had his first holiday in seven years with his wife, Barb Another beneficiary is Guy Alden, 70, a deacon at a catholic church in London, Ontario. He was forced to retire in 2012 because of his Parkinson's disease. His greatest regret was that it curtailed his work in the community, such as his prison visits. ""I was freezing a lot when I was in a crowd or crossing a threshold in a mall. Everyone would be looking at me. It was very embarrassing,"" he told me. ""Now I can walk in crowds. My wife and I even went on holiday to Maui and I didn't need to use my wheelchair at any point. There were a lot of narrow roads and a lot of (slopes) and I did all of that pretty well."" Dr Beckie Port, research manager at Parkinson's UK, said: ""The results seen in this small-scale pilot study are very promising and the therapy certainly warrants further investigation.

Cyber-attacks on UK firms 'jump' in 2019,"The proportion of UK firms reporting a cyber-attack has jumped, despite most businesses admitting they are under-prepared for breaches, according to research from Hiscox. The insurer found 55% had faced an attack in 2019, up from 40% last year. But almost three quarters of firms were ranked as ""novices"" in terms of cyber readiness. Hiscox said a lot of businesses ""incorrectly felt that they weren't at risk"". The firm surveyed more than 5,400 small, medium and large businesses across seven countries, including the UK, Germany, the US, Belgium, France, the Netherlands and Spain. Hack attacks 'damage' key infrastructure 'Cyber-attack' on turkey firm's workers It said there had been a ""sharp increase"" in the number of cyber-attacks this year, with more than 60% of firms having reported one or more attacks - up from 45% in 2018. Average losses from breaches also soared from $229,000 (Â£176,000) to $369,000, an increase of 61%. Despite this, the insurer said the percentage of firms scoring top marks on cyber security had fallen, with UK organisations doing particularly badly. British firms had the lowest cyber security budgets, it said, spending less than $900,000 on average compared with $1.46m across the group. They were also joint-least likely with US firms to have a ""defined role for cyber security"" on their staff. In France the proportion was closer to one in ten. Gareth Wharton, head of Cyber at Hiscox, said the low UK spending could be driven by the large number of small businesses in Britain. ""They may feel like they won't be targeted, as we tend to only read about large breaches in the press. If they incorrectly feel that they won't be targeted, they may be less likely to spend on cyber security."" However, Hiscox also found the average cost of an attack in the UK was lower than average at $243,000, compared with $906,000 in Germany and $486,000 in Belgium. New regulation has also prompted action, with eight in ten UK firms saying they had made changes since the introduction of tough new EU data protection rules last year.

Sri Lanka faces scrutiny over bomb warnings,"Prime Minister Ranil Wickremasinghe (C) arrives at one of the bomb sites Scrutiny fell on rifts in Sri Lanka's leadership on Monday after it emerged that authorities were warned about the group accused in Sunday's bombings. Attacks on churches and hotels killed 310 people and wounded nearly 500. Security agencies had been watching the National Thowheed Jamath jihadist group, reports said, and had notified police about a possible attack. But the prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, and the cabinet were not informed, ministers said. On Tuesday, the country is observing a day to ""mourn the senseless loss of innocent lives,""Mr Wickremesinghe said in a statement posted to Twitter.,external ""It is imperative that we remain unified as Sri Lankans in the face of this unspeakable tragedy,"" he added. What we know so far Dispatch: St Anthony's - 'church of miracles' Who are the victims? The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath The prime minister was not privy to security briefings following a rift last year with President Maithripala Sirisena, cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne told a press conference. Mr Sirisena sacked Mr Wickremesinghe and his cabinet in October and tried to install another prime minister, prompting a full-blown constitutional crisis. He was forced to reinstate Mr Wickremesinghe under pressure from the nation's supreme court, but apparently kept the prime minister from security briefings. Mr Senaratne said intelligence agencies had begun issuing warnings about the group on 4 April, after which the defence ministry sent a detailed warning to the chief of police; and on 11 April a memo was sent to the heads of several security divisions. He said information passed to police included a warning from a foreign intelligence agency about possible attacks by the group, as well as names of members. US media quote Sri Lankan officials as saying both Indian and US intelligence had warned the country about a threat in early April. Residents gather outside St Anthony's Shrine in Colombo, a day after it was bombed It was not clear on Monday whether Mr Sirisena had been made aware of the warnings. ""Our understanding is that it was correctly circulated among security and police,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, a senior adviser to Mr Sirisena, told the BBC. He said that the president had appointed a special committee led by a supreme court judge to investigate what had happened. Rauff Hakeem, the minister for town planning, called the attacks a ""colossal failure of intelligence"". ""It is shameful for all of us. We are all ashamed of this,"" he said. Telecommunications Minister Harin Fernando tweeted: ""Some intelligence officers were aware of this incidence. Therefore there was a delay in action. Serious action needs to be taken as to why this warning was ignored."" Sri Lankan authorities declared a state of emergency which came into effect at midnight (18:30 GMT) on Monday. The declaration gives police and the military sweeping powers to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders - powers that were last used during the nation's civil war. A curfew also came into effect at 20:00, leaving armed security forces patrolling largely deserted streets in Colombo on Monday night. The government blocked access to Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram after the attacks. Police arrested 24 suspects in a series of raids just hours after the blasts, and later said 87 bomb detonators had been found at the Bastian Mawatha private bus station in Petta. This video can not be played A bomb exploded on Monday as police in Colombo tried to defuse it On Monday, another blast rocked a street in the capital, Colombo, when a bomb went off while police attempted to defuse it, although no-one was hurt. The first reports of explosions came at about 08:45 local time on Sunday with six blasts reported within a small space of time. Three churches in Negombo, Batticaloa and Colombo's Kochchikade district were targeted during Easter services. Blasts also rocked the Shangri-La, Kingsbury and Cinnamon Grand hotels in the country's capital. Police did not release a breakdown of how many people were killed and wounded at each location. All the attacks were carried out by suicide bombers, officials said. Police then carried out raids on two addresses and there were explosions at both. One was in Dehiwala, southern Colombo, and the other was near the Colombo district of Dematagoda, where three officers were killed when a suicide bomber detonated a device. In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' UK dad's tribute to family An improvised explosive device - a 6ft-long [1.8m] plastic pipe packed with explosives - was also found and defused near the airport in Colombo. National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ) has been named by a government spokesman as the main suspect. This video can not be played Archbishop of Colombo: ''A very, very sad day for all of us"" The group has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. However, neither NTJ, nor any other group, has admitted carrying out Sunday's bombings. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. The ministry of foreign affairs said it had identified 31 foreign nationals among the dead, with 14 unaccounted for. The death toll included at least eight British citizens and at least eight citizens of India. They include three of the children of Danish billionaire Anders Holch Povlsen, a family spokesman confirmed to the BBC. Mr Povlsen owns the Bestseller clothing chain and holds a majority stake in clothing giant Asos. This video can not be played Sri Lanka attacks: ""My heart shattered when I saw the bodies"" British lawyer Anita Nicholson died alongside her two children, Alex, 14, and Annabel, 11, when a suicide bomber detonated a device in the breakfast queue at the Shangri-La hotel in Colombo. Her husband, Ben Nicholson, survived and praised his ""wonderful, perfect wife"" and ""amazing, intelligent"" children. China on Tuesday issued an advisory to its citizens not to travel to Sri Lanka in the near future while the US State Department had already on Sunday warned of possible further attacks in a travel advisory.

Mass funeral on Sri Lanka's day of mourning,"This video can not be played The footage shows a man wearing a large backpack calmly walking towards St Sebastian's church Sri Lanka has held its first mass funeral amid a day of mourning for the victims of Sunday's bomb blasts. The death toll from the attacks on churches and hotels has risen to 321 with about 500 wounded, police said. A state of emergency is in effect to prevent further attacks. The Islamic State (IS) group claimed the attack on Tuesday via its news outlet. Sri Lanka's government has blamed the blasts on local Islamist group National Thowheed Jamath (NTJ). The country's prime minister, Ranil Wickremesinghe, said the government believed there ""may be links"" to IS. ""This could not have been done just locally,"" he said. ""There had been training given and a coordination which we are not seeing earlier."" A BBC correspondent in Sri Lanka says the IS statement should be treated cautiously. As with previous attacks that the group says it carried out, it has provided no evidence for the claim. What led to Sri Lanka's Easter carnage? What we know so far Who are the victims? Police have now detained 40 suspects in connection with the attack. A spokesman said they included a Syrian who was arrested ""after the interrogation of local suspects"". The mass funeral for about 30 victims took place at St Sebastian's church in Negombo, north of Colombo, which was one of the places targeted in Sunday's blasts. Another funeral service was scheduled for later on Tuesday. Earlier, a moment of silence was observed at 08:30, reflecting the time the first of six bombs detonated. Flags were lowered to half-mast and people, many of them in tears, bowed their heads in respect. The death toll has risen to 321 with around 500 injured The state of emergency gives police and the military sweeping powers to detain and interrogate suspects without court orders - powers that were last used during the nation's civil war. The government limited access to Facebook, WhatsApp and Instagram after the blasts. Why cut off social media in Sri Lanka? NTJ, the group named by the government as the main suspect, has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. At the scene: Ayeshea Perera, BBC News, Negombo Negombo is usually bustling but today is very different. Most of its shops and businesses are shut, there is a heavily-armed military presence and the entire city is bedecked in white flags - a sign of mourning. Everywhere, there is a sense of complete shock. People are discussing what happened in hushed tones. Many take pictures of the banners or try to put up bouquets of flowers between the iron grills on the perimeter of the church. Dispatch: St Anthony's, 'church of miracles' About 150 people are estimated to have been killed during St Sebastian's Easter Mass. There are so many funerals to conduct that they are being carried out in batches. Security is tight - people are not allowed to drive within a 1km radius of the church. St Sebastian's itself is strung with banners. Some have pictures of those who died, others have messages of condolence and condemnation. Huge crowds of people are walking in to pay their respects, many having travelled from outside the city. But there was tension too. An interfaith event organised by the local mosque to condemn the attacks was cut short after a mob surrounded it armed with poles and knives. They were dispersed by police. IS claimed the attack on Tuesday via its Amaq news outlet, saying it had ""targeted nationals of the crusader alliance [anti-IS US-led coalition] and Christians in Sri Lanka"". It provided no evidence for the claim. Defence minister Ruwan Wijewardene told parliament on Tuesday that NTJ was linked to another radical Islamist group he named as JMI, but he gave no details. The alleged bombers: National Thowheed Jamath He also said ""preliminary investigations"" indicated thatthe bombings were in retaliation for deadly attacks on mosques in Christchurch, New Zealand, in March, but again gave no further information. NTJ has no history of large-scale attacks but came to prominence last year when it was blamed for damaging Buddhist statues. The group has not said it carried out Sunday's bombings. Meanwhile, police in Colombo have been placed on high alert and told to search for a lorry and a van suspected to be carrying explosives, the BBC Sinhala's Azzam Ameen reports. Mr Wickremesinghe said that only Sri Lankan nationals had been arrested in connection with the attack so far, but that some of the attackers may have travelled abroad before the bombings. Sunday's attacks have highlighted rifts in Sri Lanka's leadership, after it emerged that authorities were warned about an imminent threat. Security agencies had been watching the NTJ jihadist group, reports said, and had notified police about a possible attack. But Prime Minister Ranil Wickremesinghe and the cabinet were not informed, ministers said. Authorities have declared a state of emergency Cabinet spokesman Rajitha Senaratne said the information was not passed to Mr Wickremesinghe due to a rift between the prime minister and President Maithripala Sirisena. However, it was not clear on Monday whether Mr Sirisena had been made aware of the warnings. ""Our understanding is that it was correctly circulated among security and police,"" Shiral Lakthilaka, a senior adviser to Mr Sirisena, told the BBC.

According to BBC Sinhala's Azzam Ameen, the blast happened while ""security forces personnel... tried to defuse a newly discovered explosives in a vehicle"". Police have not yet released details of how many people were killed and wounded at each location. All the attacks were carried out by suicide bombers, officials said. Most of those who died were Sri Lankan nationals, including scores of Christians attending Easter Sunday church services. In pictures: Sri Lanka's day of deadly attacks 'I thought we had left all this violence behind us' UK dad's tribute to family One of the first victims to be publicly identified was Sri Lankan celebrity chef Shantha Mayadunne and her daughter Nisanga Mayadunne, who had posted a picture of the family having breakfast in the Shangri-La Hotel in Colombo shortly before the deadly blast.

Edinburgh wins University ChallengeThe University of Edinburgh is the first Scottish winner of the TV quiz show in more than 30 years.,"The University of Edinburgh won the final by a 15 point margin The University of Edinburgh has been crowned this year's champion of the long running BBC quiz show University Challenge. The four-man team from Edinburgh beat Oxford University's St Edmund Hall by 155 points to 140. The University of Edinburgh team is the first from Scotland to win since 1984 and the first non-Oxbridge finalist in six years. Team captain Max Fitz-James hailed his team after winning the coveted prize. Speaking to BBC Scotland's The Nine, he said: ""The main secret is to be good as a team and that came in the selection process; they really made an effort to find people who had a complementary basis of knowledge so it wasn't just down to one person, we did it as a team. ""The best training was watching past episodes and doing it together as a team, so we would get together every Monday and watch past episodes, pause and try and answer the questions before the team. ""This is the third year in a row that Edinburgh reached the semi-finals so we were very pleased we got one further than that, and even more pleased when we finally lifted the trophy.""

Climate protesters stage museum 'die-in'Extinction Rebellion protesters lay down underneath the blue whale skeleton in the Natural History Museum.,"This video can not be played Protesters lie down underneath the giant whale skeleton in the museum's main hall Extinction Rebellion activists took over part of the Natural History Museum as the climate change protest entered its second week. About 100 people lay down under the blue whale skeleton at about 14:15 BST. It comes as more than 1,000 people have been arrested since the protests began in central London a week ago. The climate change group are now based in Marble Arch, after police moved protesters from Oxford Street, Waterloo Bridge and Parliament Square. Extinction Rebellion said it hoped the protest at the museum, which it called a ""die-in"", would raise awareness of what they call the ""sixth mass extinction"". Most of the protesters finished their lie-down protest after about half an hour. But some people wearing red face paint, veils and robes remained to give a performance to classical music on the steps underneath the whale skeleton. The ""die-in"" protest lasted about an hour and concluded with a performance by The Invisible Circus On Sunday, teenage activist Greta Thunberg told the rally in Marble Arch that they were ""making a difference"". Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the protest was taking ""a real toll"" on London's police and businesses. ""I'm extremely concerned about the impact the protests are having on our ability to tackle issues like violent crime if they continue any longer,"" he said. About 9,000 police officers have been responding to the protest since it began a week ago on 15 April. This video can not be played Teen activist Greta Thunberg addresses Extinction Rebellion rally A total of 1,065 people have been arrested and 53 have been charged for various offences including breach of Section 14 Notice of the Public Order Act 1986, obstructing a highway and obstructing police. Olympic gold medallist Etienne Stott was one of the activists arrestedas police moved to clear Waterloo Bridge on Sunday evening. The London 2012 canoe slalom champion was carried from the bridge by four officers as he shouted about the ""ecological crisis"". Extinction Rebellion: Can the plan work? Climate protesters 'making a difference' Who is Greta Thunberg? An Extinction Rebellion spokesperson said there would be no escalation of activity on Easter Monday, but warned that the disruption could get ""much worse"" if politicians are not open to their negotiation requests. On Sunday, one organiser told the BBC the group were planning ""a week of activities"" including a bid to prevent MPs entering Parliament. The group said a ""people's assembly"" was due to be held later to decide what will happen in the coming week. Thousands of protesters have spent Monday at the Marble Arch site The protest group has been forced to focus its activities on its Marble Arch site On Sunday, Ms Thunberg was greeted with chants of ""we love you"" as she took to the stage in front of thousands of people at the rally. The 16-year-old, who is credited with inspiring an international movement to fight climate change, told the crowd ""humanity is standing at a crossroads"" and that protesters ""will never stop fighting for this planet"". Met Commissioner Cressida Dick has said that during her 36-year career she had never known a single police operation to result in so many arrests. This video can not be played The co-founder of the protest group invites people to join Since the group was set up last year, members have shut bridges, poured buckets of fake blood outside Downing Street, blockaded the BBC and stripped semi-naked in Parliament. It has three core demands: for the government to ""tell the truth about climate change""; to reduce carbon emissions to zero by 2025; and to create a citizens' assembly to oversee progress. Controversially, the group is trying to get as many people arrested as possible. But critics say they cause unnecessary disruption and waste police time when forces are already overstretched.

"New IRA 'admits to Lyra McKee killing'The group offered ""full and sincere apologies"" to the journalist's family and friends, Irish News reports.UK","Lyra McKee was observing rioting in Londonderry's Creggan estate when she was shot The New IRA has admitted carrying out the murder of journalist Lyra McKee,according to the Irish News.,external In a statement given to the paper the group offered ""full and sincere apologies"" to her family and friends. Ms McKee, 29, was shot in the head on Thursday night while observing rioting in Londonderry's Creggan estate. A 57-year-old woman arrested on Tuesday in connection with Ms McKee's death has been released unconditionally. Journalist shot dead during Derry rioting 'Massive' public response to McKee murder Timeline of Irish dissident activity Police say there has been a ""massive response"" to her killing and have urged more members of the public to come forward. The statement from the New IRA comes after the hard-left republican political party Saoradh - which has the support of the New IRA - had previously sought to justify the use of violence on Thursday. In the House of Common on Tuesday, Northern Ireland Secretary Karen Bradley said there was nothing that could justify this ""murderous act"". A message of condolence was added to the mural at Free Derry corner in the city ""To those responsible for this act of terrorism, we say: 'We have heard your excuses and your hollow apologies. No-one buys it. This was no accident',"" she added. Mrs Bradley also said she would hold discussions with the leaders of Northern Ireland's political parties later this week. She will be among political leaders who will attend Ms McKee's funeral on Wednesday at St Anne's Cathedral in Belfast. Irish President Michael D Higgins and Taoiseach (Irish PM) Leo Varadkar will also attend. They will be joined by Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney, who is already in Northern Ireland meeting some of the Stormont parties after calls on Monday for urgent talks to be convened to restore power-sharing.
