Looking for the man who disappeared," They are short, brutal tributes. Darius, who “livened the area” around rue Lafitte, and was dead at the age of 43. Or Pierre, “found by a local resident, near the bins in rue Jacques Kellner”. Or Michel, who died on 21 January in rue Matignon, “in a parking lot where he lived for 20 years”. These curt memorials, posted on the website of a small charity, are pulled together from the sparse details and thin slivers of memory passed on by local shopkeepers, social workers, park attendants - anyone who might remember something about the men and women who lived and died on the streets of France. Sometimes the details are so few that the dead are honoured without even names or ages. Their time and place of death are carefully posted along with a photo or video of their neighbourhood spot - an attempt to remember a life, when even its most basic information is forgotten. These investigations are carried out by the Collectif les Morts de la Rue.  Their work catches the eye in the noisy, fume-ridden streets of Paris - a bright, plastic-covered notice tied to a tree or a wall, sometimes giving a name, but ending always with the same request: “If you knew this person, or have information which would allow us to pay homage, please contact us.” That might have been Tango’s story.  Few in Paris’s tranquil 14th arrondissement would have known much about him - to many, he was just a man in his 50s, who slept in a park, with a friendly disposition and an alcohol problem. The park in Paris's 14th arrondissement where Tango slept But two years after his death, Tango is still remembered in the place he once inhabited - even by those who arrived there long after he’d gone, and even though his body is buried 2,000 miles from France. Clement Etienne runs a cafe in a quiet street not far from Tango’s park.   The doors open promptly at 08:00 most mornings and there’s often a queue for the coffee machine.  Unlike most cafes, the windows of this one are carefully painted over to provide privacy - you can eat, drink and even sleep there for free, and the whole operation is housed in a retired double-decker bus.  It’s part of a project by the organisation Enfants du Canal to combat the exclusion of homeless people in Paris. Clement Etienne runs a cafe for homeless people in a double-decker bus Tango had been living on the streets for 20 years when he first met Clement, and was already a local fixture - known throughout the area only by his nickname.  He almost never told people his real name, says Clement. “He was too ashamed - worried that reports about his situation would get back to his family.” For this article, too, we have concealed his real identity, and even his real nickname, at the request of those who worked with him. “He was more victim than thug,” remembers Clement. “He drank a lot but he was adorable - always joking, he wouldn’t hurt a fly.  He wasn’t a cultivated man, but he had a real sense of kindness.” Slowly, over the years, as the two men got to know each other, Tango’s story began to emerge. “He had a dream, that he would return to Morocco,” Clement says. “It was more of a fantasy, really - and I think he knew that deep inside.” Tango had arrived in France illegally, 30 years before - a young man from France’s former North African colony following one of the many migrant trails towards Paris. Back in the 1980s, as an illegal immigrant, Tango had no right to social housing in France, and rough sleeping  was against the law. But back then, Clement says, it was easy for even those who arrived illegally to get official papers.  Tango secured French residency, found work in a factory, and began sending money home to Morocco. He might have hoped that his story would end, decades later, with a comfortable old age and a peaceful death, supported by the structures of French society, and surrounded by close family and friends. Instead, the end came on a bench in a city park. A friend, sleeping nearby, woke one winter morning to find the middle-aged dreamer from Morocco coughing up blood.  He called Clement for help.  Tango died shortly after reaching hospital, from pulmonary embolism. The park benches where Tango slept - and where he died The Collectif les Morts de La Rue counted 501 deaths among rough sleepers across France in 2016 - the year that Tango died.  Other activists believe the real number is several thousand. The organisation holds a memorial for them each year in a central Paris square. The details of each known individual are marked on simple white cards and arranged alongside potted flowers, on AstroTurf laid out in the shapes of graves. Each one of their sparsely told stories sheds light on one of Europe’s most intractable problems. This is Tango’s. For the first decade of his life in France, Tango wasn’t homeless.  By day, he worked in the factory alongside dozens of other men just like him - by night he shared overcrowded living quarters with them. It’s a pattern familiar to many Moroccan men of his generation.  The lack of a wife or children would have allowed him to send most of his earnings back home.  But it also left him isolated. “He would have been surrounded by people,” says Clement. “It’s a community, but it’s a community made up entirely of men, all the same age, from the same place, with the same illusions.  They’re all together, but they’re isolated from the rest of society, so they’re precarious.” In that situation, it takes little for the structures fall apart.  In Tango’s case, says Clement, it was probably a combination of alcoholism and losing his job.  One may well have prompted the other. Ten years after he arrived in France, Tango entered a new kind of social isolation - living on its streets. It’s often difficult to pinpoint a single trigger for homelessness.  The French talk about a “rupture” - of health, of relationships, of work or rental contracts - that leads someone down the path to living on the streets. One of the homeless people who currently uses the ShelterBus puts the date of his own “rupture” as 6 May 1991 - the day his mother died without sorting out the right documents for their living quarters. But for many others the slide towards homelessness is slower, more blurred - a gradual fall through social safety nets that fail, or are simply not there. Bruno, homeless Bruno is another of the regulars at Clement’s ShelterBus, and at first glance could pass for someone living in regular accommodation.  He stands tall and broad, and looks very clean, with an undamaged pair of glasses.  He has been on the streets for the past four months, after losing first his job, and then his benefit payments. “There’s a big problem with the way people look at you,” Bruno says. “They can see you are a bit lost.  Because when you spend all day without doing anything, you go round and round in circles in your head - you get lost and people can see it in your eyes.” For Gilou, another long-time customer at the bus, this month marks 28 years of living rough in Paris.  He sits down to chat with his half-empty bottle of rose wine, which he has given the surreal nickname “Titine Rosenbach”. “I worked in the building trade,” he says.  “I was a painter, an iron-worker and a chef in a kitchen.  I’ve done all kinds of things.  It all stopped when I had a breakdown and ended up in the psychiatric hospital, then in prison.  I’ve been in prison 14 times.” He shows me his tattoos, which include a series of hyphens around his wrist to indicate a thief, and a symbol meaning “death to the police”. The most difficult part of being on the streets is finding lunch, he says. “Dinner is fine, because if I’ve done a good day’s begging, I always have some food.” He pulls out three pieces of cheese he’s been given from a nearby fromagerie. “I beg three times a week in the marketplace here.  All the shopkeepers know me, and they like me. The neighbourhood is really nice.  But sometimes people are cold, and sometimes residents accuse me of peeing, though it’s not true.” In 2012, a short film opened in French cinemas, based on the story of a young lawyer, Joel Catherin, whose journey home took him past an elderly homeless woman, begging on a street near the church of La Madeleine in Paris. The homeless woman who inspired Joel Catherin's sign-writing campaign “I was working a lot at the time,” Catherin says. “I was quite isolated and wasn’t seeing much of my friends and family. There wasn’t much humanity in my life, and it was then that I fell for this old homeless lady who was begging next to my house. “She made me think of my own grandmother,” he explains. “I suddenly saw her as a human being.” “My greatest love story is you” Catherin began giving her food, and as the weather got colder and colder, he had the idea to replace her generic cardboard sign, with its simple request for “one euro please”, with something that presented her as an individual, a human being. When he left his house the next morning, he gave her a new sign, on which he’d written: “I could be your grandmother.” “Life’s not just about money. 1 euro please” “A few days later,” he says, “I saw her waving at me.  She was very happy. Obviously the new sign had worked well because she had been given a lot of coins.” Catherin made individual signs for other homeless people, and his quirky slogans began to be copied by others too. “Human Warmth” requests one - another tries to raise a smile with the message “I’m Locked Out”. A third, written for a woman begging outside a bottle bank, reads simply: “Recyclable?” “The real purpose was to wake people up,” he says. “I wanted to get people talking to the homeless - to create human warmth more than money for them. Because human warmth is where help starts.” Source: INSEE Atittudes towards homeless people in France are complex.  There are plenty of people who view them as a nuisance - an unsightly disturbance bringing down property prices, relying on hand-outs, and posing a vague, unformed threat. The French believe homelessness is a structural issue... British people believe more that it comes from individual responsibility and addiction” But Prof Julien Damon, from the prestigious university, Sciences-Po, believes Paris is more tolerant and welcoming than London, for example. “The French believe homelessness is a structural issue - it’s about unemployment, the housing market - that the individuals are not responsible for their situation.  British people believe more that it comes from individual responsibility and addiction.” When British peoplewere asked about their views of homeless peopleby the polling agency YouGov four years ago, the biggest group (35%) said they believed that homeless people had “probably made bad choices in life that got them into their situation”. In contrast, a 2009 survey in France by the polling agency CSA and one of the country’s main homelessness organisations found that the majority of those polled - almost two-thirds - thought that the state was primarily responsible for people ending up living in the streets, and that three-quarters felt solidarity with homeless people. The French state has changed its approach to rough sleepers since Tango arrived here in the 1980s.  In 1994, rough sleeping was decriminalised, and in 2007 a new law ruled that everyone sleeping on the streets had the right to be housed - even those who were in the country without permission. France has the most extensive and comprehensive right to housing in the whole of the European Union, according to the EU’s federation of homelessness organisations, FEANTSA. But many illegal immigrants avoid accessing homeless services, for fear of alerting the authorities to their status.  And since last month, that risk is being extended to emergency shelters under a new policy introduced by Emmanuel Macron’s liberal government. The change requires shelters to provide details of all those sleeping under their roof - allowing government officers to find and deport those who don’t have the right to be in France. The policy is sparking stiff resistance from homelessness organisations in France, but most of them are wholly funded by the state, and there’s a big question over whether they will win the argument. Across the Channel, the British government has also targeted some foreigners found sleeping rough.  In 2016, it began a policy of deporting EU nationals found sleeping out on Britain’s streets, saying that rough sleeping was an abuse of EU freedom of movement rights. It was a policy Chloe Serme-Morin, from FEANTSA, said “criminalised migrants sleeping rough”.  And in December 2017, theHigh Court agreedthat it was discriminatory and unlawful, after two Polish men and a Latvian challenged the government in court.  The UK has now ended the deportations. On both sides of the Channel there is a complex patchwork of measures that draw criticism from homeless charities, but also those that are welcomed as big steps forward. In Paris, the metro company, RATP, has developed a working alliance with the homeless organisation, Emmaus, running a dedicated rough sleeping shelter and team of staff to monitor rough sleepers in and around its stations. But despite legal protections, solidarity from individuals, and care by transport officials, rough sleepers in Paris could be forgiven for feeling increasingly unwelcome. Clement keeps an odd collection of photographs on his mobile phone.  In between pictures of his daughter, there are severe images of deserted street sculptures, rocks,  spikes and bicycle racks along the secluded walls of apartment blocks, the exposed wrought-iron supports of park benches, stuck like isolated sculptures into the ground without the seat once perched on top of them. He gathers the pictures on his daily walks around the area, as evidence of a deliberate erosion of places where homeless people can comfortably rest. “I slept in front of a building last night where they’d installed big decorative balls,” confirms Gilou.  “It wasn’t nice.  It hurt the hips.” It’s a pattern repeated throughout the city.  The Fondation Abbe Pierre, one of France’s oldest homeless organisations, describes it as a campaign to drive rough sleepers from town centres into areas where they are less visible.  Among the examples they’ve gathered is an automatic cold shower, installed in the doorway of a private car-park. “Cities with lots of tourism, like Paris, install them to put a nice face on the city for economic reasons,” says Chloe Serme-Morin from FEANTSA. “Cities are more and more in competition with each other to attract more wealthy inhabitants, more wealthy tourists."" There have been regular stories of similar measures in the UK involvinganti-homeless spikes, or other street furniture andmodificationsthat might stop people bedding down. Despite some similarities though, customers at the ShelterBus acknowledge a difference in the experience of homelessness across the Channel. “The Anglo-Saxons have a different way of dealing with homelessness,” says Bruno.  “In England, you have to fight to succeed - that’s a good thing.  In France, we are a country of civil servants; you have to fit the model.  If you don’t fit, you don’t exist. For me, that’s the problem, I’ve been erased.” During his election campaign, France's President Emmanuel Macron said he wanted to eradicate rough sleeping by the end of 2017.  Itwasn’t a promisehe was able to keep. Written around the ShelterBus are the names of other politicians who made exactly the same promise in years gone by - former president Nicolas Sarkozy, former prime minister Lionel Jospin.  “We’ll add Mr Macron when we repaint,” says Clement. But eradicating street homelessness is not as fantastical as it might seem, according to Eric Constantin of the Fondation Abbe Pierre.  “With the right policies, the problem in the Paris region could be solved in five to 10 years,” he says. “Build homes, stop evictions, control rents and put in place a system that cares for people as they are.” The French government has put money into expanding emergency shelters - there were 13,000 new shelter places opened this winter.  But there are usually strict rules about entering them: no dogs, no couples, no alcohol.  Some also refuse to take those with mental health issues. Gilou has a trove of stories about being kicked out of shelters for trying to bring in a bottle of wine.  Drink on the premises, and you can be barred. Get into a fight or cause any kind of disturbance, the same applies.  Stay away too long - and you can be similarly denied a place at that shelter again. And that strict approach kept Tango out, says Clement.  “He would have left the streets. It was possible.  We just had to find a place that would take an alcoholic.” It’s one reason why the government’s spokesman, Christophe Castaner, is right when he says that many rough sleepers choose not to use the shelter places available. Forced to separate from their partner or their dog, or overcome addiction or mental illness in order to secure a place, many refuse.  But that’s not the same as wanting to remain on the street. But many London shelters also have strict rules on alcohol, pets, or smoking.  A quick study of the 28 emergency night shelters available across the British capital reveal that 26 of them banned alcohol.  Tango might not have found himself any better off across the Channel. And even those who meet hostel criteria can struggle to find a bed.  A national emergency helpline, set up in France to link rough sleepers with shelters, is often inundated with calls and many of those who do get through are told there are no spaces left. This winter, the French media ran a series of reports on the desperate advice rough sleepers were being given by the hotline - to try to sleep on night-buses, park benches, or on mattresses being laid out by some hospital A&E departments. Bruno lived rough for a short while 10 years ago, and says the situation was completely different then.  “It was nothing compared to today,” he says. “Back then, there were many more places in homeless shelters, and far fewer people on the streets.  The economic situation was different then, and all the refugees weren’t here.” Gauging accurately the number of people sleeping rough on the streets of Paris has proved very difficult - estimates range between 7,000-8,000. But in 2014 the French Bureau of Statistics said the number of homeless adults in the much wider Paris Metropolitan Area had risen by 84% in about  a decade. Some of that rise is thought to be a result of the 2008 financial crisis, but the expansion of the EU also brought in new populations to the capital’s streets, and the large numbers of migrants crossing the Mediterranean into Europe have added to those numbers again. And, says Chloe Serme-Morin, Paris has seen new groups of rough sleepers appearing. ""Families and young people are more and more represented among rough sleepers and in shelters,” she says. “That's really because of rising housing costs - especially rent - and austerity policies which mean economically fragile families are unable to afford housing.” With pressure continuing to grow, says Serme-Morin, shelters are not the whole solution. “There’s been a real shift in attitude following the change to the law in 2007 - it’s starting to realise that the solution is long-term housing, and to think about Housing First.” Housing First is a model from Finland that turns on its head the traditional approach towards homelessness that trapped Tango and others like him. Inside an emergency homeless accommodation centre in Paris “Previously, it was: sort out your addictions and psychiatric problems first, then we’ll give you temporary accommodation to see if you can handle it, and then if you’re ready, you’ll get permanent accommodation,” explains Serme-Morin. “Housing First means long-term housing is a precondition for sorting out everything else.” The real sticking point is a lack of social housing stock. An emergency accommodation centre for homeless people, under construction in Paris Eric Constantin, of Fondation Abbe Pierre, says that to solve the problem in the Ile-de-France region around Paris, 70,000 homes need to be built each year from 2010-2030, with half of these set aside for social housing.  So far, that target has gone unmet for all but one year. Almost three-quarters of residents in the Ile-de-France region qualify for social housing, he says.  “The French model is unique, but now it’s under threat, because the government thinks it should start to focus on the poorest of the poor - which is London’s approach.” A long-term home, without conditions attached, might well have been the key to getting Tango off the streets, but it would have meant Paris having enough social housing to go around. As it is, he chose to sleep on a bench in a Paris park, drinking away his days while dreaming of rebuilding his life. Tango’s memorial took place on a winter morning, in the park where he had lived. “We’d put up notices all around the neighbourhood,” Clement says. “Around 15 people showed up: social workers, park attendants, nearby shopkeepers, his friends from the street.  They had put a mattress on the ground and arranged candles and flowers all around it, along with his belongings - and some bottles of alcohol.” Clement began the secular ceremony, talking about the man he had known.  Others followed, sharing their stories.  “Tango was very sociable,” he says.  “Most people on the street die alone.” “There was another homeless man who died recently at a street corner just up the road,” he says.  “The local residents had been hostile, often calling the town hall to get rid of him. I wouldn’t go so far as to say they were happy when he died, but…” Deaths like this can be sudden, and next of kin hard to trace.  Until about 15 years ago, if no family could be traced, homeless people who died in Paris were buried by the municipality in a communal grave.  “That’s still what many people in the street think will happen to them,” says Clement. But organisations like his, and the Collectif Les Morts, now take over the process, organising simple ceremonies in a dedicated corner of the Thiais Cemetery outside Paris.  The area set aside for homeless burials is called the Carré de Fraternité - the Corner of Brotherhood. In Tango’s case, though, there was someone in his life. “There was a niece,” Clement says. “Tango talked about her a lot, and had given me her number.  I told her about the memorial, and she said she would come.  She sent lots of texts leading up to it, but she never appeared.  I think it was too difficult for her to confront what he had been through.” Instead, she stepped in to take charge of her uncle’s body.  Three decades after he had arrived in France full of hope for a brighter life, Tango’s body was repatriated to Morocco for burial. After 20 years spent dreaming of returning home, finally, he did.

Cost of British passport to increase,"The price of a British passport is to rise by Â£12.50 from 27 March for those applying by post. Currently, an adult's passport costs Â£72.50 regardless of how you apply for it but under government plans this would rise by 17% up to Â£85. The cost of online applications will also go up - but only by Â£3 to Â£75.50. Children's passport applications will also increase by Â£12.50 (27%) from Â£46 to Â£58.50 for anyone under the age of 16, but will be Â£49 online. Blue passport to return after Brexit Â£500m passport claim 'fake news' 'The blue belongs to us' It will be the first time ordering a passport by post will cost more than doing so online. Despite the price hike, the government maintains it will still cost less than it would have nine years ago due to fees being reduced in 2012. You can renew your passport at any time Any time left on your old passport will be transferred to your new one up to a maximum of nine months So if your passport runs out before 27 December, you might want to consider getting it renewed in the next eight weeks at the cheaper rate But do not do so if you have any imminent travel plans, as it currently takes about three weeks for a new passport to arrive The HM Passport Office has said it plans to draft in up to 200 extra staff to cope with extra demand in the run-up to the price increase While the changes are subject to parliamentary approval, the increases mean a family of four - two adults and two children - who apply by post will need to spend Â£287. Prices for adult passports on the fast-track service will rise from Â£103 to Â£142, and from Â£128 to Â£177 under the premium service. The Home Office said: ""These reforms are part of plans by the Home Office to invest Â£100m on border security and infrastructure next year."" It aims to ""create a self-sustainable immigration and borders system"". The Home Office justified the higher postal charges, saying they reflected the ""increased costs of processing postal applications compared to online applications"". It said the reforms would shift the financial burden of providing passports on to users of the service instead of taxpayers - ""millions of whom do not currently hold passports"". It added that the proposals are unrelated tothe reintroduction of blue passports, which will not create an extra cost. The proposed increased fees could mean the government makes an extra Â£50m in the next financial year. What price would you put on a passport? Is it true only 10% of Americans have passports?

India 'has 21 million unwanted girls',"Indian society should reflect upon its preference for sons, report authors said The desire among parents in India to have sons instead of daughters has created 21 million ""unwanted"" girls, a government report estimates. The finance ministry report found many couples kept on having children until they had a boy. Authors called this a ""subtler form"" of son preference than sex-selective abortions but warned it might lead to fewer resources for girls. Son preference was ""a matter for Indian society to reflect upon"", they said. The authors also found that 63 million women were ""missing"" from India's population because the preference for sons led to to sex-selective abortions and more care was given to boys. Tests to determine a foetus's sex are illegal in India, but they still take place and can lead to sex-selective abortions. Where are India's millions of missing girls? Some cultural reasons for son preference were listed, including: Property passing on to sons, not daughters Families of girls having to pay dowries to see their daughters married Women moving to their husband's house after getting married The cultural preference for male children has even ledone newspaper to list scientifically unfounded tips for conceiving boys, including facing west while sleeping, and having sex on certain days of the week. The states most affected by son preference were Punjab and Haryana, while the least-affected was Meghalaya. In Punjab and Haryana states there were 1,200 boys under the age of seven for every 1,000 girls of the same age, the authors ofthe Economic Survey,externalfound.

German shock at exhaust tests on humans,"German carmakers have already been hit by a damaging scandal over cheating in emissions tests The German government has denounced experiments funded by German carmakers in which humans and monkeys reportedly inhaled diesel exhaust fumes. German media say the health impact research was done by EUGT, a body funded by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. Such tests could not be justified, the government said, demanding details. A minister called them ""abominable"". Daimler also condemned them. VW is embroiled in a scandal over software that gave false diesel exhaust data. In 2015 VW admitted having fitted ""cheat"" devices in the US that made their engines appear less polluting than they actually were. Car firms are trying to reduce losses from bad publicity about diesel fumes EUGT was dissolved by the carmakers last year. The initials stand for European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector. ""These tests on monkeys or even humans cannot be justified ethically in any way,"" said Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks called the experiments ""abominable"" and expressed shock that scientists had agreed to conduct them. Social Democrat politician Stephan Weil - a VW supervisory board member - called them ""absurd and abhorrent"". ""Lobbying can be no excuse whatsoever for such testing,"" he said. On Thursdaythe New York Times reported that the EUGT research was designed to counter a 2012 decision by the World Health Organization,externalto classify diesel exhaust as a carcinogen. It said that in 2014, EUGT had exposed 10 monkeys to fumes - in an air-tight chamber - from several cars, including a diesel VW Beetle. The testing took place at a lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Then at the weekend Germany's Stuttgarter Zeitung and SWR radio reported that 19 men and six women had inhaled diesel fumes in another EUGT experiment. During a month of tests at a lab in Aachen, west Germany, they were exposed to various concentrations of diesel fumes, which contain toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx). The BBC has not seen the study itself, but German media say it was published in 2016. At the time the carmakers were arguing that modern technology had cut pollution from diesel engines to safe levels. But VW was later found to have fitted ""cheat"" devices that rigged the emissions data. The Aachen University Clinic said its ""ethically approved"" human tests had ""no link"" to the VW emissions scandal. Read more on the diesel emissions scandal: VW emissions cheat bill hits $30bn How toxic is your car exhaust? Volkswagen: The scandal explained Daimler, manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz cars, said on Sunday ""we are appalled by the extent of the [EUGT] studies and their implementation"".,external""We condemn the experiments in the strongest terms."" Reacting to the NYT report about the monkey experiments,VW tweeted on Saturday that it ""explicitly distances itself clearly from all forms of animal abuse"".,external ""We know that the scientific methods used by EUGT were wrong and apologise sincerely for this."" VW's supervisory board says it will conduct a full investigation, calling the experiments ""utterly incomprehensible"". A new study by a German car specialist, Ferdinand DudenhÃ¶ffer, says levels of pollution from diesel cars are still too high in 10 German cities, so the vehicles are likely to be banned from the pollution hotspots unless engines are upgraded. According to his research, vehicle software upgrades would not be enough to address the problem. Munich, Stuttgart, Hamburg, DÃ¼sseldorf and Cologne are among the cities with serious pollution hotspots. The German government thinks so. VW apologised and Daimler said ""the EUGT's approach contradicts our values and ethical principles"". Two independent scientists who have conducted air pollution tests on human volunteers told the BBC that the company sponsorship in the German case was problematic. ""If the research is not independent then there would be doubt about its validity and it would therefore not be ethical,"" said Prof Frank Kelly of King's College London. He said hundreds of volunteers had participated in state-funded studies on the impact of diesel exhaust - studies which required prior ethical approval.In one study by the college, volunteers with chronic lung or heart conditions walked down London's busy Oxford Street and through Hyde Park.,external ""Experimenting on people or monkeys is not inherently unethical,"" said Dr Chris Carlsten of Canada's University of British Columbia. He said it was ""not very common"" to do air pollution tests on monkeys, though some had been used in ozone impact studies. He has studied the effects of diesel exhaust on volunteers, who are paid about C$14 hourly (Â£8; $11) for two hours of exposure at a time.,externalThe diluted exhaust exposure is similar to the level experienced in Beijing, he said. ""These studies are essential to back up policies that protect all of us,"" he said. Are diesel cars always the most harmful?

Loyalist 'supergrass' jailed for six years,"Gary Haggarty, 45, was sentenced for more than 200 offences, including five murders A loyalist ""supergrass"" who admitted the murders of five people among hundreds of offences has had a 35-year jail term reduced to six-and-a-half years for helping the police. Gary Haggarty, 45, was a former leader of an Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) unit in north Belfast. Haggarty was a paid police informer for 11 years. A judge said the offences were ""ones of exceptional gravity"" but that he had provided significant information. After turning state witness in 2009, Haggarty provided information on 55 loyalist murders and 20 attempted murders in the course of 1,015 police interviews. Gary Haggarty: Full list of charges Informer shot Catholic to hide double life Legal challenge over supergrass handlers However, only one man is to be prosecuted, for two murders, on the back of the evidence. The vast majority of people named by Haggarty in his police interviews will not face prosecution amid state concerns about a lack of supporting evidence. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Volunteer Force murdered more than 500 people. The loyalist paramilitary group's campaign also claimed the lives of 33 people in bomb attacks in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974. Haggarty was a former commander of an Ulster Volunteer Force unit in the Mount Vernon area of north Belfast The organisation's name dates back to the Protestant force formed to oppose Home Rule in 1912. The name was revived in 1966 as loyalists came together to oppose liberal unionism and what it saw as a rise in Irish nationalism, centred on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. The UVF's political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, played a prominent role in the peace process and supported the 1998 Belfast Agreement. The judgement from Belfast Crown Court indicated that the 35-year jail term was reduced by 75% for the assistance given to prosecutors and then a further 25% for Haggarty's plea of guilty. The judge said that the 202 offences admitted by Haggarty had been committed during a ""terrorist campaign over a 16-year period"" between 1991 and 2007. He also noted that Haggarty's motivation for co-operating with prosecutors was ""self-interest and pragmatism"" rather than because he ""wishes to atone for his crimes"". However, his judgement added that Haggarty's assistance ""went beyond what might be described as 'normal' and, as a result of that assistance, the defendant has placed himself at considerable personal risk"". The judge said that Haggarty had provided ""a significant amount of information in relation to very serious criminal activity"". Keiran Fox said Haggarty had been 'allowed to kill at will' Keiran Fox, whose father, Eamon, was murdered by Haggarty, said he was a paid state informer who had been ""allowed to kill at will"". ""How can a man convicted of so many crimes be set free into society? He might come across as a a nice guy but the man's a serial killer,"" Mr Fox said. Haggarty admitted murdering: Catholic Sean McParland, who was shot while babysitting in Belfast in 1994 John Harbinson, a Protestant, who was handcuffed and beaten to death by a UVF gang on the Mount Vernon estate in north Belfast in May 1997 Catholic workmen Eamon Fox, 44, a father of six, and Gary Convie, 24, a father of one, shot dead as they had lunch together in a car in Belfast's North Queen Street in May 1994 Sean McDermott, a 37-year-old Catholic found shot dead in his car near Antrim in August 1994 He also admitted five attempted murders, including against police officers, 23 counts of conspiracy to murder and directing terrorism. The judge also took into consideration a further 301 lesser offences in his judgement.

Cost of British passport to increasePostal applications are to rise by significantly more than online applications.23m24 minutes agoUK,"The price of a British passport is to rise by Â£12.50 from 27 March for those applying by post. Currently, an adult's passport costs Â£72.50 regardless of how you apply for it but under government plans this would rise by 17% up to Â£85. The cost of online applications will also go up - but only by Â£3 to Â£75.50. Children's passport applications will also increase by Â£12.50 (27%) from Â£46 to Â£58.50 for anyone under the age of 16, but will be Â£49 online. Blue passport to return after Brexit Â£500m passport claim 'fake news' 'The blue belongs to us' It will be the first time ordering a passport by post will cost more than doing so online. Despite the price hike, the government maintains it will still cost less than it would have nine years ago due to fees being reduced in 2012. You can renew your passport at any time Any time left on your old passport will be transferred to your new one up to a maximum of nine months So if your passport runs out before 27 December, you might want to consider getting it renewed in the next eight weeks at the cheaper rate But do not do so if you have any imminent travel plans, as it currently takes about three weeks for a new passport to arrive The HM Passport Office has said it plans to draft in up to 200 extra staff to cope with extra demand in the run-up to the price increase While the changes are subject to parliamentary approval, the increases mean a family of four - two adults and two children - who apply by post will need to spend Â£287. Prices for adult passports on the fast-track service will rise from Â£103 to Â£142, and from Â£128 to Â£177 under the premium service. The Home Office said: ""These reforms are part of plans by the Home Office to invest Â£100m on border security and infrastructure next year."" It aims to ""create a self-sustainable immigration and borders system"". The Home Office justified the higher postal charges, saying they reflected the ""increased costs of processing postal applications compared to online applications"". It said the reforms would shift the financial burden of providing passports on to users of the service instead of taxpayers - ""millions of whom do not currently hold passports"". It added that the proposals are unrelated tothe reintroduction of blue passports, which will not create an extra cost. The proposed increased fees could mean the government makes an extra Â£50m in the next financial year. What price would you put on a passport? Is it true only 10% of Americans have passports?

EU sets out Brexit transition demands,"Chief negotiator Michel Barnier set out the EU's negotiating stance for the transition period The European Union has set out its demands for the temporary transition period after the UK leaves in March 2019. The EU wants the UK to continue to follow its rules but not be involved in making decisions. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK wanted a ""right to object"" to new laws passed by the EU during this time. Downing Street said there would ""naturally"" be differences between the sides ahead of negotiations. Reality Check: What's the EU's transition stance? Brexit bill flawed, peers say The UK hopes the two sides can reach agreement by March. The transition period - also referred to as an implementation period - is seen as a way to minimise disruption when the UK leaves the EU for things like business, holidaymakers and security. It will also allow more time to finalise the terms of the UK's post-Brexit relations with the EU. In their guidelines, the EU say: Transition should run from Brexit in March 2019 to 31 December 2020 All EU rules and regulations - as well as EU rule changes adopted after March 2019 - should apply in the UK during the transition phase There can be no ""cherry picking"" on the single market - so free movement into the UK should continue The UK will not be involved in the decision-making of EU bodies It cannot implement its own international agreements unless the EU agrees Work should continue on finding a solution to the Northern Ireland border question, one of the main sticking points in the first round of negotiations Speaking at a press conference after EU ministers agreed the negotiating guidelines, chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK would be allowed to attend decision-making meetings on a ""limited, exceptional, case  by case basis."" It would be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries but the deals could not come into force until the transition period was over, he added. This is in line with the UK's negotiating stance, as set out by Mr Davis in a speech on Friday. May urged to 'see off' hard Brexiteers Brexit: All you need to know Mr Davis also said existing international agreements - which include trade deals with other countries and agreements on aviation and nuclear power - should continue to apply during the period. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee on Monday, Mr Davis said the UK wanted a ""right to object"" to new laws passed by the EU during the transition phase over which it had no say and disagreed with. ""It's not particularly democratic practice to just have the country accept without any say-so, anything - particularly if... the European Union takes it on itself to do something which is actively disadvantageous to a major British industry or something like that,"" he said. ""So that's why we've raised the matter, and let's see how it goes."" Asked what legal status this would have, he said he wanted such a safeguard included in the withdrawal agreement. It's the sort of amazing coincidence that the Brexit process throws up all the time. Minutes after the Brexit Secretary David Davis laid out his concerns about the EU's transition proposals to a House of Lords Committee, Michel Barnier held a press conference where he knocked them down. For example, David Davis wants a mechanism where the UK has a say on new European laws that might affect Britain while it's not in the club but still subject to the rules. The best Mr Barnier was prepared to offer was consultation ""on an exceptional, case-by-case basis agreed by the 27 remaining member states"". And don't dare call it anything as grand as ""observer status"", he warned. He dismissed the Brexit secretary's demands that Britain be allowed to negotiate trade deals with other countries during the transition period. Of course they can, Mr Barnier said. In fact, Britain had better get a move on if it wants to replicate the 750 international agreements that come with EU membership. True, this is the start of a negotiation but it is not clear that the EU sees anything to negotiate. Mr Barnier feels that he has already made the UK a generous offer that's in Britain's economic interest. Plus, there was a reminder that the deal on the transition period is linked to a deal on everything else: no agreement on a final Brexit treaty means no transition. Some in the UK are unhappy at the idea that the UK will have to follow the rules of the single market and the customs union, including freedom of movement for EU citizens, but will lose its voting rights. Mrs May's Brexit ''inner circle'' of senior ministers met in sub-committee on Monday morning to discuss how the transitional phase could work, including the UK's demand that it be free to negotiate trade deals with other countries during the period. Earlier a Downing Street spokesman said: ''There is obviously going to be a negotiation on what the implementation period looks like. ''The formal directives will be released this afternoon. This will be a negotiation and there will naturally be some distance in the detail of our starting positions.""

Killers 'chosen by coin-toss',"Gary Haggarty was a police informer for 13 years The most senior loyalist ever to agree to become a so-called supergrass volunteered to kill a Catholic to cover up the fact he was an informer. Sean McParland died after being shot while babysitting in Belfast in 1994. The Ulster Volunteer Force was to decide the identity of the killer by flipping a coin, Belfast Crown Court heard. But Gary Haggarty volunteered to be the ""primary gunman"" because he feared he was suspected of being a police agent. Gary Haggarty: Full list of charges The intended target was a relative of Mr McParland, who was 55. Haggarty, an ex-commander of the UVF's north Belfast unit, was working as a paid Special Branch agent at the time of the killing. He worked as an informer for 13 years. In January 2010, he offered to become a supergrass - officially referred to as an assisting offender - and offered to give evidence against other UVF members he said were also involved in the crimes he committed. Haggarty, 45, a long-time police informer, has pleaded guilty to 202 terror offences, including five murders, as his part of a controversial state deal that offered a significantly reduced prison term in return for giving evidence against other terrorist suspects. The two-day sentencing hearing is expected to conclude on Thursday. Haggarty is likely to be given mandatory life sentences for each of the murders he has admitted. But he will also receive a significant reduction in his sentence in return for the amount of information he has provided as an assisting offender. Mr Justice Colton will make that decision based on the information put before him during the hearing. It is not clear when the sentence is likely to be imposed. Haggarty is to be the star prosecution witness in the trial of a man accused of murdering Catholic workmen Gary Convie and Eamon Fox in Belfast city centre in May 1994. But before he can give evidence he must first be sentenced for his own crimes. Gary Haggarty was the commander of the Ulster Volunteer Force's north Belfast unit That formal process began on Wednesday when a prosecution lawyer outlined some of the details of Haggarty's confessions to police. In one of the biggest and most complex cases undertaken in Northern Ireland, he was interviewed by detectives more than 1,000 times and the information he gave them ran beyond 12,000 pages. The extent of his criminal activities is staggering. As well as pleading guilty to 202 crimes, he asked that 301 others be taken into consideration. In total he admitted 503 offences, including: Five murders Five attempted murders 25 conspiracies to murder 66 charges of possession of firearms and ammunition Four counts of directing terrorism In addition to the killing of Sean McParland, he also admitted the murders of: John Harbinson, a Protestant handcuffed and beaten to death by a UVF gang on the Mount Vernon estate in north Belfast in May 1997 Catholic workmen Eamon Fox, 44 , a father of six, and Gary Convie, 24 , a father of one, shot dead as they had lunch together in a car in Belfast's North Queen Street in May 1994 Sean McDermott, a 37-year-old Catholic found shot dead in his car near Antrim in August 1994 Relatives of some of the victims were in court on Wednesday as a prosecution lawyer spent more than four hours outlining the extent of Haggarty's activities. He included harrowing details of some of the incidents. The judge was told how three of Sean McParland's young grandchildren ran screaming from his house in Skegoneill Avenue when the UVF burst in to kill him. Eamon Fox and Gary Convie were shot dead while eating their lunch at a building site in 1994 In police interviews, Haggarty said he shot the 55-year-old in the chest from close range. He had planned to fire another five bullets into his chest, but could not do so because his gun jammed. The prosecution lawyer said Haggarty, who was promoted within the UVF after the shooting, expressed regret during interviews after agreeing to become a supergrass. ""He said he is sorry, it was the wrong person killed, he is sorry for the kids that were there,"" said the lawyer. The court was also told that Haggarty acknowledged that two more of his victims, Eamon Fox and Gary Convie, were innocent men and not republicans as claimed by the UVF at the time. ""He said he did not believe they were republicans, but just soft easy targets,"" added the lawyer. Kieran Fox, one of Eamon Fox's six children, was one of the relatives in court as the details of Haggarty's litany of crimes was outlined, and welcomed the admission. ""To hear that Haggarty has admitted before they actually carried out the shooting that my dad and Gary were both innocent, that they were not republicans as they claimed at the time, it was nice to hear that part,"" he said. The court also heard harrowing details about the extent of injuries to John Harbinson. The dead man's son was also in the public gallery but left shortly after details of the injuries were described. Haggarty was involved in abducting Mr Harbinson, but told police he thought he was going to be beaten and shot in the legs, rather than killed. The hearing will continue on Thursday, when a lawyer representing Gary Haggarty will outline details he gave his police handlers during 13 years as an informer. He is said to have provided information on: 55 murders 20 attempted murders 56 conspiracies to murder 24 bombing offences Prosecutors have said Haggarty's evidence is insufficient to provide a reasonable prospect of obtaining a conviction against 11 other suspected UVF members and two former police intelligence officers, allegedly his then handlers. The police bristle at the very mention of the word supergrass, because of its association with a series of high-profile trials in the 1980s. Hundreds of republicans and loyalists were convicted on the word of informers and suspects who agreed to give evidence in return for reduced sentences, new identities and lives outside Northern Ireland. Those deals were done at a political level, with the details kept secret. Technically, those individuals were assisting offenders but they became known as ""touts"" and ""supergrasses"" in communities. The system collapsed in 1985 because of concerns about the credibility of the evidence provided by the supergrasses. Members of the judiciary complained that they were being used as political tools to implement government security policy. A change in law in 2005 implemented safeguards for trials of that kind.

The EU's transition position explained,"The European Union haslaid out its guidelines,external(known officially as supplementary directives) for the transition period after the UK formally leaves it, presumably in March next year. This is just the start of the negotiations - this is the agreed position of the other 27 member states. It's quite a dense, legalistic document, so Reality Check has pulled out some of the more important sections. This is a bit of a warning shot. The guidelines begin with several paragraphs reminding us of what's been agreed so far, and emphasise that those agreements have to be respected if further progress is to be made. One example: the EU believes there was an understanding that the transition period would maintain the status quo - in other words, all existing rules, regulations and arrangements would continue to operate. But the UK is now seeking some exceptions, and that will complicate matters. The government hopes a deal on the transition can be completed in March, but there's no guarantee that will happen. Irish border alert - don't think that you've heard the last of it. The language used in the December agreement was a fudge, and it will be difficult to translate into a legal text. Remember, the UK pledged that - if all else failed - it would maintain full alignment with those rules of the single market and the customs union that affected the border. The EU isn't sure how that can be done if the UK insists on leaving the single market and the customs union. There are various legal quirks to be found in small territories around the edges of the EU, but the challenge in Ireland is of a different scale. Creative solutions are required. This is an old favourite making yet another comeback, but it is worth highlighting again. It is one of the ""core principles"" the EU says it will apply to both transitional arrangements and the future relationship with the UK. So, during the transition, the EU will insist that freedom of movement of people should continue in full, as should UK participation in the single market and the customs union. Suggestions from London that some things could change during the transition (hence the phrase ""implementation"" period) are met with raised eyebrows and rolling eyes elsewhere on the Continent. Remember, the acquis is the set of laws, treaties and agreements that apply to all members. This one is politically difficult for the UK government, given the scale of unrest on its back benches. The EU says the UK will have to accept any new laws passed during the transition even though it will no longer have any say in making them. Brexit Secretary David Davis has pointed out it takes about two years for new legislation to make its way through the EU system, so most new laws will have been drafted while the UK was still a member state. But he also said it was important to find a mechanism for resolving concerns about any new laws the UK did not like. The opening gambit from the EU suggests there is very little wiggle room. This is a quick reminder of the official position of the other 27 member states: the UK can't actually implement new agreements with other countries during what it likes to call the implementation period, unless the EU gives a nod of approval. Spoiler: the EU won't do that for important things such as ambitious new trade deals. The government points out it will be able to negotiate and even sign trade deals during this period, but implementation will have to wait. It is a moot point anyway, because we do not know whether other countries will be willing to finalise a trade deal with the UK before they know what the future UK-EU trade relationship is going to be. This is the kicker towards the end, which is giving rise to accusations from Brexiteers that the UK will become a ""vassal state"" during transition. The UK will no longer play any formal role, or have any vote, in any of the EU institutions, even though it will be obliged to follow all EU laws. The government points out this will apply only for a strictly time-limited period, and says it is necessary to provide business with the continuity it seeks. In fact, the EU guidelines say the transition should last less than two years - ""not beyond 31 December 2020"". But many business groups worry that will not be long enough. Perhaps that's one of the reasons why an annex to these guidelines says they will be kept under review and updated as necessary.

FBI deputy quits after Trump criticism,"The president complained that Mr McCabe's wife had received donations from ""Clinton Puppets"" The Federal Bureau of Investigation's deputy director, whom US President Donald Trump repeatedly accused of political bias, has resigned. Andrew McCabe was pressured to quit by FBI Director Christopher Wray in advance of an inspector general report examining the agency, reports CBS News. Mr McCabe was reportedly due to retire on 18 March. His exit from the top law enforcement agency comes a week after a report that Mr Trump wanted him out. An internal communication authored by Mr Wray shows Mr McCabe's early departure was the result of a forthcoming FBI inspector general report that concluded the agency must perform at the highest standards, according to CBS News. Earlier on Monday,the New York Times reported,externalthat Mr Wray had expressed an interest in moving Mr McCabe to another job, which would have been a demotion, ahead of the inspector general report. It is unclear when the report will be released. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told Monday's daily press briefing: ""This decision was not made by the White House."" ""The president wasn't part of this decision making process,"" she added. All you need to know about Trump Russia story Could Trump be guilty of obstruction of justice? Why attacks on Mueller are mounting Mr McCabe briefly became acting FBI director last May after Mr Trump fired its previous chief, James Comey.

By Anthony Zurcher, BBC News Andrew McCabe had become a lightning rod for Republican criticism of the FBI's handling of the investigation into possible Trump campaign ties to Russia. Now he's heading for - or, perhaps, being pushed toward - the exits a bit earlier than he planned. Donald Trump had already been explicit in his criticism of the bureau's second-in-command during the tumultuous 2016 presidential election season. In a late December tweet,the president essentially counted the days,externaluntil Mr McCabe's planned springtime retirement. FBI Director Christopher Wray reportedly threatened to resign rather than sack his deputy director. Something changed. Perhaps the political pressure from Republicans became too much. Or maybe, as Democrats have warned, this is the beginning of a political-tinged purge of the nation's top law-enforcement agency. If there's something more concerning about Mr McCabe's tenure, beyond a Democratic-affiliated wife or his name surfacing in text messages in 2016 between two FBI employees who had been critical of Mr Trump, it's only a matter of time before it comes to light. What's clear at this point, however, is that the Russian investigation is increasingly becoming mired in partisan trench warfare - and it could directly affect how Robert Mueller's special investigation proceeds. The 'secret memo' intriguing Washington The Republican president has previously criticised Mr McCabe because his wife, Dr Jill McCabe, ran as a Democrat in a failed bid for Virginia's state senate. Her campaign received nearly $500,000 (Â£355,000) in donations from a political funding committee aligned with Hillary Clinton, Mr Trump's 2016 election rival. Mr Trump has railed against Mr McCabe and his wife on Twitter, calling the FBI chief a ""Comey friend"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Last July he tweeted: ""Problem is that the acting head of the FBI & the person in charge of the Hillary investigation, Andrew McCabe, got $700,000 from H for wife!"" The White House revolving door: Who's gone? The Washington Post reported last week that Mr McCabe was disturbed by a question he was asked by the president during a get-to-know-you Oval Office meeting. Mr Trump had reportedly asked Mr McCabewho he voted for in the 2016 US presidential election, according to current and former officials in the report. Mr McCabe said he told the president that he did not vote. The president has questioned how Mr McCabe could have handled the FBI investigation into Mrs Clinton's use of a private email server when his wife received donations from ""Clinton Puppets"". He also reportedly called Mr McCabe and demanded to know why Mr Comey was allowed to fly back on an FBI plane after he was fired in May,NBC News reported,external, citing people familiar with the phone call. During that reported phone call, the president allegedly turned on Mr McCabe and told him to ask his wife ""how it feels to be a loser"", referencing her campaign loss, according to NBC News. Recently released text messages indicate FBI officials felt Mr McCabe should have recused himself earlier from the Clinton email investigation owing to his wife's political aspirations. In a 28 October 2016 exchange, FBI agent Peter Strzok wrote to colleague Lisa Page that the bureau's chief of staff ""very clearly 100% believes that Andy should be recused because of the 'perception'"". Mr McCabe eventually did recuse himself from the Clinton probe a week before the November 2016 election. Republican-led congressional committees have launched inquiries into whether the FBI botched its Clinton investigation and showed favouritism towards her. Democrats have said those investigations are attempts to distract from US Department of Justice Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into whether Mr Trump's 2016 presidential campaign colluded with Russia.

TomTom ditches updates for some sat-navs,"The affected devices include older sat-navs, but some relatively recent models as well A number of customers with TomTom sat-navs have been told that their devices will no longer receive map updates. ""Your maps will become out-of-date and as such navigation will be less accurate,"" the firm told customers. ""It has become clear that some of our older generation navigation devices do not have sufficient resources to run the newest maps and software."" A spokesman for TomTom told the BBC the company had been ""proactively"" communicating with customers. ""Afull list of those affected devices,externalis available on our website,"" he said. TomTom has said active subscriptions to map updates will continue until subscriptions run out, but customers will not be able to renew maps or receive new software updates. In an email to customers, the firm added: ""We will continue to provide quick GPS fix updates so your device will continue to function as it does now."" The BBC has spoken to one user who was given a new sat-nav at Christmas. Paula Hatcher's partner bought her the Start 20 device because her previous sat-nav - an older model with the same name - had not come with lifetime maps. ""I haven't even had the opportunity to update it even once, since the email I received this morning [advised] the withdrawal of lifetime maps,"" she said. When the BBC contacted TomTom, the company confirmed that there were two devices named ""Start 20"" and that Paula's, the newer version, would in fact receive map updates. A spokesman for the firm said the TomTom website would be updated to reflect this naming issue and avoid confusion. However, other TomTom sat-nav models available at various online retailers appear to be among those that the firm has said will cease to receive updates. Product descriptions continue to state that maps on these devices will be refreshed multiple times a year ""for the lifetime of your device"". On its website, TomTom explains that ""lifetime"" means the ""useful life"" of a device: ""ie: the period of time TomTom supports your device with updates, services, content or accessories. A device will have reached the end of its life when none of these are available any more."" Paula Hatcher received her TomTom sat-nav at Christmas - but was concerned when TomTom appeared to announce that its lifetime updates would be cancelled Another customer who bought a TomTom Start 25 sat-nav in 2013 said he won't be buying another product from the company. ""I will use my current smartphone with updated maps,"" said Chris Syntichakis. TomTom's sales of devices direct to customers have recently been in ""severe decline"", according to analyst Chris Jones at Canalys. ""Clearly they've identified a business market for future growth - that includes navigation and traffic services integrated into cars,"" he explained. He said the market for personal sat-navs had been eroded by the rise of smartphone apps that offer similar services and frequent updates. ""Within months the [sat-navs] will quickly become out-of-date when those updates stop appearing,"" he added. ""It's not just new roads, it's [information about] features on roads - road signs, speed limits, rights of way and crossings.""

Fashion firms Joe Bloggs and East fail,"Bez and Shaun Ryder of the Happy Mondays, pictured with the late Kirsty MacColl, wore Joe Bloggs The owner of Joe Bloggs, the fashion label that became synonymous with the ""Madchester"" music scene of the late 1980s, has gone into administration. Juice Corporation has made 60 people redundant and its assets are being put up for sale. Joe Bloggs was known for its baggy denim flares, with some measuring as wide as 25-inches. Asian-inspired High Street fashion brand East has also gone into administration. East, whose controlling shareholder is Indian retail group Fabindia, operates 34 stores and 15 concessions in the UK, with a total workforce of 314 people. The firms' failures come during a tough period for UK fashion retailers. While new online fast-fashion brands have seen dramatic growth, older brands and High Street retailers have struggled. Dressing celebs Both brands have more than 20 years' pedigree with UK consumers. In the 1980s Joe Bloggs' signature baggy denim jeans were worn by the likes of Manchester bands Happy Mondays and Inspiral Carpets. Christmas shopping: the winners and losers Five things we've learnt from UK shoppers Joe Bloggs was set up by Shami Ahmed in 1985 when he was in his early twenties. The brand rode the wave of Manchester's cultural and musical resurgence in the late 1980s and early 1990s, making Mr Ahmed a multi-millionaire. However, he was declared bankrupt in 2009 after running up large gambling debts. Joe Bloggs is one of a number of brands owned by the Juice Corporation, including Elizabeth Emanuel. Juice Corporation bought the name but then faced a six-year court battle with Elizabeth Emanuel, who designed the wedding dress worn by the late Diana, Princess of Wales when she married Prince Charles. Juice Corporation eventually won and used the name for a range of evening dresses, nightwear and lingerie. East was launched in 1994 by former Monsoon employees Clive Pettigrew, Penny Oliver and Jonathan Keating. East has 34 stores and 15 concessions in the UK The Indian firm behind it, Fabindia, was set up to help distribute goods made by local craft workers in Jaipur and Rajasthan. Joe Bloggs-owner Juice Corporation is also a licensee for Slazenger and Kangol, which counts the actor Samuel L Jackson among its fans. The administrators appointed Robson Kay to oversee a sale of the company's assets, which include around Â£7.5m, in intellectual property rights and buildings.

Fitness app exposes military basesSoldiers have been publicly sharing location information as they log their daily runs.,"The movements of soldiers within Bagram air base - the largest US military facility in Afghanistan Security concerns have been raised after a fitness tracking firm showed the exercise routes of military personnel in bases around the world. Online fitness tracker Strava has published a ""heatmap"" showing the paths its users log as they run or cycle. It appears to show the structure of foreign military bases in countries including Syria and Afghanistan as soldiers move around them. The US military was examining the heatmap, a spokesman said. San Francisco-based Strava provides an app that uses a mobile phone's GPS to track a subscriber's exercise activity. It uses the collected data, as well as that from fitness devices such as Fitbit and Jawbone, to enable people to check their own performances and compare them with others. It says it has 27 million users around the world. The latest version of the heatmap was released by Strava in November last year,external. It is a data visualisation showing all of the activity of all of its users around the world. Strava says the newest version has been built from one billion activities - some three trillion points of data, covering 27 billion km (17bn miles) of distance run, jogged or swum. But it is not a live map. The data aggregates the activities recorded between 2015 and September 2017. That is thanks to Nathan Ruser, a 20-year-old Australian university student who is studying international security at the Australian National University and also works with the Institute for United Conflict Analysts.

He said he came across the map while browsing a cartography blog last week. It occurred to him that a large number of military personnel on active service had been publicly sharing their location data and realised that the highlighting of such exercises as regular jogging routes could be dangerous. ""I just looked at it and thought, 'oh hell, this should not be here - this is not good,'"" he told the BBC. ""I thought the best way to deal with it is to make the vulnerabilities known so they can be fixed. Someone would have noticed it at some point. I just happened to be the person who made the connection."" Although the location of military bases is generally well-known and satellite imagery can show the outline of buildings, the heatmap can reveal which of them are most used, or the routes taken by soldiers. Is that fitness tracker you're using a waste of money? The gadgets for keeping tabs on pets Has wearable tech had its day? It displays the level of activity - shown as more intense light - and the movement of personnel inside the walls. It also appears that location data has been tracked outside bases - which may show commonly used exercise routes or patrolled roads. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Ruser said he was shocked by how much detail he could see. ""You can establish a pattern of life,"" he said. By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent Many years ago, operational security was a relatively simple matter of not being physically overheard by the enemy. Think of the British WWII poster with the slogan ""Careless Talk Costs Lives"". Well, no more. Our modern electronic age means that we all move around with a number of ""signatures"";  we send and receive a variety of signals, all of which can be tracked. And as the episode with the exercise tracker shows, you do not need to be an American or Russian spy to be able to see and analyse these signals. Russian troops have been tracked in Ukraine or in Syria by studying their social media interactions or geo-location data from their mobile phone images. Each piece of evidence is a fragment, but when added together it could pose a significant risk to security - in this case highlighting the location of formerly secret bases or undisclosed patterns of military activity. The app is far more popular in the West than elsewhere and major cities are aglow with jogging routines. But in remote areas foreign military bases stand out as isolated ""hotspots"" and the activities of a single jogger can be illuminated on dark backgrounds. Exercise activities stand out in such countries as Syria, Yemen, Niger, Afghanistan and Djibouti, among others. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Neither is it just military personnel who could be affected, but also aid workers and NGO staffers in remoter areas too. Both state and non-state actors could use the data to their advantage. Yes. The settings available in Strava's app allow users to explicitly opt out of data collection for the heatmap - even for activities not marked as private - or to set up ""privacy zones"" in certain locations. Strava has not said much since the concerns were raised but it released a brief statement highlighting that the data used had been anonymised, and ""excludes activities that have been marked as private and user-defined privacy zones"".

In 2016, the US military banned Pokemon GO from government-issued mobile phones, An image of the Pentagon on the Strava heatmap showed no activity.

Uni probes 'inappropriate chav party',"Members of the hockey team, dressed up for the party, were posted on Instagram A ""chav-themed"" party held by a university hockey club is being investigated by a students' union after the University of Leeds described it as ""ill-judged"". The women's hockey club at Leeds University Union held a ""chav night"" social last Wednesday. The Tab,externalwebsite showed Instagram photos of women in tracksuits, drinking Lambrini and covered in fake tattoos. The union said it had received complaints from a group of students. More Yorkshire stories The Tab said the invitation to the evening, posted on the hockey team's closed Facebook group, told members to dress as ""lower-class"" people and included a dictionary definition of ""chav"" as ""a young, lower-class person typified by brash and loutish behaviour"". It said the invitation read: ""We educated fair maidens, studying in one of the countries [sic] grandest universities, would find such behaviour entirely alien"". Members were told to ""set aside all they believed to be good, honest and noble"" and ""replace champagne flutes with cans of K cider"". A spokesperson from the students' union said the theme was ""not acceptable"" and the event was being investigated. Clubs and societies commit to theLUU Social Guidelines,external, which say: ""No matter where you are and what you are doing if there is a complaint about you or your club or society it will reflect badly on the university, LUU, your club or society and you"". The union is investigating the event following informal complaints ""We expect all our clubs and societies to run inclusive and accessible activities, including socials,"" it said. ""Where we become aware that this is not the case, as in this instance, we will investigate this with the organisers and take disciplinary action against individuals or clubs as appropriate. ""We are still investigating and determining what action should be taken."" The University of Leeds said the event was ""ill-judged"". The hockey club has so far been unavailable for comment.

1.6m PIP disability claims to be reviewed,"This video can not be played 'My husband had to quit work to care for me' Every person receiving Personal Independence Payments (PIP) will have their claim reviewed, the Department for Work and Pensions has said. A total of 1.6 million of the main disability benefit claims will be reviewed, with around 220,000 people expected to receive more money. It comes after the DWP decided not to challenge a court ruling that said changes to PIP were unfair to people with mental health conditions. The review could cost Â£3.7bn by 2023. The minister for disabled people, Sarah Newton, said the DWP was embarking on a ""complex exercise and of considerable scale"". She added: ""Whilst we will be working at pace to complete this exercise it is important that we get it right."" What is the row around PIPs all about? U-turn in disability benefits row Why I secretly taped my disability assessment Ministers made changes to PIP in 2017 which limited the amount of support people with mental health conditions could receive. As a result, people who were unable to travel independently on the grounds of psychological distress - as opposed to other conditions - were not entitled to the enhanced mobility rate of the benefit. The government pressed ahead with the proposals, despite criticism from an independent tribunal in 2016. An independent review of PIP in 2017 was critical of the assessment system, afterrevealing 65% of those who appealed against rejected claimssaw the decision overturned by judges. And in December, a High Court judge ruled the alterations ""blatantly discriminate"" against people with psychiatric problems and were a breach of their human rights. Last week, new Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey announced the governmentwould not appeal against the judgement, despite not agreeing with certain aspects of it. The government's announcement to review all claims for PIP is not, as it may seem at first glance, a complete overhaul of the system. This judgement won't affect people with physical disabilities, but the DWP will be going through everyone currently in receipt of PIP to narrow the 1.6 million claims down to approximately 220,000 people it thinks will be affected. The DWP has told me it will prioritise claimants who were disallowed PIP over those already in receipt of the award. Shadow work and pensions secretary Debbie Abrahams said it was ""shocking"" that so many claims were having to be reviewed and expressed concern that a timetable for action was yet to be put forward. ""The government was wrong to cut PIP benefits in the first place, wrong to bring in the PIP regulations last year and it was wrong to repeatedly ignore the views of the courts,"" she said. Mark Atkinson, chief executive at disability charity Scope, said more had to be done to address all the issues. ""While it's crucial that the government urgently identifies and pays the vast numbers of disabled people who lost out on this vital support, this will not address the root of the problem,"" he said. ""The fundamentally flawed PIP assessment needs a radical overhaul so it accurately identifies the extra costs disabled people face."" Philip Connolly, policy manager at Disability Rights UK, welcomed the review but expressed regret at ""persistent failures"" of the assessment process. ""Huge amounts of taxpayers' money is being wasted on poor quality assessments which deny disabled people benefits that they qualify for."" Campaigners protesting Personal Independence Payments outside courts in London Keith Thompson, who lives with bipolar disorder, had his PIP reduced from Â£420 to Â£220 because he did not score enough points on his assessment. The 49-year-old was moved from the Disability Living Allowance (DLA) to PIP in October 2017. He told the BBC: ""I got a letter saying my payments would stop and I would be reviewed by assessment for PIP. ""The lady there wasn't a psychiatrist. She asked if I could walk, none of the questions related to any of my mental health problems."" He said that he ""felt totally discriminated"", and that the ""whole process was totally disgusting"". He was initially told he would receive no PIP payment, but that was later reviewed and he was informed he would receive a minor PIP, rather than the full amount. ""I don't know what's going to happen. What if it gets reviewed and I end up with nothing?"" Kelly Bailey lives with borderline personality disorder, and says she had her PIP removed when she informed the DWP her condition had worsened. ""They sent me for a consultation, we spoke for a little while, and then they sent a letter saying thanks for letting us look at your claim again. ""I got the letter in January. The letter said that my needs have changed so now they're stopping my payments.""

Fitness app exposes military bases,"The movements of soldiers within Bagram air base - the largest US military facility in Afghanistan Security concerns have been raised after a fitness tracking firm showed the exercise routes of military personnel in bases around the world. Online fitness tracker Strava has published a ""heatmap"" showing the paths its users log as they run or cycle. It appears to show the structure of foreign military bases in countries including Syria and Afghanistan as soldiers move around them. The US military was examining the heatmap, a spokesman said. San Francisco-based Strava provides an app that uses a mobile phone's GPS to track a subscriber's exercise activity. It uses the collected data, as well as that from fitness devices such as Fitbit and Jawbone, to enable people to check their own performances and compare them with others. It says it has 27 million users around the world. The latest version of the heatmap was released by Strava in November last year,external. It is a data visualisation showing all of the activity of all of its users around the world. Strava says the newest version has been built from one billion activities - some three trillion points of data, covering 27 billion km (17bn miles) of distance run, jogged or swum. But it is not a live map. The data aggregates the activities recorded between 2015 and September 2017. That is thanks to Nathan Ruser, a 20-year-old Australian university student who is studying international security at the Australian National University and also works with the Institute for United Conflict Analysts.

He said he came across the map while browsing a cartography blog last week. It occurred to him that a large number of military personnel on active service had been publicly sharing their location data and realised that the highlighting of such exercises as regular jogging routes could be dangerous. ""I just looked at it and thought, 'oh hell, this should not be here - this is not good,'"" he told the BBC. ""I thought the best way to deal with it is to make the vulnerabilities known so they can be fixed. Someone would have noticed it at some point. I just happened to be the person who made the connection."" Although the location of military bases is generally well-known and satellite imagery can show the outline of buildings, the heatmap can reveal which of them are most used, or the routes taken by soldiers. Is that fitness tracker you're using a waste of money? The gadgets for keeping tabs on pets Has wearable tech had its day? It displays the level of activity - shown as more intense light - and the movement of personnel inside the walls. It also appears that location data has been tracked outside bases - which may show commonly used exercise routes or patrolled roads. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Ruser said he was shocked by how much detail he could see. ""You can establish a pattern of life,"" he said. By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent Many years ago, operational security was a relatively simple matter of not being physically overheard by the enemy. Think of the British WWII poster with the slogan ""Careless Talk Costs Lives"". Well, no more. Our modern electronic age means that we all move around with a number of ""signatures"";  we send and receive a variety of signals, all of which can be tracked. And as the episode with the exercise tracker shows, you do not need to be an American or Russian spy to be able to see and analyse these signals. Russian troops have been tracked in Ukraine or in Syria by studying their social media interactions or geo-location data from their mobile phone images. Each piece of evidence is a fragment, but when added together it could pose a significant risk to security - in this case highlighting the location of formerly secret bases or undisclosed patterns of military activity. The app is far more popular in the West than elsewhere and major cities are aglow with jogging routines. But in remote areas foreign military bases stand out as isolated ""hotspots"" and the activities of a single jogger can be illuminated on dark backgrounds. Exercise activities stand out in such countries as Syria, Yemen, Niger, Afghanistan and Djibouti, among others. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The settings available in Strava's app allow users to explicitly opt out of data collection for the heatmap - even for activities not marked as private - or to set up ""privacy zones"" in certain locations.

Kremlin accuses US of election meddling,"Vladimir Putin seems certain to win in March after an opposition leader was barred from standing An expected US report that could sanction Kremlin-linked oligarchs is an attempt to influence Russia's March presidential election, Moscow has said. The US treasury report is expected to detail the closeness of senior Russian political figures and oligarchs to President Vladimir Putin, who is standing for re-election. US officials accuse Russia of meddling in the 2016 US presidential elections. Kremlin representatives have repeatedly denied the allegations. Mr Putin's spokesman said the forthcoming report would be analysed. This video can not be played All you need to know about the Trump-Russia investigation Last year, US President Donald Trump enacted new sanctions on Russia but he accused Congress of overreaching itself and preventing him from easing penalties on Russia in the future. The US president has repeatedly rejected any allegations that his campaign staff colluded with Russia to help him defeat Hillary Clinton at the November 2016 presidential election. The allegations voiced by the US intelligence community are currently being investigated by Congress and a special investigator. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Dmitry Peskov said the US report was a ""direct and obvious attempt to influence the elections"" on 18 March. However, he added that he was sure the list would not affect the vote. The Kremlin has pledged to help limit further damage to Russian oligarchs and businesses that could be on the list. Last year, President Putin reportedly met top businessmen behind closed doors to discuss the issue. Last week, the boss of Russia's VTB bank,Andrei Kostin, told the Financial Times that if the US slapped more economic sanctions against Russia it would be ""a declaration of war"".,external Allow Twitter content?

Mr Putin is seen as the clear favourite to win the March elections. His main opposition rival, Alexei Navalny, has been barred from standing in the race.He was briefly detained during a protest rally on Sunday. The US treasury department has to finalise the document on Monday, after which it is expected to hand the report over to Congress. It is not known whether the names of those on the list will be publicly revealed or kept secret or indeed how many people and entities are on the list. Being on the list does not automatically trigger sanctions but such penalties could be activated any time later by the US. The US first imposed penalties in response to Russia's annexation of Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula in March 2014 after an unrecognised referendum on self-determination. Together with the EU, the US later extended sanctions over Russia's role in the conflict in eastern Ukraine, which has claimed more than 10,000 lives. Russia denies sending troops and arming separatist rebels but says Russian volunteers have been helping the rebels. Last week,the US treasury imposed additional sanctions,externalagainst 21 individuals and 19 individuals in connection with the Ukrainian crisis.

River Seine peaks in flood-hit Paris,"This video can not be played Watch drone footage of the swollen river Seine in Paris The swollen River Seine in the French capital, Paris, has peaked at about four metres above its normal water level for the time of year. The flood level rose to 5.84m (19.2ft) early on Monday and is not expected to begin receding before Tuesday. Weeks of rainfall have produced a relentless rise in the water level. Around 1,500 people have been evacuated from their homes in the greater Paris region, while a similar number of homes remain without electricity. In 2016, the last significant flood in Paris, the river floodwater reached a high of 6.1m. Seven stations of a main commuter line, the RER C, have been closed until at least 5 February, and some expressways that run alongside the Seine have been closed. The city's famous Bateaux Mouches tourist boats are out of service, with only emergency services allowed to use the river. This year's floods are not as bad as those experienced in 2016 or 1910 Parts of the greater Paris region are also affected A man used a rope to transfer a bag of supplies to a friend living on a houseboat Many people who live on houseboats along the Seine have been affected by the rising water levels and strengthening currents. Those moored directly along the river have been evacuated to gyms in the city while others, like Gregory Deryckere, 36, who live in slightly more protected harbours up and down the waterway, have had to be towed closer to the land. ""My houseboat is in Port Van Gogh, in AsniÃ¨res, and was one of the furthest out into the Seine,"" he said. ""We've been temporarily 'attached' to two other boats so have to get across them in order to reach the pontoon now. ""My houseboat has been plugged into the electricity supply for a vacant boat so I do have power but I have no Wi-Fi connection. ""We just have to wait for the water levels drop before it's safe to move back to my normal location."" In some areas, residents have erected defences against the floodwaters The water is expected to start receding later in the week At the Louvre, a lower level housing Islamic artwork was closed to visitors. Other famous attractions like the MusÃ©e d'Orsay and the Orangerie gallery were on high alert. Several areas on the city's outskirts are under water, and some residents are getting around by boat while dozens have been evacuated from their homes. Some schools are closed. When Paris was under water for two months Water levels are expected to remain high all week, as more rain is expected to worsen an already waterlogged soil, and towns downstream from Paris are expected to be affected in the coming days. A number of flood gauges are installed along the river, and the one at the Pont d'Austerlitz is often quoted. Itis normal for this time of year for the water level to rise by one or two metres,,externalthe Franceinfo website reports. A statue of a French soldier from the Crimean War - known as The Zouave - on the Pont de l'Alma has also long been used as a marker for water levels in the city. On Saturday afternoon, the water was still well below his waist; during the historically bad floods of 1910, when the city was submerged for two months, it reached his neck.

Greening says 'wrong' to scrap student grants,"Justine Greening says maintenance grants should be reinstated for poorer students Former education secretary Justine Greening says maintenance grants for poorer students in England should be reinstated, after being scrapped by the government last year. Ms Greening, removed in the cabinet reshuffle, also raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts. She said that any student finance system needed to be ""progressive"". Prime Minister Theresa May has announced a major review of tuition fees and university funding. But, Ms Greening, speaking onBBC Radio 4's Today programme,said she was against the idea of different levels of fees for different courses, because it could push poorer students into cheaper, less prestigious degrees. Her successor as education secretary, Damian Hinds, is expected to launch a review of student finance in England. There been claims that Ms Greening had been reluctant to have a review - but she said that she had been wary of anything that became an excuse to kick changes ""into the long grass"". This video can not be played Justine Greening says a review of student fees could kick issues into the ""long grass"" Ms Greening said students were worried about the level of interest charges - currently 6.1% - and that the loss of maintenance grants put an unfair burden on the poorest students. These grants were abolished from 2016-17 and replaced by loans, which have to be repaid with interest. Ms Greening said that it was ""wrong"" that as a result of this, ""young people from more disadvantaged, poorer backgrounds are coming out with more debt than their better-off peers"". Tuition fee decision waiting for Damian Hinds, new education secretary What is going to happen next with tuition fees? 10 charts showing the impact of tuition fees Are tuition fees really heading for the scrap heap? In terms of the tuition fees system, she argued in favour of a ""time-limited graduate contribution"" with the money being ring-fenced for higher education. The forthcoming review of tuition fees will have to consider issues such as whether fees should be reduced or lowered, the interest charges on loans, cross-subsidies between subjects and the availability of support for poorer students. The Department for Education says that replacing maintenance grants with loans has given poorer students more ""cash-in-hand support"". A DFE spokeswoman says that the current system provides ""sustainable funding"" for universities, maintains access for students and supports repayment arrangements which are ""fair to both graduates and taxpayers"". Labour has campaigned for the scrapping of tuition fees and the restoration of maintenance grants. The shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Justine Greening is absolutely right that her own party's decision to abolish maintenance grants was wrong and that it is the most disadvantaged families and students who have suffered."" She said that without any timetable for the review, students would still face ""huge fees"" to go to university. The challenges facing universities in 2018 Should tuition fees be cut to Â£3,000?

EU agrees Brexit 'transition' stance,"Chief negotiator Michel Barnier set out the EU's negotiating stance for the transition period The European Union has set out its demands for the temporary transition period after the UK leaves in March 2019. The EU wants the UK to continue to follow its rules but not be involved in making decisions. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK wanted a ""right to object"" to new laws passed by the EU during this time. Downing Street said there would ""naturally"" be differences between the sides ahead of negotiations. Reality Check: What's the EU's transition stance? Brexit bill flawed, peers say The UK hopes the two sides can reach agreement by March. The transition period - also referred to as an implementation period - is seen as a way to minimise disruption when the UK leaves the EU for things like business, holidaymakers and security. It will also allow more time to finalise the terms of the UK's post-Brexit relations with the EU. In their guidelines, the EU say: Transition should run from Brexit in March 2019 to 31 December 2020 All EU rules and regulations - as well as EU rule changes adopted after March 2019 - should apply in the UK during the transition phase There can be no ""cherry picking"" on the single market - so free movement into the UK should continue The UK will not be involved in the decision-making of EU bodies It cannot implement its own international agreements unless the EU agrees Work should continue on finding a solution to the Northern Ireland border question, one of the main sticking points in the first round of negotiations Speaking at a press conference after EU ministers agreed the negotiating guidelines, chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK would be allowed to attend decision-making meetings on a ""limited, exceptional, case  by case basis."" It would be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries but the deals could not come into force until the transition period was over, he added. This is in line with the UK's negotiating stance, as set out by Mr Davis in a speech on Friday. May urged to 'see off' hard Brexiteers Brexit: All you need to know Mr Davis also said existing international agreements - which include trade deals with other countries and agreements on aviation and nuclear power - should continue to apply during the period. Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee on Monday, Mr Davis said the UK wanted a ""right to object"" to new laws passed by the EU during the transition phase over which it had no say and disagreed with. ""It's not particularly democratic practice to just have the country accept without any say-so, anything - particularly if... the European Union takes it on itself to do something which is actively disadvantageous to a major British industry or something like that,"" he said. ""So that's why we've raised the matter, and let's see how it goes."" Asked what legal status this would have, he said he wanted such a safeguard included in the withdrawal agreement. It's the sort of amazing coincidence that the Brexit process throws up all the time. Minutes after the Brexit Secretary David Davis laid out his concerns about the EU's transition proposals to a House of Lords Committee, Michel Barnier held a press conference where he knocked them down. For example, David Davis wants a mechanism where the UK has a say on new European laws that might affect Britain while it's not in the club but still subject to the rules. The best Mr Barnier was prepared to offer was consultation ""on an exceptional, case-by-case basis agreed by the 27 remaining member states"". And don't dare call it anything as grand as ""observer status"", he warned. He dismissed the Brexit secretary's demands that Britain be allowed to negotiate trade deals with other countries during the transition period. Of course they can, Mr Barnier said. In fact, Britain had better get a move on if it wants to replicate the 750 international agreements that come with EU membership. True, this is the start of a negotiation but it is not clear that the EU sees anything to negotiate. Mr Barnier feels that he has already made the UK a generous offer that's in Britain's economic interest. Plus, there was a reminder that the deal on the transition period is linked to a deal on everything else: no agreement on a final Brexit treaty means no transition. Some in the UK are unhappy at the idea that the UK will have to follow the rules of the single market and the customs union, including freedom of movement for EU citizens, but will lose its voting rights. Mrs May's Brexit ''inner circle'' of senior ministers met in sub-committee on Monday morning to discuss how the transitional phase could work, including the UK's demand that it be free to negotiate trade deals with other countries during the period. Earlier a Downing Street spokesman said: ''There is obviously going to be a negotiation on what the implementation period looks like. ''The formal directives will be released this afternoon.

"EU agrees Brexit 'transition' stanceEuropean ministers meet to finalise their guidelines for a proposed Brexit ""transition"" period.1h36 minutes agoUK Politics","Chief negotiator Michel Barnier set out the EU's negotiating stance for the transition period The European Union has set out its demands for the temporary transition period after the UK leaves in March 2019. The EU wants the UK to continue to follow its rules but not be involved in making decisions. Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK wanted a ""right to object"" to new laws passed by the EU during this time. Downing Street said there would ""naturally"" be differences between the sides ahead of negotiations. Reality Check: What's the EU's transition stance? Brexit bill flawed, peers say The UK hopes the two sides can reach agreement by March. The transition period - also referred to as an implementation period - is seen as a way to minimise disruption when the UK leaves the EU for things like business, holidaymakers and security. It will also allow more time to finalise the terms of the UK's post-Brexit relations with the EU. In their guidelines, the EU say: Transition should run from Brexit in March 2019 to 31 December 2020 All EU rules and regulations - as well as EU rule changes adopted after March 2019 - should apply in the UK during the transition phase There can be no ""cherry picking"" on the single market - so free movement into the UK should continue The UK will not be involved in the decision-making of EU bodies It cannot implement its own international agreements unless the EU agrees Work should continue on finding a solution to the Northern Ireland border question, one of the main sticking points in the first round of negotiations Speaking at a press conference after EU ministers agreed the negotiating guidelines, chief negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK would be allowed to attend decision-making meetings on a ""limited, exceptional, case  by case basis."" It would be able to negotiate trade deals with other countries but the deals could not come into force until the transition period was over, he added.

Giving evidence to a House of Lords committee on Monday, Mr Davis said the UK wanted a ""right to object"" to new laws passed by the EU during the transition phase over which it had no say and disagreed with. ""It's not particularly democratic practice to just have the country accept without any say-so, anything - particularly if... the European Union takes it on itself to do something which is actively disadvantageous to a major British industry or something like that,"" he said. ""So that's why we've raised the matter, and let's see how it goes."" Asked what legal status this would have, he said he wanted such a safeguard included in the withdrawal agreement. It's the sort of amazing coincidence that the Brexit process throws up all the time. Minutes after the Brexit Secretary David Davis laid out his concerns about the EU's transition proposals to a House of Lords Committee, Michel Barnier held a press conference where he knocked them down. For example, David Davis wants a mechanism where the UK has a say on new European laws that might affect Britain while it's not in the club but still subject to the rules. The best Mr Barnier was prepared to offer was consultation ""on an exceptional, case-by-case basis agreed by the 27 remaining member states"". And don't dare call it anything as grand as ""observer status"", he warned. He dismissed the Brexit secretary's demands that Britain be allowed to negotiate trade deals with other countries during the transition period. Of course they can, Mr Barnier said. In fact, Britain had better get a move on if it wants to replicate the 750 international agreements that come with EU membership. True, this is the start of a negotiation but it is not clear that the EU sees anything to negotiate. Mr Barnier feels that he has already made the UK a generous offer that's in Britain's economic interest. Plus, there was a reminder that the deal on the transition period is linked to a deal on everything else: no agreement on a final Brexit treaty means no transition.

Window cleaner saves defaced Banksy,"The damaged mural (top) and after the whitewash had been removed (bottom) A defaced mural by the graffiti artist Banksy on a disused bridge in Hull has been saved by a window cleaner. The stencilled design depicts a child carrying a wooden sword with a pencil attached to the end, under the text ""draw the raised bridge!"" The mural on Scott Street, Wincolmlee, was whitewashed on Sunday night but Jason Fanthorpe used water and white spirit to partly restore the image. Hull City Council has since installed a large protective cover over the work. More from East Yorkshire Mr Fanthorpe said he ""could not just sit back and not try to help"" after seeing the mural had been damaged. ""I was just going to bed when I'd seen that it had been painted over, and someone had said it was still wet,"" he said. ""Banksy, love him or hate him, has international prestige and he'd gifted the city with his art."" A protective screen was installed over the mural on Monday morning The window cleaner already had his ladders and other equipment prepared for his Monday morning shift, so he headed straight to the bridge in an attempt to save the mural. He said: ""I tried with just pure water at first, on one tiny corner, desperate not to destroy the underlying art. But it was not shifting so had to use white spirit."" A number of people also turned up overnight to help with the cleaning, Mr Fanthorpe added. A steady stream of people have been visiting the street to take photos of the mural after images of it were shared on Banksy's verified Instagram account on Friday. Hull City Council said the protective layer has been added ""to prevent further damage"". ""This temporary measure will help to ensure that the public can continue to enjoy the work,"" a spokesperson said. Hundreds of people have visited the mural on Scott Street since it appeared Staff at the Whalebone pub, yards away from the mural, told the BBC they have met people from Bristol and Manchester who have travelled to Hull specifically to see the artwork. Chris Fenton went to the site earlier after hearing about the damage. ""Why would someone do that? What was the reason,"" he said.

EasyJet boss in pay cut over equality,"EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren is reducing his salary by Â£34,000 to match that of his predecessor Carolyn McCall. Mr Lundgren's starting annual salary was Â£740,000, while Ms McCall was on Â£706,000 when she left the budget airline in November. He was previously a deputy chief executive at travel group Tui. EasyJet was ""absolutely committed"" to giving equal pay and equal opportunity for women and men, said Mr Lundgren. ""To show my personal commitment I have asked the board to reduce my pay to match that of Carolyn's when she was at EasyJet,"" he added. ""I also want to affirm my own commitment to address the gender imbalance in our pilot community which drives our overall gender pay gap."" The gender pay gap in EasyJet is currently 51.7%, but the budget airline says this is not because of unequal pay for women. Salaries for pilots and cabin crew are collectively agreed with unions and both men and women are paid the same. The gender pay gap comes in because there are far fewer female pilots than male pilots in the industry as a whole - only 4% of commercial pilots are women, and only 5% of EasyJet's pilots are women. The budget carrier has set a target that 20% of new pilots should be female by 2020, up from 6% in 2015. Earlier this month,EasyJet reported a 14.4% jump in revenuesto Â£1.1bn for the three months to 31 December, with passenger numbers up 8% to 18.8 million in the period.

Carillion 'wriggled out' of obligations,"Carillion ""wriggled out"" of payments into its company pension schemes as its troubles grew, while it carried on paying shareholder dividends and bosses' bonuses, say MPs. The Work and Pensions Committee is questioning the way pension investments were managed at the collapsed outsourcing giant. The schemes overall are in deficit. But last year contributions to the pension funds were deferred until 2019, to help shore up the firm's finances. The committee has published a letter from Robin Ellison, chairman of trustees of Carillion's pension scheme, giving an account of the last few years and suggesting they have been left with a funding shortfall of around Â£990m. The letter shows that pension trustees were ""kept in the dark"" about the state of Carillion's finances until late last year, the committee argues, and that dividends and bonuses were paid out at the expense of pension fund contributions. On Monday,the Financial Reporting Council, the UK's accountancy watchdog, said it would launch an investigation,externalinto KPMG's audit of Carillion's financial results between 2014 and 2016 as well as the work it carried out during 2017. The FRC said the probe would ""consider whether the auditor has breached any relevant requirements, in particular the ethical and technical standards for auditors"". It will examine KPMG's audit work on areas including estimates and recognition of revenue on significant contracts and accounting for pensions. KPMG said it believed that ""we conducted our role as Carillion's auditor appropriately and responsibly"", adding that it would co-operate fully with the FRC's investigation. Frank Field, chairman of the Work and Pensions Committee said: ""It's clear that Carillion has been trying to wriggle out of its obligations to its pensioners for the last 10 years."" Mr Ellison will appear in person to answer questions from committee members later this week as pressure grows on those involved to explain why the pension funds' shortfall was allowed to widen sharply as the company's difficulties worsened. Carillion, which manages a huge variety of public sector and private projects around the UK, from rebuilding Battersea Power Station to cleaning prisons, collapsed under a growing mountain of debt two weeks ago. The firm was a conglomerate, incorporating parts of several previously independent firms including Tarmac, Wimpey, Mowlem and Alfred McAlpine. As a result its employees, past employees and pensioners are members of more than a dozen different pension schemes. Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink? The signals that Carillion was going bust Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened Mr Ellison, who oversees six of the firm's defined benefit pension schemes, said in his letter to MPs that the company repeatedly cited ""constraints in cash flow"" prior to 2017, as the reason they could not make higher pension contributions. The letter states that after Carillion published its first profit warning in July, and its share price began to slide dramatically, the pension trustees engaged with Carillion ""to understand what the profit warning meant for the schemes, and also began regular and close dialogue with the Pension Regulator."" In September 2017, the company requested that pension contributions be deferred altogether. Mr Ellison's letter explains the trustees agreed to a deferral, since that appeared to be a prerequisite for banks committing more funding for the troubled company. Mr Field criticised the conduct of both the trustees and the regulator, pointing out that Carillion continued to pay out more than Â£70m in annual dividends. However, there are no rules preventing companies from paying out dividends while running a pension deficit and company directors would argue that dividends are important in making a firm attractive to investors. Carillion has also been criticised for the bonuses and severance pay it was paying to senior managers, althoughthose were blocked following the firm's demise. ""The purported cash flow problems did of course not prevent them shelling out dividends and handsome pay packets for those at the top,"" said Mr Field. ""This culminated in negotiating deficit contributions away entirely last autumn to enable more borrowing. ""Remarkably, this was endorsed by the trustees and the Pensions Regulator. However, pensions expert Tom McPhail of Hargreaves Lansdown said the trustees should not be judged too harshly for agreeing the deferral. ""They had to make a judgement call whether to continue to work with the employer or effectively pull the plug and accept the consequences could be they would precipitate the collapse of the business,"" he said. ""That gamble did not pay off but they were doing what they thought was in the best interests of pension scheme members."" A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said it had been ""working proactively"" to protect pension member benefits for several years. ""The current regulatory framework attempts to balance the needs of a scheme and its members with the needs of an employer to invest in their ongoing business,"" the spokesperson said. The Pensions Regulator said information available before July 2017 ""did not highlight sufficient concern"" to justify them stepping in. A spokesperson for David Chapman, the official receiver, responsible for overseeing Carillion's liquidation process, said: ""The official receiver will be investigating the actions of the directors of the company prior to liquidation, with regard to all the affairs of the company. ""If there was any inappropriate behaviour then he does have the ability to seek further action."" Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink?

The myth of the 2017 'youthquake' election,"A surge in youth turnout has often been cited as the reason for Labour's unexpectedly strong performance in the 2017 election. The trouble is, it seems there was no such ""youthquake"", write members of the British Election Study team. After the surprise of the Conservatives losing their majority in the June 2017 general election, people started looking for an explanation. One theory quickly came to prominence: Jeremy Corbyn had enthused previously disengaged young voters, who turned out in droves to vote Labour. Certainly, Mr Corbyn appears to be popular with young people - he is often pictured surrounded by young supporters and that summer's Glastonbury Festival echoed to chants of ""Oh, Jeremy Corbyn"". Opinion polls lent weight to the idea - one polling organisation suggested that turnout among 18 to 24-year-olds went up by as much as 16 percentage points, another suggested an increase of 12 points. The youth mobilisation explanation came to be seen as a fact and the Oxford English Dictionary even declared ""youthquake"" - a political awakening among millennial voters - its word of the year. But we now know there was no surge in youth turnout. Since 1964, the gold standard measure of electoral behaviour in Britain has been the British Election Study's face-to-face survey. Newly released results using this data show that there was very little change in turnout by age group,externalbetween the 2015 and 2017 elections. Younger voters were still much less likely to vote, older voters much more so. The graph below shows the predicted probability of turning out in the election, by age. Among the youngest voters, the margin of error means that we cannot rule out a small increase - or decrease - in 2017. In both years, turnout among the youngest voters was between 40% and 50%. That there was no surge in youth turnout should probably not be as surprising as it is. Everything we know about turnout suggests that voting is ""sticky"" - most people who vote in one election will go on to vote at subsequent elections, and most people who abstain will continue to do so. We also know that older people are more likely to vote than young people - something that has always been the case in Britain and other countries. Overall turnout did go up in 2017, but only by 2.5 percentage points. All of this suggests that large, sudden, and unexpected shifts in the age-turnout relationship are very unlikely. The idea that there was a surge in youth turnout may reflect a belief that politicians achieve success because of what they set out to do. In this case, increasing youth turnout was part of Mr Corbyn's political strategy. As Labour did unexpectedly well, it was not unreasonable to form the view that the strategy paid off. In a sense it did: Labour was more popular among young people than old people in 2017 and its share of the youth vote did increase. But winning the support of more of the young people who vote is not the same as a surge in youth turnout. It is also worth pointing out that in 2017 Labour's popularity increased among all ages, except for those over 70. Among older age groups there was also a big shift in the probability of voting Conservative, as many UKIP voters switched following the Brexit referendum. Another reason the idea of a surge in youth turnout took hold is that the constituency-level data appeared to support the claim. However, drawing conclusions about the behaviour of individuals from this bigger picture is risky. We can see this at work with the change in turnout between 2015 and 2017. Turnout did go up in constituencies with more young voters. For every percentage point increase in 18 to 29-year-olds living in a constituency, turnout went up by 0.1 percentage points compared with 2015. However, this relationship is not as straightforward as it appears. For every percentage point increase in nought to four-year-olds living in a constituency, turnout went up by 0.9 percentage points. Few people, it is probably safe to say, think that turnout went up in 2017 because of a sudden surge in the number of toddlers voting. Six key lessons from a surprise result Which issues really decided the election? What caused Labour's youth vote surge? Reality Check: Did Jeremy Corbyn have youth on his side? What this relationship is showing, of course, is not that turnout went up among toddlers, but that turnout went up in the sorts of places with lots of toddlers. The same is true of the relationship between the number of young adults and turnout. There was a slight increase in turnout in the sorts of places with lots of young adults. But it was not necessarily those young adults doing the extra turning out. Older people were still more likely to vote than younger people So how did people get it so wrong? One reason is that measuring turnout in surveys is tricky - and people who don't vote also tend to be more reluctant to take part in them. This means we can end up with too many voters in surveys, which become insufficiently representative of the general population as a result. Second, some people will tell you they voted when they actually didn't. Third, many surveys are conducted over the phone or internet, again attracting more people who are likely to vote. The British Election Study face-to-face survey is designed to be as representative of the country as possible - including people who didn't vote in the election. People are chosen randomly from thousands of addresses across the country and doors are knocked until as many of those selected as possible participate. And people's survey answers about turnout are verified by the checks against the marked electoral register. Of course, the BES face-to-face survey isn't perfect, but the results are as close to the truth about who turned out to vote as we can get. This analysis piece was commissioned by the BBC from experts working for an outside organisation. Dr Chris Prosser, Prof Ed Fieldhouse, Prof Jane Green, Dr Jon Mellon (all University of Manchester), and Prof Geoff Evans (University of Oxford) are members of theBritish Election Study,externalTeam.

German row over exhaust tests on humansThe German government is outraged over reported tests of diesel fumes on humans and monkeys.1m2 minutes agoEurope,"German carmakers have already been hit by a damaging scandal over cheating in emissions tests The German government has denounced experiments funded by German carmakers in which humans and monkeys reportedly inhaled diesel exhaust fumes. German media say the health impact research was done by EUGT, a body funded by Volkswagen, Daimler and BMW. Such tests could not be justified, the government said, demanding details. A minister called them ""abominable"". Daimler also condemned them. VW is embroiled in a scandal over software that gave false diesel exhaust data. In 2015 VW admitted having fitted ""cheat"" devices in the US that made their engines appear less polluting than they actually were. Car firms are trying to reduce losses from bad publicity about diesel fumes EUGT was dissolved by the carmakers last year. The initials stand for European Research Group on Environment and Health in the Transport Sector. ""These tests on monkeys or even humans cannot be justified ethically in any way,"" said Chancellor Angela Merkel's spokesman, Steffen Seibert. Environment Minister Barbara Hendricks called the experiments ""abominable"" and expressed shock that scientists had agreed to conduct them. Social Democrat politician Stephan Weil - a VW supervisory board member - called them ""absurd and abhorrent"". ""Lobbying can be no excuse whatsoever for such testing,"" he said. On Thursdaythe New York Times reported that the EUGT research was designed to counter a 2012 decision by the World Health Organization,externalto classify diesel exhaust as a carcinogen. It said that in 2014, EUGT had exposed 10 monkeys to fumes - in an air-tight chamber - from several cars, including a diesel VW Beetle. The testing took place at a lab in Albuquerque, New Mexico. Then at the weekend Germany's Stuttgarter Zeitung and SWR radio reported that 19 men and six women had inhaled diesel fumes in another EUGT experiment. During a month of tests at a lab in Aachen, west Germany, they were exposed to various concentrations of diesel fumes, which contain toxic nitrogen oxides (NOx). The BBC has not seen the study itself, but German media say it was published in 2016. At the time the carmakers were arguing that modern technology had cut pollution from diesel engines to safe levels. But VW was later found to have fitted ""cheat"" devices that rigged the emissions data. The Aachen University Clinic said its ""ethically approved"" human tests had ""no link"" to the VW emissions scandal. Read more on the diesel emissions scandal: VW emissions cheat bill hits $30bn How toxic is your car exhaust? Volkswagen: The scandal explained Daimler, manufacturer of Mercedes-Benz cars, said on Sunday ""we are appalled by the extent of the [EUGT] studies and their implementation"".,external""We condemn the experiments in the strongest terms."" Reacting to the NYT report about the monkey experiments,VW tweeted on Saturday that it ""explicitly distances itself clearly from all forms of animal abuse"".,external ""We know that the scientific methods used by EUGT were wrong and apologise sincerely for this."" VW's supervisory board says it will conduct a full investigation, calling the experiments ""utterly incomprehensible"". A new study by a German car specialist, Ferdinand DudenhÃ¶ffer, says levels of pollution from diesel cars are still too high in 10 German cities, so the vehicles are likely to be banned from the pollution hotspots unless engines are upgraded. According to his research, vehicle software upgrades would not be enough to address the problem. Munich, Stuttgart, Hamburg, DÃ¼sseldorf and Cologne are among the cities with serious pollution hotspots. The German government thinks so. VW apologised and Daimler said ""the EUGT's approach contradicts our values and ethical principles"". Two independent scientists who have conducted air pollution tests on human volunteers told the BBC that the company sponsorship in the German case was problematic. ""If the research is not independent then there would be doubt about its validity and it would therefore not be ethical,"" said Prof Frank Kelly of King's College London. He said hundreds of volunteers had participated in state-funded studies on the impact of diesel exhaust - studies which required prior ethical approval.In one study by the college, volunteers with chronic lung or heart conditions walked down London's busy Oxford Street and through Hyde Park.,external ""Experimenting on people or monkeys is not inherently unethical,"" said Dr Chris Carlsten of Canada's University of British Columbia. He said it was ""not very common"" to do air pollution tests on monkeys, though some had been used in ozone impact studies. He has studied the effects of diesel exhaust on volunteers, who are paid about C$14 hourly (Â£8; $11) for two hours of exposure at a time.,externalThe diluted exhaust exposure is similar to the level experienced in Beijing, he said. ""These studies are essential to back up policies that protect all of us,"" he said. Are diesel cars always the most harmful?

Fatal shooting police in misconduct probe,"Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood, left, and Det Ch Insp Robert Cousen have been or will be interviewed under caution Two senior Manchester police officers are being investigated for alleged gross misconduct over evidence given to an inquiry into the fatal shooting of an unarmed man, the BBC has learned. Assistant Chief Constable Steve Heywood, who authorised the operation in which Anthony Grainger died, and Det Ch Insp Robert Cousen have been or will be interviewed under caution. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is behind the probe. Mr Grainger died in Cheshire in 2012. The father of twowas shot dead by a Greater Manchester Police (GMP) officerthrough the windscreen of an Audi in a car park in Culcheth, on 3 March 2012. The 36-year-old was under observation amid suspicions he was part of a gang conspiring to commit armed robberies. The BBC understands the IOPC investigation is examining evidence ACC Heywood gave to the inquiry regarding notes in a firearms logbook. Anthony Grainger was shot dead in 2012 by police who believed he was planning an armed robbery The notes appeared be a contemporaneous record of what happened in the days before Mr Grainger's death, as the police operation was planned. However, the inquiry heard it was likely some of the notes had been written after the shooting, leading to claims they gave a ""false impression"" of intelligence. The BBC has been told the matters are so serious there is the potential for criminal investigations into the actions of the two senior GMP officers. The two men have now been formally served with gross misconduct notices. The IOPC said this did not mean they necessarily had a case to answer, but rather informed them their conduct was under investigation and confirmed ""the level of severity"". ACC Heywood has not returned to work since he gave evidence at the inquiry chaired by Judge Thomas Teague QC last March. Det Ch Insp Cousen was the senior investigating officer on the operation which led to Mr Grainger's death. Assistant Chief Constable Heywood said he ""would never knowingly mislead a court of inquiry"" ACC Heywood admitted to the inquiry there were ""some flaws"" in his record-keeping and ""apologised unreservedly"" for them. But he strongly denied deliberately misleading the inquiry. ""This was not any great conspiracy from Greater Manchester Police,"" he told the hearing. ""This is my personal failing as a firearms commander for not doing the paperwork."" The IOPC investigation regards these matters as so serious that criminal investigations could follow. It is not yet known when Judge Teague will publish his inquiry's findings.

Children could get grooming 'alerts',"This video can not be played Minister Matt Hancock tells BBC Breakfast both government and social media companies can do more. Children at risk of online grooming should be sent automatic alerts as part of the government's internet safety strategy, the NSPCC has said. The children's charity said existing algorithms could be used to flag suspected groomers to moderators. A ""staggering"" 1,316 offences were recorded in the first six months of a new child grooming law being introduced last year in England and Wales. Minister Matt Hancock said he would be robust with social media companies. The minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the government was working on making the UK the safest place in the world to go online and that can and ""must"" include grooming alerts. He told BBC Breakfast that as a father of three young children it was something that ""really mattered"" to him. Posing as a schoolgirl to expose online groomers Father's warning after son was groomed online Before the new offence of sexual communication with a child was introduced in April, police could not intervene until groomers attempted to meet their targets face-to-face. Of the cases recorded, the youngest victim was a seven-year-old girl, although girls aged between 12 and 15 were the most likely to be targeted by predators. Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were the most common sites used by offenders, making up 63% of all incidents. The NSPCC, which campaigned to bring in the new legislation, has criticised social media companies for not making the most of the technology they already use to enforce the law. Algorithms - the calculations that tell computers what to do - are currently used by social media companies to flag up images of child abuse, hate speech and extremist material. The charity said the same techniques should be used to pick up ""grooming language"" and then send an automatic alert to both the child and moderators. By Chris Baraniuk, BBC Technology Reporter Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were the most common sites used by offenders Automatically identifying malicious or illegal content is something that social networks already do, in some measure. For example, give a machine learning system thousands of nude pictures and it can, much of the time, go on to pick out new examples of nude pictures in the future. However, the specifics of these algorithms are closely guarded secrets - companies like Facebook don't like competitors to know too much about content filtering, or that they have established a certain way of doing things that they may later decide to change. Butconcerns over how much these sites are doingto tackle problematic material are not new. While Facebook already does some work in identifying grooming behaviour, social networks in general may be reluctant to take on too much responsibility in this area. Should any new anti-child predator system be shown to have failings or loopholes, they could face even greater criticism. Tony Stower, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, said that despite the ""staggering number of offences"", government and social networks are not properly working together to stop this crime from happening. ""Government's Internet Safety Strategy must require social networks to build in technology to keep their young users safe, rather than relying on police to step in once harm has already been done,"" he said. The NSPCC said an existing voluntary code of practice does not go far enough and has called for a mandatory code to be put in place. Meanwhile Facebook said it was already using technology to identify grooming behaviour. Vera Baird, victim affairs lead at the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said she expected the number of cases to be higher given the ""endemic"" scale of online grooming. She said alerts are ""imperative"" to prevention, but should be accompanied by sex and relationships education so that children know how to respond to such a warning. The Home Office said Â£20m was spent pursuing grooming offenders in 2017. School Snapchat 'grooming' investigated Anti-grooming work to stop paedophiles Young children groomed on Periscope.

Greening backs return of student grants,"Justine Greening says maintenance grants should be reinstated for poorer students Former education secretary Justine Greening says maintenance grants for poorer students in England should be reinstated, after being scrapped by the government last year. Ms Greening, removed in the cabinet reshuffle, also raised concerns about the level of interest on student debts. She said that any student finance system needed to be ""progressive"". Prime Minister Theresa May has announced a major review of tuition fees and university funding. But, Ms Greening, speaking onBBC Radio 4's Today programme,said she was against the idea of different levels of fees for different courses, because it could push poorer students into cheaper, less prestigious degrees. Her successor as education secretary, Damian Hinds, is expected to launch a review of student finance in England. There been claims that Ms Greening had been reluctant to have a review - but she said that she had been wary of anything that became an excuse to kick changes ""into the long grass"". This video can not be played Justine Greening says a review of student fees could kick issues into the ""long grass"" Ms Greening said students were worried about the level of interest charges - currently 6.1% - and that the loss of maintenance grants put an unfair burden on the poorest students. These grants were abolished from 2016-17 and replaced by loans, which have to be repaid with interest. Ms Greening said that it was ""wrong"" that as a result of this, ""young people from more disadvantaged, poorer backgrounds are coming out with more debt than their better-off peers"". Tuition fee decision waiting for Damian Hinds, new education secretary What is going to happen next with tuition fees? 10 charts showing the impact of tuition fees Are tuition fees really heading for the scrap heap? In terms of the tuition fees system, she argued in favour of a ""time-limited graduate contribution"" with the money being ring-fenced for higher education. The forthcoming review of tuition fees will have to consider issues such as whether fees should be reduced or lowered, the interest charges on loans, cross-subsidies between subjects and the availability of support for poorer students. The Department for Education says that replacing maintenance grants with loans has given poorer students more ""cash-in-hand support"". A DFE spokeswoman says that the current system provides ""sustainable funding"" for universities, maintains access for students and supports repayment arrangements which are ""fair to both graduates and taxpayers"". Labour has campaigned for the scrapping of tuition fees and the restoration of maintenance grants. The shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said: ""Justine Greening is absolutely right that her own party's decision to abolish maintenance grants was wrong and that it is the most disadvantaged families and students who have suffered."" She said that without any timetable for the review, students would still face ""huge fees"" to go to university. The challenges facing universities in 2018 Should tuition fees be cut to Â£3,000?

EasyJet boss cuts pay to match predecessor,"EasyJet's chief executive Johan Lundgren is reducing his salary by Â£34,000 to match that of his predecessor Carolyn McCall. Mr Lundgren's starting annual salary was Â£740,000, while Ms McCall was on Â£706,000 when she left the budget airline in November. He was previously a deputy chief executive at travel group Tui. EasyJet was ""absolutely committed"" to giving equal pay and equal opportunity for women and men, said Mr Lundgren. ""To show my personal commitment I have asked the board to reduce my pay to match that of Carolyn's when she was at EasyJet,"" he added. ""I also want to affirm my own commitment to address the gender imbalance in our pilot community which drives our overall gender pay gap."" The gender pay gap in EasyJet is currently 51.7%, but the budget airline says this is not because of unequal pay for women. Salaries for pilots and cabin crew are collectively agreed with unions and both men and women are paid the same. The gender pay gap comes in because there are far fewer female pilots than male pilots in the industry as a whole - only 4% of commercial pilots are women, and only 5% of EasyJet's pilots are women. The budget carrier has set a target that 20% of new pilots should be female by 2020, up from 6% in 2015. Earlier this month,EasyJet reported a 14.4% jump in revenuesto Â£1.1bn for the three months to 31 December, with passenger numbers up 8% to 18.8 million in the period.

Two UK skiers die in French Alps fall,"Two British skiers have fallen to their deaths while on holiday in the French Alps. It is believed that the 25-year-olds slipped before falling several hundred metres while off-piste in the Chamonix-Mont-Blanc region. A third skier - also British - raised the alarm on Sunday morning. Mountain rescue services arrived at the scene within 10 minutes of being alerted but the two men were pronounced dead at the scene. A spokesman for Le Peloton de Gendarmerie de Haute Montagne said: ""The deceased were skiing off-piste but the route is very well-known and is popular with skiers."" He described conditions as ""very unfavourable"" and said the ""snow was very compacted and very icy"", adding that both Britons were believed to have slipped and fallen ""several hundred metres to their deaths"".

Fear over trusted trade website profiles,"Handyman profiles were opened on the Rated People and MyBuilder websites to advertise for business Fraudulent tradespeople can advertise their services on two trusted trade websites without any experience, a BBC Inside Out investigation has found. After setting up a website and email address, a reporter gained a handyman profile on Rated People and MyBuilder. He was also able to pretend to be one of his customers and submitted glowing reviews for extra credibility. MyBuilder said it would review its processes, with Rated People calling its screening methods a ""top priority"". The websites provide a network of people or companies offering a variety of services including plumbing, roofing, bricklaying and landscape gardening. Users can filter results by their location and can also read reviews and ratings posted by the tradesperson's previous customers. While several similar sites required a face-to-face meeting, references or proof of public liability insurance, the reporter was able to start advertising as a handyman on the two websites with relative ease. Rated People did not ask for references, insurance or request any quality checks and MyBuilder's property maintenance questionnaire was passed by searching the internet for the correct answers. Phillip Norton: From BBC reporter to wannabe handyman I was incredibly surprised by just how easy it was to get signed up and how simple it was to award myself a reliable-looking five star rating and positive feedback. With the help of friends and false email addresses, I could set up fake work, apply for it, and build myself a trustworthy profile without lifting a finger. With a website and rented business premises, we went to some lengths to make Inside and Out Property Services appear like a legitimate company. But it turned out very little of that was needed. Rated People and MyBuilder have both told the BBC they encourage property owners to do their own homework and check reviews before hiring. But many people turn to trustworthy trader websites thinking a large part of the homework has already been done - a belief for some that's proved to be an expensive mistake. Location, Location, Location presenter Phil Spencer, an ambassador for Rated People, said it was ""shocking to hear that some bad tradesmen get through the net"". David Ball, from Prescot, Merseyside, handed over Â£1,500 to a tradesman he found on the website to repair damp but he failed to treat the problem and is now ""nowhere to be seen"". ""I thought they had a process in place to make sure the people doing the jobs were trustworthy,"" Mr Ball said. ""You go through an external company because you think there's a level of protection there you're not getting if you're going direct."" The tradesman involved has since been removed from the service. The reporter was able to post positive reviews about his own company by setting up new email addresses Rated People said tradespeople looking to sign up were screened with a credit agency, fraud prevention agencies and it ""regularly reassesses all members"". Accreditation is required to be validated ""where official government accreditation is available"", but ""no formal qualifications or standards exist"" for a handyman, a spokesperson added. MyBuilder said it turned down 40% of all applications, with each trade category evaluated differently due to varying requirements. TV presenter Phil Spencer said it was 'really important that people do their homework' when it comes to tradespeople The handyman evaluation is ""the easiest to pass"" as jobs in the category are ""relatively low skilled and low risk"", including assembling flat pack furniture or hanging pictures. Despite this, the company said it would still be ""conducting a thorough review"" of its handyman evaluation following the BBC investigation.

Reality Check: Are pensions on the brink?,"The collapse of the construction firm Carillion is the latest high-profile failure of a company with a large pension deficit. Such cases may have raised concerns among workers generally over whether their employers' pension promise will be broken. They have also prompted debate over the future of workplace pensions. Workers with defined benefit (DB) pensions know exactly how much they will receive in retirement. Such schemes are based on either a worker's final salary or their career average earnings. Workers with defined contribution (DC) schemes save into a pension pot, which they can then use to buy a retirement income or cash-in subject to tax. The size of the pot depends on stock market performance. The chairman of trustees of Carillion's pension scheme, Robin Ellison, has suggested in a letter to a committee of MPs that there was a funding shortfall of around Â£990m with Carillion's defined benefit pension schemes by the end. This is higher than had generally been thought at the time of the company's collapse. A spokesperson for the Pensions Regulator said it had been ""working proactively"" to protect pension member benefits for several years. It said information available before July 2017 ""did not highlight sufficient concern"" over Carillion to justify the regulator stepping in. However, for Carillion to have such a deficit begs the question of whether all defined benefit schemes are in the red. The answer, provided by thePension Protection Fund's regular review of the sector,external, is that there are plenty of schemes in surplus. The latest figures show that there were 1,878 schemes in surplus, and 3,710 schemes in deficit at the end of last year. Collectively, these schemes had a total deficit of Â£103.8bn. This figure seems to be enormous, but it does fluctuate significantly, and it represents pensions that will be paid over decades. A major study by the Pensions and Lifetime Savings Association (PLSA), published in September, found most defined benefit schemes had a sustainable model for meeting future payouts. In other words, if they are in deficit, they still have an adequate plan to pay people their pensions in the future, for example by the employer putting more money into the pot. However, the PLSA said that three million savers in the remaining schemes had only a 50% chance of receiving the payouts they had been promised. In total, there are 11 million people in the UK with a defined benefit pension. The PLSA said there was a ""real possibility"" of a collapse for more high-profile pension schemes, and that one solution could be the pooling of resources into ""super-funds"", which would then have bigger investment opportunities. Pensions consultant John Ralfe has described the super-fund plan as ""outrageous"". He said there was ""no crisis in defined benefit pensions, so there is no need for crisis measures"". His confidence is based on the existence of the pensions ""lifeboat"" - the Pension Protection Fund (PPF). For the most part, the PPF steps in to pay defined benefit pensions but, for some, this may be less than they expected. Under this system: Anyone over pension age will receive their pension in full Pension payments related to employment from 5 April 1997 will rise in line with inflation, subject to a ceiling of 2.5%. Payments relating to employment before this date will not rise For workers under pension age, 90% of the pension will be paid, subject to a cap That cap is currently set by the government at Â£38,505, which equates to Â£34,655 when the 90% level is applied, per year. There aredifferent caps at different ages,external Future pension increases may also be lower than expected, not necessarily matching inflation Carillion had 14 defined benefit pension schemes, with 27,500 past and current workers receiving or set to receive payments from these schemes in retirement. All of those are in the process of transferring over to the PPF. Lots of commentators have pointed out that, while this places extra pressure on the PPF, it is in a good position to cope. The PPF's latest annual report showed that it had balance-sheet assets of Â£34bn. Start a new job now and it is highly unlikely that you will have access to a defined benefit pension scheme. Instead, workers will get a defined contribution pension, in a scheme usually run by the employer or by an insurance company. If the company goes bust, then the situation with these schemes should be simpler. The employer makes regular contributions to a worker's pension pot when that employee is paid. If the company goes bust, those contributions stop, as they would if the worker left their job. However, the pot is still in the employee's name and is still invested ready for their retirement. When the employee gets a new job, he or she will usually start a new pot.

"Prison pays pub worker Â£10,000 in error","The man has been paid more than Â£10,000 by the Prison Service, despite working for a pub chain A pub worker has been paid at least Â£10,000 for his ""job"" at Nottingham Prison - despite never working there. The man accepted a prison officer job but did not start his training. Despite this, he has been receiving a monthly wage for more than a year. The man believes it reflects ""severe mismanagement of the system"" at the prison, which has beendescribed as being in a ""dangerous state"". The Prison Service told the BBC it ""apologised for the error"". The would-be prison officer, who works as a deputy manager for a pub chain, said: ""What situation is Nottingham Prison in that they don't even know that somebody who is not working for them is still being paid? ""If I'm the only person it's still going to have cost them 20-odd thousand pounds a year [before tax] - but are there potentially more people? ""I would like to know how this has happened because as a taxpayer myself I don't want to know that my money has been wasted."" The pub worker has decided to stay in his current job after becoming aware of wider problems at Nottingham Prison The 28-year-old was due to start his prison officer training in December 2016 but deferred because his wife was ill. However, he received about Â£700 at the end of December, which he assumed was for two weeks' wages. Since then he has been paid between Â£1,200 and Â£1,600 at the end of every month. ""I think they were advertising about Â£21,000 or Â£22,000 a year at that point, so I presume after tax contributions that's what the outcome was,"" he said. 'Two suicide attempts a week' at prison Government warned over 'dangerous' jail What is going wrong with the prison system? In the meantime he has decided to stay in his current job after becoming aware of wider problems at the prison. He emailed evidence to the prison, seen by the BBC, to show he does not work for them. The BBC has also seen an email in which the prison's ""People Hub"" manager emailed various Ministry of Justice contacts about the error in March 2017. The Prison Service said it would resolve the problem after being notified by the BBC The pub manager says his extra salary has caused tax problems and he fears being accused of ""committing fraud or something"". After being contacted by the BBC, the Prison Service said it would sort it out. ""We apologise for this error and for the inconvenience caused,"" it said in a statement.

"Loyalist 'supergrass' jailed for six yearsState witness Gary Haggarty's sentence for 202 crimes, including five murders, was reduced from 35 years.4m5 minutes agoNorthern Ireland","Gary Haggarty, 45, was sentenced for more than 200 offences, including five murders A loyalist ""supergrass"" who admitted the murders of five people among hundreds of offences has had a 35-year jail term reduced to six-and-a-half years for helping the police. Gary Haggarty, 45, was a former leader of an Ulster Volunteer Force (UVF) unit in north Belfast. Haggarty was a paid police informer for 11 years. A judge said the offences were ""ones of exceptional gravity"" but that he had provided significant information. After turning state witness in 2009, Haggarty provided information on 55 loyalist murders and 20 attempted murders in the course of 1,015 police interviews. Gary Haggarty: Full list of charges Informer shot Catholic to hide double life Legal challenge over supergrass handlers However, only one man is to be prosecuted, for two murders, on the back of the evidence. The vast majority of people named by Haggarty in his police interviews will not face prosecution amid state concerns about a lack of supporting evidence. During the Troubles in Northern Ireland, the Ulster Volunteer Force murdered more than 500 people. The loyalist paramilitary group's campaign also claimed the lives of 33 people in bomb attacks in Dublin and Monaghan in 1974. Haggarty was a former commander of an Ulster Volunteer Force unit in the Mount Vernon area of north Belfast The organisation's name dates back to the Protestant force formed to oppose Home Rule in 1912. The name was revived in 1966 as loyalists came together to oppose liberal unionism and what it saw as a rise in Irish nationalism, centred on the 50th anniversary of the 1916 Easter Rising. The UVF's political wing, the Progressive Unionist Party, played a prominent role in the peace process and supported the 1998 Belfast Agreement. The judgement from Belfast Crown Court indicated that the 35-year jail term was reduced by 75% for the assistance given to prosecutors and then a further 25% for Haggarty's plea of guilty. The judge said that the 202 offences admitted by Haggarty had been committed during a ""terrorist campaign over a 16-year period"" between 1991 and 2007. He also noted that Haggarty's motivation for co-operating with prosecutors was ""self-interest and pragmatism"" rather than because he ""wishes to atone for his crimes"". However, his judgement added that Haggarty's assistance ""went beyond what might be described as 'normal' and, as a result of that assistance, the defendant has placed himself at considerable personal risk"". The judge said that Haggarty had provided ""a significant amount of information in relation to very serious criminal activity"". Keiran Fox said Haggarty had been 'allowed to kill at will' Keiran Fox, whose father, Eamon, was murdered by Haggarty, said he was a paid state informer who had been ""allowed to kill at will"". ""How can a man convicted of so many crimes be set free into society? He might come across as a a nice guy but the man's a serial killer,"" Mr Fox said. Haggarty admitted murdering: Catholic Sean McParland, who was shot while babysitting in Belfast in 1994 John Harbinson, a Protestant, who was handcuffed and beaten to death by a UVF gang on the Mount Vernon estate in north Belfast in May 1997 Catholic workmen Eamon Fox, 44, a father of six, and Gary Convie, 24, a father of one, shot dead as they had lunch together in a car in Belfast's North Queen Street in May 1994 Sean McDermott, a 37-year-old Catholic found shot dead in his car near Antrim in August 1994 He also admitted five attempted murders, including against police officers, 23 counts of conspiracy to murder and directing terrorism. The judge also took into consideration a further 301 lesser offences in his judgement.

Fitness tracker highlights military bases,"The movements of soldiers within Bagram air base - the largest US military facility in Afghanistan Security concerns have been raised after a fitness tracking firm showed the exercise routes of military personnel in bases around the world. Online fitness tracker Strava has published a ""heatmap"" showing the paths its users log as they run or cycle. It appears to show the structure of foreign military bases in countries including Syria and Afghanistan as soldiers move around them. The US military was examining the heatmap, a spokesman said. San Francisco-based Strava provides an app that uses a mobile phone's GPS to track a subscriber's exercise activity. It uses the collected data, as well as that from fitness devices such as Fitbit and Jawbone, to enable people to check their own performances and compare them with others. It says it has 27 million users around the world. The latest version of the heatmap was released by Strava in November last year,external. It is a data visualisation showing all of the activity of all of its users around the world. Strava says the newest version has been built from one billion activities - some three trillion points of data, covering 27 billion km (17bn miles) of distance run, jogged or swum. But it is not a live map. The data aggregates the activities recorded between 2015 and September 2017. That is thanks to Nathan Ruser, a 20-year-old Australian university student who is studying international security at the Australian National University and also works with the Institute for United Conflict Analysts.

He said he came across the map while browsing a cartography blog last week. It occurred to him that a large number of military personnel on active service had been publicly sharing their location data and realised that the highlighting of such exercises as regular jogging routes could be dangerous. ""I just looked at it and thought, 'oh hell, this should not be here - this is not good,'"" he told the BBC. ""I thought the best way to deal with it is to make the vulnerabilities known so they can be fixed. Someone would have noticed it at some point. I just happened to be the person who made the connection."" Although the location of military bases is generally well-known and satellite imagery can show the outline of buildings, the heatmap can reveal which of them are most used, or the routes taken by soldiers. Is that fitness tracker you're using a waste of money? The gadgets for keeping tabs on pets Has wearable tech had its day? It displays the level of activity - shown as more intense light - and the movement of personnel inside the walls. It also appears that location data has been tracked outside bases - which may show commonly used exercise routes or patrolled roads. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Ruser said he was shocked by how much detail he could see. ""You can establish a pattern of life,"" he said. By Jonathan Marcus, defence and diplomatic correspondent Many years ago, operational security was a relatively simple matter of not being physically overheard by the enemy. Think of the British WWII poster with the slogan ""Careless Talk Costs Lives"". Well, no more. Our modern electronic age means that we all move around with a number of ""signatures"";  we send and receive a variety of signals, all of which can be tracked. And as the episode with the exercise tracker shows, you do not need to be an American or Russian spy to be able to see and analyse these signals. Russian troops have been tracked in Ukraine or in Syria by studying their social media interactions or geo-location data from their mobile phone images. Each piece of evidence is a fragment, but when added together it could pose a significant risk to security - in this case highlighting the location of formerly secret bases or undisclosed patterns of military activity. The app is far more popular in the West than elsewhere and major cities are aglow with jogging routines. But in remote areas foreign military bases stand out as isolated ""hotspots"" and the activities of a single jogger can be illuminated on dark backgrounds. Exercise activities stand out in such countries as Syria, Yemen, Niger, Afghanistan and Djibouti, among others. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Neither is it just military personnel who could be affected, but also aid workers and NGO staffers in remoter areas too. Both state and non-state actors could use the data to their advantage. Yes. The settings available in Strava's app allow users to explicitly opt out of data collection for the heatmap - even for activities not marked as private - or to set up ""privacy zones"" in certain locations. Strava has not said much since the concerns were raised but it released a brief statement highlighting that the data used had been anonymised, and ""excludes activities that have been marked as private and user-defined privacy zones"".

In 2016, the US military banned Pokemon GO from government-issued mobile phones, An image of the Pentagon on the Strava heatmap showed no activity. The heatmap showed no data from inside the Pentagon The UK's Ministry of Defence said it also took ""the security of its personnel and establishments very seriously and keeps them under constant review"" but would not comment on specific security arrangements.

Sixteen other soldiers were injured in the raid near the main military academy in the west of the Afghan capital. Four militants were killed, a defence ministry spokesman told the BBC. A fifth was arrested. Islamic State (IS) militants claimed the assault. Taliban and IS attacks have soared this month, leaving scores dead. On Saturdayan ambulance packed with explosives killed more than 100 people in the Chicken Street shopping area. The Taliban claimed the attack, the deadliest in months. Marshal Fahim National Defense University is sometimes referred to as ""Sandhurst in the Sand"" as it is closely modelled on the British officer training academy. It has been attacked before. In October 2017,15 military cadets were killed in an explosion outside itas they were leaving by minibus. That attack was attributed to the Taliban. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? Four days behind the Taliban front line Who are the Taliban? Several explosions were heard, as well as small-arms fire, as the attack began at about 05:00 local time (00:30 GMT) at the military base in western Kabul. Two attackers blew themselves up, two others were killed by security forces and a fifth was arrested, defence ministry spokesman Gen Dawlat Waiziri told the BBC. Four AK-47 assault rifles, one suicide vest and one rocket-launcher were seized, he said. The president's spokesperson said none of the attackers had been able to get further than the first gate, Afghan news website Tolo reports. The attack was carried out by IS, according to the militant group's Amaq news outlet. Afghan military institutions are frequently targeted by militants. Secunder Kermani, BBC News, Kabul Both the Taliban and IS seem now to be focusing their energies on carrying out attacks in Kabul. Government officials say it is a response to progress made by the security forces elsewhere in the country. US air strikes have helped push the Taliban back from some parts of Helmand Province for example. However, it could also just be that the militants have decided attacking the capital is a more effective way of undermining confidence in the government and attracting international attention than trying to capture and retain territory in rural areas. The chief of the Afghan intelligence services said on Sunday he believed the upsurge in attacks was a response to increased US pressure on Pakistan. The US and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of providing safe havens to militants and President Donald Trump recently suspended security aid to Islamabad. Pakistan has denied the claims. Whatever the reason, it is clear that violence in Kabul is on the rise. Apart from the ambulance bomb and the attack on the academy, an aid agency and a hotel have been targeted in the past week. â¢ IS said it had carried out a suicide attack on the international charity Save the Children, in the city of Jalalabad last week. killing three members of staff and at least two others On 20 January,another attack on a Kabul hotel killed 22 people- mostly foreigners. Six militants stormed the hotel in suicide vests the attack continued for several hours until Afghan troops regained control of the building In October, 176 people were killed in bomb attacks across Afghanistan in one week. The country's security forces in particular have suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Taliban, who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country. In May, 150 people were killed by a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The Taliban denied any role, but the Afghan government says its affiliate, the Haqqani group, carried it out with support from Pakistan. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan - but IS militants hold sway in a much smaller number of districts. However, both groups have demonstrated their ability to hit targets across the country. They have often come into conflict with each other, too. How successful has IS been in Afghanistan?

Brits can book ahead to win sunbed race,"UK holidaymakers are to be offered the chance to choose their sunbed before they have even left home. Thomas Cook's trial scheme will allow customers to pay Â£22 to book a specific lounger in advance of their holiday. They will be able to pick their preferred location from a map, which will also allow customers to work out when each spot will get sun and shade. Only some sunbeds will be bookable as part of the scheme, which is being trialled in three hotels next month. The travel firm's ""Choose Your Favourite Sunbed"" service will then be available in 30 hotels this summer. For customers who do not want to pay the premium, a proportion of sunbeds at those hotels will not be part of the scheme. The service comes after a number ofvideos were posted online in recent months showing British holidaymakers sprinting to get sunbeds,externalearly in the morning. Thomas Cook's UK managing director Chris Mottershead said the initiative will particularly help ""families that want to secure a number of beds together in a specific spot"". It says it is the UK's first package holiday company to provide such a service and follows the trial scheme it introduced last year allowing customers to select their hotel room before the start of their trip.

'Class divide' in university entry exams,"About a fifth of university places are awarded on the basis of vocational exams Half of white working-class students at England have vocational qualifications as well as A-levels, says research from the Social Market Foundation. The analysis says in the North East 35% of white working-class students have entered with only vocational exams. The think tank is calling for more recognition of how exams other than A-levels are used to get into university, particularly by poorer students. And it warns of ""institutional snobbery"" against vocational exams. The research from the Social Market Foundation highlights how vocational qualifications are used for university applications - with about a fifth of places being awarded entirely on the basis of vocational exams. But this is not evenly spread - with the report highlighting that working-class students from the north of England are particularly likely to have gained places with vocational qualifications. Young people from ethnic minorities are also disproportionately likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications, such as BTecs. Children from poorer families are twice as likely to apply to university with vocational qualifications than the children of professional families. There is also a regional difference, with fewer people in the South applying with vocational qualifications. The think tank says this social divide produces an unhelpful bias in the system - with A-levels dominating political debate about university entry. The report says the emphasis on A-levels means that universities do not always give enough support or recognition for applicants with vocational qualifications. Entry requirements can often be set in A-levels, with the risk of putting off applicants with vocational qualifications. ""For too long, politicians and the media alike have ignored and even belittled the vocational route, because politics and the media are dominated by people who took the traditional route of A-levels then university,"" said James Kirkup, director of the Social Market Foundation. ""Most of the people who run the country didn't do BTecs, and they don't come from the sort of background where BTecs matter most. ""The result is institutional snobbery against vocational qualifications and the people who have them."" Maddalaine Ansell, chief executive of the University Alliance group of universities, said there had to be support for vocational alternatives to A-levels as a route into higher education - so they did not ""end up being dead-ends"".

Scandal-hit children's services 'improve',"This video can not be played ""It's taken a travesty like Rotherham to understand child exploitation,"" says social worker Ailsa Barr Children's services once mired in a child sexual exploitation scandal have been ""transformed"", government inspectors have said. Rotherham Council has been given an overall ""good"" rating following an Ofsted inspection in November. The service had been judged to be failing following 2014'sJay Report,external, which found up to 1,400 children were sexually abused between 1997 and 2013. Ofsted said the authority had made ""significant improvement"". More stories from across Yorkshire ""The local authority has taken a systematic and rigorous approach to improvement since the last Ofsted inspection in 2014 which identified widespread and serious failures,"" the inspectors said. ""The quality and impact of services for children are transformed."" Children at risk of sexual exploitation were identified and received an ""effective multi-agency response to protect them"", inspectors said. Rotherham Council has been run by government appointed commissioners since 2015 In the wake of the Jay Report the government took control of the authority in February 2015. Some services - though not those for children - werereturned to local controlin 2017. Children's Commissioner at Rotherham Council, Patricia Bradwell, said: ""The council and its partners have worked very hard to change outcomes for children, young people and families and I am delighted that this hard work has been recognised in this way."" Ofsted added the culture at the council was one of ""openness and transparency"" and staff were dedicated to improving the lives of children and young people. Ailsa Barr, a social work manager at Rotherham Council, said: ""Keeping children safe is the whole council's business, not just children's services' business. ""That means there is good training for staff, there is good investment in children's services by the council, even in times that are incredibly difficult."" She added: ""Child sexual exploitation was not understood in the way that it is understood now, and across the country improvements have been made and it's taken travesties like in Rochdale, Rotherham and other parts of the country for it to become a national focus."" Gordon Watson, deputy leader of the council, said he was grateful to staff for helping to bring about the improvements. ""Three years ago we let the children of Rotherham down, and we are truly sorry for that,"" he said. ""We pledged to use the Ofsted report to examine and improve culture and practice across the organisation and this new report hopefully shows we have done just that.""

Looking for the man who disappeared in Paris," They are short, brutal tributes. Darius, who “livened the area” around rue Lafitte, and was dead at the age of 43. Or Pierre, “found by a local resident, near the bins in rue Jacques Kellner”. Or Michel, who died on 21 January in rue Matignon, “in a parking lot where he lived for 20 years”. These curt memorials, posted on the website of a small charity, are pulled together from the sparse details and thin slivers of memory passed on by local shopkeepers, social workers, park attendants - anyone who might remember something about the men and women who lived and died on the streets of France. Sometimes the details are so few that the dead are honoured without even names or ages. Their time and place of death are carefully posted along with a photo or video of their neighbourhood spot - an attempt to remember a life, when even its most basic information is forgotten. These investigations are carried out by the Collectif les Morts de la Rue.  Their work catches the eye in the noisy, fume-ridden streets of Paris - a bright, plastic-covered notice tied to a tree or a wall, sometimes giving a name, but ending always with the same request: “If you knew this person, or have information which would allow us to pay homage, please contact us.” That might have been Tango’s story.  Few in Paris’s tranquil 14th arrondissement would have known much about him - to many, he was just a man in his 50s, who slept in a park, with a friendly disposition and an alcohol problem. The park in Paris's 14th arrondissement where Tango slept But two years after his death, Tango is still remembered in the place he once inhabited - even by those who arrived there long after he’d gone, and even though his body is buried 2,000 miles from France. Clement Etienne runs a cafe in a quiet street not far from Tango’s park.   The doors open promptly at 08:00 most mornings and there’s often a queue for the coffee machine.  Unlike most cafes, the windows of this one are carefully painted over to provide privacy - you can eat, drink and even sleep there for free, and the whole operation is housed in a retired double-decker bus.  It’s part of a project by the organisation Enfants du Canal to combat the exclusion of homeless people in Paris. Clement Etienne runs a cafe for homeless people in a double-decker bus Tango had been living on the streets for 20 years when he first met Clement, and was already a local fixture - known throughout the area only by his nickname.  He almost never told people his real name, says Clement. “He was too ashamed - worried that reports about his situation would get back to his family.” For this article, too, we have concealed his real identity, and even his real nickname, at the request of those who worked with him. “He was more victim than thug,” remembers Clement. “He drank a lot but he was adorable - always joking, he wouldn’t hurt a fly.  He wasn’t a cultivated man, but he had a real sense of kindness.” Slowly, over the years, as the two men got to know each other, Tango’s story began to emerge. “He had a dream, that he would return to Morocco,” Clement says. “It was more of a fantasy, really - and I think he knew that deep inside.” Tango had arrived in France illegally, 30 years before - a young man from France’s former North African colony following one of the many migrant trails towards Paris. Back in the 1980s, as an illegal immigrant, Tango had no right to social housing in France, and rough sleeping  was against the law. But back then, Clement says, it was easy for even those who arrived illegally to get official papers.  Tango secured French residency, found work in a factory, and began sending money home to Morocco. He might have hoped that his story would end, decades later, with a comfortable old age and a peaceful death, supported by the structures of French society, and surrounded by close family and friends. Instead, the end came on a bench in a city park. A friend, sleeping nearby, woke one winter morning to find the middle-aged dreamer from Morocco coughing up blood.  He called Clement for help.  Tango died shortly after reaching hospital, from pulmonary embolism. The park benches where Tango slept - and where he died The Collectif les Morts de La Rue counted 501 deaths among rough sleepers across France in 2016 - the year that Tango died.  Other activists believe the real number is several thousand. The organisation holds a memorial for them each year in a central Paris square. The details of each known individual are marked on simple white cards and arranged alongside potted flowers, on AstroTurf laid out in the shapes of graves. Each one of their sparsely told stories sheds light on one of Europe’s most intractable problems. This is Tango’s. For the first decade of his life in France, Tango wasn’t homeless.  By day, he worked in the factory alongside dozens of other men just like him - by night he shared overcrowded living quarters with them. It’s a pattern familiar to many Moroccan men of his generation.  The lack of a wife or children would have allowed him to send most of his earnings back home.  But it also left him isolated. “He would have been surrounded by people,” says Clement. “It’s a community, but it’s a community made up entirely of men, all the same age, from the same place, with the same illusions.  They’re all together, but they’re isolated from the rest of society, so they’re precarious.” In that situation, it takes little for the structures fall apart.  In Tango’s case, says Clement, it was probably a combination of alcoholism and losing his job.  One may well have prompted the other. Ten years after he arrived in France, Tango entered a new kind of social isolation - living on its streets. It’s often difficult to pinpoint a single trigger for homelessness.  The French talk about a “rupture” - of health, of relationships, of work or rental contracts - that leads someone down the path to living on the streets. One of the homeless people who currently uses the ShelterBus puts the date of his own “rupture” as 6 May 1991 - the day his mother died without sorting out the right documents for their living quarters. But for many others the slide towards homelessness is slower, more blurred - a gradual fall through social safety nets that fail, or are simply not there. Bruno, homeless Bruno is another of the regulars at Clement’s ShelterBus, and at first glance could pass for someone living in regular accommodation.  He stands tall and broad, and looks very clean, with an undamaged pair of glasses.  He has been on the streets for the past four months, after losing first his job, and then his benefit payments. “There’s a big problem with the way people look at you,” Bruno says. “They can see you are a bit lost.  Because when you spend all day without doing anything, you go round and round in circles in your head - you get lost and people can see it in your eyes.” For Gilou, another long-time customer at the bus, this month marks 28 years of living rough in Paris.  He sits down to chat with his half-empty bottle of rose wine, which he has given the surreal nickname “Titine Rosenbach”. “I worked in the building trade,” he says.  “I was a painter, an iron-worker and a chef in a kitchen.  I’ve done all kinds of things.  It all stopped when I had a breakdown and ended up in the psychiatric hospital, then in prison.  I’ve been in prison 14 times.” He shows me his tattoos, which include a series of hyphens around his wrist to indicate a thief, and a symbol meaning “death to the police”. The most difficult part of being on the streets is finding lunch, he says. “Dinner is fine, because if I’ve done a good day’s begging, I always have some food.” He pulls out three pieces of cheese he’s been given from a nearby fromagerie. “I beg three times a week in the marketplace here.  All the shopkeepers know me, and they like me. The neighbourhood is really nice.  But sometimes people are cold, and sometimes residents accuse me of peeing, though it’s not true.” In 2012, a short film opened in French cinemas, based on the story of a young lawyer, Joel Catherin, whose journey home took him past an elderly homeless woman, begging on a street near the church of La Madeleine in Paris. The homeless woman who inspired Joel Catherin's sign-writing campaign “I was working a lot at the time,” Catherin says. “I was quite isolated and wasn’t seeing much of my friends and family. There wasn’t much humanity in my life, and it was then that I fell for this old homeless lady who was begging next to my house. “She made me think of my own grandmother,” he explains. “I suddenly saw her as a human being.” “My greatest love story is you” Catherin began giving her food, and as the weather got colder and colder, he had the idea to replace her generic cardboard sign, with its simple request for “one euro please”, with something that presented her as an individual, a human being. When he left his house the next morning, he gave her a new sign, on which he’d written: “I could be your grandmother.” “Life’s not just about money. 1 euro please” “A few days later,” he says, “I saw her waving at me.  She was very happy. Obviously the new sign had worked well because she had been given a lot of coins.” Catherin made individual signs for other homeless people, and his quirky slogans began to be copied by others too. “Human Warmth” requests one - another tries to raise a smile with the message “I’m Locked Out”. A third, written for a woman begging outside a bottle bank, reads simply: “Recyclable?” “The real purpose was to wake people up,” he says. “I wanted to get people talking to the homeless - to create human warmth more than money for them. Because human warmth is where help starts.” Source: INSEE Atittudes towards homeless people in France are complex.  There are plenty of people who view them as a nuisance - an unsightly disturbance bringing down property prices, relying on hand-outs, and posing a vague, unformed threat. The French believe homelessness is a structural issue... British people believe more that it comes from individual responsibility and addiction” But Prof Julien Damon, from the prestigious university, Sciences-Po, believes Paris is more tolerant and welcoming than London, for example. “The French believe homelessness is a structural issue - it’s about unemployment, the housing market - that the individuals are not responsible for their situation.  British people believe more that it comes from individual responsibility and addiction.” When British peoplewere asked about their views of homeless peopleby the polling agency YouGov four years ago, the biggest group (35%) said they believed that homeless people had “probably made bad choices in life that got them into their situation”. In contrast, a 2009 survey in France by the polling agency CSA and one of the country’s main homelessness organisations found that the majority of those polled - almost two-thirds - thought that the state was primarily responsible for people ending up living in the streets, and that three-quarters felt solidarity with homeless people. The French state has changed its approach to rough sleepers since Tango arrived here in the 1980s.  In 1994, rough sleeping was decriminalised, and in 2007 a new law ruled that everyone sleeping on the streets had the right to be housed - even those who were in the country without permission. France has the most extensive and comprehensive right to housing in the whole of the European Union, according to the EU’s federation of homelessness organisations, FEANTSA. But many illegal immigrants avoid accessing homeless services, for fear of alerting the authorities to their status.  And since last month, that risk is being extended to emergency shelters under a new policy introduced by Emmanuel Macron’s liberal government. The change requires shelters to provide details of all those sleeping under their roof - allowing government officers to find and deport those who don’t have the right to be in France. The policy is sparking stiff resistance from homelessness organisations in France, but most of them are wholly funded by the state, and there’s a big question over whether they will win the argument. Across the Channel, the British government has also targeted some foreigners found sleeping rough.  In 2016, it began a policy of deporting EU nationals found sleeping out on Britain’s streets, saying that rough sleeping was an abuse of EU freedom of movement rights. It was a policy Chloe Serme-Morin, from FEANTSA, said “criminalised migrants sleeping rough”.  And in December 2017, theHigh Court agreedthat it was discriminatory and unlawful, after two Polish men and a Latvian challenged the government in court.  The UK has now ended the deportations. On both sides of the Channel there is a complex patchwork of measures that draw criticism from homeless charities, but also those that are welcomed as big steps forward. In Paris, the metro company, RATP, has developed a working alliance with the homeless organisation, Emmaus, running a dedicated rough sleeping shelter and team of staff to monitor rough sleepers in and around its stations. But despite legal protections, solidarity from individuals, and care by transport officials, rough sleepers in Paris could be forgiven for feeling increasingly unwelcome. Clement keeps an odd collection of photographs on his mobile phone.  In between pictures of his daughter, there are severe images of deserted street sculptures, rocks,  spikes and bicycle racks along the secluded walls of apartment blocks, the exposed wrought-iron supports of park benches, stuck like isolated sculptures into the ground without the seat once perched on top of them. He gathers the pictures on his daily walks around the area, as evidence of a deliberate erosion of places where homeless people can comfortably rest. “I slept in front of a building last night where they’d installed big decorative balls,” confirms Gilou.  “It wasn’t nice.  It hurt the hips.” It’s a pattern repeated throughout the city.  The Fondation Abbe Pierre, one of France’s oldest homeless organisations, describes it as a campaign to drive rough sleepers from town centres into areas where they are less visible.  Among the examples they’ve gathered is an automatic cold shower, installed in the doorway of a private car-park. “Cities with lots of tourism, like Paris, install them to put a nice face on the city for economic reasons,” says Chloe Serme-Morin from FEANTSA. “Cities are more and more in competition with each other to attract more wealthy inhabitants, more wealthy tourists."" There have been regular stories of similar measures in the UK involvinganti-homeless spikes, or other street furniture andmodificationsthat might stop people bedding down. Despite some similarities though, customers at the ShelterBus acknowledge a difference in the experience of homelessness across the Channel. “The Anglo-Saxons have a different way of dealing with homelessness,” says Bruno.  “In England, you have to fight to succeed - that’s a good thing.  In France, we are a country of civil servants; you have to fit the model.  If you don’t fit, you don’t exist. For me, that’s the problem, I’ve been erased.” During his election campaign, France's President Emmanuel Macron said he wanted to eradicate rough sleeping by the end of 2017.  Itwasn’t a promisehe was able to keep. Written around the ShelterBus are the names of other politicians who made exactly the same promise in years gone by - former president Nicolas Sarkozy, former prime minister Lionel Jospin.  “We’ll add Mr Macron when we repaint,” says Clement. But eradicating street homelessness is not as fantastical as it might seem, according to Eric Constantin of the Fondation Abbe Pierre.  “With the right policies, the problem in the Paris region could be solved in five to 10 years,” he says. “Build homes, stop evictions, control rents and put in place a system that cares for people as they are.” The French government has put money into expanding emergency shelters - there were 13,000 new shelter places opened this winter.  But there are usually strict rules about entering them: no dogs, no couples, no alcohol.  Some also refuse to take those with mental health issues. Gilou has a trove of stories about being kicked out of shelters for trying to bring in a bottle of wine.  Drink on the premises, and you can be barred. Get into a fight or cause any kind of disturbance, the same applies.  Stay away too long - and you can be similarly denied a place at that shelter again. And that strict approach kept Tango out, says Clement.  “He would have left the streets. It was possible.  We just had to find a place that would take an alcoholic.” It’s one reason why the government’s spokesman, Christophe Castaner, is right when he says that many rough sleepers choose not to use the shelter places available. Forced to separate from their partner or their dog, or overcome addiction or mental illness in order to secure a place, many refuse.  But that’s not the same as wanting to remain on the street. But many London shelters also have strict rules on alcohol, pets, or smoking.  A quick study of the 28 emergency night shelters available across the British capital reveal that 26 of them banned alcohol.  Tango might not have found himself any better off across the Channel. And even those who meet hostel criteria can struggle to find a bed.  A national emergency helpline, set up in France to link rough sleepers with shelters, is often inundated with calls and many of those who do get through are told there are no spaces left. This winter, the French media ran a series of reports on the desperate advice rough sleepers were being given by the hotline - to try to sleep on night-buses, park benches, or on mattresses being laid out by some hospital A&E departments. Bruno lived rough for a short while 10 years ago, and says the situation was completely different then.  “It was nothing compared to today,” he says. “Back then, there were many more places in homeless shelters, and far fewer people on the streets.  The economic situation was different then, and all the refugees weren’t here.” Gauging accurately the number of people sleeping rough on the streets of Paris has proved very difficult - estimates range between 7,000-8,000. But in 2014 the French Bureau of Statistics said the number of homeless adults in the much wider Paris Metropolitan Area had risen by 84% in about  a decade. Some of that rise is thought to be a result of the 2008 financial crisis, but the expansion of the EU also brought in new populations to the capital’s streets, and the large numbers of migrants crossing the Mediterranean into Europe have added to those numbers again. And, says Chloe Serme-Morin, Paris has seen new groups of rough sleepers appearing. ""Families and young people are more and more represented among rough sleepers and in shelters,” she says. “That's really because of rising housing costs - especially rent - and austerity policies which mean economically fragile families are unable to afford housing.” With pressure continuing to grow, says Serme-Morin, shelters are not the whole solution. “There’s been a real shift in attitude following the change to the law in 2007 - it’s starting to realise that the solution is long-term housing, and to think about Housing First.” Housing First is a model from Finland that turns on its head the traditional approach towards homelessness that trapped Tango and others like him. Inside an emergency homeless accommodation centre in Paris “Previously, it was: sort out your addictions and psychiatric problems first, then we’ll give you temporary accommodation to see if you can handle it, and then if you’re ready, you’ll get permanent accommodation,” explains Serme-Morin. “Housing First means long-term housing is a precondition for sorting out everything else.” The real sticking point is a lack of social housing stock. An emergency accommodation centre for homeless people, under construction in Paris Eric Constantin, of Fondation Abbe Pierre, says that to solve the problem in the Ile-de-France region around Paris, 70,000 homes need to be built each year from 2010-2030, with half of these set aside for social housing.  So far, that target has gone unmet for all but one year. Almost three-quarters of residents in the Ile-de-France region qualify for social housing, he says.  “The French model is unique, but now it’s under threat, because the government thinks it should start to focus on the poorest of the poor - which is London’s approach.” A long-term home, without conditions attached, might well have been the key to getting Tango off the streets, but it would have meant Paris having enough social housing to go around. As it is, he chose to sleep on a bench in a Paris park, drinking away his days while dreaming of rebuilding his life. Tango’s memorial took place on a winter morning, in the park where he had lived. “We’d put up notices all around the neighbourhood,” Clement says. “Around 15 people showed up: social workers, park attendants, nearby shopkeepers, his friends from the street.  They had put a mattress on the ground and arranged candles and flowers all around it, along with his belongings - and some bottles of alcohol.” Clement began the secular ceremony, talking about the man he had known.  Others followed, sharing their stories.  “Tango was very sociable,” he says.  “Most people on the street die alone.” “There was another homeless man who died recently at a street corner just up the road,” he says.  “The local residents had been hostile, often calling the town hall to get rid of him. I wouldn’t go so far as to say they were happy when he died, but…” Deaths like this can be sudden, and next of kin hard to trace.  Until about 15 years ago, if no family could be traced, homeless people who died in Paris were buried by the municipality in a communal grave.  “That’s still what many people in the street think will happen to them,” says Clement. But organisations like his, and the Collectif Les Morts, now take over the process, organising simple ceremonies in a dedicated corner of the Thiais Cemetery outside Paris.  The area set aside for homeless burials is called the Carré de Fraternité - the Corner of Brotherhood. In Tango’s case, though, there was someone in his life. “There was a niece,” Clement says. “Tango talked about her a lot, and had given me her number.  I told her about the memorial, and she said she would come.  She sent lots of texts leading up to it, but she never appeared.  I think it was too difficult for her to confront what he had been through.” Instead, she stepped in to take charge of her uncle’s body.  Three decades after he had arrived in France full of hope for a brighter life, Tango’s body was repatriated to Morocco for burial. After 20 years spent dreaming of returning home, finally, he did.

New York investigates 'follower factory',"New York's chief prosecutor says the state is opening an investigation into a firm that allegedly sold millions of fake followers to social media users. ""Impersonation and deception are illegal under New York law,"" said Eric Schneiderman. The company, Devumi, stands accused of stealing real people's identities, which it denies, according to the New York Times. The paper linked the ""follower factory"" to a host of celebrity accounts. The New York Times published an in-depth report on Devumi on Saturday,external, including interviews with people who alleged their account details and profile pictures had been copied to create realistic ""bots"". It is alleged that others who wanted to increase their follower count, including actors, entrepreneurs and political commentators, could then pay to be followed by the bots. On social media, high follower accounts boost influence, which can impact public opinion, or bring advantages, such as job offers or sponsorship deals, to account holders. Mr Schneiderman said he was concerned that such ""opaque"" operations were undermining democracy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On its website, Devumi offers customers the chance to order up to 250,000 Twitter followers, with prices starting  at $12 (Â£8.50). Clients can also buy ""likes"" and retweets.

In the past, Twitter has been accused of not taking the problem seriously enough. It has often dismissed bot investigations as ""inaccurate and methodologically flawed"". The platform does allow automated accounts, but it strictly prohibits them being bought or sold. It says it will suspend accounts that are found to have purchased followers, retweets or likes. However, a representative told the New York Times it rarely does this in practice, as it is hard to prove. The report alleges that Devumi has a stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, many of which are sold repeatedly. It alleges at least 55,000 of the accounts ""use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors"". ""These accounts are counterfeit coins in the booming economy of online influence, reaching into virtually any industry where a mass audience â or the illusion of it â can be monetized. Fake accounts, deployed by governments, criminals and entrepreneurs, now infest social media networks,"" they wrote. The New York Times found many well-known Twitter accounts have followers from the Devumi ""factory"". It said the company's clients covered the political spectrum, from liberal cable pundits to a reporter at the right-wing site Breitbart and an editor at China's state-run news agency, Xinhua. Martha Lane Fox:Entrepreneur and member of the UK's House of Lords Martha Lane Fox's Twitter account showed ""a series of follower purchases spanning more than a year"", including a 25,000-follower boost days after she became a Twitter board member in April 2016. She told the New York Times a ""rogue employee"" was responsible. Paul Hollywood:British TV chef The investigation showed Devumi-managed bots following Paul Hollywood's official Twitter profile. Shortly after the paper emailed him to ask questions, his account was deleted. Hilary Rosen:political commentator The CNN contributor has paid for over 500,000 Twitter followers - although most have been deleted. She said it was ""an experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked"". Randy Bryce:US ironworker turned politician On Saturday, Mr Bryce - who is trying to unseat Republican Paul Ryan in Congress - said, on Twitter, that he bought the followers as an experiment in 2015, when he was a blogger.

Why Trump is feuding with Jay-Z,"Jay-Z accused President Trump of failing to fix anything while in office President Donald Trump has hit back at Jay-Z after the rapper called him a ""superbug"" and attacked his treatment of minorities. In a tweet, Mr Trump said ""black unemployment has just been reported to be at the LOWEST RATE EVER RECORDED!"". African-American unemployment stands at 6.8%, a record low. But critics say economic growth began under President Obama and unemployment remains far higher among the black population than the white. Appearing on CNN's The Van Jones Show, Jay-Z said focusing on unemployment rates was ""missing the point"". ""It's not about money at the end of the dayâ¦money doesn't equate to happiness. It doesn't. That's missing the whole point. You treat people like human beings...that's the main point."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You spray something and you create a superbug because you don't take care of the problem."" ""You don't take the trash out, you keep spraying whatever over it to make it acceptable. As those things grow, you create a superbug. And then now we have Donald Trump, the superbug.""

Jay-Z supported Barack Obama during his presidency, and spoke out in favour of Hillary Clinton in the 2016 election that Mr Trump won.

Government urged to tackle online grooming,"This video can not be played Minister Matt Hancock tells BBC Breakfast both government and social media companies can do more. Children at risk of online grooming should be sent automatic alerts as part of the government's internet safety strategy, the NSPCC has said. The children's charity said existing algorithms could be used to flag suspected groomers to moderators. A ""staggering"" 1,316 offences were recorded in the first six months of a new child grooming law being introduced last year in England and Wales. Minister Matt Hancock said he would be robust with social media companies. The minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the government was working on making the UK the safest place in the world to go online and that can and ""must"" include grooming alerts. He told BBC Breakfast that as a father of three young children it was something that ""really mattered"" to him. Posing as a schoolgirl to expose online groomers Father's warning after son was groomed online Before the new offence of sexual communication with a child was introduced in April, police could not intervene until groomers attempted to meet their targets face-to-face. Of the cases recorded, the youngest victim was a seven-year-old girl, although girls aged between 12 and 15 were the most likely to be targeted by predators. Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were the most common sites used by offenders, making up 63% of all incidents. The NSPCC, which campaigned to bring in the new legislation, has criticised social media companies for not making the most of the technology they already use to enforce the law. Algorithms - the calculations that tell computers what to do - are currently used by social media companies to flag up images of child abuse, hate speech and extremist material. The charity said the same techniques should be used to pick up ""grooming language"" and then send an automatic alert to both the child and moderators. By Chris Baraniuk, BBC Technology Reporter Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were the most common sites used by offenders Automatically identifying malicious or illegal content is something that social networks already do, in some measure. For example, give a machine learning system thousands of nude pictures and it can, much of the time, go on to pick out new examples of nude pictures in the future. However, the specifics of these algorithms are closely guarded secrets - companies like Facebook don't like competitors to know too much about content filtering, or that they have established a certain way of doing things that they may later decide to change. Butconcerns over how much these sites are doingto tackle problematic material are not new. While Facebook already does some work in identifying grooming behaviour, social networks in general may be reluctant to take on too much responsibility in this area. Should any new anti-child predator system be shown to have failings or loopholes, they could face even greater criticism. Tony Stower, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, said that despite the ""staggering number of offences"", government and social networks are not properly working together to stop this crime from happening. ""Government's Internet Safety Strategy must require social networks to build in technology to keep their young users safe, rather than relying on police to step in once harm has already been done,"" he said. The NSPCC said an existing voluntary code of practice does not go far enough and has called for a mandatory code to be put in place. Meanwhile Facebook said it was already using technology to identify grooming behaviour. Vera Baird, victim affairs lead at the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said she expected the number of cases to be higher given the ""endemic"" scale of online grooming. She said alerts are ""imperative"" to prevention, but should be accompanied by sex and relationships education so that children know how to respond to such a warning. The Home Office said Â£20m was spent pursuing grooming offenders in 2017. School Snapchat 'grooming' investigated Anti-grooming work to stop paedophiles Young children groomed on Periscope.

Bruno Mars grabs all the Grammys,"Bruno Mars won six Grammys in total - including the top three prizes Bruno Mars and Kendrick Lamar stole the show, and most of the awards, at the 2018 Grammys. Mars provided the night's big upset, taking the album of the year trophy that most critics assumed would go to Lamar's rap tour de force, Damn. In the end, voters found Mars's crowd-pleasing R&B more palatable, while Lamar dominated the rap categories. Alessia Cara won best new artist - making her the only female artist to win a major prize. Stars like Lady Gaga, Kesha, Lorde and SZA were overlooked, with only 17 awards (out of a total of 86) going to women or female-fronted bands. Kesha's performance was an emotional highlight of the show The imbalance was particularly incongruous on a night that highlighted the #TimesUp and #MeToo campaigns. Most performers arrived for the showwearing a white roseto symbolise their support for the movements, which tackle sexual harassment and inequality. Pop star Kesha also gave a powerful, stirring performance of her single Praying, which addresses her own experience of surviving abuse. Grammy Awards 2018: As it happened White roses on the red carpet The main winners and nominees Fire and Fury over Clinton Grammy cameo She was backed by an all-star choir, including Cyndi Lauper and Camila Cabello, who were dressed in white to reflect the white rose campaign. ""We come in peace but we mean business,"" said R&B star Janelle Monae, introducing the performance. ""To those who would dare try to silence us, we offer two words: Time's Up. ""We say Time's Up for pay inequality, discrimination or harassment of any kind, and the abuse of power."" ""Let's work together, women and men, as a united music industry committed to creating more safe work environments, equal pay, and access for all women."" Handwritten notes to the victims in Las Vegas and Manchester were displayed on screens The night's other pivotal moment was a tribute to the music-loving victims of the tragedies in Manchester and Las Vegas. Handwritten notes bearing the names of the dead were projected on the stage as country music stars Maren Morris, Eric Church and Brothers Osborne performed Eric Clapton's Tears In Heaven. All three acts played at the Route 91 festival last October before a gunman opened fire on the audience, killing 58. ""All of country music was reminded in the most tragic way the connection we share with fans and the loving power that music will always provide,"" said Eric Church, choking back tears. ""We wanted to come together and honour the memory of the beautiful, music-loving souls so cruelly taken from us,"" added Morris. Album of the year:Bruno Mars - 24K Magic Record of the year:Bruno Mars - 24K Magic Song of the year:Bruno Mars - That's What I Like Best new artist:Alessia Cara Best pop album:Ed Sheeran - Ã· (Divide) Best rock album:The War On Drugs - A Deeper Understanding Best R&B album:Bruno Mars - 24k Magic Best rap album:Kendrick Lamar - Damn More winners and nominees Mars left with six trophies in all, including the three biggest prizes: Album of the year, song of the year and record of the year. Speaking onstage, he paid tribute to his fellow nominees, saying: ""You guys are the reason why I'm in the studio pulling my hair out"". He also told the story of how, as a 15-year-old in Hawaii, he performed in a show called The Magic of Polynesia, singing songs by R&B writers Babyface, Jam & Lewis and Teddy Riley. ""I'll be honest, I was incredible at 15,"" he laughed, before explaining how he'd wanted to recapture the sounds of those 80s and 90s hits on his latest album. ""Those songs were written with nothing but joy... and that's all I wanted to bring with this album. Hopefully I could feel that again and see everybody dancing and everybody moving."" As well as the star's own prizes, his recording engineers won a further award for their work on the album. Kendrick Lamar's opening number was a powerful, highly-conceptual performance His victory robbed Kendrick Lamar's more urgent, political album of the night's main prizes - but the Compton-born star still took home five trophies, including best rap album, best rap song and best rap performance. He also opened the ceremony, in New York's Madison Square Gardens, with a provocative, politically-charged performance that featured contributions from U2 and Dave Chapelle. ""I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America,"" observed Chapelle in the middle of the segment. Lamar's victories came at the expense of rap veteran Jay-Z and his soul-baring album 4:44. Jay-Z won none of his eight nominations and chose not to perform at the three-hour show. But Lamar tipped his hat to the elder star, declaring ""Jay for president!"" as he collected the best rap album award. The night also saw performances from Lady Gaga, Sam Smith, Pink and Patti LuPone, who sang Evita's Don't Cry For Me Argentina as part of a tribute to Andrew Lloyd Webber. Ed Sheeran, who could not attend the ceremony, won two prizes - best pop vocal performance for Shape Of You and best pop album for Divide. There were also posthumous awards for Leonard Cohen and actress Carrie Fisher, who won best spoken word album for the audio version of her memoirs, The Princess Diarist.

Kabul military base comes under attack,"Security forces have blocked off the roads near the site of the attack Militants have killed at least 11 soldiers in an attack on an army post in Kabul, the fourth major assault in a surge of violence in just over a week. Sixteen other soldiers were injured in the raid near the main military academy in the west of the Afghan capital. Four militants were killed, a defence ministry spokesman told the BBC. A fifth was arrested. Islamic State (IS) militants claimed the assault. Taliban and IS attacks have soared this month, leaving scores dead. On Saturdayan ambulance packed with explosives killed more than 100 people in the Chicken Street shopping area. The Taliban claimed the attack, the deadliest in months. Marshal Fahim National Defense University is sometimes referred to as ""Sandhurst in the Sand"" as it is closely modelled on the British officer training academy. It has been attacked before. In October 2017,15 military cadets were killed in an explosion outside itas they were leaving by minibus. That attack was attributed to the Taliban. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? Four days behind the Taliban front line Who are the Taliban? Several explosions were heard, as well as small-arms fire, as the attack began at about 05:00 local time (00:30 GMT) at the military base in western Kabul. Two attackers blew themselves up, two others were killed by security forces and a fifth was arrested, defence ministry spokesman Gen Dawlat Waiziri told the BBC. Four AK-47 assault rifles, one suicide vest and one rocket-launcher were seized, he said. The president's spokesperson said none of the attackers had been able to get further than the first gate, Afghan news website Tolo reports. The attack was carried out by IS, according to the militant group's Amaq news outlet. Afghan military institutions are frequently targeted by militants. Secunder Kermani, BBC News, Kabul Both the Taliban and IS seem now to be focusing their energies on carrying out attacks in Kabul. Government officials say it is a response to progress made by the security forces elsewhere in the country. US air strikes have helped push the Taliban back from some parts of Helmand Province for example. However, it could also just be that the militants have decided attacking the capital is a more effective way of undermining confidence in the government and attracting international attention than trying to capture and retain territory in rural areas. The chief of the Afghan intelligence services said on Sunday he believed the upsurge in attacks was a response to increased US pressure on Pakistan. The US and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of providing safe havens to militants and President Donald Trump recently suspended security aid to Islamabad. Pakistan has denied the claims. Whatever the reason, it is clear that violence in Kabul is on the rise. Apart from the ambulance bomb and the attack on the academy, an aid agency and a hotel have been targeted in the past week. â¢ IS said it had carried out a suicide attack on the international charity Save the Children, in the city of Jalalabad last week. killing three members of staff and at least two others On 20 January,another attack on a Kabul hotel killed 22 people- mostly foreigners. Six militants stormed the hotel in suicide vests the attack continued for several hours until Afghan troops regained control of the building In October, 176 people were killed in bomb attacks across Afghanistan in one week. The country's security forces in particular have suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Taliban, who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country. In May, 150 people were killed by a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The Taliban denied any role, but the Afghan government says its affiliate, the Haqqani group, carried it out with support from Pakistan. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan - but IS militants hold sway in a much smaller number of districts. However, both groups have demonstrated their ability to hit targets across the country. They have often come into conflict with each other, too. How successful has IS been in Afghanistan?

Several explosions were heard, as well as small-arms fire, as the attack began at about 05:00 local time (00:30 GMT) at the military base in western Kabul. Two attackers blew themselves up, two others were killed by security forces and a fifth was arrested, defence ministry spokesman Gen Dawlat Waiziri told the BBC. Four AK-47 assault rifles, one suicide vest and one rocket-launcher were seized, he said. The president's spokesperson said none of the attackers had been able to get further than the first gate, Afghan news website Tolo reports. The attack was carried out by IS, according to the militant group's Amaq news outlet. Afghan military institutions are frequently targeted by militants. Secunder Kermani, BBC News, Kabul Both the Taliban and IS seem now to be focusing their energies on carrying out attacks in Kabul. Government officials say it is a response to progress made by the security forces elsewhere in the country. US air strikes have helped push the Taliban back from some parts of Helmand Province for example. However, it could also just be that the militants have decided attacking the capital is a more effective way of undermining confidence in the government and attracting international attention than trying to capture and retain territory in rural areas. The chief of the Afghan intelligence services said on Sunday he believed the upsurge in attacks was a response to increased US pressure on Pakistan. The US and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of providing safe havens to militants and President Donald Trump recently suspended security aid to Islamabad. Pakistan has denied the claims. Whatever the reason, it is clear that violence in Kabul is on the rise. Apart from the ambulance bomb and the attack on the academy, an aid agency and a hotel have been targeted in the past week. â¢ IS said it had carried out a suicide attack on the international charity Save the Children, in the city of Jalalabad last week. killing three members of staff and at least two others On 20 January,another attack on a Kabul hotel killed 22 people- mostly foreigners. Six militants stormed the hotel in suicide vests the attack continued for several hours until Afghan troops regained control of the building In October, 176 people were killed in bomb attacks across Afghanistan in one week. The country's security forces in particular have suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Taliban, who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country. In May, 150 people were killed by a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The Taliban denied any role, but the Afghan government says its affiliate, the Haqqani group, carried it out with support from Pakistan. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan - but IS militants hold sway in a much smaller number of districts. However, both groups have demonstrated their ability to hit targets across the country. They have often come into conflict with each other, too. How successful has IS been in Afghanistan?

"New York investigates 'follower factory'It comes after a report traces links between a company, millions of bots and various celebrities.10h10 hours agoUS & Canada","New York's chief prosecutor says the state is opening an investigation into a firm that allegedly sold millions of fake followers to social media users. ""Impersonation and deception are illegal under New York law,"" said Eric Schneiderman. The company, Devumi, stands accused of stealing real people's identities, which it denies, according to the New York Times. The paper linked the ""follower factory"" to a host of celebrity accounts. The New York Times published an in-depth report on Devumi on Saturday,external, including interviews with people who alleged their account details and profile pictures had been copied to create realistic ""bots"". It is alleged that others who wanted to increase their follower count, including actors, entrepreneurs and political commentators, could then pay to be followed by the bots. On social media, high follower accounts boost influence, which can impact public opinion, or bring advantages, such as job offers or sponsorship deals, to account holders. Mr Schneiderman said he was concerned that such ""opaque"" operations were undermining democracy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On its website, Devumi offers customers the chance to order up to 250,000 Twitter followers, with prices starting  at $12 (Â£8.50). Clients can also buy ""likes"" and retweets. The company sells followers on a range of other platforms, including Pinterest, LinkedIn, Soundcloud and YouTube. How Russian bots appear in your timeline Massive bot networks found on Twitter ""Devumi has helped over 200,000 businesses, celebrities, musicians, YouTubers and other pros gain more exposure and make a big impact to their audience,"" says its website. The company is registered at a New York City address, although the New York Times alleged it is a front, with its actual offices in Florida and it also employs workers in the Philippines.

In the past, Twitter has been accused of not taking the problem seriously enough. It has often dismissed bot investigations as ""inaccurate and methodologically flawed"". The platform does allow automated accounts, but it strictly prohibits them being bought or sold. It says it will suspend accounts that are found to have purchased followers, retweets or likes. However, a representative told the New York Times it rarely does this in practice, as it is hard to prove. The report alleges that Devumi has a stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, many of which are sold repeatedly. It alleges at least 55,000 of the accounts ""use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors"". ""These accounts are counterfeit coins in the booming economy of online influence, reaching into virtually any industry where a mass audience â or the illusion of it â can be monetized. Fake accounts, deployed by governments, criminals and entrepreneurs, now infest social media networks,"" they wrote. The New York Times found many well-known Twitter accounts have followers from the Devumi ""factory"". It said the company's clients covered the political spectrum, from liberal cable pundits to a reporter at the right-wing site Breitbart and an editor at China's state-run news agency, Xinhua. Martha Lane Fox:Entrepreneur and member of the UK's House of Lords Martha Lane Fox's Twitter account showed ""a series of follower purchases spanning more than a year"", including a 25,000-follower boost days after she became a Twitter board member in April 2016. She told the New York Times a ""rogue employee"" was responsible. Paul Hollywood:British TV chef The investigation showed Devumi-managed bots following Paul Hollywood's official Twitter profile. Shortly after the paper emailed him to ask questions, his account was deleted. Hilary Rosen:political commentator The CNN contributor has paid for over 500,000 Twitter followers - although most have been deleted. She said it was ""an experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked"". Randy Bryce:US ironworker turned politician On Saturday, Mr Bryce - who is trying to unseat Republican Paul Ryan in Congress - said, on Twitter, that he bought the followers as an experiment in 2015, when he was a blogger.

"Scandal-hit children's services 'improve'""Significant improvements"" are made after a report said 1,400 children in the town were abused.5m6 minutes agoSheffield & South Yorkshire","This video can not be played ""It's taken a travesty like Rotherham to understand child exploitation,"" says social worker Ailsa Barr Children's services once mired in a child sexual exploitation scandal have been ""transformed"", government inspectors have said. Rotherham Council has been given an overall ""good"" rating following an Ofsted inspection in November. The service had been judged to be failing following 2014'sJay Report,external, which found up to 1,400 children were sexually abused between 1997 and 2013. Ofsted said the authority had made ""significant improvement"". More stories from across Yorkshire ""The local authority has taken a systematic and rigorous approach to improvement since the last Ofsted inspection in 2014 which identified widespread and serious failures,"" the inspectors said. ""The quality and impact of services for children are transformed."" Children at risk of sexual exploitation were identified and received an ""effective multi-agency response to protect them"", inspectors said. Rotherham Council has been run by government appointed commissioners since 2015 In the wake of the Jay Report the government took control of the authority in February 2015. Some services - though not those for children - werereturned to local controlin 2017. Children's Commissioner at Rotherham Council, Patricia Bradwell, said: ""The council and its partners have worked very hard to change outcomes for children, young people and families and I am delighted that this hard work has been recognised in this way."" Ofsted added the culture at the council was one of ""openness and transparency"" and staff were dedicated to improving the lives of children and young people. Ailsa Barr, a social work manager at Rotherham Council, said: ""Keeping children safe is the whole council's business, not just children's services' business. ""That means there is good training for staff, there is good investment in children's services by the council, even in times that are incredibly difficult."" She added: ""Child sexual exploitation was not understood in the way that it is understood now, and across the country improvements have been made and it's taken travesties like in Rochdale, Rotherham and other parts of the country for it to become a national focus."" Gordon Watson, deputy leader of the council, said he was grateful to staff for helping to bring about the improvements. ""Three years ago we let the children of Rotherham down, and we are truly sorry for that,"" he said. ""We pledged to use the Ofsted report to examine and improve culture and practice across the organisation and this new report hopefully shows we have done just that.""

Separatist clashes flare in south YemenSouthern separatists seize government buildings in Aden as they fight the president's forces.8h8 hours agoMiddle East,"A rift has opened between two forces that were formerly on the same side Separatists in southern Yemen have seized government buildings in the city of Aden amid fierce clashes with forces of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Prime Minister Ahmed bin Dagher has accused the separatists of mounting a coup. Aden serves as a temporary base of the Hadi government, with Houthi rebels controlling the capital Sanaa. Fighting subsided late on Sunday evening as both sides ordered their forces to stand down. Government forces called on Yemen's Arab neighbours to intervene and help calm the situation. Dozens of people are reported injured, and at least 10 people have died. The development further complicates an already dire situation in Yemen, where millions need aid. The modern state of Yemen was formed in 1990 from the merger of South Yemen and North Yemen, and separatist desires for an independent southern state have not gone away. The separatists have been backing the government against the Houthis, but long-simmering tensions have flared in recent weeks, with the separatists accusing the government of corruption and discrimination. Fighting broke out on Sunday after a deadline set by the separatists for Mr Hadi to dismiss Mr Dagher and his cabinet.

The southern separatists are backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is also part of the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis. Prime Minister Dagher called on the ""decision maker"" UAE to take action, warning that the clashes would advantage the Houthis. President Hadi, who is based in Saudi Arabia, called for a ceasefire, while his government ordered loyalist troops back to their barracks. Troops from both Saudi and the UAE - present in Aden when fighting erupted - did not intervene, reports said. The Houthis remain in control of Sanaa and territory in the north and west. They seized the capital in 2014, prompting the Saudi-led coalition to intervene on the side of the government.

It takes more than a few singers and rappers to impress this celebrity child. Bruno Mars again. He's defied all the critics to beat Kendrick to the final award of the night and steal a dramatic 6-5 victory at the death. ""Don't cut me off Grammys please,"" Bruno pleaded, after having earlier been somewhat curtailed in his acceptance speech. ""I've been drinking a little bit and celebrating,"" he confessed, before telling a heart-warming tale about how his 15-year-old self used to sing for his supper to tourists in Hawaii. Apparently, all he's ever wanted to do is share the love and make people dance. Oh and ""sprinkle Mars sauce"" on his favourite tracks. Other sauces are available. He was given his award by Bono and The Edge from U2 who stressed what a ""big big deal"" the award was and how important it is not to come out on stage ""like an ass"". The singer performs rapper Logic's suicide prevention track 1-800-273-8255 alongside another new artist nominee Khalid who has failed to convert any of his five nominations. The trio are backed up by a huge group of suicide survivors and friends and relatives of suicide victims standing silent, wearing t-shirt that bear the slogan 'You Are Not Alone'. The Maryland-born rapper finishes the track with an impassioned plea, saying ""Bring us you're tired, you're poor and any immigrant that seeks refuge."" This is what young people are talking about when they say 'woke'. Tonight, we've already seen tributes to two rock 'n' roll greats that we lost last year in Chuck Berry and Fats Domino. Now a third - Tom Petty - has been honoured with an acoustic performance of his track Wildflowers, by country album winner Chris Stapleton and all round country legend Emmlyou Harris.  The Academy then rattled through a montage of other stricken artists from the past 12 months; including Glen Campbell, Joni Sledge, Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington. Their music lives on. She missed out on the best new artist, by a singer whose album was out in 2016, but SZA proved her mettle with a great solo performance of Broken Clocks. Its a confident performance by a woman whose star is most definitely on the rise, even if it does look like someone has attacked her trousers and top with a hedge strimmer. We even have a shower of sparks raining down on the stage. Bravo. That man, Bruno Mars, for 24K Magic. That's five for Bruno now, which puts him level with Ken. He thanked ""My lady Jessica for being my rock"" and his dear old dad, saying; ""Look at me Pop, I'm at The Grammys!"" He was presented with his award by Alicia Keys, who said she prefers it when the Grammys are in her home city and not in LA as normal.

"Government urged to tackle online groomingOver 1,300 child grooming offences are recorded in England and Wales after a new law was passed.3m3 minutes agoUKLooking for the man who disappeared in Paris","This video can not be played Minister Matt Hancock tells BBC Breakfast both government and social media companies can do more. Children at risk of online grooming should be sent automatic alerts as part of the government's internet safety strategy, the NSPCC has said. The children's charity said existing algorithms could be used to flag suspected groomers to moderators. A ""staggering"" 1,316 offences were recorded in the first six months of a new child grooming law being introduced last year in England and Wales. Minister Matt Hancock said he would be robust with social media companies. The minister for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said the government was working on making the UK the safest place in the world to go online and that can and ""must"" include grooming alerts. He told BBC Breakfast that as a father of three young children it was something that ""really mattered"" to him. Posing as a schoolgirl to expose online groomers Father's warning after son was groomed online Before the new offence of sexual communication with a child was introduced in April, police could not intervene until groomers attempted to meet their targets face-to-face. Of the cases recorded, the youngest victim was a seven-year-old girl, although girls aged between 12 and 15 were the most likely to be targeted by predators. Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were the most common sites used by offenders, making up 63% of all incidents. The NSPCC, which campaigned to bring in the new legislation, has criticised social media companies for not making the most of the technology they already use to enforce the law. Algorithms - the calculations that tell computers what to do - are currently used by social media companies to flag up images of child abuse, hate speech and extremist material. The charity said the same techniques should be used to pick up ""grooming language"" and then send an automatic alert to both the child and moderators. By Chris Baraniuk, BBC Technology Reporter Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat were the most common sites used by offenders Automatically identifying malicious or illegal content is something that social networks already do, in some measure. For example, give a machine learning system thousands of nude pictures and it can, much of the time, go on to pick out new examples of nude pictures in the future. However, the specifics of these algorithms are closely guarded secrets - companies like Facebook don't like competitors to know too much about content filtering, or that they have established a certain way of doing things that they may later decide to change. Butconcerns over how much these sites are doingto tackle problematic material are not new. While Facebook already does some work in identifying grooming behaviour, social networks in general may be reluctant to take on too much responsibility in this area. Should any new anti-child predator system be shown to have failings or loopholes, they could face even greater criticism. Tony Stower, head of child safety online at the NSPCC, said that despite the ""staggering number of offences"", government and social networks are not properly working together to stop this crime from happening. ""Government's Internet Safety Strategy must require social networks to build in technology to keep their young users safe, rather than relying on police to step in once harm has already been done,"" he said. The NSPCC said an existing voluntary code of practice does not go far enough and has called for a mandatory code to be put in place. Meanwhile Facebook said it was already using technology to identify grooming behaviour. Vera Baird, victim affairs lead at the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said she expected the number of cases to be higher given the ""endemic"" scale of online grooming. She said alerts are ""imperative"" to prevention, but should be accompanied by sex and relationships education so that children know how to respond to such a warning. The Home Office said Â£20m was spent pursuing grooming offenders in 2017. School Snapchat 'grooming' investigated Anti-grooming work to stop paedophiles Young children groomed on Periscope.

It takes more than a few singers and rappers to impress this celebrity child. Bruno Mars again. He's defied all the critics to beat Kendrick to the final award of the night and steal a dramatic 6-5 victory at the death. ""Don't cut me off Grammys please,"" Bruno pleaded, after having earlier been somewhat curtailed in his acceptance speech. ""I've been drinking a little bit and celebrating,"" he confessed, before telling a heart-warming tale about how his 15-year-old self used to sing for his supper to tourists in Hawaii. Apparently, all he's ever wanted to do is share the love and make people dance. Oh and ""sprinkle Mars sauce"" on his favourite tracks. Other sauces are available. He was given his award by Bono and The Edge from U2 who stressed what a ""big big deal"" the award was and how important it is not to come out on stage ""like an ass"". The singer performs rapper Logic's suicide prevention track 1-800-273-8255 alongside another new artist nominee Khalid who has failed to convert any of his five nominations. The trio are backed up by a huge group of suicide survivors and friends and relatives of suicide victims standing silent, wearing t-shirt that bear the slogan 'You Are Not Alone'. The Maryland-born rapper finishes the track with an impassioned plea, saying ""Bring us you're tired, you're poor and any immigrant that seeks refuge."" This is what young people are talking about when they say 'woke'. Tonight, we've already seen tributes to two rock 'n' roll greats that we lost last year in Chuck Berry and Fats Domino. Now a third - Tom Petty - has been honoured with an acoustic performance of his track Wildflowers, by country album winner Chris Stapleton and all round country legend Emmlyou Harris.  The Academy then rattled through a montage of other stricken artists from the past 12 months; including Glen Campbell, Joni Sledge, Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington. Their music lives on. She missed out on the best new artist, by a singer whose album was out in 2016, but SZA proved her mettle with a great solo performance of Broken Clocks. Its a confident performance by a woman whose star is most definitely on the rise, even if it does look like someone has attacked her trousers and top with a hedge strimmer. We even have a shower of sparks raining down on the stage. Bravo. That man, Bruno Mars, for 24K Magic. That's five for Bruno now, which puts him level with Ken. He thanked ""My lady Jessica for being my rock"" and his dear old dad, saying; ""Look at me Pop, I'm at The Grammys!"" He was presented with his award by Alicia Keys, who said she prefers it when the Grammys are in her home city and not in LA as normal.

"Two shot in separate attacks in BelfastPolice say the victims, aged 26 and 41, have sustained ""potentially life-changing injuries"".6h6 hours agoNorthern Ireland","Police at the scene of the Ballymurphy atack Two men have been shot in separate so-called 'paramilitary-style' attacks an hour apart in west and north Belfast. A 41-year-old man was shot five times in his arms and legs when a gang entered his home at Ballymurphy in the west of the city on Sunday evening. In north Belfast, a 26-year-old man was shot three times in his legs at his home in Upper Meadow Street, New Lodge. Police said both victims have sustained ""potentially life-changing injuries"" and were taken to hospital. The 41-year-old victim was shot at a house in Divismore Park and the attack was reported to police at about 19:35 GMT. No-one else was in the property at the time of the shooting. The second shooting was reported at about 20:30 GMT. A PSNI spokesman described both incidents as ""terrifying"" paramilitary-style attacks in the victims' own homes. ""It is another example of a criminal group trying to control a community by the use of weapons, fear and violence."" Sinn FÃ©in north Belfast councillor JJ Magee described the New Lodge shooting as ""brutal"" and said there had been a number of such attacks in the area. ""These shootings must stop,"" he said. ""People want them to stop, they don't want these kind of shootings in their area and they want these people to go away."" Speaking about the Ballymurphy shooting, West Belfast Sinn FÃ©in MP Paul Maskey said his reaction was ""one of horror"". ""No-one, whether it's community representatives, whether it's neighbours, whether it's anyone around these streets wants to see this activity,"" he added. Mr Maskey's party colleague councillor Steven Corr said such attacks were ""unwelcome and unwanted"". He told BBC Radio Ulster: ""Three men, believed to be masked, turned up at the door and gained entry. ""We're not too sure if they forced entry... but they went inside and they shot one of the occupants."" Mr Corr added: ""There are a lot of elderly people living there, so obviously when shots are discharged in any street in a built-up area it causes and creates alarm among the local population.""

Kabul military academy under attack,"Security forces have blocked off the roads near the site of the attack Militants have killed at least 11 soldiers in an attack on an army post in Kabul, the fourth major assault in a surge of violence in just over a week. Sixteen other soldiers were injured in the raid near the main military academy in the west of the Afghan capital. Four militants were killed, a defence ministry spokesman told the BBC. A fifth was arrested. Islamic State (IS) militants claimed the assault. Taliban and IS attacks have soared this month, leaving scores dead. On Saturdayan ambulance packed with explosives killed more than 100 people in the Chicken Street shopping area. The Taliban claimed the attack, the deadliest in months. Marshal Fahim National Defense University is sometimes referred to as ""Sandhurst in the Sand"" as it is closely modelled on the British officer training academy. It has been attacked before. In October 2017,15 military cadets were killed in an explosion outside itas they were leaving by minibus. That attack was attributed to the Taliban. Can Afghan military turn the tide in Taliban fight? Four days behind the Taliban front line Who are the Taliban? Several explosions were heard, as well as small-arms fire, as the attack began at about 05:00 local time (00:30 GMT) at the military base in western Kabul. Two attackers blew themselves up, two others were killed by security forces and a fifth was arrested, defence ministry spokesman Gen Dawlat Waiziri told the BBC. Four AK-47 assault rifles, one suicide vest and one rocket-launcher were seized, he said. The president's spokesperson said none of the attackers had been able to get further than the first gate, Afghan news website Tolo reports. The attack was carried out by IS, according to the militant group's Amaq news outlet. Afghan military institutions are frequently targeted by militants. Secunder Kermani, BBC News, Kabul Both the Taliban and IS seem now to be focusing their energies on carrying out attacks in Kabul. Government officials say it is a response to progress made by the security forces elsewhere in the country. US air strikes have helped push the Taliban back from some parts of Helmand Province for example. However, it could also just be that the militants have decided attacking the capital is a more effective way of undermining confidence in the government and attracting international attention than trying to capture and retain territory in rural areas. The chief of the Afghan intelligence services said on Sunday he believed the upsurge in attacks was a response to increased US pressure on Pakistan. The US and Afghanistan accuse Pakistan of providing safe havens to militants and President Donald Trump recently suspended security aid to Islamabad. Pakistan has denied the claims. Whatever the reason, it is clear that violence in Kabul is on the rise. Apart from the ambulance bomb and the attack on the academy, an aid agency and a hotel have been targeted in the past week. â¢ IS said it had carried out a suicide attack on the international charity Save the Children, in the city of Jalalabad last week. killing three members of staff and at least two others On 20 January,another attack on a Kabul hotel killed 22 people- mostly foreigners. Six militants stormed the hotel in suicide vests the attack continued for several hours until Afghan troops regained control of the building In October, 176 people were killed in bomb attacks across Afghanistan in one week. The country's security forces in particular have suffered heavy casualties at the hands of the Taliban, who want to re-impose their strict version of Islamic law in the country. In May, 150 people were killed by a suicide bomb attack in Kabul. The Taliban denied any role, but the Afghan government says its affiliate, the Haqqani group, carried it out with support from Pakistan. The Taliban control large swathes of Afghanistan - but IS militants hold sway in a much smaller number of districts. However, both groups have demonstrated their ability to hit targets across the country. They have often come into conflict with each other, too. How successful has IS been in Afghanistan?

Separatist clashes flare in south Yemen,"A rift has opened between two forces that were formerly on the same side Separatists in southern Yemen have seized government buildings in the city of Aden amid fierce clashes with forces of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Prime Minister Ahmed bin Dagher has accused the separatists of mounting a coup. Aden serves as a temporary base of the Hadi government, with Houthi rebels controlling the capital Sanaa. Fighting subsided late on Sunday evening as both sides ordered their forces to stand down. Government forces called on Yemen's Arab neighbours to intervene and help calm the situation. Dozens of people are reported injured, and at least 10 people have died. The development further complicates an already dire situation in Yemen, where millions need aid. The modern state of Yemen was formed in 1990 from the merger of South Yemen and North Yemen, and separatist desires for an independent southern state have not gone away. The separatists have been backing the government against the Houthis, but long-simmering tensions have flared in recent weeks, with the separatists accusing the government of corruption and discrimination. Fighting broke out on Sunday after a deadline set by the separatists for Mr Hadi to dismiss Mr Dagher and his cabinet.

Prime Minister Dagher called on the ""decision maker"" UAE to take action, warning that the clashes would advantage the Houthis. President Hadi, who is based in Saudi Arabia, called for a ceasefire, while his government ordered loyalist troops back to their barracks. Troops from both Saudi and the UAE - present in Aden when fighting erupted - did not intervene, reports said. The Houthis remain in control of Sanaa and territory in the north and west. They seized the capital in 2014, prompting the Saudi-led coalition to intervene on the side of the government.

""People want them to stop, they don't want these kind of shootings in their area and they want these people to go away."" Speaking about the Ballymurphy shooting, West Belfast Sinn FÃ©in MP Paul Maskey said his reaction was ""one of horror"". ""No-one, whether it's community representatives, whether it's neighbours, whether it's anyone around these streets wants to see this activity,"" he added. Mr Maskey's party colleague councillor Steven Corr said such attacks were ""unwelcome and unwanted"". He told BBC Radio Ulster: ""Three men, believed to be masked, turned up at the door and gained entry. ""We're not too sure if they forced entry... but they went inside and they shot one of the occupants."" Mr Corr added: ""There are a lot of elderly people living there, so obviously when shots are discharged in any street in a built-up area it causes and creates alarm among the local population.""

Cambodia charges group with 'making porn',"Cambodian police have published a group shot of the 10 arrested foreigners Prosecutors in Cambodia have charged 10 foreigners, including five Britons, with producing pornographic images. They were arrested on Thursday after images emerged of people appearing to imitate sex acts at a party in a villa in Siem Reap in the north-west. If convicted, they could face up to a year in prison. Also among those arrested are citizens of Canada, New Zealand, the Netherlands and Norway, reports say. However several people in the pictures from the party do not appear among those held, reports say. Britain's Foreign Office said it was providing assistance to the UK detainees. Police said the private villa was a stop on an organised pub crawl, the Press Association reports. Images posted on an expat-run website showed several clothed couples on the floor of the villa, apparently acting out sexual positions. One member of the group told PA from prison that about 30 police officers had entered the villa in a ""confusing"" raid. ""They raided, rounded us up, there was about 80 to 100 people at this party, some of them were tourists."" The mother of one member of the group told PA the detainees had had to sign papers written in Khmer ""not knowing what they"" were. A police handout picture of people appearing to imitate sex acts at a party Siem Reap is popular with tourists because it is close to the famous ancient ruins of Angkor Wat, Cambodia's biggest tourist site. Its nightlife scene has rapidly grown over the past few years as it has become more accessible to backpackers and budget travellers. This has sometimes placed tourists at odds with Cambodia's socially conservative culture. Duong Thavry, chief of the Anti-Human Trafficking and Juvenile Protection Department in Siem Reap, told AFP news agency the group had been arrested ""because they committed activities that are against our culture"".

Brits can book ahead to win sunbed raceThomas Cook is to offer holidaymakers the chance to choose their lounger before they have left home.3m4 minutes agoUK,"UK holidaymakers are to be offered the chance to choose their sunbed before they have even left home. Thomas Cook's trial scheme will allow customers to pay Â£22 to book a specific lounger in advance of their holiday. They will be able to pick their preferred location from a map, which will also allow customers to work out when each spot will get sun and shade. Only some sunbeds will be bookable as part of the scheme, which is being trialled in three hotels next month. The travel firm's ""Choose Your Favourite Sunbed"" service will then be available in 30 hotels this summer. For customers who do not want to pay the premium, a proportion of sunbeds at those hotels will not be part of the scheme. The service comes after a number ofvideos were posted online in recent months showing British holidaymakers sprinting to get sunbeds,externalearly in the morning. Thomas Cook's UK managing director Chris Mottershead said the initiative will particularly help ""families that want to secure a number of beds together in a specific spot"". It says it is the UK's first package holiday company to provide such a service and follows the trial scheme it introduced last year allowing customers to select their hotel room before the start of their trip.

Separatist clashes flare in south YemenSouthern separatists seize government buildings in Aden as they fight the president's forces.,"A rift has opened between two forces that were formerly on the same side Separatists in southern Yemen have seized government buildings in the city of Aden amid fierce clashes with forces of President Abdrabbuh Mansour Hadi. Prime Minister Ahmed bin Dagher has accused the separatists of mounting a coup. Aden serves as a temporary base of the Hadi government, with Houthi rebels controlling the capital Sanaa. Fighting subsided late on Sunday evening as both sides ordered their forces to stand down. Government forces called on Yemen's Arab neighbours to intervene and help calm the situation. Dozens of people are reported injured, and at least 10 people have died. The development further complicates an already dire situation in Yemen, where millions need aid. The modern state of Yemen was formed in 1990 from the merger of South Yemen and North Yemen, and separatist desires for an independent southern state have not gone away. The separatists have been backing the government against the Houthis, but long-simmering tensions have flared in recent weeks, with the separatists accusing the government of corruption and discrimination. Fighting broke out on Sunday after a deadline set by the separatists for Mr Hadi to dismiss Mr Dagher and his cabinet.

The southern separatists are backed by the United Arab Emirates (UAE), which is also part of the Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthis. Prime Minister Dagher called on the ""decision maker"" UAE to take action, warning that the clashes would advantage the Houthis. President Hadi, who is based in Saudi Arabia, called for a ceasefire, while his government ordered loyalist troops back to their barracks. Troops from both Saudi and the UAE - present in Aden when fighting erupted - did not intervene, reports said. The Houthis remain in control of Sanaa and territory in the north and west. They seized the capital in 2014, prompting the Saudi-led coalition to intervene on the side of the government.

Tories urged to 'come together' amid rowsDavid Lidington urges unity amid criticism of Brexit negotiations and policy making.8h8 hours agoUK Politics,"This video can not be played David Lidington, minister for the Cabinet Office, says the Conservative ""family"" should think about more than Brexit Conservatives must ""come together in a spirit of mutual respect"", a cabinet minister says amid backbench criticism over Brexit and policy direction. David Lidington told the BBC the ""left, right and centre"" of the party should look at the ""bigger picture"". One Tory MP tweeted: ""We need to get a grip and lead"" while another urged ""less policy making by tortoise"". Ex-cabinet minister Theresa Villiers joined those concerned the UK would remain in the EU ""in all but name"". Criticisms over the government's Brexit negotiations began on Thursday when influential backbencher Jacob Rees-Mogg accused UK negotiators of being ""cowed by the EU"". Others were annoyed by Chancellor Philip Hammond's suggestion that changes to the UK-EU relations after Brexit could be ""very modest"". Trump 'would've done Brexit differently' Laura Kuenssberg: Tories' Brexit agonies resurface Davis plays down Tory Brexit row Rees-Mogg and Hammond at odds over Brexit But wider criticisms of Downing Street's direction were voiced on Sunday, amid newspaper headlines about ""Tories in Turmoil"", with backbencher Heidi Allentweeting,externalthat the party needed to ""get a grip"", adding: ""We are letting this country down."" The Conservative chairman of the education selected committee, Robert Halfon, said more needed to be done to tackle social injustice, telling the BBC: ""We need to have less policy-making by tortoise and [more] policy making by lion."" And fellow backbencher Nigel Mills, told BBC Radio 4 that progress in education had ""stalled"", adding: ""I think the frustration is that the prime minister had the right drive and the right belief when she came into office and it's hard to see how we're making progress on that."" But Cabinet Office minister Mr Lidington told The Andrew Marr Show: ""I think what I say to all my colleagues is the Conservative family - left, right and centre, because we're a broad church - needs to come together in a spirit of mutual respect, there are differences in any broad church, and look at what the bigger picture is showing."" The party was still ""neck and neck"" with Labour in the polls after eight years of government, as well as ""taking seats off them"" in local government elections, he added. Mr Lidington's message was echoed by Culture Secretary Matt Hancock, who told BBC One's Breakfast on Monday: ''The prime minister has shown leadership in a number of areas.... there are many challenges that Britain faces and we need to face them together and deal with them. I think we should pull together and back her.'' The UK is due to leave the European Union in March 2019, and among the key questions in negotiations between the two sides is how close their trading relationship will be in the future. This video can not be played Theresa Villiers MP: ""If you go too far with compromise... we wouldn't genuinely be leaving"" Former Northern Ireland Secretary Ms Villiers, who campaigned for the UK to leave the EU in the 2016 referendum,wrote in the Sunday Telegraph,,externalthat there was ""a real danger"" the UK would sign up to an agreement with Brussels which could ""keep us in the EU in all but name"". She told the BBC's Sunday Politics: ""There is only so far you can go with compromise without ultimately finding yourself in a position where you're selling out all the people who voted to leave."" Although 29 March 2019 is the official Brexit date, the UK will continue to allow free movement of people, goods and money for about two years to allow businesses to adjust. The EU is seeking to tighten the conditions which will apply to the UK during the transitional period, according to a draft of revised EU guidelines. Mr Lidington said there would be ""big, big differences"" to the relationship during that period, and that Britain would have the option to move away from EU rules. ""The bill in front of Parliament extinguishes the power of the European Court (of Justice) and supranational EU law over the UK. ""We will have, from next year, a registration system we've not had before for EU nationals coming to this country. ""Of course we will have the power to choose for ourselves whether or not to diverge once we have left the supranational legal structures of the EU,"" he added. Meanwhile, former Tory party chairman Grant Shapps has urged the prime minister to ""name a date"" when she will stand down,according to the Mail on Sunday.,external Mr Shapps said he had not submitted a letter to the party's 1922 Committee, calling for a leadership contest, but added ""an increasing number of my colleagues have"".

"Corbyn pledges 8,000 homes for homelessHe says councils would also get powers to take over ""deliberately kept empty properties"".","This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says he would give immediate housing to those that are currently homeless Labour is pledging to provide 8,000 homes ""immediately"" to house people with a history of rough sleeping, should it win power. Party leader Jeremy Corbyn said they would also help councils ""take over"" properties kept empty deliberately. He said the scale of homelessness was ""disgusting"" and ""wholly unnecessary"". Conservative David Lidington said the reasons for rough sleeping were complex and the government had set ambitious targets to reduce it. Outlining Labour's plans, Mr Corbyn pledged more council properties with lifetime tenancies at secure rent, and more intervention into the private rented sector. Asked what a Labour government could do for people who were already homeless, Mr Corbyn told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show: ""Immediately purchase 8,000 properties across the country to give emergency housing to those people who are currently homeless and at the same time require local authorities to build far more."" A party spokesman later clarified that the 8,000 properties would not be bought using compulsory purchase powers but would be acquired by ""immediately striking a deal"" with housing associations to free them up as they fell vacant. They would then be replaced by new properties to be built under Labour's pledged house building programme. Rough sleeping rises for seventh year Homeless-by-sea Mr Corbyn went on: ""We would give local authorities the power to take over deliberately kept empty properties, because there is something grossly insulting about the idea you would build some luxury block and deliberately keep it empty. ""Surely we have to have a social objective and a social priority in our society?"", he said. Labour says they would work with charities and outreach workers to identify rough sleepers and offer them accommodation ""as quickly as possible"" and tenancies could be modelled on schemes already in place - such as the""clearing house"" scheme operated by the St Mungo's charity,externalin London. The party says it would make better use of existing ""empty dwelling management orders"" - which give councils powers to let out properties which have been vacant for at least two years, with some exemptions including for second homes, people taken into care and armed services personnel on active service. New figures out last week showed rough sleeping in England had increased for the seventh year in a row. There were 4,751 people counted or estimated to be bedding down outside in autumn 2017, a 15% rise on the year before and more than double the figure recorded five years ago. Conservative Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said there were ""a number of different reasons"" rough sleeping had gone up - including mental health issues and drug and alcohol problems. ""We have pledged to halve rough sleeping by 2022 and eliminate it by 2027,"" he said. ""We have backed new legislation which is enabling us, with local authorities, to address the reasons why people become homeless and sleep rough, so that we prevent it, rather than try to deal with the problem when it occurs.""

Howard Lew Lewis, who also appeared in Blackadder, died on 20 January in an Edinburgh hospital, aged 76. His daughter Debora Milazzo claims he had been placed on a regime of high-dose sedatives and maximum-strength opiate painkillers. Police Scotland confirmed it was investigating the complaint. The death is being treated as ""unexplained"". The actor, known as Lewy, died in Ellen's Glen House, a community hospital in Edinburgh just over a week ago. He was being treated for dementia. Ms Milazzo told the BBC Scotland News website: ""I'm trying to get justice for my dad. ""I want Police Scotland to investigate my dad's case."" She claims Mr Lewis had been needlessly placed on the kind of treatment plan that would be prescribed for the terminal phase of a malignant disease. Ms Milazzo insisted her father had not received a terminal diagnosis. She said: ""My father didn't have cancer, he didn't have heart disease. Lew Lewis, back, with Maid Marian co-stars (left to right) Tony Robinson, Danny John-Jules, Kate Lonergan, Wayne Morris and Mike Edmonds ""They suddenly just changed his medication and it was the new medication that killed him.""

Scientists say skeleton was a 'good looking chap'VideoVideoHero fiancÃ© tackles jewellery thief,"This video can not be played Scientists examine Bronze age bones from Northumberland field Forensic scientists have been analysing Bronze Age bones found in a field - but how do they work out who the person was? In September 2017, afarmer near Rock, Northumberland, preparing his field for drainagediscovered a burial cist - or stone coffin - containing a skeleton and a jug. Sanita Nezirovic, a lecturer in forensic science at the University of Derby, was tasked with finding out whose bones they were. She has looked at the remains of hundreds of people, dating from the Bronze Age to modern times. In each case she creates a ""presumptive profile"", detailing facts such as the person's sex, age and height. Sanita Nezirovic has been investigating the Bronze Age remains These are determined on the balance of probabilities: for example, if she has a pelvis and a skull of someone over 18, then she can be 90% accurate on their sex. In this case, Ms Nezirovic had the skull and various other bones which, from the state of fusion, she could determine to be an adult. A more specific age will be sought later. The bones had been largely preserved by some form of blanket, possibly horse hair, used to cover the body when it was buried. The body had been covered with some form of blanket, possibly horse hair, parts of which remain The first job is determining a sex. Looking at five points on the skull, such as the brow, chin and crest at the back of the head, Ms Nezirovic grades its features out of five, one being feminine and five being masculine. She is 60 to 70% satisfied the Rock remains belonged to a man. And he was a handsome one as well. ""The shape of his head is beautiful, and you can see from the teeth he would have had a perfect smile,"" she said. The person had a ""beautiful symmetric"" skull ""This was a good-looking chap."" Her next job was determining the age. The development of a flake of bone on the clavicle allows her to say he was aged between 17 and 21. The development of a flake on the clavicle provides a good indicator of age ""That's not a bad age range at all,"" she said. ""It's better than the 29 to 89 range, which might sometimes be the closest we can get to."" Next Ms Nezirovic attempted to work out his stature or height. The most complete remaining bone is the tibia, Measuring that and applying a formula to it provides a height range of between 1.72m and 1.79m. There are no obvious signs of trauma so it is not possible to say how he died. The Bronze Age remains were found in a cist in a field But, by looking at the area around the nose and forehead, it can be determined he was a Caucasian. And the circumstances of his burial would suggest he had been an important man. ""He was on his own, had a beaker buried with him and was covered,"" Ms Nezirovic said. ""All of these things suggest he was not an ordinary man; he would have been someone. ""He is absolutely stunning.""

Putin critic's offices raided amid protestsThe Russian opposition leader has been freed after being arrested during a nationwide day of protest.2h2 hours agoEurope,"This video can not be played The BBC's Steve Rosenberg: ""We were standing right next to Mr Navalny... it was very dramatic"" Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny has been freed after detained by police at a Moscow rally in support of a presidential election boycott. His lawyer told the press that he had been released without charge but will have to appear in court at a later date and may then face charges. Earlier, police raided his offices in Moscow, reportedly seizing equipment. Mr Navalny - President Vladimir Putin's most vocal critic - is barred from standing in the 18 March election. BBC footage showed him being wrestled to the ground by policemen during the arrest. Soon afterwards the opposition leader tweeted to urge others to join protests across the country. ""The detention of one person is meaningless if there are many of us. Someone, come and replace me,"" he wrote (in Russian). Navalny: Russia's vociferous opposition leader Protest rallies were held in a number of Russian cities. In Moscow and St Petersburg they were not sanctioned by authorities. More than 180 people were detained across the country, reports say. Earlier on Sunday, Russian police raided the property of Mr Navalny's anti-corruption organisation in Moscow.A YouTube clip showed a broadcast recording from the office being interrupted,external. A spokesman for Mr Navalny said the officers used a power tool to break into the office, adding that they said they were investigating a bomb threat. Alexei Navalny has said that the upcoming Russian presidential election is ""dishonest"" The demonstrations come after weeks of pressure on Mr Navalny's supporters across Russia, who have faced detentions and had leaflets in support of the rallies confiscated. Mr Navalny's supporters attend a rally in the city of Vladivostok calling for a boycott of the election Mr Navalny, who insists he would beat Mr Putin in a fair fight, is barred from running in the ballot over a criminal conviction that he says is politically motivated. The opposition leader led mass street protests against Mr Putin in the winter of 2011-12 and was arrested three times in 2017 for organising unauthorised anti-Putin protests. Mr Putin, who refuses to mention Mr Navalny by name, retains a massive approval rating in Russia and is widely expected to win a fourth six-year term in office.

It takes more than a few singers and rappers to impress this celebrity child. Bruno Mars again. He's defied all the critics to beat Kendrick to the final award of the night and steal a dramatic 6-5 victory at the death. ""Don't cut me off Grammys please,"" Bruno pleaded, after having earlier been somewhat curtailed in his acceptance speech. ""I've been drinking a little bit and celebrating,"" he confessed, before telling a heart-warming tale about how his 15-year-old self used to sing for his supper to tourists in Hawaii. Apparently, all he's ever wanted to do is share the love and make people dance. Oh and ""sprinkle Mars sauce"" on his favourite tracks. Other sauces are available. He was given his award by Bono and The Edge from U2 who stressed what a ""big big deal"" the award was and how important it is not to come out on stage ""like an ass"". The singer performs rapper Logic's suicide prevention track 1-800-273-8255 alongside another new artist nominee Khalid who has failed to convert any of his five nominations. The trio are backed up by a huge group of suicide survivors and friends and relatives of suicide victims standing silent, wearing t-shirt that bear the slogan 'You Are Not Alone'. The Maryland-born rapper finishes the track with an impassioned plea, saying ""Bring us you're tired, you're poor and any immigrant that seeks refuge."" This is what young people are talking about when they say 'woke'. Tonight, we've already seen tributes to two rock 'n' roll greats that we lost last year in Chuck Berry and Fats Domino. Now a third - Tom Petty - has been honoured with an acoustic performance of his track Wildflowers, by country album winner Chris Stapleton and all round country legend Emmlyou Harris.  The Academy then rattled through a montage of other stricken artists from the past 12 months; including Glen Campbell, Joni Sledge, Chris Cornell and Chester Bennington. Their music lives on. She missed out on the best new artist, by a singer whose album was out in 2016, but SZA proved her mettle with a great solo performance of Broken Clocks. Its a confident performance by a woman whose star is most definitely on the rise, even if it does look like someone has attacked her trousers and top with a hedge strimmer. We even have a shower of sparks raining down on the stage. Bravo. That man, Bruno Mars, for 24K Magic. That's five for Bruno now, which puts him level with Ken. He thanked ""My lady Jessica for being my rock"" and his dear old dad, saying; ""Look at me Pop, I'm at The Grammys!"" He was presented with his award by Alicia Keys, who said she prefers it when the Grammys are in her home city and not in LA as normal.

"Two shot in separate attacks in BelfastPolice say the victims, aged 26 and 41, have sustained ""potentially life-changing injuries"".1han hour agoNorthern Ireland","Police at the scene of the Ballymurphy atack Two men have been shot in separate so-called 'paramilitary-style' attacks an hour apart in west and north Belfast. A 41-year-old man was shot five times in his arms and legs when a gang entered his home at Ballymurphy in the west of the city on Sunday evening. In north Belfast, a 26-year-old man was shot three times in his legs at his home in Upper Meadow Street, New Lodge. Police said both victims have sustained ""potentially life-changing injuries"" and were taken to hospital. The 41-year-old victim was shot at a house in Divismore Park and the attack was reported to police at about 19:35 GMT. No-one else was in the property at the time of the shooting. The second shooting was reported at about 20:30 GMT. A PSNI spokesman described both incidents as ""terrifying"" paramilitary-style attacks in the victims' own homes. ""It is another example of a criminal group trying to control a community by the use of weapons, fear and violence."" Sinn FÃ©in north Belfast councillor JJ Magee described the New Lodge shooting as ""brutal"" and said there had been a number of such attacks in the area. ""These shootings must stop,"" he said. ""People want them to stop, they don't want these kind of shootings in their area and they want these people to go away."" Speaking about the Ballymurphy shooting, West Belfast Sinn FÃ©in MP Paul Maskey said his reaction was ""one of horror"". ""No-one, whether it's community representatives, whether it's neighbours, whether it's anyone around these streets wants to see this activity,"" he added. Mr Maskey's party colleague councillor Steven Corr said such attacks were ""unwelcome and unwanted"". He told BBC Radio Ulster: ""Three men, believed to be masked, turned up at the door and gained entry. ""We're not too sure if they forced entry... but they went inside and they shot one of the occupants."" Mr Corr added: ""There are a lot of elderly people living there, so obviously when shots are discharged in any street in a built-up area it causes and creates alarm among the local population.""

"'Rogue' parking companies face crackdownNew legislation aimed at raising standards will ban ""dodgy"" firms from issuing charges.20h20 hours agoUK","""Rogue"" parking companies will be banned from accessing driver data and issuing charges as part of plans to stop ""unscrupulous operators"". The government has confirmed it will support new legislation aimed at raising standards among parking firms. Sajid Javid, the communities secretary, said the legislation will provide ""fair, clear and consistent"" regulation of the parking industry. It comes as firms issue almost 13 times more tickets than a decade ago. Drivers' growing disquiet about the rules on parking are underlined by figures showing nearly 10,000 people approached the Citizens Advice Bureau for guidance on parking tickets last year. There are complaints of inconsistent practices, substandard signage, confusing appeals processes and intimidating payment letters, said the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government. Private parking charges: Your rights MSP calls for private parking law change Conservative MP Sir Greg Knight's Parking (Code of Practice) Bill to tackle rogue parking operators is due for its second reading in the House of Commons on Friday, effectively guaranteeing its passage into law. Firms which don't obey the rules will be blocked from accessing drivers' DVLA records. This will prevent the firms from issuing charges, effectively forcing them out of the industry. Mr Javid said drivers have suffered for too long ""at the hands of dodgy parking firms"". He said: ""That is why government is putting the brakes on these rogue operators and backing new laws that will put a stop to aggressive behaviour and provide a simpler way for drivers to appeal fines."" The department hopes motoring groups and other experts will help the Communities Secretary to develop the code of practice. Steve Gooding, director of the RAC Foundation, said the move would bring ""some much-needed regulatory rigour to the world of private parking"". He added: ""Drivers don't want a parking free-for-all, but they do want a system that is fair to all parties and that's what a code of practice set by government - rather than the industry itself - should bring about.""

"New York investigates 'follower factory'It comes after a report traces links between a company, millions of bots and various celebrities.1han hour agoUS & Canada","New York's chief prosecutor says the state is opening an investigation into a firm that allegedly sold millions of fake followers to social media users. ""Impersonation and deception are illegal under New York law,"" said Eric Schneiderman. The company, Devumi, stands accused of stealing real people's identities, which it denies, according to the New York Times. The paper linked the ""follower factory"" to a host of celebrity accounts. The New York Times published an in-depth report on Devumi on Saturday,external, including interviews with people who alleged their account details and profile pictures had been copied to create realistic ""bots"". It is alleged that others who wanted to increase their follower count, including actors, entrepreneurs and political commentators, could then pay to be followed by the bots. On social media, high follower accounts boost influence, which can impact public opinion, or bring advantages, such as job offers or sponsorship deals, to account holders. Mr Schneiderman said he was concerned that such ""opaque"" operations were undermining democracy. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The platform does allow automated accounts, but it strictly prohibits them being bought or sold. It says it will suspend accounts that are found to have purchased followers, retweets or likes. However, a representative told the New York Times it rarely does this in practice, as it is hard to prove. The report alleges that Devumi has a stock of at least 3.5 million automated accounts, many of which are sold repeatedly. It alleges at least 55,000 of the accounts ""use the names, profile pictures, hometowns and other personal details of real Twitter users, including minors"". ""These accounts are counterfeit coins in the booming economy of online influence, reaching into virtually any industry where a mass audience â or the illusion of it â can be monetized. Fake accounts, deployed by governments, criminals and entrepreneurs, now infest social media networks,"" they wrote. The New York Times found many well-known Twitter accounts have followers from the Devumi ""factory"". It said the company's clients covered the political spectrum, from liberal cable pundits to a reporter at the right-wing site Breitbart and an editor at China's state-run news agency, Xinhua. Martha Lane Fox:Entrepreneur and member of the UK's House of Lords Martha Lane Fox's Twitter account showed ""a series of follower purchases spanning more than a year"", including a 25,000-follower boost days after she became a Twitter board member in April 2016. She told the New York Times a ""rogue employee"" was responsible. Paul Hollywood:British TV chef The investigation showed Devumi-managed bots following Paul Hollywood's official Twitter profile. Shortly after the paper emailed him to ask questions, his account was deleted. Hilary Rosen:political commentator The CNN contributor has paid for over 500,000 Twitter followers - although most have been deleted. She said it was ""an experiment I did several years ago to see how it worked"". Randy Bryce:US ironworker turned politician On Saturday, Mr Bryce - who is trying to unseat Republican Paul Ryan in Congress - said, on Twitter, that he bought the followers as an experiment in 2015, when he was a blogger.
