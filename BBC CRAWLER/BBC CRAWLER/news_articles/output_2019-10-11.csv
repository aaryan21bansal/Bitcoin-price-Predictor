"100,000 flee as Turkey steps up Syria offensive","This video can not be played The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict Some 100,000 people have fled their homes in north Syria, the UN reports, as Turkey presses on with its cross-border offensive on Kurdish-held areas. Many people are sheltering in schools or other buildings in Hassakeh city and the town of Tal Tamer, the UN says. Turkey took action on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled American troops out of the area. At least 11 civilians have died. Humanitarian groups say the number of people affected will rise further. Child refugees arrive in Syria's north-western Hassakeh province Dozens of fighters from the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) and pro-Turkish factions have been killed. The first death of a Turkish soldier was confirmed by Turkey's military. Analysts say the US withdrawal in effect gave Turkey the green light to begin its cross-border assault. Much of the region has been outside the control of the Syrian government as a consequence of the civil war which began in 2011. It has been controlled by the SDF since 2015. The SDF have been key allies of the US in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group but Turkey regards the Kurdish militias of the SDF as ""terrorists"" who support an anti-Turkish insurgency. Turkey's Syria offensive explained in four maps Who are the Kurds? Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained Turkey defended its offensive as a bid to create a ""safe zone"" free of Kurdish militias which could also house Syrian refugees. ""We will not stop it no matter what anyone says,"" President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said on Friday. One major concern for the international community is the fate of thousands of suspected IS prisoners, including many foreign nationals, being guarded by Kurdish-led forces in the region. This video can not be played Residents who have fled the city of Ras al-Ain wait at a shelter On Friday, IS said it had planted a car bomb that killed six people - civilians and members of the security forces - in the border town of Qamishli on Friday. Meanwhile, US media report that an explosion occurred near a US base in Kobane, but no injuries have been reported. On Thursday, Turkish troops partly encircled the towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad. But while the Turkish military said its operation was going to plan, Kurdish sources and activists from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the offensive had not made much progress. Trump's week of confusion over Syria Turkey Syria offensive: Your questions answered Four maps explaining the offensive 'The Kurds have no friends but the mountains' Turkish warplanes have struck targets in both towns, and video footage has shown columns of smoke rising above them. Tal Abyad's only public hospital has been forced to close. The Kurdish Red Crescent said there had been 11 confirmed civilian deaths so far and 28 serious injuries, mostly in Ras al-Ain and another border town, Qamishli. Some are children. At least five people, including a Syrian baby, were reportedly killed in Kurdish shelling of Turkish border towns. The SOHR reported at least 29 deaths among the SDF and 17 from among pro-Turkish Syrian rebels (known as the Syrian National Army), as more than 10 villages fell into Turkish hands. This video can not be played Footage from the start of the Turkish offensive In a later report they said that seven members of pro-Turkish forces including a Turkish soldier had been killed as the SDF retook a village in Tal Abyad region. Could Turkish offensive unleash IS threat? 'The Kurds have no friends but the mountains' What did the Kurds ever do for the US? Turkey's military confirmed a soldier's death, and said three others had been wounded. Turkey's Anadolu news agency said late on Thursday 228 Kurdish militants had been ""neutralised"" since the start of the operation. The casualty reports could not be independently verified. A refugee crisis is developing.The UN's Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs (OCHA) gave the figure of 100,000,externalbut aid groups say as many as 450,000 people could be forced to move. Residents flee their home town of Ras al-Ain According to aid workers on the ground, the vast majority of civilians have fled Tal Abyad and those who remain fear for their lives. OCHA said the Turkish bombardment had affected key civilian infrastructure such as water stations. Thousands of people could lose adequate access to clean water in the Hassakeh region, it reports. Turkey wants to create a ""safe zone"" running for 480km (300 miles) along the Syrian side of the border but says it will not advance deeper than a planned 32km limit. On Friday Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had shared ""serious concerns"" about the operation in a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. He expected Turkey, a Nato member, to ""act with restraint"", he added. Mr Erdogan has strongly defended the incursion, threatening to send some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it hosts to Europe if the Turkish offensive is described as an occupation. Also on Friday, US Secretary of Defence Mark Esper said the Turkish operation ""risks the security of ISIS prison camps"" and could further destabilise the region. He added that the US was ""not abandoning"" its Kurdish partners there. US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said that President Donald Trump had authorised new sanctions on Turkey, but added that the US had not yet chosen to activate them. The SDF say they are holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been revealed, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border. This video can not be played Inside the camp of IS families in Syria Two camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the ""safe zone"". On Friday the Kurdish-led authorities said discussions were under way on how to move the Ain Issa camp, which had been hit by shelling. Turkey has said it will take responsibility for the IS prisoners it found during its offensive. Are you in the affected area?

'Only big changes' will tackle climate change,"Experts expect more extreme weather in future The UK government must tell the public small, easy changes will not be enough to tackle climate change, warn experts. Researchers from Imperial College London say we must eat less meat and dairy, swap cars for bikes, take fewer flights, and ditch gas boilers at home. The report, seen by BBC Panorama, has been prepared for the Committee on Climate Change, which advises ministers how to cut the UK's carbon footprint. It says an upheaval in our lifestyles is the only way to meet targets. The government has passed a law obliging the country to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. It is ""going further and faster than any other developed nation to protect the planet for future generations"", a government spokesperson told BBC Panorama. ""If we can go faster, we will."" But the new report warns major shifts in policy across huge areas of government activity are needed to keep the public onside. Chris Stark, the Chief Executive of the Committee on Climate Change, tells Panorama the government's plan for cutting emissions is ""not nearly at the level of ambition required"". ""Every bit of policy now needs to be refreshed,"" he warned in an interview with BBC Panorama. Climate change: UK government to commit to 2050 target Ditch cars to meet climate change targets, say MPs Climate change: 12 years to save the planet? Make that 18 months The new report, called Behaviour Change, Public Engagement and Net Zero, amounts to an extensive ""to-do"" list for government. It says subsidies for fossil fuels have to go and taxes on low-carbon technologies must be cut. At the same time, consumers need to be given far more information on the environmental consequences of their actions. It also urges the government to consider introducing a carbon tax, increasing the prices of carbon-intensive products and activities. It is an ambitious agenda but necessary, the report says, if Britain is to achieve its Net Zero ambitions. ""These changes need not be expensive or reduce well-being,"" the report concludes, ""but they will not happen at the pace required unless policy first removes obstacles to change in markets and consumer choice."" Justin tucks into a ""bug burger"": There needs to be a shift to lower carbon foods, such as mealworm Food currently accounts for 30% of a household's carbon footprint in high-income countries like the UK. The report says we need to make a significant shift towards lower-carbon foods, particularly towards more plant-based diets. Producing food from animals uses more resources than food from plants. Some animals, like cows and sheep, also produce and burp up methane - a powerful greenhouse gas. The Committee on Climate Change's official recommendation to government is that a 20% cut in red meat and dairy is needed - the emissions from the other 80% will have to be matched by CO2 that has been captured and stored permanently in order to meet the net zero ambition. The report implies a bigger shift in diets could be needed, and says one way to get people to change will be to emphasise the health benefits this could bring. Another will be to give people much more information on the environmental impact of different foods.  It calls for mandatory carbon impact labelling on products, on till receipts, and via shopping websites and apps. Once consumers understand the environmental impact of different food choices, the report argues, government should begin to increase the price of foods that involve high emissions. It suggests this could be done by cutting farm subsidies - more than 70% of which go to livestock - and by raising VAT on these products. Home heating burns a lot of carbon Home heating is the single biggest challenge in terms of reducing UK emissions, according to Chris Stark of the Committee on Climate Change. It accounts for 21% of a household's carbon footprint and it will be costly to bring it down. With 30 million homes and 30 years to decarbonise, he argues, ""simple arithmetic"" suggests we need to ""decarbonise"" one million homes every year, starting now. The Behaviour Change report has a whole catalogue of policy recommendations here.  As with electric vehicles, decarbonisation of UK electricity creates opportunities for low-carbon heating systems, in particular air-source heat pumps, which extract heat from air outside the home and remove cold air from inside. The report recommends a ""rebalancing"" of the tax and regulatory costs on energy, which currently fall more heavily on electricity than gas. VAT on installation of insulation and low-carbon heating systems should be removed. At the same time, consumers need to be offered a range of incentives to encourage the use of low-carbon technology. According to Chris Stark: ""We haven't even started nibbling away at that heat challenge in any real sense. We need a real plan, and the sooner we do, the cheaper it will be overall."" Cycle lanes can cut the risk of accidents Transport currently accounts for 34% of a household's carbon footprint. The report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling. It says what's needed is a ""modal shift"" to public transport, walking and cycling and believes the public can be encouraged to do this, in part, because of the health benefits it would bring. However, it recognises the UK's progress in decarbonising electricity creates an opportunity for consumers to reduce emissions by switching to electric vehicles and urges greater subsidies for new electric car purchases. Electricity companies need to be encouraged to introduce smart EV charging systems so customers can charge their vehicles when electricity is cheap or when renewable power is plentiful and there needs to be a massive rollout of charging infrastructure along motorways, in towns and in cities. Measures to cut flight numbers are needed Here, the report says policy-makers need to focus on the 15% of the population that are estimated to take 70% of flights. It calls for an ""Air Miles Levy"" to discourage what it calls ""excessive flying"", something the Committee on Climate Change hasalready proposed. The idea is to penalise frequent flyers, while not raising prices for people taking an annual holiday. It says air miles and frequent flier reward schemes have to go and passengers need to be given much more information about the emissions generated by flights.

Financial crisis threatens historic blind school,"One of the country's most historic educational centres for young blind people is warning that financial pressures are threatening its survival. The Royal National College for the Blind, which has operated for almost 150 years, says without extra funding it will cease to be sustainable. Lucy Proctor, chief executive of the college's charitable trust, has blamed a squeeze on special-needs budgets. But the government is promising a Â£700m increase for special needs. Lord Blunkett, a former student at the college, said he was ""very concerned"" about the ""financial difficulty"". The former education secretary said a ""unique national asset"" was at risk. Ms Proctor says there might be a perception that the Hereford college must be well-resourced. ""Even the name makes us sound wealthy,"" she says. Chief executive Lucy Proctor says a national centre should not depend on local funding But accounts show a shortfall of Â£2.7m between income and spending - and in cash terms the college has a smaller income than six years ago. Even with a recent sale of land, a restructuring and a hiring out of sports facilities, there is still a cash shortage. As well as A-levels and vocational qualifications, the students, aged 16 to 25, learn practical skills needed by blind people for university or the workplace. The biggest problem, says Ms Proctor, is that the college depends on local authorities paying for residential places, which can cost more than Â£50,000 a year. ""It is difficult for the local authorities, because there isn't enough money in the system. They've been subject to cuts in every area,"" says Ms Proctor. ""We're a national provision, but we're being funded locally."" This means legal wrangles about getting councils to support places - and there are students who should already have started this term who are still at home arguing about funding, she says. Families lose challenge over special needs funding More special needs complaints held School funding to be boosted  by extra Â£7.1bn Extra school cash enough to reverse cuts ""Increasing student numbers is critical - and if student numbers don't go up we won't be financially sustainable,"" she says. At present, about 75 students are living there, but that number would need to rise to more than 90, says Ms Proctor. Brandon, 19, says learning how to be independent has made a ""massive difference"" to him. He is applying to university and has gone from thinking he would be ""stuck in a room"" all his life to feeling confident in travelling around the country. Brandon says the college has helped him to become independent and to address his sense of isolation ""It's so important to have independence - I felt like I couldn't do anything for myself and then I got really depressed thinking I wasn't worth the time and effort. ""No teenager should have to feel so isolated from the world. It's awful. If other people can do it, why can't we? ""In the end you can do whatever you want to if you put your mind to it."" Brandon says having the support of other young people who have faced similar problems, after years of being the ""odd one out"", has also made a big difference. The college is a centre for sport, including ""goalball"", played by people with vision problems ""They've all gone through sight loss, one way or another, in their life. You can put yourself in their shoes because you've gone through it. ""It helps massively because if you're dealing with it on your own it can be a very isolating world. It's so painful."" He says students have stories of being bullied, patronised or written off. It's even small things, says Brandon, like not being embarrassed if his guide dog starts making noises in lessons. He also points out that despite their calm exterior, guide dogs can have ""cheeky days"" and his own had just eaten an entire cheesecake. Sonal says sharing experiences with other young people with visual impairments is as important as the academic study ""It's not just the academic side, but it's the social side,"" says 20-year-old Sonal. ""I really like sharing our experiences,"" she says, after enduring years without friends facing similar challenges. ""I felt like I was the only person with visual impairment."" It also gives her confidence and makes her less self-conscious to learn alongside other people with sight problems, whether it's learning how to get into town or to cook for themselves. Ms Proctor says there is a great deal of information sharing between the young people, swapping apps and technology to assist blind people. She mentions a device that can read the colour of clothing, so that people going to work will not dress in a way that makes them look out of place. Learning to cook is part of the process of becoming independent ""They're learning so much from each other. The friendship groups, the socialisation, is incredibly important,"" she says. The college says only about a quarter of working-age people who are blind or partially sighted are in employment, down from about a third in 2006. The spending review, presented by Chancellor of the Exchequer Sajid Javid in September, also promised more for special-needs funding, alongside a wider school spending increase of Â£7.1bn. ""We're providing over Â£700m to give more support to children and young people with special educational needs - an 11% increase compared to last year,"" the chancellor told MPs last month. The Local Government Association welcomed the extra funding. But Judith Blake, chairwoman of the association's children and young people board, said there were still ""long-term concerns"" about meeting the cost of special educational needs. ""Without certainty over funding for the future the situation is likely to get worse as the number of children who need support continues to increase,"" she said.

Government faces industry backlash on Brexit plans,"The government is facing an unprecedented backlash from five key industries over Boris Johnson's plans for post-Brexit trading arrangements. The aerospace, automotive, chemicals, food and drink and pharmaceutical sectors warn they could pose ""serious risk to manufacturing competitiveness"". Collectively, the sectors employ 1.1 million people, contributing Â£98bn to the UK economy each year. The group has sent a letter to the government highlighting its concerns. The BBC has seen extracts of the letter, which was sent this week to Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and the Cabinet Office minister, Michael Gove. While such bodies have in the past made clear their concern at the prospect of a no-deal Brexit, this is the first time they have directly expressed to government their joint concern about a possible Brexit deal, after mostly supporting Theresa May's negotiated proposal. The letter outlines their growing concern that Boris Johnson's Brexit negotiators have dropped existing commitments to maintain regulatory alignment in relevant sectors. The manufacturers' key concern is that they may no longer participate in specific EU regulatory institutions after any Brexit deal. The group is asking for a ""reassurance"" that industry interests are still being prioritised by EU negotiators, and the letter warns of the ""damage which would be done by the current approach on regulatory divergence"". It says: ""Pan-European regulatory alignment has been a success in our industries, supporting continued creation and retention of highly skilled manufacturing jobs in the UK. ""It is important this regulatory alignment should continue after Brexit as a critical element of the UK's future relationship with the EU"". A government spokesperson said the UK was ""seeking a best in class"" free trade agreement drawing on existing EU deals. ""We have been clear that we are committed to maintaining high standards after we leave the EU,"" the spokesperson said. However the public and private noises emerging from London and Brussels is that the government has markedly changed its plan for a future relationship. They say the new proposal has low alignment with EU regulations, and does not have level playing field conditions attached on the environmental, social and labour standards, as proposed in Theresa May's deal. After failing to get reassurances in recent weeks, particularly on the membership of key EU agencies, various sectors joined forces to warn the government directly. The letter says that the serious risk to manufacturing ""will result in huge new costs and disruption to UK firms"". ""It would be disruptive to our complex international supply chains and has the potential to risk consumer and food safety, and confidence, access to overseas markets for UK exporters and vital future investment in innovation in this country."" This letter sees the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, the Chemical Industries Association, the Food and Drink Federation, and the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry join an existing call from the aerospace industry, reported by the BBC earlier on Friday. The aerospace industry body the ADS wrote to the governmentasking for ""reassurance"" that there would be ""continued membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and alignment with EU chemicals regulations"" which ""are vital for our sector"". Repeated attempts to get clarity on this issue have not reassured the aerospace and other industries on this topic. Other industries have asked for similar reassurances, only to be told in recent weeks that the government is seeking a ""best in class"" free trade agreement, where the UK would set its own regulatory standards. The government has acknowledged that it wants to take the ""level playing field"" arrangements out of the political declaration that promised alignment on environmental, social, labour and some tax measures. These were also seen as crucial to ongoing industrial regulatory co-operation, and preventing the introduction of many types of checks on trade. But the government fears such measures agreed by Theresa May will restrict the ability of a post-Brexit government to strike meaningful trade deals with other countries such as the US. A source close to the talks acknowledged to the BBC that among changes being negotiated in the political declaration, these references to EU agencies could get scrapped. Even as most of the negotiating attention remains on Northern Ireland, the change in approach from the Johnson government suggest a significantly different, more diverged end-point for Brexit for England, Scotland and Wales, than envisaged under Theresa May. A number of Labour MPs who say they want to support a deal have already expressed a desire for a deal with less scope for regulatory divergence.

Human trafficking gang guilty of selling women,"Vojtech Gombar, Anil Wagle, Jana Sandorova, and Ratislav Adam were convicted Four people have been found guilty of trafficking women from Slovakia to Glasgow and forcing their victims into prostitution and sham marriages. The women were transported to flats in the Govanhill area between 2011 and 2017, then exploited by the gang. One victim was sold for Â£10,000 outside a store in the city's Argyle Street. Vojtech Gombar, 61, Anil Wagle, 37, Jana Sandorova, 28, and Ratislav Adam, 31, denied the charges but were found guilty at the High Court in Glasgow. They will be sentenced next month. Police, who cracked the trafficking ring in a five-year operation dubbed Operation Synapsis, described the crimes as ""despicable"". Vojtech Gombar was described as the ringleader of the gang ""It's a heinous crime,"" says Detective Inspector Steven McMillan, who led the investigation. ""It's horrific to think that people think it is acceptable to buy and sell other human beings as a commodity, to have no thought for the impact and trauma it is going to have on them."" He said the convictions were the culmination of a complex investigation involving law enforcement from around the UK and European agencies such as Europol and Eurojust. Women trafficked to Glasgow for sham marriages Police first became aware of the trafficking and exploitation in 2014 but it took a three-year operation before about 70 officers raided four flats in the Govanhill area of Glasgow, leading to the arrest of  Gombar, Wagle, Sandorova and Adam. Gombar, who was described as the ringleader of the gang, had family ties with fellow Slovakians Adam and Sandorova. They are ethnic Romani and came from the town of Trebisov in the east of Slovakia, near its border with Ukraine, from where most of the women were trafficked. Wagle, from Nepal, became involved initially because he wanted to buy a bride. Over the course of the investigation, police had helped more than a dozen suspected victims, aged between 18 and 25, to safety. Women were trafficked from Trebisov in the east of Slovakia The women were trafficked to the UK, usually by bus and car, having been promised a better life and work. But when they arrived they were sold for between between Â£3,000 and Â£10,000 as part of a sham marriage scheme. The buyers were mainly men from Pakistan who wanted EU citizenship so they could live and work in Europe, and wanted the women to become their wives. Some of the victims were used as prostitutes while others were abused by the men who bought them. Police found that the women were held in ""safe houses"" in places including Manchester and Yorkshire before being taken to Govanhill. Marriage records showed Slovakian women getting married to Pakistani men Det Insp McMillan said the women had their identity documents taken from them and their movements controlled. ""Some of them suffered abuse, they were forced into sexual exploitation before being forced into sham marriages,"" he said. During the court case, a 28-year-old woman from Slovakia said she had thought that she and her sister were leaving for jobs in London but she ended up in a flat in Govanhill with no job and no money. She said she was forced to marry the son of a Pakistani man who had chosen her. Another woman told the court she was brought over from her home town of Trebisov, when she was four or five months pregnant, ""for a better life"". She was handed over to a Nepalese man outside Primark in Argyle Street in 2014 for Â£10,000. The woman also claimed that prior to being sold, she was made to sleep with Pakistani men for money and described this as ""hitchhiking"". Some victims stayed at a house belonging to one of Gombar's relatives in Michalovce The court also heard how one woman managed to escape and ran to a nearby shop where she raised the alarm. The woman spoke no English and the shopkeeper could not understand her, but a beat police officer managed to translate with the help of two young girls who lived nearby. The police officer said the woman wanted to get her identification documents and walked with her to the flat to retrieve them. The officer told the court: ""We got a phone number for her sister in London, and it was then we realised she had allegedly been trafficked to Glasgow."" Det Insp McMillan said all the women involved, most of whom are now back in Slovakia, were severely traumatised by what happened to them, which added extra complications to the investigation. He said: ""It is unbelievable in this day and age but, yes, women were being sold as a commodity in Glasgow.""

England beaten in Czech Republic,"Kane's penalty was his seventh goal in qualifying England must wait to confirm their place in Euro 2020 after the Czech Republic deservedly ended their 43-game unbeaten run in qualifiers stretching back 10 years. Gareth Southgate's side would have secured their place in next summer's tournament with victory in Prague but they can have no complaints after a wretched display against a Czech side who were a different proposition from that swept aside 5-0 at Wembley in March. England can still qualify on Monday if they beat Bulgaria and Kosovo do not beat Montenegro. England were handed the perfect start when captain Harry Kane put them ahead from the penalty spot in the fifth minute after Lukas Masopust fouled Raheem Sterling but they were well below their best and slumped to a bitterly disappointing defeat. The Czechs were swiftly level when Jakub Brabec scored following a corner. England could not muster further inspiration and substitute Zdenek Ondrasek pounced to score the winner with four minutes left. England were desperately poor throughout and were grateful to goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who produced fine saves from Vladimir Coufal, Masopust and Alex Kral, while Czech counterpart Tomas Vaclik did well to deny Sterling and Kane. They can put things right against Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday but this was a serious reality check for a side hoping to do great things next summer, losing a qualifier for the first time since they went down 1-0 to Ukraine on 10 October 2009. 'A disturbing night for Southgate as cracks reappear' Southgate takes responsibility for loss Czech Republic 2-1 England - how did you rate the players? Football Daily podcast: Lacklustre England punished in Prague This must rank as one of the worst performances of Southgate's reign and the manager himself has to take his own share of the responsibility. No-one can complain about his decision to give Chelsea's in-form Mason Mount his debut ahead of team-mate Ross Barkley but the youngster never flourished in an advanced midfield position in the first half. Mount was barely able to influence the game and with Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice exposed and pedestrian, England found themselves often overrun by the sprightly Czechs. England's potent attacking trio of Kane, Sterling and Jadon Sancho were starved of service, leaving them under-performing in every area of the pitch. The Czech Republic, backed by a noisy crowd in Prague, gathered momentum and confidence and it was no surprise when Ondrasek finally broke Pickford's resistance late on. This was simply not good enough from England and the concerns that surfaced about their true quality when they won 5-3 in chaotic style against Kosovo in Southampton will only increase after this. Relive England's defeat in the Czech Republic Euro 2020 qualifying: Who needs what? Any hope the defensive uncertainty that characterised England's victory against Kosovo had been successfully addressed was banished inside the first 10 minutes in Prague. Pickford saved brilliantly from Coufal as the Czech Republic responded to England's early salvo but there was the trademark confusion at the resulting corner which ended with Brabec stabbing home from close range. England lived dangerously throughout and it was not a shock when they finally conceded late on. Everton's Michael Keane struggles desperately at this level while full-backs Danny Rose and Kieran Trippier hardly covered themselves in glory either. Harry Maguire looks the one staple in defence but he does not exude confidence either. In other words, quality sides will relish facing this England defence and Southgate is running out of time to apply the fix. Czech Republic had 17 shots in this match, the most England have faced in a qualifying match since March 2013, when Montenegro had 19 in a World Cup qualifier. This was England's first defeat in a European Championship qualifier since losing 3-2 at Wembley against Croatia in November 2007. Harry Kane has scored 20 goals in 21 matches for England when starting as captain - the only player with more is Vivian Woodward (23 goals between 1908 and 1911). Excluding shootouts, no player has scored more penalties for England than Harry Kane (9, level with Frank Lampard). Zdenek Ondrasek scored on his international debut for Czech Republic, scoring with his first shot in international football. Gareth Southgate (W21 D9 L8) has lost as many games as England manager in 38 matches as Roy Hodgson lost in 56 matches as manager (W33 D15 L8). England travel to Bulgaria on Monday (kick-off 19:45 BST) looking to secure a spot at Euro 2020.

Payments giants abandon Facebook's Libra,"Facebook had said it hoped to launch Libra in 2020 Mastercard, Visa, eBay and payments firm Stripe have pulled out of Facebookâs embattled cryptocurrency project, Libra. Their move,first reported in the Financial Times,external, follows the withdrawal of PayPal, announced last week. It represents a huge blow to the social networkâs plans to launch what it envisions as a global currency. The project has drawn heavy scrutiny from regulators and politicians, particularly in the US. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will appear before the House Committee on Financial Services on 23 October to discuss Libra and its planned roll-out. Regulators have raised multiple concerns over Libra, including the risk it may be used for money laundering. Mercado Pago, a payments firm serving mostly Latin America, also pulled out. It means of the six payments-related firms first involved in Libra, just one, PayU, remains. Netherlands-based PayU did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on Friday. In a statement released on Friday, eBay said it ârespectedâ the Libra project. âHowever, eBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member. At this time, we are focused on rolling out eBayâs managed payments experience for our customers.â A spokesperson for Stripe said the firm supported the aim of making global payments easier. ""Libra has this potential. We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage.â A spokesperson for Visa said: ""We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association's ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations."" The Libra Association, set up by Facebook to manage the project, said of the departing companies: ""We appreciate their support for the goals and mission of the Libra project. ""Although the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra's governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient. ""We look forward to the inaugural Libra Association Council meeting in just 3 days and announcing the initial members of the Libra Association.â Facebook's executive in charge of its Libra effort wrote on Twitter that losing the firms was ""liberating"". ""I would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update,"" wrote David Marcus, who before joining Facebook was PayPal's president. ""Of course, it's not great news in the short term, but in a way it's liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you're on to something when so much pressure builds up."" Last week,PayPal said it would no longer be part of the Libra Association, but did not rule out working on the project in future - prompting a strong reaction from the Association. ""Commitment to that mission is more important to us than anything else,"" it said in a statement. ""We're better off knowing about this lack of commitment now."" _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

First person to walk in space dies aged 85,"Leonov's 1965 mission was celebrated in 2017 Russian film, ""The Spacewalker"" Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, who in 1965 became the first person in history to spacewalk, has died aged 85. Tethered to his spaceship by a 4.8m (16ft) cable, the Russian floated above the Earth for 12 minutes. ""You just can't comprehend it. Only out there can you feel the greatness - the huge size of all that surrounds us,"" Leonov told the BBC in 2014. But the outing nearly ended in disaster as his spacesuit inflated and he struggled to get back in the spaceship. At a time when the US and the USSR were jostling for space supremacy, Leonov's mission was lauded as a triumph at home. But Leonov's ambitions did not stop at his spacewalk. He went on to become the commander of Soyuz-Apollo, the first ever joint US-Soviet mission in 1975. Alexei Leonov describes his first spacewalk How Russia won the space race Leonov died at Moscow's Burdenko hospital on Friday after a long illness, his assistant confirmed. Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko said Leonov's death was a ""loss for the whole planet"", while President Vladimir Putin said he admired the astronaut's courage. Leonov was born in Siberia, his father a victim of Stalinist repression. His family moved to Kaliningrad in western Russia in 1948. As an air force pilot he was selected to train as a cosmonaut in 1960. He trained with Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space, and they became close friends. This video can not be played Watch archive footage of Leonov's and other spacewalks Leonov described his sortie into outer space in numerous media interviews. ""It was so quiet I could even hear my heart beat,"" he told the Observer. ""I was surrounded by stars and was floating without much control. I will never forget the moment. I also felt an incredible sense of responsibility. Of course, I did not know that I was about to experience the most difficult moments of my life - getting back into the capsule."" In the vacuum of outer space, his spacesuit began to balloon out of shape and its fabric began to stiffen dangerously. Alexei Leonov (L) took part in the first joint space mission between the Soviet Union and America in 1975 His hands slipped out of his gloves, his feet came out of his boots, and Leonov could no longer get through his spaceship's airlock. Even worse, the craft was hurtling towards Earth's shadow. In five minutes, the cosmonaut realised he would be plunged into total darkness. He managed to release some of the oxygen from his spacesuit and was barely able to squeeze himself back into the capsule headfirst. He lost 6kg (13 pounds) in the process. Leonov went into space twice, in 1965 and 1975 He and his pilot Pavel Belyayev were hailed as heroes on their return, but only after crash-landing in a forest in the Ural mountains and waiting three days to be rescued. A decade later, Leonov was one of two Soviet cosmonauts involved in the first docking of US and Soviet spaceships - the Apollo 18 and Soyuz 19 - during a period of detente between the two countries. He was twice awarded the country's top medal, Hero of the Soviet Union. Although Leonov was best-known for his exploits as an astronaut, his artwork also garnered accolades throughout his life. A self-taught artist, Leonov was adept at drawing in zero gravity. It was during the space-walking mission of 1965 that Leonov created the first artwork in space. This video can not be played Technology behind Alexei Leonov's spacewalk In the artwork, Leonov depicted a small yet remarkable sunrise from the vantage point of the Voskhod 2 spacecraft. London's Science Museum exhibited Leonov's coloured pencil drawing as part of a major exhibition on cosmonauts in 2015. ""You can imagine it being a bit of a nightmare â¦ but he wanted to stop the time and share this moment with other people,"" curator of the exhibition Natalia Sidlina said. Leonov's artworks drew heavily on his experiences in space. His other notable artworks included a self-portrait of his 1965 spacewalk, sketches of fellow astronauts and landscapes in the former Soviet Union. Archive footage of key spacewalks.

UK pays Â£87m for no-deal ferry contracts,"The government has awarded Â£86.6m of contracts to ferry companies to transport medicines in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Brittany Ferries, DFDS, P&O and Stena Line will be able to deliver those supplies from 31 October, it said. The contracts are aimed at making sure deliveries of vital products continue, if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. The government was criticised earlier this year after awarding a transport contractto a company with no ferries. The contracts will be in place for six months so the government is prepared for different Brexit scenarios, a spokesperson said. Should the contracts need to be cancelled, the UK will pay the firms Â£11.52m. The UK paid Â£51m to cancel no-deal ferry contracts after the Brexit deadline extension at the end of March. Brexit ferry deal 'rushed and risky', MPs say Brexit ferry contracts could cost government millions more Brexit: Seaborne Freight no-deal ferry contract scrapped Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""The UK is getting ready to leave the EU on the 31 October and, like any sensible government, we are preparing for all outcomes. ""Our decisive action means freight operators will be ready and waiting to transport vital medicines into the country from the moment we leave."" The firms will operate on routes away from the busiest ports to minimise disruption, the Department for Transport said. The ferries run between Teesport, Hull, Killingholme, Felixstowe, Harwich, Tilbury, Portsmouth and Poole in the UK and Cherbourg, Caen, Le Havre, Zeebrugge, Hook of Holland, Rotterdam, Europort, and Vlaardingen. Earlier this week, the government established a customs paperwork support unit for medical goods suppliers to help with getting across borders in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The extra capacity will help drugs firms plan for a no-deal Brexit, the Association of the British Pharmaceutical Industry said. ""This capacity is an important part of our members' preparations,"" said the industry body's chief executive Mike Thompson. ""Stockpiles are also in place, and some companies have already sourced their own alternative ferry routes."" Earlier this week Dame Sally Davies warned that patients could die should there be medical supplies shortages. ""We cannot guarantee that there will not be shortages, not only in medicines, but technology and gadgets,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""There may be deaths, we can't guarantee there won't."" In February the governmentscrapped a ferry contract with Seaborne Freight, which had no ships, after the Irish company backing the deal pulled out.

England beaten in Czech RepublicEngland suffer their first qualifying loss in 10 years and must wait to clinch a spot at Euro 2020.,"Kane's penalty was his seventh goal in qualifying England must wait to confirm their place in Euro 2020 after the Czech Republic deservedly ended their 43-game unbeaten run in qualifiers stretching back 10 years. Gareth Southgate's side would have secured their place in next summer's tournament with victory in Prague but they can have no complaints after a wretched display against a Czech side who were a different proposition from that swept aside 5-0 at Wembley in March. England can still qualify on Monday if they beat Bulgaria and Kosovo do not beat Montenegro. England were handed the perfect start when captain Harry Kane put them ahead from the penalty spot in the fifth minute after Lukas Masopust fouled Raheem Sterling but they were well below their best and slumped to a bitterly disappointing defeat. The Czechs were swiftly level when Jakub Brabec scored following a corner. England could not muster further inspiration and substitute Zdenek Ondrasek pounced to score the winner with four minutes left. England were desperately poor throughout and were grateful to goalkeeper Jordan Pickford, who produced fine saves from Vladimir Coufal, Masopust and Alex Kral, while Czech counterpart Tomas Vaclik did well to deny Sterling and Kane. They can put things right against Bulgaria in Sofia on Monday but this was a serious reality check for a side hoping to do great things next summer, losing a qualifier for the first time since they went down 1-0 to Ukraine on 10 October 2009. 'A disturbing night for Southgate as cracks reappear' Southgate takes responsibility for loss Czech Republic 2-1 England - how did you rate the players? Football Daily podcast: Lacklustre England punished in Prague This must rank as one of the worst performances of Southgate's reign and the manager himself has to take his own share of the responsibility. No-one can complain about his decision to give Chelsea's in-form Mason Mount his debut ahead of team-mate Ross Barkley but the youngster never flourished in an advanced midfield position in the first half. Mount was barely able to influence the game and with Jordan Henderson and Declan Rice exposed and pedestrian, England found themselves often overrun by the sprightly Czechs. England's potent attacking trio of Kane, Sterling and Jadon Sancho were starved of service, leaving them under-performing in every area of the pitch. The Czech Republic, backed by a noisy crowd in Prague, gathered momentum and confidence and it was no surprise when Ondrasek finally broke Pickford's resistance late on. This was simply not good enough from England and the concerns that surfaced about their true quality when they won 5-3 in chaotic style against Kosovo in Southampton will only increase after this. Relive England's defeat in the Czech Republic Euro 2020 qualifying: Who needs what? Any hope the defensive uncertainty that characterised England's victory against Kosovo had been successfully addressed was banished inside the first 10 minutes in Prague. Pickford saved brilliantly from Coufal as the Czech Republic responded to England's early salvo but there was the trademark confusion at the resulting corner which ended with Brabec stabbing home from close range. England lived dangerously throughout and it was not a shock when they finally conceded late on. Everton's Michael Keane struggles desperately at this level while full-backs Danny Rose and Kieran Trippier hardly covered themselves in glory either. Harry Maguire looks the one staple in defence but he does not exude confidence either. In other words, quality sides will relish facing this England defence and Southgate is running out of time to apply the fix. Czech Republic had 17 shots in this match, the most England have faced in a qualifying match since March 2013, when Montenegro had 19 in a World Cup qualifier. This was England's first defeat in a European Championship qualifier since losing 3-2 at Wembley against Croatia in November 2007. Harry Kane has scored 20 goals in 21 matches for England when starting as captain - the only player with more is Vivian Woodward (23 goals between 1908 and 1911). Excluding shootouts, no player has scored more penalties for England than Harry Kane (9, level with Frank Lampard). Zdenek Ondrasek scored on his international debut for Czech Republic, scoring with his first shot in international football. Gareth Southgate (W21 D9 L8) has lost as many games as England manager in 38 matches as Roy Hodgson lost in 56 matches as manager (W33 D15 L8). England travel to Bulgaria on Monday (kick-off 19:45 BST) looking to secure a spot at Euro 2020.

Human trafficking gang guilty of selling womenVictims were taken from Slovakia to Glasgow and forced into prostitution or sham marriages.Scotland,"Vojtech Gombar, Anil Wagle, Jana Sandorova, and Ratislav Adam were convicted Four people have been found guilty of trafficking women from Slovakia to Glasgow and forcing their victims into prostitution and sham marriages. The women were transported to flats in the Govanhill area between 2011 and 2017, then exploited by the gang. One victim was sold for Â£10,000 outside a store in the city's Argyle Street. Vojtech Gombar, 61, Anil Wagle, 37, Jana Sandorova, 28, and Ratislav Adam, 31, denied the charges but were found guilty at the High Court in Glasgow. They will be sentenced next month. Police, who cracked the trafficking ring in a five-year operation dubbed Operation Synapsis, described the crimes as ""despicable"". Vojtech Gombar was described as the ringleader of the gang ""It's a heinous crime,"" says Detective Inspector Steven McMillan, who led the investigation. ""It's horrific to think that people think it is acceptable to buy and sell other human beings as a commodity, to have no thought for the impact and trauma it is going to have on them."" He said the convictions were the culmination of a complex investigation involving law enforcement from around the UK and European agencies such as Europol and Eurojust. Women trafficked to Glasgow for sham marriages Police first became aware of the trafficking and exploitation in 2014 but it took a three-year operation before about 70 officers raided four flats in the Govanhill area of Glasgow, leading to the arrest of  Gombar, Wagle, Sandorova and Adam. Gombar, who was described as the ringleader of the gang, had family ties with fellow Slovakians Adam and Sandorova. They are ethnic Romani and came from the town of Trebisov in the east of Slovakia, near its border with Ukraine, from where most of the women were trafficked. Wagle, from Nepal, became involved initially because he wanted to buy a bride. Over the course of the investigation, police had helped more than a dozen suspected victims, aged between 18 and 25, to safety. Women were trafficked from Trebisov in the east of Slovakia The women were trafficked to the UK, usually by bus and car, having been promised a better life and work. But when they arrived they were sold for between between Â£3,000 and Â£10,000 as part of a sham marriage scheme. The buyers were mainly men from Pakistan who wanted EU citizenship so they could live and work in Europe, and wanted the women to become their wives. Some of the victims were used as prostitutes while others were abused by the men who bought them. Police found that the women were held in ""safe houses"" in places including Manchester and Yorkshire before being taken to Govanhill. Marriage records showed Slovakian women getting married to Pakistani men Det Insp McMillan said the women had their identity documents taken from them and their movements controlled. ""Some of them suffered abuse, they were forced into sexual exploitation before being forced into sham marriages,"" he said. During the court case, a 28-year-old woman from Slovakia said she had thought that she and her sister were leaving for jobs in London but she ended up in a flat in Govanhill with no job and no money. She said she was forced to marry the son of a Pakistani man who had chosen her. Another woman told the court she was brought over from her home town of Trebisov, when she was four or five months pregnant, ""for a better life"". She was handed over to a Nepalese man outside Primark in Argyle Street in 2014 for Â£10,000. The woman also claimed that prior to being sold, she was made to sleep with Pakistani men for money and described this as ""hitchhiking"". Some victims stayed at a house belonging to one of Gombar's relatives in Michalovce The court also heard how one woman managed to escape and ran to a nearby shop where she raised the alarm. The woman spoke no English and the shopkeeper could not understand her, but a beat police officer managed to translate with the help of two young girls who lived nearby. The police officer said the woman wanted to get her identification documents and walked with her to the flat to retrieve them. The officer told the court: ""We got a phone number for her sister in London, and it was then we realised she had allegedly been trafficked to Glasgow."" Det Insp McMillan said all the women involved, most of whom are now back in Slovakia, were severely traumatised by what happened to them, which added extra complications to the investigation. He said: ""It is unbelievable in this day and age but, yes, women were being sold as a commodity in Glasgow.""

Mastercard and eBay pull out of Facebook's Libra,"Facebook had said it hoped to launch Libra in 2020 Mastercard, Visa, eBay and payments firm Stripe have pulled out of Facebookâs embattled cryptocurrency project, Libra. Their move,first reported in the Financial Times,external, follows the withdrawal of PayPal, announced last week. It represents a huge blow to the social networkâs plans to launch what it envisions as a global currency. The project has drawn heavy scrutiny from regulators and politicians, particularly in the US. Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg will appear before the House Committee on Financial Services on 23 October to discuss Libra and its planned roll-out. Regulators have raised multiple concerns over Libra, including the risk it may be used for money laundering. Mercado Pago, a payments firm serving mostly Latin America, also pulled out. It means of the six payments-related firms first involved in Libra, just one, PayU, remains. Netherlands-based PayU did not respond to the BBC's request for comment on Friday. In a statement released on Friday, eBay said it ârespectedâ the Libra project. âHowever, eBay has made the decision to not move forward as a founding member. At this time, we are focused on rolling out eBayâs managed payments experience for our customers.â A spokesperson for Stripe said the firm supported the aim of making global payments easier. ""Libra has this potential. We will follow its progress closely and remain open to working with the Libra Association at a later stage.â A spokesperson for Visa said: ""We will continue to evaluate and our ultimate decision will be determined by a number of factors, including the Association's ability to fully satisfy all requisite regulatory expectations."" The Libra Association, set up by Facebook to manage the project, said of the departing companies: ""We appreciate their support for the goals and mission of the Libra project. ""Although the makeup of the Association members may grow and change over time, the design principle of Libra's governance and technology, along with the open nature of this project ensures the Libra payment network will remain resilient. ""We look forward to the inaugural Libra Association Council meeting in just 3 days and announcing the initial members of the Libra Association.â Facebook's executive in charge of its Libra effort wrote on Twitter that losing the firms was ""liberating"". ""I would caution against reading the fate of Libra into this update,"" wrote David Marcus, who before joining Facebook was PayPal's president. ""Of course, it's not great news in the short term, but in a way it's liberating. Stay tuned for more very soon. Change of this magnitude is hard. You know you're on to something when so much pressure builds up."" Last week,PayPal said it would no longer be part of the Libra Association, but did not rule out working on the project in future - prompting a strong reaction from the Association.

One dead in wildfires raging round Los AngelesOne of the fires was sparked by a bin lorry that dumped burning rubbish near tinder-dry vegetation.,"This video can not be played 'I saw the flames and said we gotta go' - wildfires near Los Angeles force thousands to flee At least one person is dead in a fast-moving wildfire that has razed 4,700 acres north of Los Angeles, California, forcing thousands of others to flee. The Saddleridge fire has led to a mandatory evacuation for 25,000 homes, some of which have been destroyed. A lorry with burning rubbish sparked another fire on Thursday east of LA. The state's largest utility this week pulled the plug on at least 700,000 customers to prevent wildfires sparked by windblown power lines. The Saddleridge fire has been fuelled by gusty winds, warm temperatures and low humidity. The victim, a man in his late 50s, died from cardiac arrest connected to the blaze, fire officials told local media. By Friday morning, the fire had grown to more than seven square miles (18 square km), burning at least 25 homes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is going to take a few days,"" Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas told a Friday morning news briefing. He said the fire was still zero per cent contained. Two major highways have been closed due to the flames. The National Weather Service has issued red flag fire condition warnings for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, cautioning of wind gusts of up to 75mph in the mountains and 55mph by the coasts. Some 100,000 people live in the evacuation zone. California fires 'can now happen any year' Why do Santa Ana winds make wildfires worse? Volunteers fighting fires in California's 'forgotten canyon' Authorities have opened shelters for residents forced to abandon their homes. The Saddleridge fire started on Thursday night in the San Fernando Valley and has since begun encroaching into northern neighbourhoods of the city. It remains unclear how it started. It is one of several fires currently burning in southern California. The blaze sparked by the garbage truck in Calimesa - a city some 70 miles east of Los Angeles - has spread to 500 acres and destroyed 74 structures, according to officials. That outbreak, dubbed the Sandalwood fire after a local landmark, was 10% contained as of Thursday night. At least two other smaller wildfires prompted evacuations on Thursday as well. Up in the north of the state this week, power company PG&E cut electricity to parts of 22 counties, including portions of the San Francisco Bay Area, as a wildfire prevention method. Embers from the fire have been spread across the hillside due to the strong winds The planned outage was to prevent power lines felled by strong winds sparking fires. Last year, PG&E's fallen power lines started the deadliest wildfire in California's history. PG&E has now begun restoring power, though more than 300,000 customers remained in the dark as of Thursday night. The outages have been difficult for many residents, but particularly those with medical and health needs. Local media report that many breastfeeding mothers have been banding together, connecting via online groups to share access to freezers and tips on how to store milk.

"Firm fined over woman's tzatziki allergic reactionHayley Lancaster suffered a ""potentially fatal"" reaction due to her egg allergy, a court hears.Wales","The tzatziki dip did not list egg as an ingredient A woman suffered a ""potentially fatal"" allergic reaction after a food company mistakenly put egg in a pot of tzatziki. Zorba Delicacies pleaded guilty to three food safety charges at Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court. Hayley Lancaster sufferedanaphylaxis,externalafter buying the dip from Morrisons in Caerphilly in February 2018. The Ebbw Vale-based company was fined Â£93,000 following a prosecution by Caerphilly Trading Standards. The three charges relate to the product being unsafe, not of the ""nature demanded by the purchaser"" and the company providing documents with false or misleading information. The court heard Miss Lancaster had been diagnosed with an egg and nut allergy at a young age. Why the world is becoming more allergic to food What can restaurants do to help customers with allergies? Hayley Lancaster was diagnosed with an egg and nut allergy when she was a child After eating a small amount of the dip she immediately showed signs of a reaction - her airway began to close and she felt nauseous. Prosecution barrister Matthew Roberts said if she had not had her Epipen, it ""could have been potentially fatal"". Caerphilly council's Trading Standards was informed and tested the pot bought by Miss Lancaster and another pot bought from the same Morrisons store. Both were found to contain levels of egg protein, which was not listed on the label or in the company's recipe. The court was told about relevant food hygiene practices, including swabbing for allergens and a clean-down between products, but there was ""no evidence"" these took place on the day the dip was made. The company said a dip of beetroot, mint and yogurt, which contained egg, had been produced on the line before and had contaminated the tzatziki. The company employs 490 people and has a turnover of about Â£50m a year Defence barrister Carl Harrison said Zorba Delicacies sincerely regretted the incident and offered Miss Lancaster a ""full and unreserved apology"". He said changes had been put in place since the incident and products with no allergens were now made at the start of the day. District Judge Martin Brown fined the company Â£93,000 and ordered it to pay a surcharge of Â£120 and prosecution costs of about Â£14,700. Speaking after the case, Tim Keohane, senior Trading Standards officer for the council, said: ""It is a serious fine which only goes to show the seriousness of the offence and how important it is for food manufacturers and retailers to pay attention to allergens in the food that they serve to customers.""

Climate change: Big lifestyle changes only answer,"Experts expect more extreme weather in future The UK government must tell the public small, easy changes will not be enough to tackle climate change, warn experts. Researchers from Imperial College London say we must eat less meat and dairy, swap cars for bikes, take fewer flights, and ditch gas boilers at home. The report, seen by BBC Panorama, has been prepared for the Committee on Climate Change, which advises ministers how to cut the UK's carbon footprint. It says an upheaval in our lifestyles is the only way to meet targets. The government has passed a law obliging the country to cut carbon emissions to net zero by 2050. It is ""going further and faster than any other developed nation to protect the planet for future generations"", a government spokesperson told BBC Panorama. ""If we can go faster, we will."" But the new report warns major shifts in policy across huge areas of government activity are needed to keep the public onside. Chris Stark, the Chief Executive of the Committee on Climate Change, tells Panorama the government's plan for cutting emissions is ""not nearly at the level of ambition required"". ""Every bit of policy now needs to be refreshed,"" he warned in an interview with BBC Panorama. Climate change: UK government to commit to 2050 target Ditch cars to meet climate change targets, say MPs Climate change: 12 years to save the planet? Make that 18 months The new report, called Behaviour Change, Public Engagement and Net Zero, amounts to an extensive ""to-do"" list for government. It says subsidies for fossil fuels have to go and taxes on low-carbon technologies must be cut. At the same time, consumers need to be given far more information on the environmental consequences of their actions. It also urges the government to consider introducing a carbon tax, increasing the prices of carbon-intensive products and activities. It is an ambitious agenda but necessary, the report says, if Britain is to achieve its Net Zero ambitions. ""These changes need not be expensive or reduce well-being,"" the report concludes, ""but they will not happen at the pace required unless policy first removes obstacles to change in markets and consumer choice."" Justin tucks into a ""bug burger"": There needs to be a shift to lower carbon foods, such as mealworm Food currently accounts for 30% of a household's carbon footprint in high-income countries like the UK. The report says we need to make a significant shift towards lower-carbon foods, particularly towards more plant-based diets. Producing food from animals uses more resources than food from plants. Some animals, like cows and sheep, also produce and burp up methane - a powerful greenhouse gas. The Committee on Climate Change's official recommendation to government is that a 20% cut in red meat and dairy is needed - the emissions from the other 80% will have to be matched by CO2 that has been captured and stored permanently in order to meet the net zero ambition. The report implies a bigger shift in diets could be needed, and says one way to get people to change will be to emphasise the health benefits this could bring. Another will be to give people much more information on the environmental impact of different foods.  It calls for mandatory carbon impact labelling on products, on till receipts, and via shopping websites and apps. Once consumers understand the environmental impact of different food choices, the report argues, government should begin to increase the price of foods that involve high emissions. It suggests this could be done by cutting farm subsidies - more than 70% of which go to livestock - and by raising VAT on these products. Home heating burns a lot of carbon Home heating is the single biggest challenge in terms of reducing UK emissions, according to Chris Stark of the Committee on Climate Change. It accounts for 21% of a household's carbon footprint and it will be costly to bring it down. With 30 million homes and 30 years to decarbonise, he argues, ""simple arithmetic"" suggests we need to ""decarbonise"" one million homes every year, starting now. The Behaviour Change report has a whole catalogue of policy recommendations here.  As with electric vehicles, decarbonisation of UK electricity creates opportunities for low-carbon heating systems, in particular air-source heat pumps, which extract heat from air outside the home and remove cold air from inside. The report recommends a ""rebalancing"" of the tax and regulatory costs on energy, which currently fall more heavily on electricity than gas. VAT on installation of insulation and low-carbon heating systems should be removed. At the same time, consumers need to be offered a range of incentives to encourage the use of low-carbon technology. According to Chris Stark: ""We haven't even started nibbling away at that heat challenge in any real sense. We need a real plan, and the sooner we do, the cheaper it will be overall."" Cycle lanes can cut the risk of accidents Transport currently accounts for 34% of a household's carbon footprint. The report calls for a major programme of investment in the rail and bus network, with lower ticket prices and investment in safer cycling. It says what's needed is a ""modal shift"" to public transport, walking and cycling and believes the public can be encouraged to do this, in part, because of the health benefits it would bring. However, it recognises the UK's progress in decarbonising electricity creates an opportunity for consumers to reduce emissions by switching to electric vehicles and urges greater subsidies for new electric car purchases. Electricity companies need to be encouraged to introduce smart EV charging systems so customers can charge their vehicles when electricity is cheap or when renewable power is plentiful and there needs to be a massive rollout of charging infrastructure along motorways, in towns and in cities. Measures to cut flight numbers are needed Here, the report says policy-makers need to focus on the 15% of the population that are estimated to take 70% of flights. It calls for an ""Air Miles Levy"" to discourage what it calls ""excessive flying"", something the Committee on Climate Change hasalready proposed. The idea is to penalise frequent flyers, while not raising prices for people taking an annual holiday. It says air miles and frequent flier reward schemes have to go and passengers need to be given much more information about the emissions generated by flights.

Firm fined over woman's tzatziki allergic reaction,"The tzatziki dip did not list egg as an ingredient A woman suffered a ""potentially fatal"" allergic reaction after a food company mistakenly put egg in a pot of tzatziki. Zorba Delicacies pleaded guilty to three food safety charges at Merthyr Tydfil Magistrates' Court. Hayley Lancaster sufferedanaphylaxis,externalafter buying the dip from Morrisons in Caerphilly in February 2018. The Ebbw Vale-based company was fined Â£93,000 following a prosecution by Caerphilly Trading Standards. The three charges relate to the product being unsafe, not of the ""nature demanded by the purchaser"" and the company providing documents with false or misleading information. The court heard Miss Lancaster had been diagnosed with an egg and nut allergy at a young age. Why the world is becoming more allergic to food What can restaurants do to help customers with allergies? Hayley Lancaster was diagnosed with an egg and nut allergy when she was a child After eating a small amount of the dip she immediately showed signs of a reaction - her airway began to close and she felt nauseous. Prosecution barrister Matthew Roberts said if she had not had her Epipen, it ""could have been potentially fatal"". Caerphilly council's Trading Standards was informed and tested the pot bought by Miss Lancaster and another pot bought from the same Morrisons store. Both were found to contain levels of egg protein, which was not listed on the label or in the company's recipe. The court was told about relevant food hygiene practices, including swabbing for allergens and a clean-down between products, but there was ""no evidence"" these took place on the day the dip was made. The company said a dip of beetroot, mint and yogurt, which contained egg, had been produced on the line before and had contaminated the tzatziki. The company employs 490 people and has a turnover of about Â£50m a year Defence barrister Carl Harrison said Zorba Delicacies sincerely regretted the incident and offered Miss Lancaster a ""full and unreserved apology"". He said changes had been put in place since the incident and products with no allergens were now made at the start of the day. District Judge Martin Brown fined the company Â£93,000 and ordered it to pay a surcharge of Â£120 and prosecution costs of about Â£14,700. Speaking after the case, Tim Keohane, senior Trading Standards officer for the council, said: ""It is a serious fine which only goes to show the seriousness of the offence and how important it is for food manufacturers and retailers to pay attention to allergens in the food that they serve to customers.""

Husband guilty of wife's crowbar murder at stables,"David Pomphret said his wife could go from being happy to depressed ""in minutes"" A man who battered his wife to death with a crowbar during a row has been found guilty of her murder. Ann Marie Pomphret, 49, was struck 30 times by her husband David at the stables they owned in Warrington, Cheshire, on 2 November. Pomphret, 51,admittedkilling his wife, but denied murder on the grounds of a temporary loss of control. Liverpool Crown Court heard he had been abused by his ""highly volatile"" wife whose mental health had deteriorated. Richard Pratt QC, defending, told the 10-day trial Pomphret faced longstanding ""vocal and sometimes violent"" abuse from his wife. The jury heard the couple met on Mrs Pomphret's 21st birthday and were happily married with an 18-year-old daughter. However, over the course of their 22-year marriage, his wife's physical and mental health changed. Pomphret said his wife could go from being happy to depressed in minutes and become ""very angry, very quickly"". The Barclays bank technology expert said the couple had gone to the stables to check on their horses on 2 November when Mrs Pomphret began ""ranting"" at him. David Pomphret struck his wife Ann Marie 30 times with a crowbar He told the trial the next thing he remembered, ""I was standing at the side of her body. There was blood on my hands and the crowbar. She was on the floor..."". He dialled 999, saying he had found his wife lying in a pool of blood, ""very dead"", adding: ""There is brain and blood everywhere, and it looks like she has had her head beaten in."" Pomphret was arrested the next day and initially denied any involvement. He burned his bloodstained clothes, disposed of the murder weapon, protested his innocence and was released on bail. The court heard Mrs Pomphret's injuries were consistent with the use of a crowbar which was recovered from a nearby pond But he did not destroy his socks, which would ""come back to haunt him"", the prosecution said. He was re-arrested after police found his wife's ""airborne blood"" on his socks putting him at the scene of the crime, the trial heard. He then had to change his story, the jury was told and admitted manslaughter, tearfully telling the jury he ""killed the woman I loved"". Pomphret still denied murder, instead claiming a ""special defence"" and blaming his wife's behaviour for a temporary loss of control. He will be sentenced next week.

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter returns to UK,"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter, Gabriella, cuts her own ""welcome home"" cake with help from her dad, Richard The five-year-old daughter of a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran on spying charges has returned to the UK. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, a charity worker from London, has been detained for three years over the allegations, which she denies. Her British-born daughter Gabriella, who has been living with her grandparents in Tehran, returned on Thursday to start school in the UK. Gabriella's father, Richard Ratcliffe, said she has been ""so brave"". What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Appearing with Gabriella at a news conference at the Houses of Parliament, Mr Ratcliffe said she struggled speaking English but had been keen to tell him that she wanted to visit a toy shop. He said she ""told mum that she'll see her back in London"". ""She's promised mummy she's going to be brave. It's just lovely to hold her again."" Richard Ratcliffe embraces his daughter, Gabriella, after she landed back in the UK Gabriella brought a cake into a news conference at the Houses of Parliament on Friday afternoon Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 during a visit to introduce Gabriella to relatives, her family said. She is now being held in Tehran's Evin prison, where Gabriella visited her at least once a week. But in April the family said new prison rules meant Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffecould only see her daughter once a monthand that she was banned from making international calls. Earlier this month Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe wrote an open letter to mothers of Iran, in which she said: ""In the near future, my baby will leave me to go to her father and start school in the UK.  It will be a daunting trip for her travelling, and for me left behind."" Last week, Mr Ratcliffe from West Hampstead, toldthe Times,externalthat they had agreed Gabriella should return to the UK for the start of the school year in September, but postponed the decision after Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was taken to a psychiatric hospital. ""I spoke to Nazanin yesterday and she was reasonably distraught,"" he told reporters at Westminster on Friday. ""One of the things she really didn't want to happen was her daughter to leave while she was still in prison."" Mr Ratcliffe said there is a ""real risk"" his wife's mental and physical condition will deteriorate. Richard and Nazanin agreed that Gabriella should return to the UK to begin school, the family said In response to Gabriella's return, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reiterated his earlier calls for Iran to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and said the family's situation was one that no parent ""should ever have to face"". ""Gabriella is an innocent child and should be able to go to school and be with both her parents,"" he said. ""We continue to urge Iran to release Nazanin immediately so the family can be reunited in the UK."" His predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, described the news of Gabriella's homecoming as ""the definition of bittersweet"". He called on the British government to ""redouble"" its efforts to secure Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, tweeting: ""Now more than ever, she needs to know she's not alone."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was temporarily reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a three-day release from prison in August last year Mr Ratcliffe told reporters that his wife had shared a prison cell with British-Australian woman Jolie King, who had been detained with her boyfriend in Tehran earlier this year for reportedly flying a drone without a permit. Ms King and her boyfriend, Mark Firkin,were released last week. Iran has detained a number of dual citizens and foreign nationals in recent years, many of them on spying charges. The exact numbers are not known. The arrests and arow over the seizure of oil tankers in the Gulf.have led to increasingly tense diplomatic relations between the UK and Iran. Iran also claims it is owed Â£400m by the UK in relation to contracts signed more than 40 years ago between the International Military Services (IMS) - a company that has ceased trading but was used by the Ministry of Defence to sell defence equipment - and the pre-Islamic Revolution Iranian regime. The contracts involved the supply of tanks to Iran, which were paid for but undelivered in the wake of the country's 1979 revolution. Litigation regarding the dispute is under way. The UK government said it does not ""share the view"" that the IMS debt, or any other bilateral issue, is the reason for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's detention, and that the two issues are ""entirely separate"". ""Iran must live up to its responsibilities under international human rights law and under the Vienna convention on consular relations, and release Nazanin, and the other dual national cases, without delay,"" a government statement issued by the Foreign Office said. The family's MP, Tulip Siddiq, said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe wants to know why the UK government is not doing more to secure her release.

""Every single one of those politicians have looked me in the eye and said that this has nothing to do with the debt that we owe Iran. But we know that's not true."" Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnsoncalled for the release of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffeduring a meeting with Iran's president. In 2017, when he was foreign secretary, Mr Johnson had to apologise after saying Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran ""teaching people journalism"" - despite her family's insistence she was there on holiday.

Thousands flee wildfires raging round Los Angeles,"This video can not be played 'I saw the flames and said we gotta go' - wildfires near Los Angeles force thousands to flee At least one person is dead in a fast-moving wildfire that has razed 4,700 acres north of Los Angeles, California, forcing thousands of others to flee. The Saddleridge fire has led to a mandatory evacuation for 25,000 homes, some of which have been destroyed. A lorry with burning rubbish sparked another fire on Thursday east of LA. The state's largest utility this week pulled the plug on at least 700,000 customers to prevent wildfires sparked by windblown power lines. The Saddleridge fire has been fuelled by gusty winds, warm temperatures and low humidity. The victim, a man in his late 50s, died from cardiac arrest connected to the blaze, fire officials told local media. By Friday morning, the fire had grown to more than seven square miles (18 square km), burning at least 25 homes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

This is going to take a few days,"" Fire Chief Ralph Terrazas told a Friday morning news briefing. He said the fire was still zero per cent contained. Two major highways have been closed due to the flames. The National Weather Service has issued red flag fire condition warnings for Los Angeles and Ventura counties, cautioning of wind gusts of up to 75mph in the mountains and 55mph by the coasts. Some 100,000 people live in the evacuation zone. California fires 'can now happen any year' Why do Santa Ana winds make wildfires worse? Volunteers fighting fires in California's 'forgotten canyon' Authorities have opened shelters for residents forced to abandon their homes. The Saddleridge fire started on Thursday night in the San Fernando Valley and has since begun encroaching into northern neighbourhoods of the city. It remains unclear how it started. It is one of several fires currently burning in southern California. The blaze sparked by the garbage truck in Calimesa - a city some 70 miles east of Los Angeles - has spread to 500 acres and destroyed 74 structures, according to officials. That outbreak, dubbed the Sandalwood fire after a local landmark, was 10% contained as of Thursday night. At least two other smaller wildfires prompted evacuations on Thursday as well. Up in the north of the state this week, power company PG&E cut electricity to parts of 22 counties, including portions of the San Francisco Bay Area, as a wildfire prevention method. Embers from the fire have been spread across the hillside due to the strong winds The planned outage was to prevent power lines felled by strong winds sparking fires. Last year, PG&E's fallen power lines started the deadliest wildfire in California's history. PG&E has now begun restoring power, though more than 300,000 customers remained in the dark as of Thursday night.

One dead in wildfires raging round Los Angeles,"This video can not be played 'I saw the flames and said we gotta go' - wildfires near Los Angeles force thousands to flee At least one person is dead in a fast-moving wildfire that has razed 4,700 acres north of Los Angeles, California, forcing thousands of others to flee. The Saddleridge fire has led to a mandatory evacuation for 25,000 homes, some of which have been destroyed. A lorry with burning rubbish sparked another fire on Thursday east of LA. The state's largest utility this week pulled the plug on at least 700,000 customers to prevent wildfires sparked by windblown power lines. The Saddleridge fire has been fuelled by gusty winds, warm temperatures and low humidity. The victim, a man in his late 50s, died from cardiac arrest connected to the blaze, fire officials told local media. By Friday morning, the fire had grown to more than seven square miles (18 square km), burning at least 25 homes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Half of all debit card payments now contactless,"Contactless payments have become so popular among UK consumers that they accounted for half of all debit card transactions in July. It is the first time the 50% level has been reached, according tofigures from banking trade body UK Finance.,external Contactless allows consumers to pay by placing their card, or smartphone, near the merchant's machine, without the need to enter a PIN. It was used 647 million times on debit cards during the month, the data shows. The technology was adopted relatively slowly by consumers in its early years, but widespread use on public transport has given it a significant push. The use of contactless - which includes cards loaded onto smartphones - outstrips debit card payments using a PIN, as well as online transactions. Concerns have been raised about the potential harm for those without a bank account, and therefore without a card, if the move to such technology comes at the expense of cash. Iona Bain, founder of the Young Money Blog, said: ""The jury is out about what this means in the long-term for consumers. ""We have to think about the unbanked customers in the UK. They are very much reliant on cash. The rise in contactless technology risks leaving behind rural and poorer communities."" New design for Britain's most-forged banknote Pay by cash? Not for long, report warns High credit card interest rates, and a safety-first approach from consumers, mean that the growth in outstanding credit card debt has slowed in recent months. The UK Finance figures show that the annual growth rate stood at 3.67% in July. This was down from a recent high of 8.3% in February last year. Commentators have suggested the Bank of England's base interest rate could be cut in the near future, but such a change might not feed through to better deals for borrowers.

Ethiopia's Abiy Ahmed wins Nobel Peace Prize,"Abiy Ahmed became Ethiopia's prime minister in April 2018 The 2019 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed who made peace last year with bitter foe Eritrea. He was awarded the prize for his efforts to ""achieve peace and international cooperation"". Mr Abiy's peace deal with Eritrea ended a 20-year military stalemate following their 1998-2000 border war. He was named as the winner of the 100th Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, where he will receive the award in December. It is worth some nine million Swedish crowns (about Â£730,000; $900,000). Africa Live: Reaction to Abiy Ahmedâs victory Why is the Nobel Peace Prize so important? On the road with Abiy Ahmed Following the announcement, Mr Abiy said he was ""humbled and thrilled"". ""Thank you very much. It is a prize given to Africa, given to Ethiopia and I can imagine how the rest of Africa's leaders will take it positively to work on [the] peace-building process on our continent,"" he added in a phone call with the secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

A total of 301 candidates had been nominated for the prestigious award, including 223 individuals and 78 organisations. There had been great speculation over who would win the prize, with climate activist Greta Thunberg widely tipped as the favourite. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, nomination shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years, and the organisation says any speculation ahead of the announcement is ""sheer guesswork"". This video can not be played The announcement was made by Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen After becoming prime minister in April 2018, Mr Abiy introduced massive liberalising reforms to Ethiopia, shaking up what was a tightly controlled nation. He freed thousands of opposition activists from jail and allowed exiled dissidents to return home. Under him, several women have also been appointed to prominent positions. Most importantly, he signed the peace deal with Eritrea. Abiy Ahmed: The man changing Ethiopia The women smashing Ethiopia's glass ceiling Bold reforms expose Ethiopia's ethnic divides But his reforms also lifted the lid on Ethiopia's ethnic tensions, and the resulting violence forced some 2.5 million people from their homes. Mr Abiy, 43, was honoured for his ""decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea"", the Norwegian Nobel Committee said. ""The prize is also meant to recognise all the stakeholders working for peace and reconciliation in Ethiopia and in the East and Northeast African regions,"" they said. Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki (right) receives a key from Abiy Ahmed as the Eritrean Embassy in Addis Ababa is re-opened in 2018 ""Peace does not arise from the actions of one party alone. When Prime Minister Abiy reached out his hand, President Afwerki grasped it, and helped to formalise the peace process between the two countries. The Norwegian Nobel Committee hopes the peace agreement will help to bring about positive change for the entire populations of Ethiopia and Eritrea."" Since the Eritrea deal, Mr Abiy - the youngest head of government in Africa - has also been involved in peace processes in other African countries, the committee said. This has included helping to broker an agreement between Sudan's military leaders and civilian opposition after months of protests. Mr Abiy's office said the award was testimony ""to the ideals of unity, cooperation and mutual coexistence that the prime minister has been consistently championing"". Analysis by Emmanuel Igunza, BBC Africa Since coming into office just over a year ago, Abiy Ahmed has made history and turned Ethiopian politics on its head. Few had given him any chance of ascending to the prime minister's office and even less had anticipated the sweeping reforms he would bring to a country that for years had been led by the iron fist of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. His most significant achievement was ending a bitter border dispute with Eritrea. He even went to the Eritrean capital, Asmara, receiving a rock star's welcome - a sign of his popularity with the population weary of the two decades of hostilities between the two countries. But also significant is the role he has played in bringing peace to the Horn of Africa region, from Sudan to Somalia and Djibouti, all which at some time have had border disputes. Throughout he's preached a message ofMedemer- meaning togetherness or inclusiveness. His Nobel win is yet another feather in the cap of this former intelligence chief. African leaders were among those to congratulate Mr Abiy following his win. Somalia's President Mohamed Farmaajo described Mr Abiy as a ""deserving winner"" as he congratulated him on Twitter. ""I have enjoyed working with him on strengthening regional co-operation,"" he wrote. Liberia's President George Weah expressed his ""warmest felicitations for this noble feat"", while Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo said the award was ""a reminder to us all that peace is one of the most critical ingredients needed to make Africa successful"".

The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, congratulated Mr Abiy but said he must now ""make resolving ethnic tensions within Ethiopia a priority"". Human rights group Amnesty International welcomed Mr Abiy's reforms and efforts towards peace, but said his work was ""far from done"". ""He must urgently ensure that his government addresses the ongoing ethnic tensions that threaten instability and further human rights abuses,"" it added. Bisrat Hadte, a 45-year-old businessman in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, told Reuters news agency that Mr Abiy also needed to ""improve the economy and drive down the cost of living"". Mr Abiy was born in Ethiopia in 1976 to a Muslim father and Christian mother. He has several degrees, including a doctorate degree in peace and security issues and a master's degree in transformational leadership. As a teenager, he joined the armed struggle against the former Derg regime - a Communist military junta that ruled Ethiopia from 1974 to 1987. He later served as a UN peacekeeper in Rwanda. Abiy Ahmed is the youngest head of government in Africa During the 1998-2000 border dispute with Eritrea, he led a spy team on a reconnaissance mission into areas held by the Eritrean Defence Forces. He joined politics in 2010, becoming a member of the Oromo People's Democratic Organization, before being elected as a member of parliament. His time as an MP coincided with clashes between Muslims and Christians. He devised a lasting solution to the problem by setting up a ""Religious Forum for Peace"". Former US President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, for ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"".

Facebook under fire over 'outrageous' UK tax bill,"Facebook's UK arm paid Â£28.5m in tax in 2018 as revenues hit a record Â£1.65bn on the back of strong advertising growth. The social media firms's latest UK accounts show that profits last year jumped by 54% to Â£96.6m. Facebook's total tax charge on those profits almost doubled to Â£30.4m, but was reduced due to adjustments. Tax campaigner and MP Margaret Hodge said such a low bill was ""outrageous"", but Facebook said it pays what it owes. Gross revenues from advertising and other activities rose 30% in 2018, a year when the Cambridge Analytica affair was at its height and the company was facing heavy criticism. The UK division spent Â£356m on research, development and engineering in the UK last year, the accounts filed at Companies House showed. Steve Hatch, the company's vice president for Northern Europe, said: ""The UK is now one of Facebook's most important hubs for global innovation. We continue to grow and invest heavily in the UK and by the end of the year we'll employ 3,000 people here. ""Businesses across the country use our platforms to grow and revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is now recorded here so that any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax."" Facebook said it complies with tax laws in all jurisdictions and pays what is legally due. But Ms Hodge, a former chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, and who now leads an all-party parliamentary group looking into the tax system, tweeted that it was ""still outrageous"" that big tech firms were not paying their fair share into society.

Last month, Amazon came under fire for paying  Â£14.7m in UK corporation tax last year, despite reporting sales of Â£2.3bn. Google has faced similar criticism. Earlier this week,the Organisation for Economic and Development (OECD), proposed tax changes aimed at making global firms pay more tax. The proposals would give governments more power specifically to tax big technology firms such as Apple, Facebook and Google. Companies that do business in more than one country have long been a challenge for tax authorities, because they can structure their business in a way that minimises their tax bills. The OECD's proposal includes new rules on where tax should be paid and on the proportion of their profits that should be taxed in each country.

"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter returns to UKFive-year-old Gabriella has promised her jailed mum she will be ""brave"", dad Richard tells reporters.","This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter, Gabriella, cuts her own ""welcome home"" cake with help from her dad, Richard The five-year-old daughter of a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran on spying charges has returned to the UK. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, a charity worker from London, has been detained for three years over the allegations, which she denies. Her British-born daughter Gabriella, who has been living with her grandparents in Tehran, returned on Thursday to start school in the UK. Gabriella's father, Richard Ratcliffe, said she has been ""so brave"". What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Appearing with Gabriella at a news conference at the Houses of Parliament, Mr Ratcliffe said she struggled speaking English but had been keen to tell him that she wanted to visit a toy shop. He said she ""told mum that she'll see her back in London"". ""She's promised mummy she's going to be brave. It's just lovely to hold her again."" Richard Ratcliffe embraces his daughter, Gabriella, after she landed back in the UK Gabriella brought a cake into a news conference at the Houses of Parliament on Friday afternoon Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 during a visit to introduce Gabriella to relatives, her family said.

Earlier this month Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe wrote an open letter to mothers of Iran, in which she said: ""In the near future, my baby will leave me to go to her father and start school in the UK.  It will be a daunting trip for her travelling, and for me left behind."" Last week, Mr Ratcliffe from West Hampstead, toldthe Times,externalthat they had agreed Gabriella should return to the UK for the start of the school year in September, but postponed the decision after Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was taken to a psychiatric hospital. ""I spoke to Nazanin yesterday and she was reasonably distraught,"" he told reporters at Westminster on Friday. ""One of the things she really didn't want to happen was her daughter to leave while she was still in prison."" Mr Ratcliffe said there is a ""real risk"" his wife's mental and physical condition will deteriorate. Richard and Nazanin agreed that Gabriella should return to the UK to begin school, the family said In response to Gabriella's return, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reiterated his earlier calls for Iran to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and said the family's situation was one that no parent ""should ever have to face"". ""Gabriella is an innocent child and should be able to go to school and be with both her parents,"" he said. ""We continue to urge Iran to release Nazanin immediately so the family can be reunited in the UK."" His predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, described the news of Gabriella's homecoming as ""the definition of bittersweet"". He called on the British government to ""redouble"" its efforts to secure Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, tweeting: ""Now more than ever, she needs to know she's not alone."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was temporarily reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a three-day release from prison in August last year Mr Ratcliffe told reporters that his wife had shared a prison cell with British-Australian woman Jolie King, who had been detained with her boyfriend in Tehran earlier this year for reportedly flying a drone without a permit. Ms King and her boyfriend, Mark Firkin,were released last week. Iran has detained a number of dual citizens and foreign nationals in recent years, many of them on spying charges. The exact numbers are not known. The arrests and arow over the seizure of oil tankers in the Gulf.have led to increasingly tense diplomatic relations between the UK and Iran. Iran also claims it is owed Â£400m by the UK in relation to contracts signed more than 40 years ago between the International Military Services (IMS) - a company that has ceased trading but was used by the Ministry of Defence to sell defence equipment - and the pre-Islamic Revolution Iranian regime. The contracts involved the supply of tanks to Iran, which were paid for but undelivered in the wake of the country's 1979 revolution. Litigation regarding the dispute is under way. The UK government said it does not ""share the view"" that the IMS debt, or any other bilateral issue, is the reason for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's detention, and that the two issues are ""entirely separate"". ""Iran must live up to its responsibilities under international human rights law and under the Vienna convention on consular relations, and release Nazanin, and the other dual national cases, without delay,"" a government statement issued by the Foreign Office said. The family's MP, Tulip Siddiq, said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe wants to know why the UK government is not doing more to secure her release.

""Every single one of those politicians have looked me in the eye and said that this has nothing to do with the debt that we owe Iran. But we know that's not true."" Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnsoncalled for the release of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffeduring a meeting with Iran's president. In 2017, when he was foreign secretary, Mr Johnson had to apologise after saying Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran ""teaching people journalism"" - despite her family's insistence she was there on holiday.

First person to walk in space dies aged 85Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov floated above the Earth for 12 minutes in 1965.Europe,"Leonov's 1965 mission was celebrated in 2017 Russian film, ""The Spacewalker"" Soviet cosmonaut Alexei Leonov, who in 1965 became the first person in history to spacewalk, has died aged 85. Tethered to his spaceship by a 4.8m (16ft) cable, the Russian floated above the Earth for 12 minutes. ""You just can't comprehend it. Only out there can you feel the greatness - the huge size of all that surrounds us,"" Leonov told the BBC in 2014. But the outing nearly ended in disaster as his spacesuit inflated and he struggled to get back in the spaceship. At a time when the US and the USSR were jostling for space supremacy, Leonov's mission was lauded as a triumph at home. But Leonov's ambitions did not stop at his spacewalk. He went on to become the commander of Soyuz-Apollo, the first ever joint US-Soviet mission in 1975. Alexei Leonov describes his first spacewalk How Russia won the space race Leonov died at Moscow's Burdenko hospital on Friday after a long illness, his assistant confirmed. Russian cosmonaut Oleg Kononenko said Leonov's death was a ""loss for the whole planet"", while President Vladimir Putin said he admired the astronaut's courage. Leonov was born in Siberia, his father a victim of Stalinist repression. His family moved to Kaliningrad in western Russia in 1948. As an air force pilot he was selected to train as a cosmonaut in 1960. He trained with Yuri Gagarin, the first human in space, and they became close friends. This video can not be played Watch archive footage of Leonov's and other spacewalks Leonov described his sortie into outer space in numerous media interviews. ""It was so quiet I could even hear my heart beat,"" he told the Observer. ""I was surrounded by stars and was floating without much control. I will never forget the moment. I also felt an incredible sense of responsibility. Of course, I did not know that I was about to experience the most difficult moments of my life - getting back into the capsule."" In the vacuum of outer space, his spacesuit began to balloon out of shape and its fabric began to stiffen dangerously. Alexei Leonov (L) took part in the first joint space mission between the Soviet Union and America in 1975 His hands slipped out of his gloves, his feet came out of his boots, and Leonov could no longer get through his spaceship's airlock. Even worse, the craft was hurtling towards Earth's shadow. In five minutes, the cosmonaut realised he would be plunged into total darkness. He managed to release some of the oxygen from his spacesuit and was barely able to squeeze himself back into the capsule headfirst. He lost 6kg (13 pounds) in the process. Leonov went into space twice, in 1965 and 1975 He and his pilot Pavel Belyayev were hailed as heroes on their return, but only after crash-landing in a forest in the Ural mountains and waiting three days to be rescued. A decade later, Leonov was one of two Soviet cosmonauts involved in the first docking of US and Soviet spaceships - the Apollo 18 and Soyuz 19 - during a period of detente between the two countries. He was twice awarded the country's top medal, Hero of the Soviet Union. Although Leonov was best-known for his exploits as an astronaut, his artwork also garnered accolades throughout his life. A self-taught artist, Leonov was adept at drawing in zero gravity. It was during the space-walking mission of 1965 that Leonov created the first artwork in space. This video can not be played Technology behind Alexei Leonov's spacewalk In the artwork, Leonov depicted a small yet remarkable sunrise from the vantage point of the Voskhod 2 spacecraft. London's Science Museum exhibited Leonov's coloured pencil drawing as part of a major exhibition on cosmonauts in 2015. ""You can imagine it being a bit of a nightmare â¦ but he wanted to stop the time and share this moment with other people,"" curator of the exhibition Natalia Sidlina said. Leonov's artworks drew heavily on his experiences in space. His other notable artworks included a self-portrait of his 1965 spacewalk, sketches of fellow astronauts and landscapes in the former Soviet Union. Archive footage of key spacewalks.

Sterling surges on Brexit deal hopes,"Sterling surged on Friday to a three-month high amid investor optimism about a last-minute Brexit deal between Britain and the European Union. Against the dollar the pound rose 1.9% to $1.2682, and against the euro was up 1.67% at â¬1.1489. The currency has rallied more than 3% since Thursday, its biggest two-day gain since before the June 2016 referendum on leaving the EU. Many UK-focused shares also surged, with Royal Bank of Scotland up 11.6%. On Friday, EU Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier said he had had a ""constructive"" meeting with UK Brexit secretary, Stephen Barclay. That followed talks between the Irish and British prime ministers on Thursday, after which a joint statement spoke of ""a pathway to a possible deal"". Deutsche Bank's foreign exchange strategist George Saravelos said he was ""turning more optimistic on Brexit"" and no longer negative on the pound, while JPMorgan said the Anglo-Irish statement may have ""changed everything"". Brexit: EU gives go-ahead for 'more intense' talks Aerospace industry seeks Brexit reassurance ""The chances of a deal seem to have improved and the pound has moved accordingly but hurdles still remain,"" said Dean Turner, economist at UBS Wealth Management. ""Time to thrash out the details of the deal are tight, and then there is the question of parliamentary approval."" Other analysts cautioned that trading on the financial markets was thin, leading to higher volatility and a sharp jump in some share prices. Meanwhile, another analyst said the price surges were probably due to algorithms driving the market. Following the more confident noises coming from Brussels, London and Dublin, there were hopes that a meeting between British and EU negotiators will pave the way for a Brexit transition deal at a summit on 17-18 October. The rally in sterling undermined the UK's export-heavy FTSE 100 stocks, and the blue chip index itself was up under 0.9%. But shares exposed to UK growth and consumers soared. Housebuilders Persimmon, Barratt and Taylor Wimpey rose more than 10%. Next rose nearly 8.5%, and ITV more than 6%. The more UK-focussed FTSE 250 index was up more than 4%. The yield on 10-year British government bonds was on track for its biggest three-day rise since 2017.

Deal reached 'in principle' for Wrightbus sale,"This video can not be played Workers at the troubled bus manufacturer Wrightbus celebrated after a deal for its sale was agreed A deal has been reached in principle for the sale of Wrightbus. Bidder Jo Bamford said agreement had been reached with ""the Wright family for the Wrightbus factory and land"". ""We are still to conclude a deal with the administrators but are pleased to report this important step in the right direction,"" he said. He thanked DUP MP Ian Paisley for ""his hard work and diligence in helping to mediate what has at times been a tricky negotiation"". Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure Wrightbus future 'in the balance' says DUP MP On Thursday, the owner of the Wrightbus factory,Jeff Wright, said he had not been able to reach a deal to sell the company to a new owner. The sticking point had been farmland he did not consider part of the factory site. However, a statement from Jeff Wright on Friday confirmed that the farmland will now be gifted to the local council as ""a tribute"" to his father, Sir William Wright. There are plans for a potential innovation centre for start-ups on the site. ""This legacy gift is a tribute not only to my father, his father before him, and the Wright family members, but most importantly is a tribute to the generations of workers who helped build a proud manufacturing tradition in Ballymena,"" said Mr Wright. ""It is my true wish to see this legacy used for the purposes of expanding manufacturing and benefiting our local community."" George Brash from the Unite union said the ""momentous day"" was ""a tribute to the workforce"" and the solidarity they have shown. ""There are a lot of smiling faces at the moment,"" he added. ""We just need everything confirmed."" Jeff Wright said the farmland would be gifted to the local council as a tribute to his father Sir William Wright (above) Mr Bamford, an English industrialist, who is the son of JCB chairman Lord Bamford, wants to buy the Wrightbus business and the factory through his Ryse Hydrogen company. Mr Paisley, who was involved in negotiations over the farmland on Thursday night, welcomed Friday's announcement, saying Mr Bamford is ""concluding the final arrangements with the administrator to take over Wrightbus and get men and women back to work building buses"". Speaking on the BBC's Evening Extra programme, Mr Paisley said: ""To have got a major British industrialist to come over and invest in the workforce of north Antrim, and put significant millions behind them and to get this over the line... a piece of farmland wasn't going to get in the way."" He added that the land would not be used for personal gain and that Jo Bamford ""will work that piece of land in partnership with the council"" to create opportunities for the local population. TUV leader and North Antrim MLA Jim Allister said he was ""delighted"" to hear the news of the deal. ""I want to commend all who made this possible, many working tirelessly behind the scenes,"" he added. ""I particularly salute the fortitude of the workers."" By Clodagh Rice, BBC News NI business correspondent Workers gathered outside Wrightbus breathed a sigh of relief - there were even bottles of champagne opened in celebration. The news came through on Friday morning that Jo Bamford has agreed in principle to buy the factory. Work is ongoing on the details with the administrators - we don't yet know how many of the workers will be kept. The farmland that was a sticking point previously has been gifted by Jeff Wright to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council as a tribute to his father and generations of workers. The council is in negotiations with Queens university - it hopes the site could be used as an innovation project as part of the Belfast city deal. Manufacturing NI tweeted that it was great news that a deal had been done which could lead to a deal being secured by the administrators, but added that Deloitte needed to be aware that ""in saving some jobs at Wrightbus they don't kill jobs in the SME supply chain who are owed millions"".

Iranian tanker 'explosion' off Saudi coast,"Pictures aboard the Sabiti - allegedly taken on Friday - were published by Iranian state TV An Iranian-owned oil tanker has been attacked in the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia, Iran's foreign ministry says. The ministry said the tanker Sabiti had been hit twice, causing some damage. Earlier Iran's national oil company (NIOC) said two explosions on the vessel had been caused ""likely by missiles"". But it dismissed earlier reports quoting it as saying the missiles were likely to have come from Saudi Arabia. In recent months ""other sabotage acts"" had been carried out against Iranian tankers in the Red Sea and these were being investigated, foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. The incident took place at 04:50 (01:50 GMT) about 95km (60 miles) from the Saudi city of Jeddah, Iran's Mehr news agency said. Two of the vessel's tanks were struck, it added, causing damage measuring between 0.5m and 1.5m. There were no reports of injuries. The Sabiti is now sailing towards the Gulf, Mehr said. The reports have so far only come from Iranian sources. There has been no comment from Saudi officials. Iranian state TV earlier identified the vessel as the Sinopa, but the NIOC later said it was the Sabiti. Pictures allegedly taken on Friday aboard the Sabiti have been published by Iranian state TV, showing no visible signs of damage. Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent This story is as clear as mud. It seemed to change. Two different ships have been named - the Sinopa and the Sabiti. We had reports of missiles striking the tanker and then an accusation briefly levelled against Saudi Arabia for committing what was described as an ""act of terrorism"". That claim seems to have been dropped quite quickly. And crucially there is no independent evidence at all that the vessel was struck. Pictures were released later in the morning showing nothing untoward. And most crucially both tankers are currently steaming at full speed in their different directions so there is no evidence that either vessel has been impaired in any way. Publicly available ship tracking records show both ships are currently in the Red Sea. The Sinopa turned its transmitter on earlier this week for the first time in more than 50 days. The Sabiti, meanwhile, turned its tracker on early Friday after nearly 60 days of no transmissions. Under international regulations, all vessels above a certain tonnage must be fitted with the trackers, known as automatic identification systems (AIS). But ships are not required to have their AIS turned on all the time. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A source at maritime analytics firm Windward told the BBC it was common for Iranian tankers to turn off AIS to avoid detection - often to evade international sanctions or harassment from Saudi Arabia. Because of safety regulations, vessels must have their AIS switched on when they are close to the Suez Canal. The Windward source said Sabiti was behaving unusually because, when going through the canal, it only switches on its AIS when rules require - but in this instance, the AIS had been turned on hundreds of miles from the Suez after being ""dark"" for two months. Michelle Bockmann, an analyst at shipping newspaper Lloyds List, told the BBC that the tanker - whichever one it was - was ""probably"" carrying oil to Syria. This video can not be played How sanctions affect Iran... in five objects ""That really is, along with China, the only market there is for Iranian crude now since the US tightened sanctions in May,"" said Ms Bockmann. ""We're seeing geopolitics playing out within the global shipping and tanker markets, and this is just an extension of the instability that we're seeing in the region."" The latest incident came amid heightened tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia in recent months. Last month, 18 drones and seven cruise missiles hit a major oil field and processing facility in Saudi Arabia, which blamed Iran for the attack. And US officials said Iran was responsible for attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as attacks on another four tankers in May. Iran denied involvement in all the incidents.

Casualties mount as Turkey presses Syria offensive,"This video can not be played The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict Casualties are increasing as Turkey presses on with its cross-border offensive on Kurdish-held areas of northern Syria. At least 11 civilians have died and dozens of fighters from the Kurdish-led SDF and pro-Turkish factions have been killed, reports say. The first death of a Turkish soldier was confirmed by Turkey's military. Tens of thousands of people have fled their homes, amid growing international criticism of the offensive. Turkey moved into northern Syria on Wednesday after US President Donald Trump pulled American troops out of the area. Analysts say the US withdrawal in effect gave Turkey the green light to begin its cross-border assault. Much of the region has been outside the control of the Syrian government as a consequence of the civil war which began in 2011. It has been controlled by the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) since 2015. The SDF have been key allies of the US in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group but Turkey regards the Kurdish militias of the SDF as ""terrorists"" who support an anti-Turkish insurgency. Turkey's Syria offensive explained in four maps Who are the Kurds? Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained Turkey defended its offensive as a bid to create a ""safe zone"" free of Kurdish militias which could also house Syrian refugees. One major concern for the international community is the fate of thousands of suspected IS prisoners, including many foreign nationals, being guarded by Kurdish-led forces in the region. On Thursday, Turkish troops partly encircled the border towns of Ras al-Ain and Tal Abyad. But while the Turkish military said its operation was going to plan, Kurdish sources and activists from the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) said the offensive had not made much progress. Turkey Syria offensive: Your questions answered Four maps explaining the offensive 'The Kurds have no friends but the mountains' Turkish warplanes have struck targets in both towns, and video footage has shown columns of smoke rising above them. Tal Abyad's only public hospital has been forced to close. The Kurdish Red Crescent said there had been 11 confirmed civilian deaths so far and 28 serious injuries, mostly in Ras al-Ain and another border town, Qamishli. Some are children. At least five people, including a Syrian baby, were reportedly killed in Kurdish shelling of Turkish border towns. The SOHR reported at least 29 deaths among the SDF and 17 from among pro-Turkish Syrian rebels, the Syrian National Army, as more than 10 villages fell into Turkish hands. This video can not be played Footage from the start of the Turkish offensive In a later report they said that seven members of pro-Turkish forces including a Turkish soldier had been killed as the SDF retook a village in Tal Abyad region. Could Turkish offensive unleash IS threat? 'The Kurds have no friends but the mountains' What did the Kurds ever do for the US? Turkey's military confirmed a soldier's death, and said three others had been wounded. Turkey's Anadolu news agency said late on Thursday 228 Kurdish militants had been ""neutralised"" since the start of the operation. A refugee crisis is developing. Some 64,000 people have already reportedly fled their homes, the International Rescue Committee aid organisation said. Residents flee their home town of Ras al-Ain Aid groups say as many as 450,000 could be forced to move. According to aid workers on the ground, the vast majority of civilians have fled Tal Abyad and those who remain fear for their lives. Meanwhile a statement by the UN refugee agency says the Turkish bombardment has affected key civilian infrastructure such as water pumping stations, dams, power stations and oil fields. Thousands of people could lose adequate access to clean water in Hasakeh region, it said. Turkey wants to create a ""safe zone"" running for 480km (300 miles) along the Syrian side of the border but says it will not advance deeper than a planned 32km limit. SDF - Syrian Democratic Forces -A multi-ethnic alliance of mostly Kurdish and Arab militias that has been the critical partner on the ground in Syria for the US-led multinational coalition against the jihadist group Islamic State (IS). YPG - People's Protection Units -The military wing of the Syrian Kurdish Democratic Union Party (PYD). It is the dominant force in the SDF. The Women's Protection Units (YPJ) is the YPG's all-female brigade. PKK - Kurdistan Workers' Party -A Kurdish rebel group that has fought for Kurdish autonomy in Turkey for three decades. It is designated as a terrorist group by Turkey, the US and EU. Turkey says the YPG is an extension of the PKK - a claim both groups deny. SNA - Syrian National Army -The new name for a loose alliance of Syrian rebel factions backed by Turkey previously known as the Free Syrian Army (FSA). SNA fighters are taking part in the ground offensive in north-eastern Syria. The UN Security Council discussed the situation on Thursday at the request of its current five EU members - the UK, France, Germany, Belgium and Poland - who are calling for Turkey to halt its military offensive. Who are the IS prisoners no-one wants? Why the battle for northern Syria matters UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres expressed his ""deep concern"" at the rising violence. On Friday Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said he had shared ""serious concerns"" about the operation in a meeting with Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlut Cavusoglu. He expected Turkey, a Nato member, to ""act with restraint"", he added. Mr Erdogan has strongly defended the incursion, threatening to send some of the 3.6 million Syrian refugees it hosts to Europe if the Turkish offensive is described as an occupation. The SDF say they are holding more than 12,000 suspected IS members in seven prisons, and at least 4,000 of them are foreign nationals. The exact locations have not been revealed, but some are reportedly close to the Turkish border. This video can not be played Inside the camp of IS families in Syria Two camps - Roj and Ain Issa - holding families of suspected IS members are inside the ""safe zone"". On Friday the Kurdish-led authorities said discussions were under way on how to move the Ain Issa camp, which had been hit by shelling. Turkey has said it will take responsibility for the IS prisoners it found during its offensive. The IS prisoners no-one wants 'Worst of the worst' IS fighters in US custody Smoke billows in border areas in Syria.

"Deal reached 'in principle' for Wrightbus saleBidder Jo Bamford says a deal has been reached ""for the Wrightbus factory and land"".Northern Ireland","This video can not be played Workers at the troubled bus manufacturer Wrightbus celebrated after a deal for its sale was agreed A deal has been reached in principle for the sale of Wrightbus. Bidder Jo Bamford said agreement had been reached with ""the Wright family for the Wrightbus factory and land"". ""We are still to conclude a deal with the administrators but are pleased to report this important step in the right direction,"" he said. He thanked DUP MP Ian Paisley for ""his hard work and diligence in helping to mediate what has at times been a tricky negotiation"". Wrightbus: From driving seat to financial failure Wrightbus future 'in the balance' says DUP MP On Thursday, the owner of the Wrightbus factory,Jeff Wright, said he had not been able to reach a deal to sell the company to a new owner. The sticking point had been farmland he did not consider part of the factory site. However, a statement from Jeff Wright on Friday confirmed that the farmland will now be gifted to the local council as ""a tribute"" to his father, Sir William Wright. There are plans for a potential innovation centre for start-ups on the site. ""This legacy gift is a tribute not only to my father, his father before him, and the Wright family members, but most importantly is a tribute to the generations of workers who helped build a proud manufacturing tradition in Ballymena,"" said Mr Wright. ""It is my true wish to see this legacy used for the purposes of expanding manufacturing and benefiting our local community."" George Brash from the Unite union said the ""momentous day"" was ""a tribute to the workforce"" and the solidarity they have shown. ""There are a lot of smiling faces at the moment,"" he added. ""We just need everything confirmed."" Jeff Wright said the farmland would be gifted to the local council as a tribute to his father Sir William Wright (above) Mr Bamford, an English industrialist, who is the son of JCB chairman Lord Bamford, wants to buy the Wrightbus business and the factory through his Ryse Hydrogen company. Mr Paisley, who was involved in negotiations over the farmland on Thursday night, welcomed Friday's announcement, saying Mr Bamford is ""concluding the final arrangements with the administrator to take over Wrightbus and get men and women back to work building buses"". Speaking on the BBC's Evening Extra programme, Mr Paisley said: ""To have got a major British industrialist to come over and invest in the workforce of north Antrim, and put significant millions behind them and to get this over the line... a piece of farmland wasn't going to get in the way."" He added that the land would not be used for personal gain and that Jo Bamford ""will work that piece of land in partnership with the council"" to create opportunities for the local population. TUV leader and North Antrim MLA Jim Allister said he was ""delighted"" to hear the news of the deal. ""I want to commend all who made this possible, many working tirelessly behind the scenes,"" he added. ""I particularly salute the fortitude of the workers."" By Clodagh Rice, BBC News NI business correspondent Workers gathered outside Wrightbus breathed a sigh of relief - there were even bottles of champagne opened in celebration. The news came through on Friday morning that Jo Bamford has agreed in principle to buy the factory. Work is ongoing on the details with the administrators - we don't yet know how many of the workers will be kept. The farmland that was a sticking point previously has been gifted by Jeff Wright to Mid and East Antrim Borough Council as a tribute to his father and generations of workers. The council is in negotiations with Queens university - it hopes the site could be used as an innovation project as part of the Belfast city deal. Manufacturing NI tweeted that it was great news that a deal had been done which could lead to a deal being secured by the administrators, but added that Deloitte needed to be aware that ""in saving some jobs at Wrightbus they don't kill jobs in the SME supply chain who are owed millions"".

Barnier: Brexit like climbing a mountain,"This video can not be played Barnier: We had a constructive meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has likened Brexit to ""climbing a mountain"", after holding talks with Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay. Mr Barnier urged ""patience"", as the EU and UK look to reach a deal ahead of a crucial summit next week. Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk said Irish PM Leo Varadkar had given ""promising signals"" that an agreement is still possible. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October. The summit on 17 and 18 October is seen as the last chance for the UK and the EU to agree a deal ahead of the Brexit deadline. Something has changed - but there are miles to go Will 'Super Saturday' be a decisive Brexit moment? 'No community will have Brexit plans veto' - Smith Corbyn: No Brexit referendum before election Following his ""technical"" discussion with Mr Barclay in Brussels, Mr Barnier told reporters: ""Be patient."" He added: ""Brexit is like climbing a mountain. We need vigilance, determination and patience."" Steve Barclay held talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said he suspected the best outcome for the UK that could emerge from the Barclay-Barnier meeting would be the EU agreeing to restart fuller and ""more intense"" negotiations. Earlier this week, several senior EU figures played down the chances of Brexit happening with a deal agreed to by both sides. But on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Varadkar held a one-to-one discussion - described by both as ""very positive and very promising"" - at Thornton Manor, Merseyside. Mr Varadkar said talks were at a ""very sensitive stage"" but he was now ""convinced"" the UK wanted a deal, adding: ""I do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks."" Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar discussed Brexit on Thursday But he refused to be drawn on what ""concessions"" had been made by either side during his meeting with Mr Johnson, while Downing Street has not commented on Irish press reports suggesting ""significant movement"" on the UK prime minister's part. Speaking on a visit to Cyprus on Friday, Mr Tusk said the UK had not ""come forward with a workable, realistic proposal"", but added he had received ""promising signals"" from Mr Varadkar that a deal was still possible. ""Of course there is no guarantee of success and time is practically up, but even the slightest chance must be used,"" he added. ""A no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU."" With three weeks to go until the Brexit deadline, the prime minister continues to insist the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month. That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October. Should any new deal be reached between the EU and UK, it will still have to be approved by MPs in Parliament. The issue of Northern Ireland's consent - and how it is achieved - for post-Brexit arrangements has emerged as a key factor in EU-UK negotiations. But Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said there was ""a range of options"" for finding consent for the proposals. He also denied any ""one community"" would have a veto over Brexit plans, following concern from some NI parties that the PM's proposals could give the Democratic Unionist Party exactly that. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?

Brexit: EU gives go-ahead for 'more intense' talks,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: Brexit is not a done deal EU countries have agreed to ""intensify"" Brexit talks with the UK over the next few days. The development comes after a meeting in Brussels between Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay and EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, described by both sides as ""constructive"". But UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said there was ""a way to go"" before a deal could be reached. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October. A European leaders' summit next week is seen as the last chance to agree a deal before that deadline. Mr Johnson put forward revised proposals for a deal last week, designed to avoid a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit.

In Paris, French President Emmanuel Macron was asked if there was hope of a deal, replying: ""Let's wait for the next few hours."" Leader of Northern Ireland's Democratic Unionist Party Arlene Foster said ""anything that traps Northern Ireland in the EU, whether single market or customs union, as the rest of the UK leaves will not have our support -  the prime minister is very mindful of that"".

Three people were stabbed and two others were hurt when a man with a large knife started ""lunging and attacking people"", according to police.

What will happen next?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

"Crash death parents 'considering civil action'Harry Dunn's father says the family has ""heard nothing"" since meeting Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab.Northampton","Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo The parents of a teenage motorcyclist killed in a crash have said they are considering civil action against a US diplomat's wife suspected of driving the other vehicle. Harry Dunn, 19, died in a crash with a Volvo in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Suspect Anne Sacoolas later left the UK despite telling police she had no such plans. Mr Dunn's father Tim said the family had ""heard nothing"" sincemeeting Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab. He said they were also ""still waiting"" for information from the US government following President Donald Trump's comments. On Wednesday, the president said his administration would speak to Mrs Sacoolas ""very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet"". This video can not be played Donald Trump described the 19-year-old's death as a ""terrible accident"" But a briefing note held by Mr Trump at the press conference said Mrs Sacoolaswould not be returning to the UKafter being granted diplomatic immunity. Mr Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles said the US's apparent approach was ""beyond any realm of human thinking"". The family is still planning to go to the US. Tim Dunn said: ""We have to go to America and speak to the American people. We can't let this be swept under the carpet."" He said they had taken legal advice on civil action and it was ""an avenue we are looking at"". ""We are out of our depth really, I feel like I'm on autopilot,"" he added. In a civil case a complaint is made by a person or company in a law court against another person or company said to have done something to harm them. This is commonly referred to as being sued. The case is then dealt with by a judge, who determines whether the defendant has liability for causing the harm. The outcome can differ depending from which country the case is brought, but the if the defendant is found to be liable they often have to pay compensation in the form of damages. However, diplomatic immunity extends to civil cases. Prof Craig Barker, dean of the School of Law and Social Sciences at London South Bank University, said the couple ""could pursue action in the US"". He explained that the diplomatic immunity for civil cases only extends to the ""receiving state"", in this case the UK. But Prof Barker said the family ""would need to find a court in the US to accept the case,"" which he said would be costly and given the US stance may be difficult. He also said there could be a claim made against the US Government in the UK, but a case like that had never been tested in court. After speaking to Mr Raab on Wednesday, as well as their local MP and Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom, Mr Dunn said the family felt ""we've exhausted our governments efforts"". The teenager's parents described the meeting with Mr Raab as a ""publicity stunt"". Afterwards Mr Raab said the justice process was ""not being allowed to properly run its course"". Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police Nick Adderley said the investigation into the crash was ""carrying on"". ""We are expediting that file, so that file of evidence will be with the Crown Prosecution Service within the next few days,"" he said. He added the force was exploring ""nuances"" within diplomatic immunity in the hope of bringing Mrs Sacoolas back to the UK. South Northamptonshire Council said along with Northamptonshire County Council it had put up new signs around RAF Croughton making clear which side of the road to drive on. Tim Dunn said the message of support the family had received had been ""gobsmacking"" Mr Dunn has welcomed the idea of speaking with Mrs Sacoolas. ""We want answers from her about what happened, there are things the police cannot answer,"" he said. Police have said CCTV of the crash in which the teenager died shows a Volvo travelling on the wrong side of the road. Speaking at the press briefing on Wednesday - after his conversation with Prime Minister Boris Johnson - Mr Trump said: ""The woman was driving on the wrong side of the road, and that can happen. ""You know, those are the opposite roads, that happens. I won't say it ever happened to me, but it did. ""So a young man was killed, the person that was driving the automobile has diplomatic immunity, we're going to speak to her very shortly and see if we can do something where they meet."" Harry Dunn crash: What is diplomatic immunity? Crash death parents 'let down' by governments PM's plea to US to rethink immunity over crash Speaking in Northampton on Thursday, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Trump's comments were ""crass and insensitive"". He also said the use of diplomatic immunity in the case was ""completely unacceptable"", and that more pressure should be put the US to return Mrs Sacoolas to the UK. The crash in which Mr Dunn died happened close to RAF Croughton, a US Air Force communications station, where Mrs Sacoolas's husband Jonathan had been working. Number 10 said the prime minister had urged Mr Trump to reconsider the decision to allow Mrs Sacoolas immunity in order that ""the individual involved can return to the UK, co-operate with police and allow Harry's family to receive justice"".

Three people were stabbed and two others were hurt when a man with a large knife started ""lunging and attacking people"", according to police. He chased two police community support officers (PCSOs) before being detained, the force said. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) believe he was acting alone. The force said the man had been assessed ""by specialist doctors"". Investigations into the motives behind the attack are continuing. One witness said they saw a man ""running around with a knife lunging at multiple people"", while another described people ""screaming and running"". The centre was put on lockdown as officers confronted the attacker, with some shoppers taking refuge in stores. There was a large police presence outside the Arndale shopping centre A shop worker, who only gave his name as Jordan, 23, said: ""A man was running around with a knife lunging at multiple people, one of which came into my store visibly shaken with a small graze. ""Soon after, security staff told all retail staff to close their doors and move the public to the back of the stores."" Speaking at a press conference, Assistant Chief Constable Russ Jackson said it was a ""random"" and ""brutal"" attack. As it happened: Manchester Arndale stabbings,external ACC Jackson said a man armed with a knife entered the Exchange Court area of the centre before he ""lunged"" at shoppers and began ""attacking people with the knife"".

Facebook UK pays Â£28.5m in tax as revenues jump,"Facebook's UK arm paid Â£28.5m in tax in 2018 as revenues hit a record Â£1.65bn on the back of strong advertising growth. The social media firms's latest UK accounts show that profits last year jumped by 54% to Â£96.6m. Facebook's total tax charge on those profits almost doubled to Â£30.4m, but was reduced due to adjustments. Tax campaigner and MP Margaret Hodge said such a low bill was ""outrageous"", but Facebook said it pays what it owes. Gross revenues from advertising and other activities rose 30% in 2018, a year when the Cambridge Analytica affair was at its height and the company was facing heavy criticism. The UK division spent Â£356m on research, development and engineering in the UK last year, the accounts filed at Companies House showed. Steve Hatch, the company's vice president for Northern Europe, said: ""The UK is now one of Facebook's most important hubs for global innovation. We continue to grow and invest heavily in the UK and by the end of the year we'll employ 3,000 people here. ""Businesses across the country use our platforms to grow and revenue from customers supported by our UK teams is now recorded here so that any taxable profit is subject to UK corporation tax."" Facebook said it complies with tax laws in all jurisdictions and pays what is legally due. But Ms Hodge, a former chairwoman of the Public Accounts Committee, and who now leads an all-party parliamentary group looking into the tax system, tweeted that it was ""still outrageous"" that big tech firms were not paying their fair share into society.

Last month, Amazon came under fire for paying  Â£14.7m in UK corporation tax last year, despite reporting sales of Â£2.3bn. Google has faced similar criticism. Earlier this week,the Organisation for Economic and Development (OECD), proposed tax changes aimed at making global firms pay more tax. The proposals would give governments more power specifically to tax big technology firms such as Apple, Facebook and Google. Companies that do business in more than one country have long been a challenge for tax authorities, because they can structure their business in a way that minimises their tax bills. The OECD's proposal includes new rules on where tax should be paid and on the proportion of their profits that should be taxed in each country.

Tusk: Promising signals over Brexit progress,"This video can not be played Barnier: We had a constructive meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has likened Brexit to ""climbing a mountain"", after holding talks with Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay. Mr Barnier urged ""patience"", as the EU and UK look to reach a deal ahead of a crucial summit next week. Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk said Irish PM Leo Varadkar had given ""promising signals"" that an agreement is still possible. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October. The summit on 17 and 18 October is seen as the last chance for the UK and the EU to agree a deal ahead of the Brexit deadline. Something has changed - but there are miles to go Will 'Super Saturday' be a decisive Brexit moment? 'No community will have Brexit plans veto' - Smith Corbyn: No Brexit referendum before election Following his ""technical"" discussion with Mr Barclay in Brussels, Mr Barnier told reporters: ""Be patient."" He added: ""Brexit is like climbing a mountain. We need vigilance, determination and patience."" Steve Barclay held talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said he suspected the best outcome for the UK that could emerge from the Barclay-Barnier meeting would be the EU agreeing to restart fuller and ""more intense"" negotiations. Earlier this week, several senior EU figures played down the chances of Brexit happening with a deal agreed to by both sides. But on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Varadkar held a one-to-one discussion - described by both as ""very positive and very promising"" - at Thornton Manor, Merseyside. Mr Varadkar said talks were at a ""very sensitive stage"" but he was now ""convinced"" the UK wanted a deal, adding: ""I do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks."" Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar discussed Brexit on Thursday But he refused to be drawn on what ""concessions"" had been made by either side during his meeting with Mr Johnson, while Downing Street has not commented on Irish press reports suggesting ""significant movement"" on the UK prime minister's part. Speaking on a visit to Cyprus on Friday, Mr Tusk said the UK had not ""come forward with a workable, realistic proposal"", but added he had received ""promising signals"" from Mr Varadkar that a deal was still possible. ""Of course there is no guarantee of success and time is practically up, but even the slightest chance must be used,"" he added. ""A no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU."" With three weeks to go until the Brexit deadline, the prime minister continues to insist the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month. That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October. Should any new deal be reached between the EU and UK, it will still have to be approved by MPs in Parliament. The issue of Northern Ireland's consent - and how it is achieved - for post-Brexit arrangements has emerged as a key factor in EU-UK negotiations. But Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said there was ""a range of options"" for finding consent for the proposals. He also denied any ""one community"" would have a veto over Brexit plans, following concern from some NI parties that the PM's proposals could give the Democratic Unionist Party exactly that. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?

Abiy Ahmed: The man changing Ethiopia,"Ethiopia's Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed was once widely praised outside the country for his reforming zeal but that image was shattered after he launched a civil war in the north of the country in November 2020. His journey from darling of the international community to condemnation has been swift. Bagging the Nobel Peace Prize in October 2019 for finally bringing an end to the 20-year stalemate with Eritrea cemented his international status. But the war in Ethiopia's Tigray region has meant a rapid reversal. He passed his first electoral test in June in polls marred by a partial opposition boycott and postponements in parts of the country because of insecurity. Enthusiastic crowds and a number of visiting prominent African leaders came out to celebrate his swearing-in in early October. But that masked deep divisions in the country. There was a jubilant atmosphere among those who came to celebrate Abiy Ahmed's swearing-in He first became prime minister in 2018 at the age of 41, taking on the job against the backdrop of anti-government protests. His youthful energy and beaming smile offered hope. Mr Abiy's governing Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front (EPRDF) coalition was deep into its third decade in power and had been dogged by accusations of repression and human rights abuses. This included the locking up of opponents and silencing of journalists. Abiy Ahmed won the Noble Peace Prize in 2019 for ending hostilities with Eritrea The EPRDF had overseen speedy economic growth but many felt excluded from its benefits. This feeling of marginalisation, particularly among the country's largest ethnic group, the Oromo, fuelled a wave of demonstrations. Mr Abiy, an Oromo himself, was promoted to the top job and immediately set about addressing concerns in a dizzying period of reforms. He released thousands of political prisoners, lifted restrictions on the independent media and invited the country's once-banned opposition groups back into the country from exile. He backed a woman to become president, created gender parity in the cabinet and established a ministry of peace. The crowning achieving was the peace deal with Eritrea and the reopening of the common border. Mr Abiy toured the country and spoke about bringing the multi-ethnic country together. He devised a new political philosophy - medemer -aimed at fostering a sense of national unity in the face of ethnic divisions. He also wanted to celebrate that diversity. He enjoyed widespread popularity, partly as a result of the dramatic changes in the country, but part of his appeal was also his personal story. There were large rallies backing the prime minister's reforms in 2018 Born in Beshaha, a coffee-farming district in south-western Ethiopia, from Christian and Muslim parents, he was quickly seen as someone capable of uniting an increasingly divided country. As the country's first ethnic Oromo leader in recent years, he had the attention of protesting youths who demanded greater political inclusion. He travelled across the country projecting youthful exuberance. His approachability contrasted with the fear-inducing distance of his predecessors and for many ordinary citizens he met on his frequent trips, he was nothing like any recent leader they knew. Nevertheless, he had been an insider. He was in the military where he rose to the rank of lieutenant colonel. He was then the founder and director of the country's Information Network and Security Agency, which was responsible for cyber-security in a country where the government had exercised tight control over the internet. After that he became the minister for science and technology. Key dates: Abiy Ahmed 1976: Born to Oromo Muslim father and Amhara Christian mother 1990: Joins the armed struggle against the Marxist Derg regime 2016: Briefly serves as minister of science and technology 2017: Completes doctorate in peace and security issues from Addis Ababa University 2018: Becomes prime minister 2019: Wins Nobel Peace Prize 2020: Conflict in Tigray begins But once the euphoria of Mr Abiy's early days as prime minister was gone, long-simmering tensions that had been kept under wraps during the days of authoritarian rule began to boil over. His push for unity while also celebrating diversity hit problems. Ethnic clashes and attacks on individuals because of their ethnicity have happened across the country, killing thousands. In 2019, close to two million people had fled their homes and were living elsewhere in the country. The assassination of prominent individuals, which had been a rarity in the past, began occurring with alarming frequency. The army's chief of staff and the leader of the country's second largest region were killed in a single nighthundreds of miles apart. Many other low- and mid-level officials met similar fates. And to quell growing violence, Mr Abiy returned to the tactics of previous governments. Internet and phone lines were shut down multiple times. Suspects were arrested en masse. Some were later released having spent weeks or months behind bars without a trial. The murder in 2020 of popular Oromo musician Hachalu Hundessain the capital, Addis Ababa, further heightened ethnic tensions and led to increased security measures. The violence that followed his killing in Oromia, the country's largest region, and Addis Ababa claimed more than 200 civilian lives. Prominent opposition figures were arrested on suspicion of inciting or escalating the violence. That prompted accusations against the prime minister by many Oromo activists that he was attempting to wipe out meaningful opposition in Oromia. But it was relations with another of the country's ethnically based states that has damned his reputation. How Ethiopia has changed over the last 50 years A quick guide to Ethiopia's election Fact-checking Ethiopiaâs Nobel Prize-winning PM The tragedy of Ethiopia's man-made famine His move in November 2019 to disband the EPRDF and form a new unified political organisation, the Prosperity Party, intensified his struggle with the Tigray People's Liberation Front (TPLF). The TPLF was the ruling party in Tigray and had been the dominant force within the EPRDF government. Sensing a reduction in its power, the TPLF refused to join Mr Abiy's new organisation. It essentially withdrew back to its heartland and tensions finally broke out into conflict between the federal government and the TPLF. The war, now nearly a year old, was described by Mr Abiy as a ""law-enforcement operation"". But as it has dragged on there are growing accusations of human rights abuses, mass rape, extra-judicial killing and the use of starvation as a tactic. The tone of the international expressions of concern has become increasingly harsh. Tigray has been devastated by the conflict The US, once a stalwart ally in the fight against terror, has announced visa restrictions on people found ""responsible for, or complicit in, undermining resolution of the crisis in Tigray"". It also imposed restrictions on economic and security assistance. This is a remarkable turnaround to how Mr Abiy and his government were viewed three years ago. But when it came to the election, it was his reputation at home that mattered most - and that had also been damaged. Last year's postponement of the poll when the coronavirus hit the country was seen by some as a power grab. Some ethnic Oromos ""who supported him or otherwise were neutral [towards him] have now turned against him"", argues Adem K Abebe, a Netherlands-based Ethiopian analyst. While in Tigray where there were suspicions towards him even from the very beginning, ""the mistrust towards him has morphed into hatred"", he adds. And while he has enjoyed some backing among ethnic Amharas, that has recently been affected by a recurrence of ethnic-based attacks against Amharas living in Oromia and Benishangul-Gumuz regions. The shifts in attitudes towards the prime minister are ""partly a result of the unrealistic expectations and personality cult that Mr Abiy sought to build"", Mr Adem told the BBC. He promised ""peace, democracy and prosperity while facing mistrust among significant portions of the population and now among key Western allies"". But it is not clear how much this bothers Mr Abiy. While he shuns interviews with reporters, he nonetheless enjoys the spotlight. A common theme in his numerous speeches and social media posts is how Ethiopia will prevail despite significant challenges. It appears that he sees criticism of his government as an inevitable by-product of attempting to bring change.

What will happen with Brexit in the next few weeks?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Famous winners of the Nobel Peace Prize,"Maria Ressa and Dmitry Muratov have jointly won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize Journalists Maria Ressa, from the Philippines, and Dmitry Muratov, from Russia, have won the 2021 Nobel Peace Prize for their ""efforts to safeguard freedom of expression"". Why are the organisation's prizes so prestigious, and who are some of the previous winners? Barack Obama (right) with his Nobel Peace Prize alongside Thorbjoern Jagland, of Norway's Nobel Committee Former US PresidentBarack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009,,externalfor ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"". President Obama said he was ""surprised and deeply humbled"" and would use it as a ""call to action"". However,there was criticism of his award, especially as he had only been in office for 12 days before the nomination deadline. Other notable winners include former US PresidentJimmy Carter (2002),external; child education activistMalala Yousafzai (shared 2014); theEuropean Union (2012); theUnited Nations and its then-general-secretary, Kofi Annan, (shared 2001),external; andSaint Teresa of Calcutta (1979).,external Albert Einstein (physics 1921),,externalMarie Curie (physics 1903 and chemistry 1911),,externalandHarold Pinter (literature 2005),externalhave also received Nobel prizes. Two people - author and philosopherJean-Paul Sartre in 1964,externaland Vietnamese politicianLe Duc Tho in 1973,external- rejected the prize, and four others were forced to decline by their countries. In 2016, there was uncertainty over whether singer Bob Dylan would accept the literature award before hefinally delivered his lecture for the prize in June 2017. Statistics from 1901 to 2019 947Nobel Laureates (920 people, 27 organisations) 17Age of youngest winner - education activist Malala Yousafzai 97Age of oldest winner - scientist John B Goodenough 53Prizes won by women 6People who declined an award The Nobel prizes are a series of annual awards given in the fields of physics, chemistry, medicine, literature, and peace. They are awarded to people ""who have conferred the greatest benefit to humankind"" in the previous 12 months. The quote is from the will of Swedish businessman - and inventor of dynamite - Alfred Nobel. He left most of his fortune in a fund to launch the awards, which were first presented in 1901. In 1968, an economic sciences prize was added by Sweden's central bank, although it does not count as a Nobel prize. Different organisations award the prize in each category every year. Five of the six are chosen in Sweden, while the Nobel Peace Prize is selected in Norway. Academics, university professors, scientists, previous winners and others all submit nominations. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, the shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years. Prize winners are called laureates, to signify the laurel wreath given to victors of contests in ancient Greece. More than one, but no more than three, people can win each prize. This video can not be played How do you choose a Nobel Prize winner? There have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars. And Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year. The recipient of each prize receives three things: a Nobel diploma, each of which is a unique work of art a Nobel medal, which have some differing designs a cash prize of 10m Swedish krona (Â£836,000; $1.1m) - which is split between winners when there is more than one. They have to deliver a lecture to receive the money The prizes are presented at ceremonies on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, in Stockholm and Oslo. Marie and Pierre Curie used their physics prize money in 1903 for further scientific research, and 2006 physics winner John Mather donated his cash to his foundation. In 1993, British biochemist Richard Roberts spent his medicine winnings on a croquet lawn, while fellow 1993 laureate Phillip Sharp bought a 100-year-old Federal-style house. The 2001 medicine winner, Sir Paul Nurse, bought himself a high-end motorbike. Meanwhile, 2006 literature laureate Orhan Pamuk established a museum in Istanbul.

Why Starbucks? The brands attacked in Hong Kong,"A worker cleans graffiti at a Starbucks coffee shop in Hong Kong on 30 September Broken glass, raging fires, and smashed up barricades: the pictures from Hong Kong in the past few days look like random chaos. But in the middle of the violence, most activists are being deliberate about the places they attack. So why are protesters targeting Starbucks? And the metro? And certain shops, restaurants and banks? Hong Kong is complex, but can largely be divided into those who support the protesters and their anti-Beijing stance, and those supportive of the mainland. So when peaceful protests turned into violence against property, big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi became targets for vandalism and spray-painting. But other less obvious places are also in the firing line. This video can not be played The weekend saw riots over the mask ban, a second person shot, and tear gas fired at protesters While Starbucks may be a US brand, the Hong Kong franchise is operated by a local company, Maxim's Caterers. Annie Wu, the daughter of the Maxim Group's founder, recently defended Hong Kong's police and criticised activists as ""radical protesters"". She made her comments with billionaire businesswoman Pansy Ho, representing the Hong Kong Federation of Women, at the United Nations Human Rights Council on 11 September. The two criticised ""a small group of radical protesters"" using ""systematic and calculated violent acts"". So protesters started directing their anger against Maxim's and the franchises it operates. The restaurant group is one of Hong Kong's largest, and includes other brands such as Genki Sushi and Arome bakery, which have also been targeted. Maxim's Caterers issued a statement saying Ms Wu ""does not hold any position at the company"" and was not involved in managerial decisions - but so far this has failed to satisfy protesters. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, so it has some autonomy andpeople have more rights Protests started in June against a controversial law which would have allowed Hong Kong criminal suspects to be sent to China to stand trial The law has been withdrawn butprotests have widenedto demand full democracy Clashes between police and activistshave been becoming increasingly violent In October,the city banned all face masksto try to shut down the protests Japanese fast food chain Yoshinoya has also come into the crosshairs. After there was confusion about a Facebook post - which some read as coded criticism of police - the operator of the Hong Kong franchise said he supported the police and government. Before long, Yoshinoya restaurants had their windows smashed and graffiti all over their walls. Another targeted brand is Best Mart 360, a chain of small grocery stores. It's an example of the divisions running within the Hong Kong population. The boss of Best Mart 360 is Hugo Lam Chi-fung, permanent honorary president of the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations which has held several demonstrations in support of China. Fujian is a Chinese province, and many local people have emigrated to Hong Kong over the years. Hong Kong's Fujianese community has been vocal in supporting the city's police force. Those demonstrations have led to clashes with activists - who have accused their opponents of being part of the Fujian triad gangs, a form of organised crime. Best Mart 360 has released several statements, insisting it is not linked to any Fujian triad. This video can not be played Hong Kong protests: 'I can't say I love China any more' The triad allegation has also been levelled against a mahjong house in a part of town home to the Fujianese community. Mahjong is a Chinese tile game, played socially. The Yi Pei Square house was accused of hiding pro-Beijing thugs who attacked local residents. The parlour has released a statement saying they are not Fujianese and in fact support the protesters' demands. There have also been cases where places have become the target of activists' anger based on mistaken assumptions of China ties. The Shanghai Commercial Bank is not mainland-owned but - despite its name - based in Hong Kong. The Yifang bubble tea chain was also wrongly associated with the mainland when in fact it's from Taiwan. In both those cases, the protesters wrongly targeted outlets only to later issue an apology and in some cases even help in the cleanup. Allow Facebook content?

In order to avoid such mix-ups and to coordinate action, the activists have even come up with a colour-coding system. The colours black, red and blue are used online to differentiate between thrashing a place, spay-painting it or simply boycotting it. In the case of shops thought to support the protests, they're marked yellow with a call to actively support them. Stations along Hong Kong's MTR metro system have repeatedly been attacked, vandalised or even set on fire during the unrest. The MTR is privatised, with the Hong Kong government as the largest shareholder. Protesters frequently set fire to MTR stations In mid-August, the operator was criticised by Chinese state media for helping ""rioters"" move around and protest across the city. After that, the MTR began shutting certain stations before people could gather for demonstrations. At one point the entire network was shut down. Activists also accuse the operator of allegedly helping the police to arrest protesters, and of failing to release CCTV footage of alleged police brutality.

Brexit talks restart after 'promising' meeting,"This video can not be played Barnier: We had a constructive meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has likened Brexit to ""climbing a mountain"", after holding talks with Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay. Mr Barnier urged ""patience"", as the EU and UK look to reach a deal ahead of a crucial summit next week. Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk said Irish PM Leo Varadkar had given ""promising signals"" that an agreement is still possible. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October. The summit on 17 and 18 October is seen as the last chance for the UK and the EU to agree a deal ahead of the Brexit deadline. Something has changed - but there are miles to go Will 'Super Saturday' be a decisive Brexit moment? 'No community will have Brexit plans veto' - Smith Corbyn: No Brexit referendum before election Following his ""technical"" discussion with Mr Barclay in Brussels, Mr Barnier told reporters: ""Be patient."" He added: ""Brexit is like climbing a mountain. We need vigilance, determination and patience."" Steve Barclay held talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said he suspected the best outcome for the UK that could emerge from the Barclay-Barnier meeting would be the EU agreeing to restart fuller and ""more intense"" negotiations. Earlier this week, several senior EU figures played down the chances of Brexit happening with a deal agreed to by both sides. But on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Varadkar held a one-to-one discussion - described by both as ""very positive and very promising"" - at Thornton Manor, Merseyside. Mr Varadkar said talks were at a ""very sensitive stage"" but he was now ""convinced"" the UK wanted a deal, adding: ""I do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks."" Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar discussed Brexit on Thursday But he refused to be drawn on what ""concessions"" had been made by either side during his meeting with Mr Johnson, while Downing Street has not commented on Irish press reports suggesting ""significant movement"" on the UK prime minister's part. Speaking on a visit to Cyprus on Friday, Mr Tusk said the UK had not ""come forward with a workable, realistic proposal"", but added he had received ""promising signals"" from Mr Varadkar that a deal was still possible. ""Of course there is no guarantee of success and time is practically up, but even the slightest chance must be used,"" he added. ""A no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU."" With three weeks to go until the Brexit deadline, the prime minister continues to insist the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month. That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October. Should any new deal be reached between the EU and UK, it will still have to be approved by MPs in Parliament. The issue of Northern Ireland's consent - and how it is achieved - for post-Brexit arrangements has emerged as a key factor in EU-UK negotiations. But Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said there was ""a range of options"" for finding consent for the proposals. He also denied any ""one community"" would have a veto over Brexit plans, following concern from some NI parties that the PM's proposals could give the Democratic Unionist Party exactly that. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?

The quote is from the will of Swedish businessman - and inventor of dynamite - Alfred Nobel. He left most of his fortune in a fund to launch the awards, which were first presented in 1901. In 1968, an economic sciences prize was added by Sweden's central bank, although it does not count as a Nobel prize. Different organisations award the prize in each category every year. Five of the six are chosen in Sweden, while the Nobel Peace Prize is selected in Norway. Academics, university professors, scientists, previous winners and others all submit nominations. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, the shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years. Prize winners are called laureates, to signify the laurel wreath given to victors of contests in ancient Greece. More than one, but no more than three, people can win each prize. This video can not be played How do you choose a Nobel Prize winner? There have been some years when the prize has not been awarded - mostly during the two world wars. And Nobel Foundation rules state if nobody deserves the prize in a particular category, it is not awarded and its prize money is kept for the following year. The recipient of each prize receives three things: a Nobel diploma, each of which is a unique work of art a Nobel medal, which have some differing designs a cash prize of 10m Swedish krona (Â£836,000; $1.1m) - which is split between winners when there is more than one. They have to deliver a lecture to receive the money The prizes are presented at ceremonies on 10 December, the anniversary of Nobel's death, in Stockholm and Oslo. Marie and Pierre Curie used their physics prize money in 1903 for further scientific research, and 2006 physics winner John Mather donated his cash to his foundation. In 1993, British biochemist Richard Roberts spent his medicine winnings on a croquet lawn, while fellow 1993 laureate Phillip Sharp bought a 100-year-old Federal-style house. The 2001 medicine winner, Sir Paul Nurse, bought himself a high-end motorbike. Meanwhile, 2006 literature laureate Orhan Pamuk established a museum in Istanbul.

"Why Starbucks? The brands attacked in Hong KongFor Hong Kong businesses, voicing support for China or the police can make them a target.China","A worker cleans graffiti at a Starbucks coffee shop in Hong Kong on 30 September Broken glass, raging fires, and smashed up barricades: the pictures from Hong Kong in the past few days look like random chaos. But in the middle of the violence, most activists are being deliberate about the places they attack. So why are protesters targeting Starbucks? And the metro? And certain shops, restaurants and banks? Hong Kong is complex, but can largely be divided into those who support the protesters and their anti-Beijing stance, and those supportive of the mainland. So when peaceful protests turned into violence against property, big mainland firms like Bank of China and tech company Xiaomi became targets for vandalism and spray-painting. But other less obvious places are also in the firing line. This video can not be played The weekend saw riots over the mask ban, a second person shot, and tear gas fired at protesters While Starbucks may be a US brand, the Hong Kong franchise is operated by a local company, Maxim's Caterers. Annie Wu, the daughter of the Maxim Group's founder, recently defended Hong Kong's police and criticised activists as ""radical protesters"". She made her comments with billionaire businesswoman Pansy Ho, representing the Hong Kong Federation of Women, at the United Nations Human Rights Council on 11 September. The two criticised ""a small group of radical protesters"" using ""systematic and calculated violent acts"". So protesters started directing their anger against Maxim's and the franchises it operates. The restaurant group is one of Hong Kong's largest, and includes other brands such as Genki Sushi and Arome bakery, which have also been targeted. Maxim's Caterers issued a statement saying Ms Wu ""does not hold any position at the company"" and was not involved in managerial decisions - but so far this has failed to satisfy protesters. Hong Kong is a Special Administrative Region of China, so it has some autonomy andpeople have more rights Protests started in June against a controversial law which would have allowed Hong Kong criminal suspects to be sent to China to stand trial The law has been withdrawn butprotests have widenedto demand full democracy Clashes between police and activistshave been becoming increasingly violent In October,the city banned all face masksto try to shut down the protests Japanese fast food chain Yoshinoya has also come into the crosshairs. After there was confusion about a Facebook post - which some read as coded criticism of police - the operator of the Hong Kong franchise said he supported the police and government. Before long, Yoshinoya restaurants had their windows smashed and graffiti all over their walls. Another targeted brand is Best Mart 360, a chain of small grocery stores. It's an example of the divisions running within the Hong Kong population. The boss of Best Mart 360 is Hugo Lam Chi-fung, permanent honorary president of the Hong Kong Federation of Fujian Associations which has held several demonstrations in support of China. Fujian is a Chinese province, and many local people have emigrated to Hong Kong over the years. Hong Kong's Fujianese community has been vocal in supporting the city's police force. Those demonstrations have led to clashes with activists - who have accused their opponents of being part of the Fujian triad gangs, a form of organised crime. Best Mart 360 has released several statements, insisting it is not linked to any Fujian triad. This video can not be played Hong Kong protests: 'I can't say I love China any more' The triad allegation has also been levelled against a mahjong house in a part of town home to the Fujianese community. Mahjong is a Chinese tile game, played socially. The Yi Pei Square house was accused of hiding pro-Beijing thugs who attacked local residents. The parlour has released a statement saying they are not Fujianese and in fact support the protesters' demands. There have also been cases where places have become the target of activists' anger based on mistaken assumptions of China ties. The Shanghai Commercial Bank is not mainland-owned but - despite its name - based in Hong Kong. The Yifang bubble tea chain was also wrongly associated with the mainland when in fact it's from Taiwan. In both those cases, the protesters wrongly targeted outlets only to later issue an apology and in some cases even help in the cleanup. Allow Facebook content?

In order to avoid such mix-ups and to coordinate action, the activists have even come up with a colour-coding system. The colours black, red and blue are used online to differentiate between thrashing a place, spay-painting it or simply boycotting it. In the case of shops thought to support the protests, they're marked yellow with a call to actively support them. Stations along Hong Kong's MTR metro system have repeatedly been attacked, vandalised or even set on fire during the unrest. The MTR is privatised, with the Hong Kong government as the largest shareholder. Protesters frequently set fire to MTR stations In mid-August, the operator was criticised by Chinese state media for helping ""rioters"" move around and protest across the city. After that, the MTR began shutting certain stations before people could gather for demonstrations. At one point the entire network was shut down. Activists also accuse the operator of allegedly helping the police to arrest protesters, and of failing to release CCTV footage of alleged police brutality.

Breaking|Breaking newsEthiopia's Abiy Ahmed wins Nobel Peace PrizeEthiopia's prime minister - who made peace with bitter foe Eritrea - wins the Nobel Peace Prize.Africa,"Abiy Ahmed became Ethiopia's prime minister in April 2018 The 2019 Nobel Peace Prize has been awarded to Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed who made peace last year with bitter foe Eritrea. He was awarded the prize for his efforts to ""achieve peace and international cooperation"". Mr Abiy's peace deal with Eritrea ended a 20-year military stalemate following their 1998-2000 border war. He was named as the winner of the 100th Nobel Peace Prize in Oslo, where he will receive the award in December. It is worth some nine million Swedish crowns (about Â£730,000; $900,000). Africa Live: Reaction to Abiy Ahmedâs victory Why is the Nobel Peace Prize so important? On the road with Abiy Ahmed Following the announcement, Mr Abiy said he was ""humbled and thrilled"". ""Thank you very much. It is a prize given to Africa, given to Ethiopia and I can imagine how the rest of Africa's leaders will take it positively to work on [the] peace-building process on our continent,"" he added in a phone call with the secretary of the Norwegian Nobel Committee.

A total of 301 candidates had been nominated for the prestigious award, including 223 individuals and 78 organisations. There had been great speculation over who would win the prize, with climate activist Greta Thunberg widely tipped as the favourite. Under the Nobel Foundation's rules, nomination shortlists are not allowed to be published for 50 years, and the organisation says any speculation ahead of the announcement is ""sheer guesswork"". This video can not be played The announcement was made by Chair of the Norwegian Nobel Committee, Berit Reiss-Andersen After becoming prime minister in April 2018, Mr Abiy introduced massive liberalising reforms to Ethiopia, shaking up what was a tightly controlled nation. He freed thousands of opposition activists from jail and allowed exiled dissidents to return home. Under him, several women have also been appointed to prominent positions. Most importantly, he signed the peace deal with Eritrea. Abiy Ahmed: The man changing Ethiopia The women smashing Ethiopia's glass ceiling Bold reforms expose Ethiopia's ethnic divides But his reforms also lifted the lid on Ethiopia's ethnic tensions, and the resulting violence forced some 2.5 million people from their homes. Mr Abiy, 43, was honoured for his ""decisive initiative to resolve the border conflict with neighbouring Eritrea"", the Norwegian Nobel Committee said. ""The prize is also meant to recognise all the stakeholders working for peace and reconciliation in Ethiopia and in the East and Northeast African regions,"" they said. Eritrea's President Isaias Afwerki (right) receives a key from Abiy Ahmed as the Eritrean Embassy in Addis Ababa is re-opened in 2018 ""Peace does not arise from the actions of one party alone. When Prime Minister Abiy reached out his hand, President Afwerki grasped it, and helped to formalise the peace process between the two countries. The Norwegian Nobel Committee hopes the peace agreement will help to bring about positive change for the entire populations of Ethiopia and Eritrea."" Since the Eritrea deal, Mr Abiy - the youngest head of government in Africa - has also been involved in peace processes in other African countries, the committee said. This has included helping to broker an agreement between Sudan's military leaders and civilian opposition after months of protests. Mr Abiy's office said the award was testimony ""to the ideals of unity, cooperation and mutual coexistence that the prime minister has been consistently championing"". Analysis by Emmanuel Igunza, BBC Africa Since coming into office just over a year ago, Abiy Ahmed has made history and turned Ethiopian politics on its head. Few had given him any chance of ascending to the prime minister's office and even less had anticipated the sweeping reforms he would bring to a country that for years had been led by the iron fist of the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Democratic Front. His most significant achievement was ending a bitter border dispute with Eritrea. He even went to the Eritrean capital, Asmara, receiving a rock star's welcome - a sign of his popularity with the population weary of the two decades of hostilities between the two countries. But also significant is the role he has played in bringing peace to the Horn of Africa region, from Sudan to Somalia and Djibouti, all which at some time have had border disputes. Throughout he's preached a message ofMedemer- meaning togetherness or inclusiveness. His Nobel win is yet another feather in the cap of this former intelligence chief. African leaders were among those to congratulate Mr Abiy following his win. Somalia's President Mohamed Farmaajo described Mr Abiy as a ""deserving winner"" as he congratulated him on Twitter. ""I have enjoyed working with him on strengthening regional co-operation,"" he wrote. Liberia's President George Weah expressed his ""warmest felicitations for this noble feat"", while Ghana's President Nana Akufo-Addo said the award was ""a reminder to us all that peace is one of the most critical ingredients needed to make Africa successful"".

The head of the Norwegian Refugee Council, Jan Egeland, congratulated Mr Abiy but said he must now ""make resolving ethnic tensions within Ethiopia a priority"". Human rights group Amnesty International welcomed Mr Abiy's reforms and efforts towards peace, but said his work was ""far from done"". ""He must urgently ensure that his government addresses the ongoing ethnic tensions that threaten instability and further human rights abuses,"" it added. Bisrat Hadte, a 45-year-old businessman in Ethiopia's capital Addis Ababa, told Reuters news agency that Mr Abiy also needed to ""improve the economy and drive down the cost of living"". Mr Abiy was born in Ethiopia in 1976 to a Muslim father and Christian mother. He has several degrees, including a doctorate degree in peace and security issues and a master's degree in transformational leadership. As a teenager, he joined the armed struggle against the former Derg regime - a Communist military junta that ruled Ethiopia from 1974 to 1987. He later served as a UN peacekeeper in Rwanda. Abiy Ahmed is the youngest head of government in Africa During the 1998-2000 border dispute with Eritrea, he led a spy team on a reconnaissance mission into areas held by the Eritrean Defence Forces. He joined politics in 2010, becoming a member of the Oromo People's Democratic Organization, before being elected as a member of parliament. His time as an MP coincided with clashes between Muslims and Christians. He devised a lasting solution to the problem by setting up a ""Religious Forum for Peace"". Former US President Barack Obama won the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009, for ""his extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and co-operation between peoples"".

US Republicans seek sanctions on Turkey over Syria,"Turkey's move into northern Syria has sparked outrage in the US Republicans in the US House of Representatives have announced plans to introduce a sanctions bill against Turkey for its offensive in Syria. Congresswoman Liz Cheney said Turkey must face ""serious consequences for mercilessly attacking our Kurdish allies"" in the region. It comes as President Donald Trump said he hoped to mediate in the conflict. Turkey moved into northern Syria on Wednesday after the president pulled US troops out of the area. Tens of thousands of civilians fled their homes on the second day of the offensive. Turkey Syria offensive: Your questions answered What did the Kurds ever do for the US? Turkey v Syria's Kurds explained This video can not be played The BBC's Martin Patience explains what's behind the conflict Critics say the US withdrawal effectively gave Turkey the green light to begin its cross-border assault, which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says is to create a ""safe zone"" running for 480km along the Syrian side of the border. Kurdish militias of the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) control the cross-border areas - groups Turkey calls ""terrorists"" who support an anti-Turkish insurgency. The SDF have been key allies of the United States in the battle against the Islamic State (IS) group, and say they have been ""stabbed in the back"" by the US. There are fears the operation could lead to an ethnic cleansing of Kurds and revive IS. A group of 29 Republicans in the Democratic-controlled House of Representatives have announced legislation which would impose sanctions on Ankara. ""If Turkey wants to be treated like an ally, it must begin behaving like one,"" Ms Cheney wrote in a statement,external. ""They must be sanctioned for their attacks on our Kurdish allies."" Ms Cheney adds that ""Congress has long had concerns about the [Erdogan] regime's cooperation with US adversaries, such as Russia"". No mention is made of the US troop withdrawal.

""President Trump made clear that if Turkey crosses a line in Syria, he would 'totally obliterate the economy of Turkey' - and this legislation gives the United States the tools to make good on that promise,"" Representative Jodey Arrington wrote. It comes the day afterRepublican Senator Lindsey Graham unveiled a sanctions bill,external, along with Democratic Senator Chris Van Hollen, for ""severe sanctions"" against Turkey. Mr Graham is a staunch ally of President Trump, but has vocally criticised his administration for the troop withdrawal in Syria - saying the US had ""shamefully abandoned"" the Kurds. The president defended his decision to withdraw troops - even saying at one point the Kurds ""didn't help us in the Second World War"". This video can not be played Trump: Kurds ""didn't help us in Second World War"" But he has since taken a harder line on Turkey's offensive after criticism at home and abroad. Mr Trump has suggested sanctions could come if Turkey's operation is not ""humane"" - a red line one official told reporters meant ""ethnic cleansing... indiscriminate artillery, air and other fires directed at civilian populations"". ""We have not seen significant examples of that so far, but we're very early,"" the official said on condition of anonymity, adding that the president had tasked diplomats with seeing ""if there are areas of commonality between the two sides, if there's a way that we can find our way to a ceasefire"". Could Turkish offensive unleash Islamic State threat? Turkey's Syria offensive explained in four maps President Trump tweeted on Thursday that there were three choices for the US,external: ""Send in thousands of troops and win militarily, hit Turkey very hard financially and with sanctions, or mediate a deal between Turkey and the Kurds"". The president later told reporters: ""I hope it's going to be the last one."" He made the remarks before he flew to Minnesota for a campaign rally. While reiterating his hope to mediate the conflict between the Kurds and Turkey, the president told the crowds it was time to ""bring our soldiers back home"" and criticised US involvement in the Middle East. ""These wars produce only chaos and bloodshed,"" he said. ""We're slowly getting out of the Middle East. We're doing it carefully."" By Lauren Turner, BBC News, Minneapolis ""Why do we need to be the policemen of the world?"" For many of Donald Trump's supporters attending his rally in central Minneapolis, their opinion on Turkey's assault on Syria - coming after US troops were pulled out of the city - was the same. ""I think it's great we've stopped involving our troops in their problems in Turkey and Syria,"" said 24-year-old Alex Ledezma. ""We're not their babysitters.""

Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter returns to UKFive year-old Gabriella has been in Iran since her mother was detained in 2016.UK,"This video can not be played Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe's daughter, Gabriella, cuts her own ""welcome home"" cake with help from her dad, Richard The five-year-old daughter of a British-Iranian woman jailed in Iran on spying charges has returned to the UK. Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 40, a charity worker from London, has been detained for three years over the allegations, which she denies. Her British-born daughter Gabriella, who has been living with her grandparents in Tehran, returned on Thursday to start school in the UK. Gabriella's father, Richard Ratcliffe, said she has been ""so brave"". What is the Zaghari-Ratcliffe case about? Uncertain fate of Iran's jailed dual nationals Appearing with Gabriella at a news conference at the Houses of Parliament, Mr Ratcliffe said she struggled speaking English but had been keen to tell him that she wanted to visit a toy shop. He said she ""told mum that she'll see her back in London"". ""She's promised mummy she's going to be brave. It's just lovely to hold her again."" Richard Ratcliffe embraces his daughter, Gabriella, after she landed back in the UK Gabriella brought a cake into a news conference at the Houses of Parliament on Friday afternoon Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe was arrested in April 2016 during a visit to introduce Gabriella to relatives, her family said. She is now being held in Tehran's Evin prison, where Gabriella visited her at least once a week. But in April the family said new prison rules meant Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffecould only see her daughter once a monthand that she was banned from making international calls. Earlier this month Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe wrote an open letter to mothers of Iran, in which she said: ""In the near future, my baby will leave me to go to her father and start school in the UK.  It will be a daunting trip for her travelling, and for me left behind."" Last week, Mr Ratcliffe from West Hampstead, toldthe Times,externalthat they had agreed Gabriella should return to the UK for the start of the school year in September, but postponed the decision after Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was taken to a psychiatric hospital. ""I spoke to Nazanin yesterday and she was reasonably distraught,"" he told reporters at Westminster on Friday. ""One of the things she really didn't want to happen was her daughter to leave while she was still in prison."" Mr Ratcliffe said there is a ""real risk"" his wife's mental and physical condition will deteriorate. Richard and Nazanin agreed that Gabriella should return to the UK to begin school, the family said In response to Gabriella's return, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab reiterated his earlier calls for Iran to release Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe and said the family's situation was one that no parent ""should ever have to face"". ""Gabriella is an innocent child and should be able to go to school and be with both her parents,"" he said. ""We continue to urge Iran to release Nazanin immediately so the family can be reunited in the UK."" His predecessor, Jeremy Hunt, described the news of Gabriella's homecoming as ""the definition of bittersweet"". He called on the British government to ""redouble"" its efforts to secure Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's release, tweeting: ""Now more than ever, she needs to know she's not alone."" Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was temporarily reunited with her daughter Gabriella during a three-day release from prison in August last year Mr Ratcliffe told reporters that his wife had shared a prison cell with British-Australian woman Jolie King, who had been detained with her boyfriend in Tehran earlier this year for reportedly flying a drone without a permit. Ms King and her boyfriend, Mark Firkin,were released last week. Iran has detained a number of dual citizens and foreign nationals in recent years, many of them on spying charges. The exact numbers are not known. The arrests and arow over the seizure of oil tankers in the Gulf.have led to increasingly tense diplomatic relations between the UK and Iran. Iran also claims it is owed Â£400m by the UK in relation to contracts signed more than 40 years ago between the International Military Services (IMS) - a company that has ceased trading but was used by the Ministry of Defence to sell defence equipment - and the pre-Islamic Revolution Iranian regime. The contracts involved the supply of tanks to Iran, which were paid for but undelivered in the wake of the country's 1979 revolution. Litigation regarding the dispute is under way. The UK government said it does not ""share the view"" that the IMS debt, or any other bilateral issue, is the reason for Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe's detention, and that the two issues are ""entirely separate"". ""Iran must live up to its responsibilities under international human rights law and under the Vienna convention on consular relations, and release Nazanin, and the other dual national cases, without delay,"" a government statement issued by the Foreign Office said. The family's MP, Tulip Siddiq, said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe wants to know why the UK government is not doing more to secure her release.

""Every single one of those politicians have looked me in the eye and said that this has nothing to do with the debt that we owe Iran. But we know that's not true."" Last month, Prime Minister Boris Johnsoncalled for the release of Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffeduring a meeting with Iran's president. In 2017, when he was foreign secretary, Mr Johnson had to apologise after saying Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe was in Iran ""teaching people journalism"" - despite her family's insistence she was there on holiday.

Iranian tanker 'on fire off Saudi coast',"Pictures aboard the Sabiti - allegedly taken on Friday - were published by Iranian state TV An Iranian-owned oil tanker has been attacked in the Red Sea off the coast of Saudi Arabia, Iran's foreign ministry says. The ministry said the tanker Sabiti had been hit twice, causing some damage. Earlier Iran's national oil company (NIOC) said two explosions on the vessel had been caused ""likely by missiles"". But it dismissed earlier reports quoting it as saying the missiles were likely to have come from Saudi Arabia. In recent months ""other sabotage acts"" had been carried out against Iranian tankers in the Red Sea and these were being investigated, foreign ministry spokesman Abbas Mousavi said. The incident took place at 04:50 (01:50 GMT) about 95km (60 miles) from the Saudi city of Jeddah, Iran's Mehr news agency said. Two of the vessel's tanks were struck, it added, causing damage measuring between 0.5m and 1.5m. There were no reports of injuries. The Sabiti is now sailing towards the Gulf, Mehr said. The reports have so far only come from Iranian sources. There has been no comment from Saudi officials. Iranian state TV earlier identified the vessel as the Sinopa, but the NIOC later said it was the Sabiti. Pictures allegedly taken on Friday aboard the Sabiti have been published by Iranian state TV, showing no visible signs of damage. Paul Adams, BBC Diplomatic Correspondent This story is as clear as mud. It seemed to change. Two different ships have been named - the Sinopa and the Sabiti. We had reports of missiles striking the tanker and then an accusation briefly levelled against Saudi Arabia for committing what was described as an ""act of terrorism"". That claim seems to have been dropped quite quickly. And crucially there is no independent evidence at all that the vessel was struck. Pictures were released later in the morning showing nothing untoward. And most crucially both tankers are currently steaming at full speed in their different directions so there is no evidence that either vessel has been impaired in any way. Publicly available ship tracking records show both ships are currently in the Red Sea. The Sinopa turned its transmitter on earlier this week for the first time in more than 50 days. The Sabiti, meanwhile, turned its tracker on early Friday after nearly 60 days of no transmissions. Under international regulations, all vessels above a certain tonnage must be fitted with the trackers, known as automatic identification systems (AIS). But ships are not required to have their AIS turned on all the time. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

A source at maritime analytics firm Windward told the BBC it was common for Iranian tankers to turn off AIS to avoid detection - often to evade international sanctions or harassment from Saudi Arabia. Because of safety regulations, vessels must have their AIS switched on when they are close to the Suez Canal. The Windward source said Sabiti was behaving unusually because, when going through the canal, it only switches on its AIS when rules require - but in this instance, the AIS had been turned on hundreds of miles from the Suez after being ""dark"" for two months. Michelle Bockmann, an analyst at shipping newspaper Lloyds List, told the BBC that the tanker - whichever one it was - was ""probably"" carrying oil to Syria. This video can not be played How sanctions affect Iran... in five objects ""That really is, along with China, the only market there is for Iranian crude now since the US tightened sanctions in May,"" said Ms Bockmann. ""We're seeing geopolitics playing out within the global shipping and tanker markets, and this is just an extension of the instability that we're seeing in the region."" The latest incident came amid heightened tension between Iran and Saudi Arabia in recent months. Last month, 18 drones and seven cruise missiles hit a major oil field and processing facility in Saudi Arabia, which blamed Iran for the attack. And US officials said Iran was responsible for attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf in June and July, as well as attacks on another four tankers in May. Iran denied involvement in all the incidents.

"Aerospace industry seeks Brexit reassuranceAerospace firms say it is ""vital"" the UK and EU have regulatory alignment.Business","There is growing concern among key aerospace manufacturers about regulatory alignment and the ability to bring products to market after Brexit. The firms have sought reassurance that the UK would continue to be a member of the European Aviation Safety Agency after any Brexit deal. They also warned that alignment with chemicals regulations is ""vital"" for the sector. The government said it would pursue agreements where necessary. The government is facing a backlash from key manufacturers amid growing industrial concern that Boris Johnson's Brexit negotiators have dropped existing commitments to participate in specific EU regulatory institutions after any Brexit deal. BBC News has obtained a letter from the aerospace industry body, the ADS, to the government asking for ""reassurance"" that ""continued membership of the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and alignment with EU chemicals regulations"" which ""are vital for our sector"". It said that ""we received assurances from the previous [May] government that the UK would seek to continue membership of or retain participation and influence in EU agencies such as EASA"". The letter, dated this week, and sent to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove and Brexit secretary Stephen Barclay, expresses ""concern"" that the PM has signalled a different approach. Repeated attempts to get clarity on this issue have not reassured the aerospace and other industries on this topic. Brexit talks to resume after 'promising' meeting Nissan Europe 'unsustainable' in no-deal Brexit It says that ""regulatory divergence would pose a serious risk to our sectors"" will result in ""huge new costs and disruptions to many of our member companies"", and an ""inability to shape safety rule making"" which ""will make it much more difficult to bring UK technology to market"". In the existing political declaration on the future relationship between the UK and the EU, negotiated under Theresa May, there were specific references to ongoing close cooperation between a post-Brexit UK and three named regulatory agencies - the European Aviation Safety Agency, the European Chemical Agency as well as the European Medicines Agency. The political declaration said ""in this context the UK will consider aligning with [European] Union rules in relevant areas"". After the completion of negotiations, Mrs May confirmed to parliament that the political declaration meant for her negotiating a form of UK membership of these agencies which set technical specifications and safety standards across the whole European single market. The concerns are shared in other industries, which have asked for similar reassurances, only to be told in recent weeks that the government is seeking a ""best in class"" free trade agreement, where the UK would set its own regulatory standards. The government has acknowledged that it wants to take the ""level playing field"" arrangements out of the political declaration that promised alignment on environmental, social, labour and some tax measures. These were also seen as crucial to ongoing industrial regulatory cooperation, and preventing the introduction of many types of checks on trade. But the government fears such measures agreed by Theresa May will restrict the ability of a post-Brexit government to strike meaningful trade deals with other countries such as the US. A source close to the negotiations acknowledged to the BBC that among changes being negotiated to the political declaration references to EU agencies could get scrapped. Even as most of the negotiating attention remains on Northern Ireland, the change in approach from the Johnson government suggests a significantly different, more diverged end point for Brexit for England, Scotland and Wales, than envisaged under Theresa May. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK is getting ready for Brexit on 31 October. We want a deal, but we must be prepared for every eventuality and we have recently announced substantial extra funding to support businesses to get ready. ""The government is seeking a best in class FTA [free trade agreement] drawing on the precedent of existing EU FTA deals. ""We have been clear that we are committed to maintaining high standards after we leave the EU. ""Where necessary, the government will pursue additional agreements to cover areas outside traditional FTAs - for example, on aviation and civil nuclear cooperation.""

Few convinced by Apple's case for Hong Kong app removal,"Apple said it had credible information that the hkmap.live app was putting people in danger As if piling up sandbags before a flood, Apple was well prepared to face a backlash over its decision to remove an app used by Hong Kong protesters. But the firmâs carefully-worded statement offering its reasoning has left China watchers, politicians - and some famed Apple supporters - wholly unconvinced. âAppleâs decision to cave to Communist Chinaâs demands is unacceptable,â tweeted Rick Scott, a Republican senator for Florida. âPutting profits above the human rights and dignity of the people of Hong Kong is wrong. No ifs, ands or buts about it.â Late on Wednesday, the firm started briefing journalists on the move, pushing its view that the HKmap.live was being âused in ways that endanger law enforcement and residentsâ. On Thursday morning, Apple chief executive Tim Cook posted an internal memo. âItâs out of my great respect for the work you do every day that I want to share the way we went about making this decision,â he wrote. âOver the past several days we received credible information, from the Hong Kong Cybersecurity and Technology Crime Bureau, as well as from users in Hong Kong, that the app was being used maliciously to target individual officers for violence and to victimize individuals and property where no police are present. This use put the app in violation of Hong Kong law. âSimilarly, widespread abuse clearly violates our App Store guidelines barring personal harm.â Long-time Apple commentator John Gruber wrote of Mr Cookâs email,external: âI canât recall an Apple memo or statement that crumbles so quickly under scrutiny.â Apple has yet to provide any additional information about those claimed incidents. Charles Mok, a Hong Kong legislator who represents the IT industry in the territory, posted a letter to Mr Cook on Twitter. The HKmap.live app crowdsources information about law enforcement movements âThere are numerous cases of innocent passers-by in the neighbourhood injured by the Kong Kong Police Forceâs excessive force in crowd dispersal operations,â he wrote. âThe user-generated information shared using HKmap.live in fact helps citizens avoid areas where pedestrians not involved in any criminal activities might be subjected to police brutality which many human rights organisations such as Amnesty International have observed.â Mr Mok went on to argue that users on major social networks, such as Facebook or Twitter, also share information about police activity - but were not being held to the same standard. âWe Hongkongers will definitely look closely at whether Apple chooses to uphold its commitment to free expression and other basic human rights, or become an accomplice for Chinese censorship and oppression.â Apple has not responded to the letter. Appleâs decision comes against a backdrop of major American firms being seen as bowing to political pressure from Beijing. In just the past week,the NBA grovelled its way around a tweet from a team executive supporting the protests, while video games published Activision Blizzard banned e-sports competitor Ng Wai ""Blitzchung"" Chung for showing his support for the movement. And Google removed a role-playing game called âRevolution of Our Timesâ from its app store after deeming it violated its policies on depicting âsensitive eventsâ (the player plays the role of a Hong Kong protester). According to the Wall Street Journal, Hong Kong authorities had contacted Google with concerns about that app - though the company has said it decided to take action before any communication took place. One bucking of the trend, however, came via Tim Sweeney, chief executive of Epic Games, the firm behind online multiplayer game Fortnite. âEpic supports everyoneâs right to speak freely,âhe wrote on Twitter,external, in response to a question about gamers voicing support for Hong Kong protesters. Chinese tech giant Tencent owns 40% of the firm. âChina players of Fortnite are free to criticize the US or criticize Epic just as equally as all others,â Mr Sweeney said. In characteristically astute timing,an episode of Comedy Centralâs South Parkearlier this month led Chinese censors to âdelete virtually every clip, episode and online discussion of the show from Chinese streaming services, social media and even fan pagesâ, according to the Hollywood Reporter. The episode featured four of the showâs main characters working on a film script that gets constantly altered so that it could be distributed in China. âWell you know what they say,â the filmâs director in the show says, âYou gotta lower your ideals of freedom if you wanna suck on the warm teat of China.â In Appleâs case that means revenues that are on course to exceed $40bn this year - almost a fifth of the firmâs total global sales. Appleâs reliance on Chinese manufacturing means the relationship goes far deeper than just local sales. The firm has 10,000 direct employees in the firm; the economy around Appleâs presence in China is responsible for around 5m jobs. What happens next depends on the extent to which China feels its hardline stance is working - and there are indications officials are becoming wary.According to reporting in the New York Times,external, Beijing is concerned its actions are drawing more attention to the protests and harming the countryâs standing on the global stage, adding yet more tension to relations with the US as trade talks restart in Washington. The rows have also bolstered concerns that China has few qualms when it comes to making demands of companies both based in the Communist state, as well as those who merely want to do business there. âWhat would Huawei do if they were the dominant 5G provider for a country, and that countryâs leaders said the wrong thing?âspeculated Elliott Zaagman,external, who covers Chinese business and investment, _____ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

'No community will have Brexit plans veto' - Smith,"NI Secretary Julian Smith made his comments on BBC's The View The NI secretary has said there will not be a situation where ""one community has a veto"" over Brexit plans. Julian Smith was responding to concern from some NI parties thatthe prime minister's Brexit proposals could give the DUP a vetoon post-Brexit arrangements. Speaking on BBC's The View, Mr Smith did not deny that a NI-only referendum was on the table. He said there were ""a range of options"" for finding consent for the plans. ""The key thing is we have to have regard to the Good Friday Agreement and have regard to the need to have a cross-community approach to how we resolve this,"" he added. Gauging NI's response to the PM's Brexit offer UK Brexit plans to include Irish customs checks What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan? 'It will be no-deal if Brexit plan is final offer' Mr Smith said that a number of options would be looked at to resolve the issue but did not go into details. The issue of Northern Ireland's consent - and how it is achieved - for post-Brexit arrangements hasemerged as a key factor in negotiations. In Mr Johnson's latest proposals, the Northern Ireland Assembly would have to sign off on the plan to have Northern Ireland stay in the European single market for goods but leave the customs union. It would then vote to maintain the arrangements every four years. Stormont's power-sharing government is currently not sitting - it collapsed two-and-a-half years ago amid a bitter row about a green energy scheme. The assembly previously operated under a system of ""parallel consent"", in which proposals must be backed by a majority of both unionists and nationalists. As such, nationalist parties and the cross-community Alliance Party have criticised the prime minister's proposals as giving the main unionist party, the DUP, a veto. On Thursday, Mr Johnson and Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) Leo Varadkar said they could see ""a pathway to a deal"" after meeting one-to-one, but Mr Varadkar maintained there were still issues over ""consent and democracy"". The secretary of state added that the ""positivity"" emerging from talks between Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar gives him ""great heart"". He said both governments seem to be on the track of coming to an accommodation. On Thursday, the prime minister and taoiseach (Irish PM) spoke for more than two hours, including a one-to-one discussionduring a walk in the grounds of Thornton Manor in north-west England. Mr Smith told the programme he had spoken to Mr Johnson on Thursday afternoon as well as a number of Stormont parties, but would not say whether that included the DUP. Allow Twitter content?

Brexit talks to resume after 'promising' meeting,"This video can not be played Barnier: We had a constructive meeting EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier has likened Brexit to ""climbing a mountain"", after holding talks with Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay. Mr Barnier urged ""patience"", as the EU and UK look to reach a deal ahead of a crucial summit next week. Meanwhile, European Council President Donald Tusk said Irish PM Leo Varadkar had given ""promising signals"" that an agreement is still possible. The UK is due to leave the EU at 23:00 GMT on 31 October. The summit on 17 and 18 October is seen as the last chance for the UK and the EU to agree a deal ahead of the Brexit deadline. Something has changed - but there are miles to go Will 'Super Saturday' be a decisive Brexit moment? 'No community will have Brexit plans veto' - Smith Corbyn: No Brexit referendum before election Following his ""technical"" discussion with Mr Barclay in Brussels, Mr Barnier told reporters: ""Be patient."" He added: ""Brexit is like climbing a mountain. We need vigilance, determination and patience."" Steve Barclay held talks with Michel Barnier in Brussels BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said he suspected the best outcome for the UK that could emerge from the Barclay-Barnier meeting would be the EU agreeing to restart fuller and ""more intense"" negotiations. Earlier this week, several senior EU figures played down the chances of Brexit happening with a deal agreed to by both sides. But on Thursday, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson and Mr Varadkar held a one-to-one discussion - described by both as ""very positive and very promising"" - at Thornton Manor, Merseyside. Mr Varadkar said talks were at a ""very sensitive stage"" but he was now ""convinced"" the UK wanted a deal, adding: ""I do see a pathway towards an agreement in the coming weeks."" Boris Johnson and Leo Varadkar discussed Brexit on Thursday But he refused to be drawn on what ""concessions"" had been made by either side during his meeting with Mr Johnson, while Downing Street has not commented on Irish press reports suggesting ""significant movement"" on the UK prime minister's part. Speaking on a visit to Cyprus on Friday, Mr Tusk said the UK had not ""come forward with a workable, realistic proposal"", but added he had received ""promising signals"" from Mr Varadkar that a deal was still possible. ""Of course there is no guarantee of success and time is practically up, but even the slightest chance must be used,"" he added. ""A no-deal Brexit will never be the choice of the EU."" With three weeks to go until the Brexit deadline, the prime minister continues to insist the UK will leave the EU with or without a deal at the end of the month. That is despite the so-called Benn Act - passed by MPs last month - demanding he request a delay to the Article 50 deadline from the EU until January 2020 if a deal has not been agreed before 19 October. Should any new deal be reached between the EU and UK, it will still have to be approved by MPs in Parliament. The issue of Northern Ireland's consent - and how it is achieved - for post-Brexit arrangements has emerged as a key factor in EU-UK negotiations. But Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith said there was ""a range of options"" for finding consent for the proposals. He also denied any ""one community"" would have a veto over Brexit plans, following concern from some NI parties that the PM's proposals could give the Democratic Unionist Party exactly that. Under Mr Johnson's proposals, which he calls a ""broad landing zone"" for a new deal with the EU: Northern Ireland would leave the EU's customs union alongside the rest of the UK, at the start of 2021 But Northern Ireland would continue to apply EU legislation relating to agricultural and other products, if the Northern Ireland Assembly approves This arrangement could, in theory, continue indefinitely, but the consent of Northern Ireland's politicians would have to be sought every four years Customs checks on goods traded between the UK and EU would be ""decentralised"", with paperwork submitted electronically and only a ""very small number"" of physical checks These checks should take place away from the border itself, at business premises or at ""other points in the supply chain"" What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit plan?

Nissan Europe 'unsustainable' in no-deal BrexitThe Japanese carmaker is concerned about the impact of export duties in the event of no-deal Brexit.,"This video can not be played The head of Nissan Europe says a no-deal Brexit threatens the firm's business model Japanese carmaker Nissan has warned that a no-deal Brexit could make its European business model unsustainable. Nissan's European chairman, Gianluca de Ficchy, said if a 10% export tariff was introduced after the UK left the EU it would put its operations ""in jeopardy"". This would be the case if the UK moved to World Trade Organization (WTO) rules after Brexit, he said. He was speaking at Nissan's plant in Sunderland,where work on a new model of the Juke is due to start. The Japanese firm said it had invested Â£100m in the plant, which also makes the Qashqai and electric Leaf models. Mr de Ficchy said Nissan still intended to build in Sunderland, the UK's biggest car plant, but that it was difficult to plan for the future amid Brexit uncertainty. The new Juke has been designed and manufactured in the UK, aimed specifically at European markets, with two-thirds of its components coming from the EU and 70% of production destined for the continent. Nissan, which employs 7,000 in Sunderland, also has operations in Spain. Mr de Ficchy said the cost of moving to WTO rules would mean the ""entire business model for Nissan Europe will be in jeopardy"". Mr de Ficchy said if duties were applied after a no-deal Brexit it would ""create an enormous problem"" The car industry is the UK's biggest exporter of goods and eight out of every 10 cars built in the UK are exported. Speaking to the BBC, Mr de Ficchy said: ""We do not know still what a no-deal means. ""There are many alternatives, and today there is a lot of uncertainty. ""The only message I can [give] is that if a no-deal will be associated with the application of 10% duties under the WTO rules, that will create an enormous problem for the overall European activities of Nissan Europe. ""If we will have to sustain 10% export duties on the vehicles that we export from UK to EU, knowing that those vehicles represent 70% of total production, the overall business model won't be sustainable. ""It's not a question of Sunderland, it's a question of the overall economic sustainability of our business [in Europe]."" He said the business was asking for tariffs not be imposed if there is a no-deal Brexit. ""We are asking not to have tariffs being applied in a no-deal scenario because otherwise the tariffs won't be sustainable for us,"" he said. A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We continue to work closely with the sector as they get ready for Brexit on 31 October."" Nissan employs 7,000 people at its plant in Sunderland On Wednesday,union leaders revealed night shifts at Sunderland would end- but Mr Ficchy said this was not the result of Brexit. Other carmakers have warned about the impact of Brexit on their business, not just because of the cost of tariffs but the potential slowdown in production caused by new customs checks after the UK leaves the EU. The industry operates a ""just-in-time"" model, shifting parts around the EU to construct cars in plants across the 28-nation bloc. Honda confirms Swindon car plant closure September figures deepen industry gloom Last month,  Carlos Tavares, chief executive of PSA-the car group that owns Vauxhall - compared a no-deal Brexit to a head-on train crash. He has warned previously that Vauxhall plants at Ellesmere Port and Luton were under threat from Brexit. In June, PSA Group announced plans to build a new version of the Vauxhall Astra at its Ellesmere Port factory in Cheshire. The industry is also under pressure with fewer diesel cars being bought and emissions standards presenting challenges for carmakers. In February, Honda announced the closure of its Swindon plant but said it was nothing to do with Brexit.
