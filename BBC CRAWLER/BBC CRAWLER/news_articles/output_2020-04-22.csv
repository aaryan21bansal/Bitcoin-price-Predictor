"Jackpot winner toasts Â£58m while social distancingRyan Hoyle says he had a beer 2m apart with his brothers to ""get over the shock"" of his lottery win.Manchester","Ryan Hoyle said he was ""shaking"" when he got an email informing him he had become a multi-millionaire A man who scooped a Â£58m lottery win celebrated by having a beer with his brothers - at a 2m (6ft 6in) distance. Ryan Hoyle, 38, said he was ""shaking"" when he got an email informing him he had become a multi-millionaire in Friday's EuroMillions draw. He drove to his parents' house, passing his phone through the window for them to ""double-check"" his numbers. After confirming the eight-figure bonanza, he enjoyed a drink in the sunshine with his siblings. Mr Hoyle, of Rochdale, Greater Manchester, said he first thought he had won Â£2.30 when he saw an email from the National Lottery on Saturday. When he read the message, he said it ""looked like a lot of numbers... I couldn't believe what my eyes were seeing"". He said he was ""shaking and really needed a second opinion so... drove round to mum and dad's house"". ""I kept a safe distance outside and passed the phone through the window for them to double-check for me."" ""It was real - I had won Â£58m."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Prince Louis' rainbow tribute in birthday pictures,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge's son Prince Louis has been photographed making a colourful rainbow poster - a symbol of hope during the coronavirus lockdown - to mark his second birthday. His handprint artwork is one of several photographs released by the family to celebrate the occasion on Thursday. Similar pictures by children haveappeared in windows across the country. Prince Louis was photographed by his mother the Duchess of Cambridge in Norfolk earlier this month. In a series of images, Kate has captured her son - wearing a smart blue gingham-style shirt - grinning up at the camera while displaying his brightly painted palms and fingers. In one portrait, his coloured digits are raised to his cheeks with apparent excitement. In another photo, Louis has smeared colourful paint all over his face, with Kensington Palaceposting a light-hearted tweet,externalsaying ""Instagram Vs Reality"". The duchess - a keen amateur photographer and patron of the Royal Photographic Society - has regularly released pictures she has taken of her other children, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, to mark their birthdays. Louis' artwork is likely to be part of William and Kate's home-schooling lessons, with the duchess recently admitting she kept the make-shift classroomup and running during the Easter holidays. ""It's just having that bit of structure, actually. It's great, there are so many great tips online and fun activities that you can do with the children so it hasn't been all hardcore,"" she said. Kate also revealed her surprise at her children's awareness about the coronavirus outbreak and how she has tackled the subject with them in ""age appropriate"" ways. Prince Louis Arthur Charles of Cambridge, fifth in line to the throne, was born on St George's Day, 23 April 2018, at the private Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, weighing 8lb 7oz. He was christened at 11 weeks old, by Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, in the Chapel Royal at St James's Palace in front of friends and family. Prince Louis has featured in a number of images released by the Cambridges and recently appeared in a video with his older brother and sister applauding the nation's health workers and carers. Prince Charles and his wife the Duchess of Cornwall wished their grandson a ""very happy birthday"" from their Clarence House twitter account. Allow Twitter content?

Easing social distancing rules 'risks second peak',"The UK will have to live with some disruptive social measures for at least the rest of the year, the government's chief medical adviser has said. Prof Chris Whitty said it was ""wholly unrealistic"" to expect life would suddenly return to normal soon. He said ""in the long run"" the ideal way out would be via a ""highly effective vaccine"" or drugs to treat the disease. But he warned that the chance of having those within the next calendar year was ""incredibly small"". ""This disease is not going to be eradicated, it is not going to disappear,"" he said, at the government's daily coronavirus briefing. ""So we have to accept that we are working with a disease that we are going to be with globally... for the foreseeable future."" The latest figures show a further 759 people have died with the virus in UK hospitals, bringing the total number of deaths to 18,100. Raab vows to hit 100k test target in eight days Prof Whitty said the public should not expect the number of coronavirus-related deaths to ""fall away"" suddenly after the peak. ""In the long run, the exit from this is going to be one of two things, ideally,"" he said. ""A vaccine, and there are a variety of ways they can be deployed... or highly effective drugs so that people stop dying of this disease even if they catch it, or which can prevent this disease in vulnerable people."" Prof Whitty warned there were multiple different ways in which the coronavirus epidemic would result in deaths or ill health. This video can not be played Prof Chris Whitty on easing restrictions: ""It's going to take a long time"" As well as those dying from Covid-19, he said others may die indirectly because the NHS has had to be ""reoriented towards Covid"",leading to fewer elective procedures and screening. Should we all be wearing masks now? When can I go out? How many cases are there in your area? He also said if the interventions in place ""extend deprivation among people"" that would increase the risk to their long-term health. ""So what we have to do is think very seriously about this: what is the best balance of measures that gives us the best public health outcome?"" He said there was a ""proper trade-off"" which ministers would have to consider. The government's chief medical adviser and other experts have often said the only secure long term route out of the coronavirus epidemic is the discovery of either a vaccine or effective drugs. So Prof Whitty's latest comments are not a total surprise, however they throw cold water on any idea that lockdown restrictions will be fully lifted in the summer or even the autumn. A vaccine and drugs are unlikely to materialise until next year and until then some form of social distancing will be required, according to Prof Whitty. But that certainly doesn't mean all the current restrictions remain in place until then. Schools, some businesses and public transport might well be reopened in the not too distant future. Pubs and restaurants, under this scenario, will probably be nearer the bottom of the list. Prof Whitty of course is an adviser and it's up to the politicians to decide. They will have to weigh up the impact on the economy and society but also, as they often say, be guided by the science. Also speaking at the briefing, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said easing social distancing measures too soon would risk a second spike of coronavirus cases. He said this could trigger a second lockdown that would ""prolong the economic pain"" across the country. Mr Raab, who is deputising for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, acknowledged the mental, physical and economic strain social distancing measures were having on people throughout the UK, but said they ""must remain in place for the time being"". Gen Sir Nick Carter, the chief of the defence staff, also joined Wednesday's press conference and described the military response to coronavirus as the ""single greatest logistical feat"" of his 40 years of service. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area Gen Carter said the military has worked in support of healthcare workers on the front line, and has been involved with planning and testing - along with helping the Foreign Office with repatriation efforts. He added that the military was also preparing mobile pop-up testing centres in a bid to roll-out more Covid-19 testing. Earlier, the government insisted it would meet its target of 100,000 tests a day by the end of April - an increase of 82,000 on Monday's levels. Sir Keir Starmer, who was making his debut in Prime Minister's Questions as Labour leader, said the UK had been ""very slow and way behind other European countries"" on testing. He asked how it was possible to go from 18,000 tests a day to 100,000 in just eight days. Mr Raab said the UK currently had testing capacity of 40,000 a day and, with new laboratories coming on stream, the government would reach its target.

UK inflation falls as lockdown begins to bite,"The UK's inflation rate fell to 1.5% in March, largely driven by falls in the price of clothing and fuel ahead of the coronavirus lockdown. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell from 1.7% in February,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external Clothing stores had offered more discounts as shoppers began staying at home, it said. Falling oil prices also resulted in cheaper petrol prices. Economists warn inflation could slide to 0.5% in 2020 as the economy shrinks. The ONS's latest data was collected on 17 March, just before lockdown started on 23 March. But its head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said there were already signs people were spending less in shops and more on necessities such as food. The agency said the average price of clothes and shoes fell 1.2% in the year to March 2020. It also said average petrol prices stood at 119.4 pence per litre during the month - the lowest seen since February 2019, while diesel stood at 123.8p The UK benchmark for oil has fallen to about $16 (Â£13) a barrelas economic activity has slowed. That is a fall of about 75% since the start of the year. Sarah Hewin, senior economist at Standard Chartered bank, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Normally low inflation would be welcomed as it means people have effectively more to spend in the shop but these are not normal circumstances. ""The fall in inflation, in addition to low energy prices, is an indication of the steep recession we will see in the coming months."" Meanwhile, Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics said: ""We suspect a larger fall in CPI inflation, from 1.5% to 0.9%, is in store for April as Ofgem [the regulator] lowers the cap on utility bills to reflect past falls in wholesale energy prices."" He added that falling employment, consumer caution and lower energy prices could pull inflation ""down to just 0.5% in the second half of this year"". CPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Inflation is one of the main factors that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the ""base rate"". That influences what interest rate banks can charge people to borrow money, or what they pay on their savings. In an emergency move last month,Last month it cut ratesfrom 0.25% to 0.1% to support the economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. They are now at the lowest level in the Bank's 325-year history. New boss of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey has slashed interest rates to a new low It also said it would increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by Â£200bn in an effort to lower the cost of borrowing. But Melissa Davies, chief economist at Redburn, said the Bank needs to go further: ""It will be a volatile ride for inflation over the next year, with negative numbers a possibility followed by a sharp reversal."" She added: ""More stimulus is needed, with only limited quantitative easing help from the Bank of England and the Treasury's lending guarantee scheme falling short. Even the furlough scheme is only delaying an inevitable and large spike in unemployment."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

Welsh health minister caught swearing about colleagueOpposition leaders call for Vaughan Gething to be sacked over comments about Labour AM.,"This video can not be played AMs could be seen laughing after the Welsh health minister swore during the Senedd meeting The health minister has been caught swearing about a Labour colleague in a virtual Welsh Assembly session after he left his microphone on by mistake. Vaughan Gething made the comment about Cardiff Central AM Jenny Rathbone. He has since apologised to Ms Rathbone. She had been asking questions about the Welsh Government's coronavirus response. Opposition leaders have called for Mr Gething to be sacked by the First Minister Mark Drakeford. Mr Gethingtweeted,external: ""I'm obviously embarrassed about my comments at the end of questions today. I've sent a message apologising and offered to speak to Jenny Rathbone if she wishes to do so. ""It is an unwelcome distraction at a time of unprecedented challenge."" Ban using second homes, doctors urge Drakeford Welsh minister attacks Raab over target comments After he finished his contribution to the day's Senedd business Mr Gething was heard off-camera talking about Ms Rathbone. He told an unknown person: ""What the [expletive] is the matter with her?"" A number of AMs, taking part in the session through the video conferencing system, Zoom, could be seen laughing. Jenny Rathbone remained in vision, before eventually walking away from her camera. Elin Jones, presiding officer, told Mr Gething to turn his microphone off. After continued difficulties the Senedd went into a short break. The clip has since been shared widely on social media. Vaughan Gething was taking questions in a virtual session of the Welsh Assembly In her questions, Ms Rathbone referred to concerns fromNobel-prize winning scientist Sir Martin Evans, saying ""we shouldn't be shooting the messenger"". During her comments she called for more domestic production of PPE, and gave examples of care home workers struggling to be tested because they do not have a car. Mr Gething said Welsh manufacturers have responded to calls to manufacture PPE, that some PPE could be reused by based on the evidence of what is safe and that there are not just ""drive-in"" testing facilities. The exchange led to strong statements from Plaid Cymru and the Welsh Conservatives. A Labour AM said most of their colleagues will be ""very angry"" and would see it as ""unacceptable behaviour"". Plaid leader Adam Price said Mr Gething ""has not only failed over the last month several times, he has failed to acknowledge that he has failed and aggressively attacks even those within his own party who question him."" ""He does not have the right attitude, skills or temperament to lead the government's response to the Coronavirus pandemic. ""To maintain public confidence the FM [first minister] needs to relieve him of these responsibilities with immediate effect. ""There are experienced members on the FM's backbenches who could be brought into government to fill any vacuum."" The health minister apologised to Jenny Rathbone following the remark Welsh Conservative assembly leader Paul Davies added: ""Politicians are entitled to ask serious and challenging questions of ministers and it's essential that they are able to do so during this pandemic. ""For a health minister to show such unprofessionalism and disdain at this time is completely unacceptable and he should be sacked."" However former Welsh Conservative Senedd leader, Andrew RT Davies, said while he had concerns about Mr Gething's record ""I'd also have concerns over a Labour backbencher coming in during the midst of the COVID-19 crisis"".

RAF plane lands with PPE from Turkey,"A delivery of personal protective equipment (PPE) from Turkey is being inspected, Downing Street said, following its late arrival in the UK. An RAF aircraft that landed at RAF Brize Norton on Wednesday morning is believed to have delivered up to about half of the promised kit. Other RAF planes were said to be on standby to collect the rest. The delivery was originally expected to arrive on Sunday, and had been due to include 400,000 surgical gowns. It is not clear exactly what supplies the flight contained and no clear reason was given for the delay. Fresh questions emerge over EU equipment claims Top civil servant 'wrong' about EU equipment claim Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? A spokesman for the prime minister said the consignment was being ""processed"" in line with standard procedure and will be moved ""on to the frontline as quickly as possible"". The RAF aircraft that flew the shipment, which left to pick up the delivery at around 17:00 BST on Monday, can carry about 40 tons of cargo - about half of the consignment. On Monday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the flight had been delayed by problems in Turkey. However, Turkey's ambassador to the UK, Umit Yalcin, said his government only learned about the deal with a private company on Sunday and insisted it had done everything to help. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The government remains under pressure for failing to supply enough PPE. On Monday, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents healthcare trusts across England - said that while the 400,000 gowns from Turkey would be welcome,NHS staff were getting through approximately 150,000 gowns a day. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, care minister Helen Whately said there was a global shortage of PPE and that some deliveries faced delays or did not turn up. ""The really important thing therefore is that we are working to secure an excess of supply to make sure that we, in due course, will have more than we need and at least what we need,"" she said. Helen Whately stressed the importance of reciprocal relationships with other countries over PPE Asked about reports that some PPE was being shipped from British warehouses to countries like Germany, Spain and Italy, she said there was an ""international market"" in PPE and stressed the importance of maintaining ""reciprocal working relationships"" with other countries. She added that the UK was a ""net importer of PPE"" and has been supplied ""many, many times over"" by China in return for equipment it sent at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan. The delivery from Turkey comes after a number of British companies told the BBC their offers to help had gone ignored. During the first virtual Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said some ""are now supplying other countries"" and therefore could have supplied the UK. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is acting as the prime minister's deputy while he recovers from coronavirus, said it was ""not quite right"" to assume that they must have been ""acceptable to UK standards just because they are supplying different needs in different countries abroad"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that offers go through a ""rigorous system of verifying"" because not all are credible, and it was important to ""focus on the biggest, most credible offers first"". He said the government was ""actively engaged"" with more than 1,000 companies who buy from abroad and was working with 159 potential manufacturers in the UK. The government has delivered more than one billion items of PPE since the start of the crisis, he added. Earlier, Ms Whately said that while some organisations which offered help already have established supply chains, others that have been set up in the past few days did not and might be unable to provide the standard of equipment required. The RAF plane was loaded in Turkey before flying back to the UK Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the BBC Breakfast it ""doesn't matter"" if some firms could only make small quantities. ""We need everybody doing what they can as part of this national effort,"" he said. It was ""understandable"" that the government ""probably [hasn't] got enough resources"" to respond to all requests, he added.

YouTube bans 'medically unsubstantiated' content,"YouTube has banned coronavirus-related content that does not follow the World Health Organization's guidelines YouTube has banned any coronavirus-related content that directly contradicts World Health Organization (WHO) advice. The Google-owned service says it will remove anything it deems ""medically unsubstantiated"". Chief executive Susan Wojcicki said the media giant wanted to stamp out ""misinformation on the platform"". The move follows YouTube banningconspiracy theories falsely linking Covid-19 to 5G networks. YouTube stars urge fans to stay at home Coronavirus: Facebook launches UK Covid-19 symptom survey Mrs Wojcicki made the remarks on Wednesday during her first interview since the global coronavirus lockdown began. ""So people saying, âTake vitamin C, take turmeric, weâll cure you,â those are the examples of things that would be a violation of our policy,â she told CNN. âAnything that would go against World Health Organization recommendations would be a violation of our policy.â Mrs Wojcicki added YouTube had seen a 75% increase in demand for news from ""authoritative"" sources. Last week, Facebook announced users who had read, watched or shared false Covid-19 information would receive a pop-up alert urging them to visit the WHO's website. Facebook-ownedmessaging service WhatsApp, meanwhile,stopped users forwarding messages already shared more than four times by the wider community to more than one chat at a time.

""I pay tribute to the work they have done,"" Oliver Dowden told the Digital, Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee on Wednesday. But he urged them to take down inaccurate information faster during ""out of hours"" periods such as evenings and weekends.

Brands are using blacklist filters to prevent their ads running alongside stories including keywords such as ""coronavirus"" and ""pandemic"". Such filters are already widely used, to avoid car manufacturers' ads appearing next to stories about road accidents, for example. But now some media outlets are reportedly frustrated content they deem ""inoffensive,"" such as uplifting human interest stories, are also being prevented from running these adverts. It is estimated keyword ad-blocking could cost the UK newspaper industry $50m (Â£40m) over the next year.

Federer wants men's and women's tennis bodies to merge,"Roger Federer has won eight Wimbledon titles Roger Federer says ""now is the time"" for the men's and women's governing bodies to merge while tennis is in limbo because of the coronavirus. The 20-time Grand Slam champion floated the idea in a series of Twitter posts. He said a merger of the Women's Tennis Association (WTA) and the men's Association of Tennis Professionals (ATP) ""probably should have happened"". ""We can come out of this with two weakened bodies or one stronger body,"" Federer said. Later on Wednesday ATP chairman Andrea Gaudenzi appeared to back the idea saying: ""Our sport has a big opportunity if we can come together in the spirit of collaboration and unity. ""Recent cooperation between governing bodies has only strengthened my belief that a unified sport is the surest way to maximise our potential and to deliver an optimal experience for fans on site, on television and online. To that end, I welcome the views of our players."" WTA chairman and chief executive Steve Simon said the organisation had been ""regular contact with the ATP"" during the coronavirus pandemic, adding: ""I have long stated that we are at our best as a sport when we can work together, and the recent weeks have highlighted that fact. ""We look forward to continuing discussions on how we can effectively work together to deliver the greatest value to our fans and to our many stakeholders."" BBC Sport understands preliminary discussions have taken place between the two tours about greater collaboration in certain areas. While many high-profile tennis players have backed Federer's plan, Australia's Nick Kyrgios tweeted on Thursday to say: ""We shouldn't merge."" On Wednesday, the world number 40 had posted: ""Did anyone ask the majority of the ATP what they think about merging with the WTA and how it is good for us?"" In a series ofsocial media posts,externalon Wednesday, Federer added: ""I am not talking about merging competition on the court but merging the two governing bodies that oversee the men's and women's professional tours. ""It's too confusing for the fans when there are different ranking systems, different logos, different websites, different tournament categories."" American tennis legend Billie Jean King, one of the prime movers behind the founding of the WTA,said a merger,external""has long been my vision for tennis"". ""The WTA on its own was always Plan B,"" added King. ""I'm glad we are on the same page. Let's make it happen."" Spanish 19-time Grand Slam championRafael Nadal added,external: ""It would be great to get out of this world crisis with the union of men's and women's tennis in only one organisation."" Reigning Wimbledon champion Simona Halep, two-time Wimbledon champion Petra Kvitova, Argentine Diego Schwartzman and two-time Grand Slam champion Garbine Muguruza are among the other high-profile tennis players to voice their agreement on social media. All tennis has been abandoned until at least 13 July, withWimbledon cancellingits grass court tournament for the first time since World War Two because of the coronavirus pandemic. It followed the postponement of the French Open, which was due to begin in May but has been rescheduled to take place in Paris from 20 September to 4 October. Russell Fuller, BBC Sport tennis correspondent With all sports facing up to an alarming financial future, one strengthened and unified governing body certainly has a ring of appeal. There would also be marketing and scheduling advantages. They wouldn't need to change the net to change the logo between matches at combined events, for example. And maybe all televised tennis would be found in the same place, and no longer require several subscriptions to access. Women could gain financially as most of their standalone events have lower prize funds, but how would men react to the potential dilution of their income and a brand, which for the moment, is significantly stronger? How likely is a merger to happen? Very unlikely in the short term, but not impossible in the longer term - although perhaps only in certain mutually beneficial areas. I understand preliminary discussions have taken place - which, in itself, is a sign of the sport's new found spirit of co-operation in the age of Covid-19.

2019 was Europe's warmest year on record,"Three heatwaves hit Europe across 2019 Europe is heating faster than the global average as new data indicates that last year was the warmest on record. While globally the year was the second warmest, a series of heatwaves helped push the region to a new high mark. Over the past five years, global temperatures were, on average, just over 1C warmer than at the end of the 19th century. In Europe, in the same period, temperatures were almost 2C warmer. July was 'marginally' world's warmest month ever Hundreds of temperature records broken over summer Last decade 'on course' to be warmest The data has been published as Earth Day marks its 50th anniversary. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says the physical signs of climate change and impacts on our planet have gathered pace in the past five years, which were the hottest on record. The European data, which comes from the EU's Copernicus Climate Service, 11 of the 12 warmest years on record on the continent have occurred since 2000. TheEuropean State of the Climate 2019,externalshows that warm conditions and summer heatwaves saw drought in many parts of central Europe. While theUK saw a new all-time high temperaturerecorded in Cambridge in July, in many places across the continent, the weather was 3-4C warmer than normal. This is reflected in the amount of sunshine that hit Europe across the year.  The number of sunshine hours was the largest on record. 2019 was a record year for sunshine hours The hot summer weather across Europe was followed by one of the wettest Novembers on record, with rainfall almost four times the normal amount in western and southern Europe. The European Arctic region though was below the high temperatures seen in recent years, just 0.9C higher than average. Taken together, the data show ""a clear warming trend across the last four decades."" ""Europe has indeed been warming significantly faster than the global average,"" said Prof Rowan Sutton, director of science (climate) at the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science. Europe was also hit by heavy rainfall during the later part of last year ""This is for two reasons.  First, land regions in general are warming faster than the oceans, largely because the greater availability of moisture over the oceans damps the rate of warming."" ""Secondly, reductions in specific forms of air pollution have contributed to the recent warming in Europe, particularly in summer."" What will worry researchers is that the mean temperature in Europe over the past five years is averaging almost 2C warmer than pre-industrial figures. This suggests that the continent is breaching the promise made in the Paris climate agreement to keep temperatures ""well below"" 2C. ""In lockdown, sitting on our sofas or our makeshift desks or in many more difficult situations, it would be easy for us to take our eyes off this alarming reality; that 2019 was the warmest year on record for Europe, that November brought us massively more precipitation than normal,"" said Prof Hannah Cloke, from the University of Reading. ""And for every decade I have been on this planet, it has been getting hotter and hotter and hotter. "" Researchers in the field are keen to underline that while the coronavirus pandemic might mean a temporary drop in emissions of greenhouse gases, much more will need to be done to arrest the worrying warming trend. ""While pollution has dropped with economic activity in response to the global pandemic, CO2 is not just disappearing overnight,"" said Prof Daniela Schmidt, from the University of Bristol. Fires made worse by drought were a feature in many European countries in 2019 ""The impact of the warming like sea level rise will be with us for centuries. The pandemic has made us less able to tackle the impact of climate change impacts. Our communities which have just been flooded will find sheltering in their damaged homes much more challenging. ""We have also learned, though, during the last months that actions taken together to make a difference."" The new data has been published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Commenting on the Earth Day anniversary, the WMO's secretary general, Petteri Taalas, said it was important to continue tackling climate change amid the global pandemic. ""Whilst COVID-19 has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human well-being, ecosystems and economies for centuries,"" he said. ""We need to flatten both the pandemic and climate change curves."" Echoingearlier comments by the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, Mr Taalas commented: ""We need to show the same determination and unity against climate change as against COVID-19. We need to act together in the interests of the health and welfare of humanity not just for the coming weeks and months, but for many generations ahead.""

"'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't'Consumer group Which? says many of the UK's biggest airlines and travel companies are breaking the law.Business","After his flight was cancelled, Steve Childs requested a refund Steve Childs was hoping to travel to Alicante to visit his father, but then the coronavirus outbreak ruined his plans. The 43-year-old from Wolverhampton was happy to follow advice not to fly, and Ryanair cancelled his flight as travel restrictions continued. He received an email confirming the cancellation, and followed the link to apply for the refund to which he was legally entitled. Then, ""out of the blue"", he received another message, not confirming his refund, but instead giving him a voucher worth the same amount to use on a future Ryanair flight. ""I'd been expecting a refund for a few weeks. When you know you are going to get the money, you make plans for it,"" he said. He understands the plight of airlines is perilous during this unprecedented crisis. They face a cashflow nightmare if they pay everyone's refund straight away, But the manner of his treatment left him ""frustrated"", he said. ""They turned around from saying I could have a refund, to saying it would be months,"" he said. If he wanted a refund, Ryanair told him, he must reapply, and the request would be placed in a queue ""until the Covid-19 emergency has passed"" - which suggests a very open-ended deadline. Consumer website Moneysavingexpert has made a formal complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority and Trading Standards about Ryanair's apparent policy. A Ryanair spokesman said: ""For any cancelled flight, Ryanair is giving customers all of the options set out under EU regulations, including refunds. ""The process time for cash refunds is taking longer due to the fact we are having to process 10,000 times the usual volume and have fewer staff available due to social distancing measures."" He added that vouchers and rebookings were quicker, as the processes were automated. Coronavirus: 'I don't want a flight voucher, where's my refund?' 'We're struggling to get a refund on our Â£17,000 chalet' Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Mr Childs is far from alone. There has been a wave of complaints from air passengers and holidaymakers who, despite accepting their break had to be cancelled, have had enormous difficulty getting a refund in good time - or at all. Under EU law, travel companies must refund customers within 14 days if their package holiday is cancelled. The EU's Denied Boarding Regulations state that air passengers are due a refund within seven days if a flight with an airline based in the UK or EU, or from an airport in the UK or EU, is cancelled. However, the consumer organisation Which? has accused many of the UK's biggest airlines and travel companies of routinely breaking these laws. It said the travel industry's own estimates suggested Â£7bn of travellers' money was affected. This was cash that people, struggling themselves as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic, could not afford to go without. It found none of the 10 biggest travel companies were giving refunds in the legally specified timeframe, with some refusing refunds all together. Some smaller companies were managing to do so in full and on time. The same was true of the 10 biggest airlines, none of which were meeting the deadline. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines will be struggling to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. Your travel insurance may, or may not, cover you If you are trying to get home, the airline has a duty to get you back. However, with so many flights cancelled, this has become increasingly difficult. Now,the government has agreed to step inwhen needed to return those who are stranded If you are stuck in the EU and a UK or EU carrier is not rerouting or helping you, you should be able to come home on any airline you can and bill the original airline for the new ticket. The airline is legally obliged to get you home and they should be rerouting you themselves. If they are failing to do that, they are responsible for the cost of getting you home. But you should not cancel and accept a refund as this ends the airline's duty of care towards you and you won't be able to claim anything back. It is best to pay by credit card, for the back-up option to claim from your card provider If you have a package holiday, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days A spokesman for Abta, which represents travel companies and agents, said: ""The worldwide travel shutdown has led to a huge volume of holidays being affected. ""Many travel agents and tour operators are unable to provide immediate cash refunds because they have not yet received money back from airlines and hotels, so they need more than 14 days to process refund requests."" Airlines UK, which represents the UK aviation sector, said it faced a huge volume of refund claims to get through. It has been lobbying for airlines to be allowed to offer vouchers, not refunds, during the crisis, as is the case in some other countries. Which? said it did not want the travel industry to fail, but the burden of financial support should not be carried by struggling consumers. Travellers could choose to rebook if they wanted to, but should not be obliged to, it said. Instead, it argued that the government, the travel industry, insurers and regulators all had a responsibility to do more. Its RefundPassengers campaign has been trending on Twitter. It proposed a range of measures including an extension of the 14-day refund rule for package holidays to one month, and the introduction of a temporary government travel guarantee fund to support firms unable to fulfil their legal obligations. The Department for Business said: ""Companies have a legal obligation to ensure their consumers are fairly compensated.""

Are the five tests for ending lockdown being met?,"After Easter, when the government in England announced lockdown was to continue for another three weeks, it set out five tests that had to be met before restrictions were eased. We are now well on the way to lifting them in both England and the rest of the UK. But to what extent are the tests being met? And what is the risk of them lapsing? As soon as images began to emerge in February of hospitals in Italy being overwhelmed with coronavirus cases, making sure the NHS could cope became the first priority. Routine operations were cancelled en masse and large field hospitals - known as Nightingales in England - began to be built. A deal was also struck with the independent sector to use ventilators and beds in private hospitals. Cases peaked in early April - and have been falling ever since. At the peak more than 3,000 Covid admissions were being seen every day. That is now down to under 500 and all the field hospitals are hibernating. Routine work has now been restarted, but the NHS remains on an emergency footing, ready for a second peak. If cases increase again the field hospitals will be re-opened - although with the exception of London, none of these has intensive care facilities. More than 40,000 people have died with coronavirus in the UK, government data shows. These figure relate to the numbers who die after testing positive for the virus. It does not necessarily mean the virus was the direct cause of their death - although work by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) suggests that in the overwhelming majority of cases it is. Deaths peaked in early-to-mid-April - and have been falling ever since. The downward trend is uneven because the recording of deaths slows at weekends, so the figures tend to drop then before rising during the week. But when you look at the seven-day average, the trend is clear. The number of newly diagnosed cases in the UK is hovering around the 1,500 mark on most days at the moment. Ministers say this shows infection rates are at manageable levels. At the peak there were around 6,000 positive tests a day, but this was when testing was restricted to certain groups, so was not an accurate measure of the true level of infections. It is estimated in late March there were around 100,000 new infections a day. But even now with widespread testing available, doubts remain whether the true level of infections is being identified. A surveillance programme in England run by the ONS suggests around 4,000 new infections a day are being seen. Part of the problem is that for some the virus leads to such mild symptoms or none at all, that they do not even realise they are infected. That poses a problem keeping on top of the virus because if there are significant numbers of silent spreaders, new -  more serious  - cases could keep popping up. Currently the UK has capacity to provide more than 200,000 tests a day, if you include tests posted out to individuals and care homes. That is a significant improvement on the picture at the start of March - when only around 10,000 a day were being done. Three mega-labs have been opened to process tests, while around 50 drive-through testing centres, 100 military-run mobile units and a home-testing service have been launched to complement the testing done in hospitals. That means there is plenty of capacity - anyone who needs a test can certainly get one. Staff - in hospitals, care homes and, to a lesser extent, other public services - also need personal protective equipment (PPE), such as visors, gowns and masks, to protect them from the virus. The more cases there are, the more demand for kit there will be. In the first weeks of the pandemic, there were serious concerns about the availability of PPE. Some hospitals and care homes were reporting they were struggling to get hold of the equipment they needed. The army was brought in to distribute supplies. The stockpile the government holds for pandemics has been used up, but international and domestic supply routes have improved. Local authority and NHS bosses both say the pressure on PPE has eased. Without a vaccine, this will be a very tricky one to navigate. As well as widespread testing, England has set up a contact-tracing system, with separate services being run by the other UK nations. The idea is that this service will help contain any local flare-ups by getting the close contacts of infected people to self-isolate, to stop further spread. It is still early days for the programme - with even its bosses warning it is not yet ""gold standard"". Originally the army of contact-tracers being employed was meant to be complemented by a tracing app that would alert people when they have been in close contact with an infected individual. This could be particularly useful if people have been seated close to someone on a train, for example. The app has been piloted on the Isle of Wight, but is currently not ready for national roll-out. The UK has come a long way in the past few months. But there are concerns the infection rates are still too high and tests are not being turned around quickly enough, while doubts remain about whether the contact-tracing system will be good enough. But at the end of the day, the easing of restrictions comes down to political judgement. The lockdown itself is harmful - economically, socially and for health. Ministers are taking into account more than just these five tests in the decision-making process. Follow Nickon Twitter,external Read more from Nick LOCKDOWN UPDATE:What's changing, where?

Tops and joggers in as Boohoo lockdown sales boom,"The Manchester-based company has seen sales pick up again this month Online fashion retailer Boohoo says it has found a new way of thriving in the coronavirus lockdown - by making people look good on video conference calls. The firm said it had seen a rise in sales of smart tops, as people working from home needed to keep up appearances on camera in front of their colleagues. The Manchester-based firm said demand for the items had contributed to a rise in sales during April. Other sought-after lines included hoodies and jogging wear. Announcing its latest financial results, Boohoo said it was seeing ""improved year-on-year growth of group sales during April"", although it declined to give figures. In the year to the end of February, the group, which includes PrettyLittle Thing and other brands, made pre-tax profits of Â£92.2m, up 54% on the previous 12 months. Trading in March had been ""mixed"" because of the coronavirus pandemic, but performance had improved in more recent weeks, it said. Boohoo shares rose 5.5% in morning trading on the news. A Boohoo spokesperson told the BBC: ""People aren't really buying going-out items, but they are buying homewear - hoodies, joggers, tracksuit bottoms. ""Sales of tops have gone up in particular, with everyone wanting to look smart on Zoom calls."" Not all of Boohoo's products have been as well received.

2019 was Europe's warmest year on recordEurope is heating faster than the global average as data shows last year was the warmest on record.Science & EnvironmentComments,"Three heatwaves hit Europe across 2019 Europe is heating faster than the global average as new data indicates that last year was the warmest on record. While globally the year was the second warmest, a series of heatwaves helped push the region to a new high mark. Over the past five years, global temperatures were, on average, just over 1C warmer than at the end of the 19th century. In Europe, in the same period, temperatures were almost 2C warmer. July was 'marginally' world's warmest month ever Hundreds of temperature records broken over summer Last decade 'on course' to be warmest The data has been published as Earth Day marks its 50th anniversary. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) says the physical signs of climate change and impacts on our planet have gathered pace in the past five years, which were the hottest on record. The European data, which comes from the EU's Copernicus Climate Service, 11 of the 12 warmest years on record on the continent have occurred since 2000. TheEuropean State of the Climate 2019,externalshows that warm conditions and summer heatwaves saw drought in many parts of central Europe. While theUK saw a new all-time high temperaturerecorded in Cambridge in July, in many places across the continent, the weather was 3-4C warmer than normal. This is reflected in the amount of sunshine that hit Europe across the year.  The number of sunshine hours was the largest on record. 2019 was a record year for sunshine hours The hot summer weather across Europe was followed by one of the wettest Novembers on record, with rainfall almost four times the normal amount in western and southern Europe. The European Arctic region though was below the high temperatures seen in recent years, just 0.9C higher than average. Taken together, the data show ""a clear warming trend across the last four decades."" ""Europe has indeed been warming significantly faster than the global average,"" said Prof Rowan Sutton, director of science (climate) at the UK's National Centre for Atmospheric Science. Europe was also hit by heavy rainfall during the later part of last year ""This is for two reasons.  First, land regions in general are warming faster than the oceans, largely because the greater availability of moisture over the oceans damps the rate of warming."" ""Secondly, reductions in specific forms of air pollution have contributed to the recent warming in Europe, particularly in summer."" What will worry researchers is that the mean temperature in Europe over the past five years is averaging almost 2C warmer than pre-industrial figures. This suggests that the continent is breaching the promise made in the Paris climate agreement to keep temperatures ""well below"" 2C. ""In lockdown, sitting on our sofas or our makeshift desks or in many more difficult situations, it would be easy for us to take our eyes off this alarming reality; that 2019 was the warmest year on record for Europe, that November brought us massively more precipitation than normal,"" said Prof Hannah Cloke, from the University of Reading. ""And for every decade I have been on this planet, it has been getting hotter and hotter and hotter. "" Researchers in the field are keen to underline that while the coronavirus pandemic might mean a temporary drop in emissions of greenhouse gases, much more will need to be done to arrest the worrying warming trend. ""While pollution has dropped with economic activity in response to the global pandemic, CO2 is not just disappearing overnight,"" said Prof Daniela Schmidt, from the University of Bristol. Fires made worse by drought were a feature in many European countries in 2019 ""The impact of the warming like sea level rise will be with us for centuries. The pandemic has made us less able to tackle the impact of climate change impacts. Our communities which have just been flooded will find sheltering in their damaged homes much more challenging. ""We have also learned, though, during the last months that actions taken together to make a difference."" The new data has been published by the Copernicus Climate Change Service, which is implemented by the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts. Commenting on the Earth Day anniversary, the WMO's secretary general, Petteri Taalas, said it was important to continue tackling climate change amid the global pandemic. ""Whilst COVID-19 has caused a severe international health and economic crisis, failure to tackle climate change may threaten human well-being, ecosystems and economies for centuries,"" he said. ""We need to flatten both the pandemic and climate change curves."" Echoingearlier comments by the UN secretary general Antonio Guterres, Mr Taalas commented: ""We need to show the same determination and unity against climate change as against COVID-19. We need to act together in the interests of the health and welfare of humanity not just for the coming weeks and months, but for many generations ahead.""

Tops and joggers in as Boohoo lockdown sales boomThe online fashion retailer says customers want to look good when videoconferencing with colleagues.Business,"The Manchester-based company has seen sales pick up again this month Online fashion retailer Boohoo says it has found a new way of thriving in the coronavirus lockdown - by making people look good on video conference calls. The firm said it had seen a rise in sales of smart tops, as people working from home needed to keep up appearances on camera in front of their colleagues. The Manchester-based firm said demand for the items had contributed to a rise in sales during April. Other sought-after lines included hoodies and jogging wear. Announcing its latest financial results, Boohoo said it was seeing ""improved year-on-year growth of group sales during April"", although it declined to give figures. In the year to the end of February, the group, which includes PrettyLittle Thing and other brands, made pre-tax profits of Â£92.2m, up 54% on the previous 12 months. Trading in March had been ""mixed"" because of the coronavirus pandemic, but performance had improved in more recent weeks, it said. Boohoo shares rose 5.5% in morning trading on the news. A Boohoo spokesperson told the BBC: ""People aren't really buying going-out items, but they are buying homewear - hoodies, joggers, tracksuit bottoms. ""Sales of tops have gone up in particular, with everyone wanting to look smart on Zoom calls."" Not all of Boohoo's products have been as well received. On Monday, the firm apologised after its range of fashion face masks caused an outcry. The Â£5 masks came with messagessuch as ""Eat, sleep, isolate, repeat"" or ""If you can read this, you are too close"".

UK inflation falls as lockdown begins to biteClothing and fuel prices slide as economists warn of sharp falls in inflation ahead.BusinessComments,"The UK's inflation rate fell to 1.5% in March, largely driven by falls in the price of clothing and fuel ahead of the coronavirus lockdown. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell from 1.7% in February,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external Clothing stores had offered more discounts as shoppers began staying at home, it said. Falling oil prices also resulted in cheaper petrol prices. Economists warn inflation could slide to 0.5% in 2020 as the economy shrinks. The ONS's latest data was collected on 17 March, just before lockdown started on 23 March. But its head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said there were already signs people were spending less in shops and more on necessities such as food. The agency said the average price of clothes and shoes fell 1.2% in the year to March 2020. It also said average petrol prices stood at 119.4 pence per litre during the month - the lowest seen since February 2019, while diesel stood at 123.8p The UK benchmark for oil has fallen to about $16 (Â£13) a barrelas economic activity has slowed. That is a fall of about 75% since the start of the year. Sarah Hewin, senior economist at Standard Chartered bank, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Normally low inflation would be welcomed as it means people have effectively more to spend in the shop but these are not normal circumstances. ""The fall in inflation, in addition to low energy prices, is an indication of the steep recession we will see in the coming months."" Meanwhile, Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics said: ""We suspect a larger fall in CPI inflation, from 1.5% to 0.9%, is in store for April as Ofgem [the regulator] lowers the cap on utility bills to reflect past falls in wholesale energy prices."" He added that falling employment, consumer caution and lower energy prices could pull inflation ""down to just 0.5% in the second half of this year"". CPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Inflation is one of the main factors that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the ""base rate"". That influences what interest rate banks can charge people to borrow money, or what they pay on their savings. In an emergency move last month,Last month it cut ratesfrom 0.25% to 0.1% to support the economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. They are now at the lowest level in the Bank's 325-year history. New boss of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey has slashed interest rates to a new low It also said it would increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by Â£200bn in an effort to lower the cost of borrowing. But Melissa Davies, chief economist at Redburn, said the Bank needs to go further: ""It will be a volatile ride for inflation over the next year, with negative numbers a possibility followed by a sharp reversal."" She added: ""More stimulus is needed, with only limited quantitative easing help from the Bank of England and the Treasury's lending guarantee scheme falling short. Even the furlough scheme is only delaying an inevitable and large spike in unemployment."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

After falling seriously ill with coronavirus, she was admitted to hospital earlier this month. Read her storyof life - and near-death - on a high-risk Covid-19 ward. A body representing Indian-origin doctors in the UK has written to the NHS calling for all staff to urgently be risk-assessed for age, sex, ethnicity and health conditions. Ethnic minorities in the UK are disproportionately more likely to become critically ill with the coronavirus - 34% of ICU patients are Bame (Black, Asian and minority ethnic), despite making up only about 13% of the general population. A disproportionate number of NHS staff who've died of the virus have also been Bame. A government review is looking into the issue. ""There is palpable worry, upset and at times anger amongst them that the matter [of Bame mortality rates] is not being addressed with sufficient urgency,""the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin (Bapio) said.,external The letter adds that many of the health conditions likely to make people more susceptible to Covid-19 - including hypertension, diabetes and vitamin D deficiency - are more common in Bame people in the UK than the rest of the population. It says if staff are deemed to be at significant risk they should be deployed in non-Covid working environments or asked to work remotely. It also asks that Bame staff be tested for vitamin D deficiency. Read more about how the coronavirus is affecting Bame communities in the UK. Chloroquine and derivatives have been used against malaria Fauci says he has no concerns that public health officials are being muzzled by the Trump administration, noting that he is still on the podium even after expressing dissenting views. He was responding to a question about hydroxychloroquine, a drug touted by the president as a possible coronavirus treatment. There has been a global surge in demand for drugs normally used against malaria to tackle the coronavirus, as governments urgently seek out treatments for the new disease. Chloroquine, and a related derivative, hydroxychloroquine, have gained attention - despite the World Health Organization (WHO) saying there is no definitive evidence they work. According to a study released on Tuesday, coronavirus patients taking hydroxychloroquine had higher death rates compared with those who did not take the drug. The research focused on 368 patients at US Veterans Health Administration medical centres. It found 97 patients who took hydroxychloroquine had a 27.8% mortality rate. The 158 patients who did not take the drug had an 11.4% death rate. The research, which was not peer reviewed or published in a medical journal, was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia. So what exactly is the evidence of the effectiveness of malaria drugs as a treatment for the coronavirus, and who is using them? Read the full story from our Reality Check team here. US Health Secretary Alex Azar US Health Secretary Alex Azar reportedly appointed a trusted aide who previously ran a dog-breeding business in Texas to lead the Department of Health and Human Servicesâ day-to-day response to coronavirus. The aide, Brian Harrison, 37, had no experience in public health or medicine, reports Reuters. Asked about this, Trump says: ""I don't know about that."" Before joining the Trump administration Harrison ran a company called Dallas Labradoodles for six years, according to financial disclosures unearthed by Reuters news agency. Five sources told Reuters that some officials in the White House derisively called him âthe dog breeder"". âEveryone had to report up through him,â said one official. Infectious disease chief Dr Fauci is asked about the recent news oftwo pet cats catching Covid-19. ""Certainly animals, pets can get infected,"" he says, noting big cats in zoos have become infected with the coronavirus. But he says there is no proof the virus can be transmitted from pets to humans. ""Biologically, anything is possible,"" Fauci says. ""But there's no evidence whatsoever that we have seen from an epidemiological standpoint that pets can be transmitters within a household."" Fauci also points out that finding an animal has the virus does not necessarily mean the animal is transmitting it. He says zoo animals that have caught Covid-19 likely contracted it from an asymptomatic keeper who was caring for them. Trump was asked about a senior government vaccine expert, Dr Rick Bright, who says he has been sidelined for refusing to toe the political line. The president says: ""I've never heard of him."" On the claim he was driven out, Trump adds: ""Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't."" Dr Brighttold the New York Times,externalhe was removed after conflicting with the Trump administration over unproven coronavirus treatments. The president has often touted chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as possible treatments against Covid-19. So what does President Trump's immigration order do? For the next 60 days, it will bar anyone who is currently outside the United States and does not have a valid immigrant visa or travel document. It does not affect:  Carolyn Goodman, the independent mayor of Las Vegas, has said she proposed offering the city as a ""control group"" to test out dropping social distancing measures. âWell, how do you know unless you have a control group?â she said on CNN, adding that she had offered to let Las Vegas be a control group but was turned down by statisticians. Ms Goodman wants to see the city's casinos, hotels and businesses reopened. ""We have to open up,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Infectious diseases chief Dr Anthony Fauci says he is ""convinced"" the US ""will have coronavirus in the fall"" because of how transmissible the disease is. But he says the nation will be ""much, much better prepared"" in the autumn ""compared to what happened to us this winter"". Fauci notes that the programme to deal with Covid-19 ""is not one that is going to be, âturn the lights on in America, weâre finished'."" ""We have to proceed in a very careful and measured way,"" he says, adding that the guidelines by the administration are just that. Fauci also says that if the US does not adopt such an approach, ""thereâs a likelihood that it will rebound and the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we canât take care of"". ""If you leave the virus to its own devices it will take off,"" Fauci adds. Trump thanks Harvard University after it decided not to accept nearly $9m (Â£7.3m) in coronavirus relief aid. The president said on Tuesday he was unhappy that the prestigious US university had received stimulus money. ""I'm pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds, nor will Stanford University or many of the others that were involved,"" he said. ""They're not accepting the money and that's great, so I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford and I want to thank the other companies,"" he added. President Trump tells reporters he's just signed an executive order that he said yesterday would temporarily suspend green cards. âIâve just signed it before coming into the room,â he says. ""This will ensure unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens,"" Trump adds. ""As for amending it, extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time."" Here'sour story. The president also noted he disagreed ""strongly"" with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, who has decided to reopen some non-essential businesses. ""I told the governor very simply I disagree,"" Trump says, noting ""safety has to predominate"" in reopening the states. ""I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlours and barber shops - in phase one [of reopening] is just too soon."" The president added: ""But at the same time I want him to do what he thinks is right.â Kemp, a Trump ally, on Monday announced Georgia would allow gyms, bowling alleys, nail salons and massage therapists to open on Friday. In-person church services can resume. Restaurants and cinemas can also open. His order also prohibited cities from imposing their own restrictions on businesses. ""It's been encouraging to watch states begin to open up, it's a beautiful thing to see,"" Trump says. ""I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines, very important,"" Trump adds. He goes on to say he wants the state governors ""to do what they think is best, but ideally they'll adhere"" to the administration's guidance. He reminds Americans to wash their hands, avoid close contact and wear a face covering in cases where social distancing is impractical. ""We don't want a rebound,"" Trump says. The president's reminder comes after weeks of anti-lockdown protests across the country. Protesters say the restrictions in states are an overreaction and have demanded governors reopen their economies. Democratic governors had requested the Trump administration remind Americans of the guidelines due to these demonstrations.  Trump asks Dr Deborah Birx, one of the taskforce experts, if there is a good chance that Covid-19 won't come back at all. Birx instead says it'll be easier to find it if it does. ""I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if, potentially, the virus comes back,"" she says. ""We're hoping that the flu infections also go down because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves."" Trump says: ""And if it comes back, though, it won't be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. He says ""you could have some embers of corona"", but adds: ""We will not go through what we've been going through for the last two months."" ""It might not come back at all,"" he adds. Trump says recent comments from Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Dr Robert Redfield that a second Covid-19 wave could be even worse were ""inaccurate"". ""He was totally misquoted,"" Trump says. ""His whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot."" Redfield joins Trump to clarify. He says he noted that next autumn ""could be more difficult, more complicated"" if influenza and Covid-19 were circulating at the same time. ""I think it's really important to emphasise what I didn't say,"" Redfield says. ""I didn't say this was going to be worse, I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated. ""The issue that I was talking about being more difficult is we're going to have two viruses circulating at the same time."" Redfield says he was accurately quoted in the Washington Post, but takes issue with the headline, âCDC director warns second wave of coronavirus is likely to be even more devastatingâ. Here's what Redfield is quoted as saying by the Post: âThereâs a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. ""Weâre going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.â Trump tweeted about this earlier: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The research, which was not peer reviewed or published in a medical journal, was funded by the National Institutes of Health and the University of Virginia. So what exactly is the evidence of the effectiveness of malaria drugs as a treatment for the coronavirus, and who is using them? Read the full story from our Reality Check team here. US Health Secretary Alex Azar US Health Secretary Alex Azar reportedly appointed a trusted aide who previously ran a dog-breeding business in Texas to lead the Department of Health and Human Servicesâ day-to-day response to coronavirus. The aide, Brian Harrison, 37, had no experience in public health or medicine, reports Reuters. Asked about this, Trump says: ""I don't know about that."" Before joining the Trump administration Harrison ran a company called Dallas Labradoodles for six years, according to financial disclosures unearthed by Reuters news agency. Five sources told Reuters that some officials in the White House derisively called him âthe dog breeder"". âEveryone had to report up through him,â said one official. Infectious disease chief Dr Fauci is asked about the recent news oftwo pet cats catching Covid-19. ""Certainly animals, pets can get infected,"" he says, noting big cats in zoos have become infected with the coronavirus. But he says there is no proof the virus can be transmitted from pets to humans. ""Biologically, anything is possible,"" Fauci says. ""But there's no evidence whatsoever that we have seen from an epidemiological standpoint that pets can be transmitters within a household."" Fauci also points out that finding an animal has the virus does not necessarily mean the animal is transmitting it. He says zoo animals that have caught Covid-19 likely contracted it from an asymptomatic keeper who was caring for them. Trump was asked about a senior government vaccine expert, Dr Rick Bright, who says he has been sidelined for refusing to toe the political line. The president says: ""I've never heard of him."" On the claim he was driven out, Trump adds: ""Maybe he was, maybe he wasn't."" Dr Brighttold the New York Times,externalhe was removed after conflicting with the Trump administration over unproven coronavirus treatments. The president has often touted chloroquine and hydroxychloroquine as possible treatments against Covid-19. So what does President Trump's immigration order do? For the next 60 days, it will bar anyone who is currently outside the United States and does not have a valid immigrant visa or travel document. It does not affect:  Carolyn Goodman, the independent mayor of Las Vegas, has said she proposed offering the city as a ""control group"" to test out dropping social distancing measures. âWell, how do you know unless you have a control group?â she said on CNN, adding that she had offered to let Las Vegas be a control group but was turned down by statisticians. Ms Goodman wants to see the city's casinos, hotels and businesses reopened. ""We have to open up,"" she said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Infectious diseases chief Dr Anthony Fauci says he is ""convinced"" the US ""will have coronavirus in the fall"" because of how transmissible the disease is. But he says the nation will be ""much, much better prepared"" in the autumn ""compared to what happened to us this winter"". Fauci notes that the programme to deal with Covid-19 ""is not one that is going to be, âturn the lights on in America, weâre finished'."" ""We have to proceed in a very careful and measured way,"" he says, adding that the guidelines by the administration are just that. Fauci also says that if the US does not adopt such an approach, ""thereâs a likelihood that it will rebound and the one way not to reopen the economy is to have a rebound that we canât take care of"". ""If you leave the virus to its own devices it will take off,"" Fauci adds. Trump thanks Harvard University after it decided not to accept nearly $9m (Â£7.3m) in coronavirus relief aid. The president said on Tuesday he was unhappy that the prestigious US university had received stimulus money. ""I'm pleased to announce that Harvard has announced today that they will not accept the funds, nor will Stanford University or many of the others that were involved,"" he said. ""They're not accepting the money and that's great, so I want to thank Harvard, I want to thank Stanford and I want to thank the other companies,"" he added. President Trump tells reporters he's just signed an executive order that he said yesterday would temporarily suspend green cards. âIâve just signed it before coming into the room,â he says. ""This will ensure unemployed Americans of all backgrounds will be first in line for jobs as our economy reopens,"" Trump adds. ""As for amending it, extending it, that we can do at the appropriate time."" Here'sour story. The president also noted he disagreed ""strongly"" with Georgia Governor Brian Kemp, a fellow Republican, who has decided to reopen some non-essential businesses. ""I told the governor very simply I disagree,"" Trump says, noting ""safety has to predominate"" in reopening the states. ""I think spas and beauty salons and tattoo parlours and barber shops - in phase one [of reopening] is just too soon."" The president added: ""But at the same time I want him to do what he thinks is right.â Kemp, a Trump ally, on Monday announced Georgia would allow gyms, bowling alleys, nail salons and massage therapists to open on Friday. In-person church services can resume. Restaurants and cinemas can also open. His order also prohibited cities from imposing their own restrictions on businesses. ""It's been encouraging to watch states begin to open up, it's a beautiful thing to see,"" Trump says. ""I want to remind all Americans to adhere to our guidelines, very important,"" Trump adds. He goes on to say he wants the state governors ""to do what they think is best, but ideally they'll adhere"" to the administration's guidance. He reminds Americans to wash their hands, avoid close contact and wear a face covering in cases where social distancing is impractical. ""We don't want a rebound,"" Trump says. The president's reminder comes after weeks of anti-lockdown protests across the country. Protesters say the restrictions in states are an overreaction and have demanded governors reopen their economies. Democratic governors had requested the Trump administration remind Americans of the guidelines due to these demonstrations.  Trump asks Dr Deborah Birx, one of the taskforce experts, if there is a good chance that Covid-19 won't come back at all. Birx instead says it'll be easier to find it if it does. ""I think we are assured that the CDC is putting in place today what we are going to need in the fall so that we can stay in containment if, potentially, the virus comes back,"" she says. ""We're hoping that the flu infections also go down because people are much more aware of respiratory illnesses and how to protect themselves."" Trump says: ""And if it comes back, though, it won't be coming back in the form that it was. It will be coming back in smaller doses that we can contain. He says ""you could have some embers of corona"", but adds: ""We will not go through what we've been going through for the last two months."" ""It might not come back at all,"" he adds. Trump says recent comments from Centers for Disease Control (CDC) Director Dr Robert Redfield that a second Covid-19 wave could be even worse were ""inaccurate"". ""He was totally misquoted,"" Trump says. ""His whole purpose in making the statement was to get a flu shot."" Redfield joins Trump to clarify. He says he noted that next autumn ""could be more difficult, more complicated"" if influenza and Covid-19 were circulating at the same time. ""I think it's really important to emphasise what I didn't say,"" Redfield says. ""I didn't say this was going to be worse, I said it was going to be more difficult and potentially complicated. ""The issue that I was talking about being more difficult is we're going to have two viruses circulating at the same time."" Redfield says he was accurately quoted in the Washington Post, but takes issue with the headline, âCDC director warns second wave of coronavirus is likely to be even more devastatingâ. Here's what Redfield is quoted as saying by the Post: âThereâs a possibility that the assault of the virus on our nation next winter will actually be even more difficult than the one we just went through. ""Weâre going to have the flu epidemic and the coronavirus epidemic at the same time.â Trump tweeted about this earlier: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

RAF plane lands with PPE from TurkeyThe delayed flight arrived with about half of the promised protective kit for NHS staff.UKComments,"A delivery of personal protective equipment (PPE) from Turkey is being inspected, Downing Street said, following its late arrival in the UK. An RAF aircraft that landed at RAF Brize Norton on Wednesday morning is believed to have delivered up to about half of the promised kit. Other RAF planes were said to be on standby to collect the rest. The delivery was originally expected to arrive on Sunday, and had been due to include 400,000 surgical gowns. It is not clear exactly what supplies the flight contained and no clear reason was given for the delay. Fresh questions emerge over EU equipment claims Top civil servant 'wrong' about EU equipment claim Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? A spokesman for the prime minister said the consignment was being ""processed"" in line with standard procedure and will be moved ""on to the frontline as quickly as possible"". The RAF aircraft that flew the shipment, which left to pick up the delivery at around 17:00 BST on Monday, can carry about 40 tons of cargo - about half of the consignment. On Monday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the flight had been delayed by problems in Turkey. However, Turkey's ambassador to the UK, Umit Yalcin, said his government only learned about the deal with a private company on Sunday and insisted it had done everything to help. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The government remains under pressure for failing to supply enough PPE. On Monday, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents healthcare trusts across England - said that while the 400,000 gowns from Turkey would be welcome,NHS staff were getting through approximately 150,000 gowns a day. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, care minister Helen Whately said there was a global shortage of PPE and that some deliveries faced delays or did not turn up. ""The really important thing therefore is that we are working to secure an excess of supply to make sure that we, in due course, will have more than we need and at least what we need,"" she said. Helen Whately stressed the importance of reciprocal relationships with other countries over PPE Asked about reports that some PPE was being shipped from British warehouses to countries like Germany, Spain and Italy, she said there was an ""international market"" in PPE and stressed the importance of maintaining ""reciprocal working relationships"" with other countries. She added that the UK was a ""net importer of PPE"" and has been supplied ""many, many times over"" by China in return for equipment it sent at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan. The delivery from Turkey comes after a number of British companies told the BBC their offers to help had gone ignored. During the first virtual Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said some ""are now supplying other countries"" and therefore could have supplied the UK. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is acting as the prime minister's deputy while he recovers from coronavirus, said it was ""not quite right"" to assume that they must have been ""acceptable to UK standards just because they are supplying different needs in different countries abroad"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that offers go through a ""rigorous system of verifying"" because not all are credible, and it was important to ""focus on the biggest, most credible offers first"". He said the government was ""actively engaged"" with more than 1,000 companies who buy from abroad and was working with 159 potential manufacturers in the UK. The government has delivered more than one billion items of PPE since the start of the crisis, he added. Earlier, Ms Whately said that while some organisations which offered help already have established supply chains, others that have been set up in the past few days did not and might be unable to provide the standard of equipment required. The RAF plane was loaded in Turkey before flying back to the UK Shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth told the BBC Breakfast it ""doesn't matter"" if some firms could only make small quantities. ""We need everybody doing what they can as part of this national effort,"" he said. It was ""understandable"" that the government ""probably [hasn't] got enough resources"" to respond to all requests, he added. Meanwhile, the government is facingfresh questions over the the time it took to join an EU scheme to bulk buy medical equipment- including potentially life-saving ventilators, protective equipment and testing kit - that could be used to tackle the coronavirus.

UK inflation falls as social distancing takes hold,"The UK's inflation rate fell to 1.5% in March, largely driven by falls in the price of clothing and fuel ahead of the coronavirus lockdown. The Consumer Prices Index (CPI) fell from 1.7% in February,according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS).,external Clothing stores had offered more discounts as shoppers began staying at home, it said. Falling oil prices also resulted in cheaper petrol prices. Economists warn inflation could slide to 0.5% in 2020 as the economy shrinks. The ONS's latest data was collected on 17 March, just before lockdown started on 23 March. But its head of inflation, Mike Hardie, said there were already signs people were spending less in shops and more on necessities such as food. The agency said the average price of clothes and shoes fell 1.2% in the year to March 2020. It also said average petrol prices stood at 119.4 pence per litre during the month - the lowest seen since February 2019, while diesel stood at 123.8p The UK benchmark for oil has fallen to about $16 (Â£13) a barrelas economic activity has slowed. That is a fall of about 75% since the start of the year. Sarah Hewin, senior economist at Standard Chartered bank, told the BBC's Today programme: ""Normally low inflation would be welcomed as it means people have effectively more to spend in the shop but these are not normal circumstances. ""The fall in inflation, in addition to low energy prices, is an indication of the steep recession we will see in the coming months."" Meanwhile, Andrew Wishart at Capital Economics said: ""We suspect a larger fall in CPI inflation, from 1.5% to 0.9%, is in store for April as Ofgem [the regulator] lowers the cap on utility bills to reflect past falls in wholesale energy prices."" He added that falling employment, consumer caution and lower energy prices could pull inflation ""down to just 0.5% in the second half of this year"". CPI remains below the Bank of England's 2% target for inflation. Inflation is one of the main factors that the Bank of England's Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) considers when setting the ""base rate"". That influences what interest rate banks can charge people to borrow money, or what they pay on their savings. In an emergency move last month,Last month it cut ratesfrom 0.25% to 0.1% to support the economy in the face of the coronavirus pandemic. They are now at the lowest level in the Bank's 325-year history. New boss of the Bank of England Andrew Bailey has slashed interest rates to a new low It also said it would increase its holdings of UK government and corporate bonds by Â£200bn in an effort to lower the cost of borrowing. But Melissa Davies, chief economist at Redburn, said the Bank needs to go further: ""It will be a volatile ride for inflation over the next year, with negative numbers a possibility followed by a sharp reversal."" She added: ""More stimulus is needed, with only limited quantitative easing help from the Bank of England and the Treasury's lending guarantee scheme falling short. Even the furlough scheme is only delaying an inevitable and large spike in unemployment."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself?

"World risks 'biblical' famines due to pandemic - UNThe number of people facing starvation could almost double, the World Food Programme warns.World","Millions across the world already rely heavily on food aid to survive The world is at risk of widespread famines ""of biblical proportions"" caused by the coronavirus pandemic, the UN has warned. David Beasley, head of the World Food Programme (WFP), said urgent action was needed to avoid a catastrophe. A report estimates that the number suffering from hunger could go from 135 million to more than 250 million. Those most at risk are in 10 countries affected by conflict, economic crisis and climate change, the WFP says. The fourth annualGlobal Report on Food Crises,externalhighlights Yemen, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Afghanistan, Venezuela, Ethiopia, South Sudan, Sudan, Syria, Nigeria and Haiti. In South Sudan, 61% of the population was affected by food crisis last year, the report says. Even before the pandemic hit, parts of East Africa and South Asia were already facing severe food shortages caused by drought andthe worst locust infestations for decades. Yemen: World's biggest humanitarian emergency How a single locust becomes a plague Venezuela: The crisis forcing mothers to give away their babies Addressing the UN Security Council during a video conference, Mr Beasley said the world had to ""act wisely and act fast"". ""We could be facing multiple famines of biblical proportions within a short few months,"" he said. ""The truth is we do not have time on our side."" In a call to action, he added: ""I do believe that with our expertise and our partnerships, we can bring together the teams and the programmes necessary to make certain the Covid-19 pandemic does not become a human and food crisis catastrophe."" The WFP chief - who has just recovered from Covid-19 - began his Security Council briefing by saying ""excuse me for speaking bluntly."" There is no blunting what could happen in a world facing - even before this global health crisis - what David Beasley called the worst humanitarian catastrophe since the Second World War. In an interview, he also expressed fear that 30 million people, and possibly more, could die in a matter of months if the UN does not secure more funding and food. But this is also a world where donors are reeling from the steep financial cost of their own Covid-19 crises. Mr Beasley says no-one told him they would turn their back on the most vulnerable. But he admitted they would need to take stock at home first. He warned that chaos elsewhere could circle back around the world. His blunt warning: ""One way or another, the world will pay for this."" Better to work together, he says, on the basis of facts, not fear. The WFP's senior economist, Arif Husain, said the economic impact of the pandemic was potentially catastrophic for millions ""who are already hanging by a thread"". ""It is a hammer blow for millions more who can only eat if they earn a wage,"" he said in a statement. ""Lockdowns and global economic recession have already decimated their nest eggs. It only takes one more shock - like Covid-19 - to push them over the edge. We must collectively act now to mitigate the impact of this global catastrophe."" Earlier this month, this WFP said it was set to halve aid to parts of war-torn Yemen controlled by Houthi rebels due to a funding crisis. It said some donors had stopped their aid over concerns that deliveries were being obstructed by Houthi forces. The WFP feeds more than 12 million Yemenis a month, 80% of whom are in areas controlled by Houthi forces. Yemen confirmed its first case of Covid-19 earlier this month, with aid agencies warning that the disease could quickly overwhelm the country's weakened health systems.

"'First Ryanair agreed to a refund, then it didn't'","After his flight was cancelled, Steve Childs requested a refund Steve Childs was hoping to travel to Alicante to visit his father, but then the coronavirus outbreak ruined his plans. The 43-year-old from Wolverhampton was happy to follow advice not to fly, and Ryanair cancelled his flight as travel restrictions continued. He received an email confirming the cancellation, and followed the link to apply for the refund to which he was legally entitled. Then, ""out of the blue"", he received another message, not confirming his refund, but instead giving him a voucher worth the same amount to use on a future Ryanair flight. ""I'd been expecting a refund for a few weeks. When you know you are going to get the money, you make plans for it,"" he said. He understands the plight of airlines is perilous during this unprecedented crisis. They face a cashflow nightmare if they pay everyone's refund straight away, But the manner of his treatment left him ""frustrated"", he said. ""They turned around from saying I could have a refund, to saying it would be months,"" he said. If he wanted a refund, Ryanair told him, he must reapply, and the request would be placed in a queue ""until the Covid-19 emergency has passed"" - which suggests a very open-ended deadline. Consumer website Moneysavingexpert has made a formal complaint to the Civil Aviation Authority and Trading Standards about Ryanair's apparent policy. A Ryanair spokesman said: ""For any cancelled flight, Ryanair is giving customers all of the options set out under EU regulations, including refunds. ""The process time for cash refunds is taking longer due to the fact we are having to process 10,000 times the usual volume and have fewer staff available due to social distancing measures."" He added that vouchers and rebookings were quicker, as the processes were automated. Coronavirus: 'I don't want a flight voucher, where's my refund?' 'We're struggling to get a refund on our Â£17,000 chalet' Can I get a holiday refund and what are my travel rights? Mr Childs is far from alone. There has been a wave of complaints from air passengers and holidaymakers who, despite accepting their break had to be cancelled, have had enormous difficulty getting a refund in good time - or at all. Under EU law, travel companies must refund customers within 14 days if their package holiday is cancelled. The EU's Denied Boarding Regulations state that air passengers are due a refund within seven days if a flight with an airline based in the UK or EU, or from an airport in the UK or EU, is cancelled. However, the consumer organisation Which? has accused many of the UK's biggest airlines and travel companies of routinely breaking these laws. It said the travel industry's own estimates suggested Â£7bn of travellers' money was affected. This was cash that people, struggling themselves as a result of the economic impact of the pandemic, could not afford to go without. It found none of the 10 biggest travel companies were giving refunds in the legally specified timeframe, with some refusing refunds all together. Some smaller companies were managing to do so in full and on time. The same was true of the 10 biggest airlines, none of which were meeting the deadline. If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund to the original form of payment within seven days, although many airlines will be struggling to meet that deadline. You can accept, or refuse, vouchers or a rebooking but a voucher will probably be invalid if the airline later goes bust If you decide against going on a future flight, which is not yet cancelled, then there is no right to a refund. Different airlines have different rules over what you can do but many are waiving any charges for changing to a later flight or having a voucher instead. Your travel insurance may, or may not, cover you If you are trying to get home, the airline has a duty to get you back. However, with so many flights cancelled, this has become increasingly difficult. Now,the government has agreed to step inwhen needed to return those who are stranded If you are stuck in the EU and a UK or EU carrier is not rerouting or helping you, you should be able to come home on any airline you can and bill the original airline for the new ticket. The airline is legally obliged to get you home and they should be rerouting you themselves. If they are failing to do that, they are responsible for the cost of getting you home. But you should not cancel and accept a refund as this ends the airline's duty of care towards you and you won't be able to claim anything back. It is best to pay by credit card, for the back-up option to claim from your card provider If you have a package holiday, then a refund should be provided for the whole holiday within 14 days A spokesman for Abta, which represents travel companies and agents, said: ""The worldwide travel shutdown has led to a huge volume of holidays being affected. ""Many travel agents and tour operators are unable to provide immediate cash refunds because they have not yet received money back from airlines and hotels, so they need more than 14 days to process refund requests."" Airlines UK, which represents the UK aviation sector, said it faced a huge volume of refund claims to get through. It has been lobbying for airlines to be allowed to offer vouchers, not refunds, during the crisis, as is the case in some other countries. Which? said it did not want the travel industry to fail, but the burden of financial support should not be carried by struggling consumers. Travellers could choose to rebook if they wanted to, but should not be obliged to, it said. Instead, it argued that the government, the travel industry, insurers and regulators all had a responsibility to do more. Its RefundPassengers campaign has been trending on Twitter. It proposed a range of measures including an extension of the 14-day refund rule for package holidays to one month, and the introduction of a temporary government travel guarantee fund to support firms unable to fulfil their legal obligations. The Department for Business said: ""Companies have a legal obligation to ensure their consumers are fairly compensated.""

Cheaper clothes sees UK inflation fall to 1.5%,"The UK's inflation rate fell to 1.5% in March, largely driven by falls in the price of clothing and fuel ahead of the coronavirus lockdown.

"Tops in, trousers out as Boohoo lockdown sales boom","The Manchester-based company has seen sales pick up again this month Online fashion retailer Boohoo says it has found a new way of thriving in the coronavirus lockdown - by making people look good on video conference calls. The firm said it had seen a rise in sales of smart tops, as people working from home needed to keep up appearances on camera in front of their colleagues. The Manchester-based firm said demand for the items had contributed to a rise in sales during April. Other sought-after lines included hoodies and jogging wear. Announcing its latest financial results, Boohoo said it was seeing ""improved year-on-year growth of group sales during April"", although it declined to give figures. In the year to the end of February, the group, which includes PrettyLittle Thing and other brands, made pre-tax profits of Â£92.2m, up 54% on the previous 12 months. Trading in March had been ""mixed"" because of the coronavirus pandemic, but performance had improved in more recent weeks, it said. Boohoo shares rose 5.5% in morning trading on the news. A Boohoo spokesperson told the BBC: ""People aren't really buying going-out items, but they are buying homewear - hoodies, joggers, tracksuit bottoms. ""Sales of tops have gone up in particular, with everyone wanting to look smart on Zoom calls."" Not all of Boohoo's products have been as well received. On Monday, the firm apologised after its range of fashion face masks caused an outcry. The Â£5 masks came with messagessuch as ""Eat, sleep, isolate, repeat"" or ""If you can read this, you are too close"". Boohoo said it was ""very sorry for any upset"" and removed the masks from sale. It insisted they were not designed for ""protection"".

"Earth Day: Don't forget 'deeper emergency', says UN chief","Despite the impacts of the coronavirus pandemic, the world mustn't forget the ""deeper environmental emergency"" facing the planet. That's the view of the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, in remarks released to celebrate Earth Day. The toll taken by the virus is both ""immediate and dreadful"", Mr Guterres says. But the crisis is also a wake-up call, ""to do things right for the future,"" said the Secretary General. Coronavirus outbreak 'greatest test since WW2' Blue skies pushed Greenland 'into the red' Trump's WHO de-funding 'as dangerous as it sounds' Mr Guterres re-iterated his view that the coronavirus is the biggest challenge the world has faced since the Second World War. But as the world commemoratesthe 50th anniversary of Earth Day,external, the planet's ""unfolding environmental crisis"" is an ""even deeper emergency"", he says. UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres ""Biodiversity is in steep decline,"" Mr Guterres stated. ""Climate disruption is approaching a point of no return. ""We must act decisively to protect our planet from both the coronavirus and the existential threat of climate disruption."" A long-term advocate of strong action to tackle global heating, Mr Guterres is now proposing six climate-related actions that should shape the recovery after the virus. The world has to deliver new jobs and businesses through a ""clean, green transition"". Taxpayers' money, when it is used, ""needs to be tied to achieving green jobs and sustainable growth"". Money must be used to make people and societies more resilient to climate change, he says. ""Public funds should be used to invest in the future not the past."" Fossil fuel subsidies from governments is a theme that Mr Guterres has highlighted many times. These must end he says, and polluters must pay for their pollution. The world will need to work together, says the Secretary General, and climate risks will need to be factored into the financial system and be at the heart of all public policy. The drought hitting central Chile is making the problems of coping with Covid-19 worse The links between climate change and the coronavirus have also been highlighted by many observers and experts in the field. ""While the pandemic will lead to a temporary dip in global greenhouse gas emissions, this must not distract from the urgent need for rapid fundamental changes in infrastructure, energy, land use and industrial systems to set us on a path to net zero emissions globally by 2050 at the latest,"" said Andrew Norton, director of the International Institute for Environment and Development (IIED). ""Land use change and deforestation are primary global drivers of biodiversity destruction. They heighten the risk of further pandemics by bringing humans into contact with new threats such as the coronavirus.  Every species lost is an irreversible event that decreases the resilience of natural and human systems on a permanent basis."" Tropical cyclone Harold recently caused havoc in places like Vanuatu On the 50th anniversary of Earth Day, which was first established on April 22 1970, many researchers are keen to highlight how the threats to the planet have grown over time. ""The Covid-19 pandemic is a reminder that our existence on Earth is fragile,"" said Dr Karen O'Neill, from Rutgers University in the US. ""Environmentalism since that first Earth Day has expanded to recognise links between human health and ecosystems."" ""Degraded environments and pollution make us more likely to encounter novel viruses and to be more vulnerable to those viruses when they start to circulate.""

Supermarkets 'to face day of reckoning' on wages,"Supermarket and shop workers deserve to be paid a minimum of Â£10 an hour after coronavirus, a union leader has argued. Paddy Lillis, of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), said retail ""heroes"" should be rewarded for risking their health to keep people ""fed and watered"". He predicted a post-crisis ""day of reckoning"" on pay and conditions. But the British Retail Consortium said now was ""not the right time"" to ask for a wage increase. It added that, across the retail sector, footfall - the number of people visiting shops - had suffered its ""worst ever decline"" in March. The government thanked ""all those working tirelessly in our supermarkets to make sure the public can continue to access essential goods"". New supermarket workers share their stories Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food Primark goes from Â£650m sales a month to nothing Theaverage hourly wage for UK sales and customer services,externalworkers is Â£9.77, according to the latest Office for National Statistics data. The figure is Â£15.26 across all professions and the national minimum wage for workers over the age of 25 is Â£8.72 per hour. ""Retail workers don't get the respect they deserve,"" said Mr Lillis. ""It's always been seen by government and local authorities and, dare I say it, even customers, that it's a job you do until you get a 'real job'. ""And I think there's a day of reckoning at the end of this, where there has to be a real recognition that these low-paid workers need to be looked after and given at least Â£10 an hour - that's a living wage, basically."" Queues to get into supermarkets have become a common sight While""non-essential"" retailers have been forced to close stores,externalbecause of coronavirus, supermarkets and convenience shops have remained open. Social distancing has changed the way they operate, however, with staff and customers being told to stay at least two metres apart while inside and queuing to get in. But unions have raised concerns thatrules are not always being followed,externaland haveasked for more personal protective equipment (PPE),externalto be provided. Mr Lillis told the BBC he had been assured that more PPE, including masks, was on its way. But he said self-service checkout areas - where customers are funnelled through a narrow area and may require assistance with scanning and payment - remained a particular concern. ""Supermarket staff aren't quite like medical workers, in that they haven't got to touch people to do their job,"" he said. ""But because of the movements of people, they're bound to come into near contact with people quite frequently."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:How to self-isolate and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health Workers including till operators and shelf-stackers were suffering ""anxiety and stress"", Mr Lillis said, while Usdaw had lost ""a few of our members in the last week through coronavirus"". ""Retail workers are out there at the sharp end,"" he added. ""I call them the beating heart of communities. They're out there making sure people get fed and watered, and that's an essential service."" Usdaw, which has more than 420,000 members, is surveying shop staff about their experiences with customers. Of the 7,500 to have responded so far, around 250 have described being physically assaulted. The coronavirus lockdown has been in place for almost a month and, every Thursday evening, millions of people in the UK have taken to pavements, balconies and windows to applaud the efforts of NHS staff. Mr Lillis said he did not think this or a similar tribute was necessary for shop staff and other non-NHS key workers, adding: ""There's no point in telling them that they're wonderful and they're heroes if they haven't got the money to provide for the families."" Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""In recent years retailers have worked hard to increase pay, with many going beyond the legal requirement and extending the National Living Wage rate to staff aged under 25. ""However, with many retailers struggling to maintain viability in the face of the continued crisis, it is not the right time to be adding even greater pressure to an industry that already operates on very fine margins."" A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring that every worker is fairly rewarded for their contribution to the economy. ""This year's increase to the National Living Wage means that we will be putting an additional Â£930 into the pockets of 2.4 million of the UK's lowest-paid workers this year.""

"US immigration green cards to be halted, Trump says","President Trump says the measure was needed to protect American jobs President Donald Trump has said he will halt applications of foreign nationals seeking permanent residence in the US because of the coronavirus crisis. A day after he announced the move in an ambiguous tweet, Mr Trump said the measure would protect American jobs. It is not clear how effective it will be as most visa services have already been suspended because of the outbreak. Critics say he is trying to distract attention away from his response to the virus. The US has nearly 45,000 deaths. Democrats also accuse the administration of using the pandemic to crack down on immigration. The issue has traditionally been a strong campaigning theme for Mr Trump, a Republican, but has taken a back seat during the crisis and in the lead-up to the November election. At a White House coronavirus briefing, Mr Trump said the ban could be extended ""much longer"" depending on how the economy was doing, he said. Follow our live updates from around the world After vowing to suspend ""all immigration"" to the US on Monday night, Mr Trump apparently changed his original plan after a backlash from some business leaders. It would reportedly impact immigrants given temporary working visas, like farm labourers and hi-tech employees. On Wednesday, the president wrote on Twitter that he would be signing an executive order ""prohibiting immigration"" later in the day. Allow Twitter content?

More than 20 million Americans have lost their jobs amid the coronavirus outbreak, and the president said the government had a ""solemn duty"" to ensure they regain their jobs. ""It would be wrong and unjust for Americans laid off by the virus to be replaced with new immigrant labour flown in from abroad,"" he said, adding that there could be some exemptions to the measure. This video can not be played ""We first must take care of the American worker,"" says President Trump ""We want to protect our US workers and I think as we move forward we will become more and more protective of them"". Mr Trump's order could spark legal challenges. The US has the highest number of confirmed cases of coronavirus in the world - more than 820,000 - according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. They give immigrants legal permanent residence and the opportunity to apply for American citizenship In a typical year, nearly one million green cards are issued in the US The majority - roughly 70% - go to those with relatives living in the US, according to a 2018 report from the US Senate For employment-based green cards, a common form of the residency status, roughly 80% are issued to those already in the country, shifting from a temporary visa to permanent residence Details of Donald Trump's ""immigration ban"" have emerged, and it turns out the proposal is not as sweeping as his tweet originally suggested. The 60-day hold applies only to permanent residents, not temporary workers. That means the public health rationale for the move is even more tenuous, however. Screening immigrants for the virus would appear to be just as effective as a total halt. As many suspected, the primary justification is economic. In the president's view, permanent workers compete with US citizens for jobs - and in a financial crisis, their presence is neither needed nor desired. Many economists will be quick to disagree, arguing that the benefits of immigration outweigh the costs. That is a public policy debate President Trump will be happy to have, however. There is also the very real possibility that the order will become bogged down in the courts - a fate that befell the president's immigration orders made in the early days of his presidency. Although the administration ultimately prevailed, those battles took time. And the end of Mr Trump's first term at this point is measured in months, not years. The president could be betting, however, that his base will appreciate the effort - and deliver another four years for him in November. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise HOPE AND LOSS:Your coronavirus stories VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash STRESS:How to look after your mental health Ali Noorani, of the National Immigration Forum, said ""immigrants account for 17% of healthcare workers and 24% of direct care workers "" in the US. ""It is unfortunate the president would rather scapegoat the other than building a consensus that helps all of through this crisis,"" he wrote on Twitter. American Civil Liberties Union's immigration expert Andrea Flores wrote: ""Xenophobia is not a public health response."" However, Thomas Homan, the president's former acting director of US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, said it made ""sense"" and would keep jobs for unemployed Americans. While such a move would usually affect millions, travel bans to prevent the spread of Covid-19 have already effectively halted immigration, making some question how much of a difference this will really make. ""The embassies are not open anyway, so this is like nothing new,"" Carl Shusterman, who has practiced immigration law since the 1970s,was quoted by Associated Press news agency as saying.,external ""This announcement doesn't really change anything unless the embassies were to open up next week or in the next 60 days.""

RAF plane lands with PPE from TurkeyThe delayed flight arrived with about half of the promised protective kit for NHS staff.UK,"A delivery of personal protective equipment (PPE) from Turkey is being inspected, Downing Street said, following its late arrival in the UK. An RAF aircraft that landed at RAF Brize Norton on Wednesday morning is believed to have delivered up to about half of the promised kit. Other RAF planes were said to be on standby to collect the rest. The delivery was originally expected to arrive on Sunday, and had been due to include 400,000 surgical gowns. It is not clear exactly what supplies the flight contained and no clear reason was given for the delay. Fresh questions emerge over EU equipment claims Top civil servant 'wrong' about EU equipment claim Are NHS staff getting enough protective gear? A spokesman for the prime minister said the consignment was being ""processed"" in line with standard procedure and will be moved ""on to the frontline as quickly as possible"". The RAF aircraft that flew the shipment, which left to pick up the delivery at around 17:00 BST on Monday, can carry about 40 tons of cargo - about half of the consignment. On Monday, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said the flight had been delayed by problems in Turkey. However, Turkey's ambassador to the UK, Umit Yalcin, said his government only learned about the deal with a private company on Sunday and insisted it had done everything to help. A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:The rules on self-isolation and exercise WHAT WE DON'T KNOWHow to understand the death toll TESTING:Can I get tested for coronavirus? LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area The government remains under pressure for failing to supply enough PPE. On Monday, Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers - which represents healthcare trusts across England - said that while the 400,000 gowns from Turkey would be welcome,NHS staff were getting through approximately 150,000 gowns a day. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, care minister Helen Whately said there was a global shortage of PPE and that some deliveries faced delays or did not turn up. ""The really important thing therefore is that we are working to secure an excess of supply to make sure that we, in due course, will have more than we need and at least what we need,"" she said. Helen Whately stressed the importance of reciprocal relationships with other countries over PPE Asked about reports that some PPE was being shipped from British warehouses to countries like Germany, Spain and Italy, she said there was an ""international market"" in PPE and stressed the importance of maintaining ""reciprocal working relationships"" with other countries. She added that the UK was a ""net importer of PPE"" and has been supplied ""many, many times over"" by China in return for equipment it sent at the peak of the epidemic in Wuhan. The delivery from Turkey comes after a number of British companies told the BBC their offers to help had gone ignored. During the first virtual Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said some ""are now supplying other countries"" and therefore could have supplied the UK. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab, who is acting as the prime minister's deputy while he recovers from coronavirus, said it was ""not quite right"" to assume that they must have been ""acceptable to UK standards just because they are supplying different needs in different countries abroad"". Health Secretary Matt Hancock told MPs that offers go through a ""rigorous system of verifying"" because not all are credible, and it was important to ""focus on the biggest, most credible offers first"". He said the government was ""actively engaged"" with more than 1,000 companies who buy from abroad and was working with 159 potential manufacturers in the UK. The government has delivered more than one billion items of PPE since the start of the crisis, he added. Earlier, Ms Whately said that while some organisations which offered help already have established supply chains, others that have been set up in the past few days did not and might be unable to provide the standard of equipment required.

"Supermarkets 'to face day of reckoning' on wagesStaff risking their health to serve the public should get more pay and respect, a union boss says.UK Politics","Supermarket and shop workers deserve to be paid a minimum of Â£10 an hour after coronavirus, a union leader has argued. Paddy Lillis, of the Union of Shop, Distributive and Allied Workers (Usdaw), said retail ""heroes"" should be rewarded for risking their health to keep people ""fed and watered"". He predicted a post-crisis ""day of reckoning"" on pay and conditions. But the British Retail Consortium said now was ""not the right time"" to ask for a wage increase. It added that, across the retail sector, footfall - the number of people visiting shops - had suffered its ""worst ever decline"" in March. The government thanked ""all those working tirelessly in our supermarkets to make sure the public can continue to access essential goods"". New supermarket workers share their stories Tesco tells people to visit stores to get food Primark goes from Â£650m sales a month to nothing Theaverage hourly wage for UK sales and customer services,externalworkers is Â£9.77, according to the latest Office for National Statistics data. The figure is Â£15.26 across all professions and the national minimum wage for workers over the age of 25 is Â£8.72 per hour. ""Retail workers don't get the respect they deserve,"" said Mr Lillis. ""It's always been seen by government and local authorities and, dare I say it, even customers, that it's a job you do until you get a 'real job'. ""And I think there's a day of reckoning at the end of this, where there has to be a real recognition that these low-paid workers need to be looked after and given at least Â£10 an hour - that's a living wage, basically."" Queues to get into supermarkets have become a common sight While""non-essential"" retailers have been forced to close stores,externalbecause of coronavirus, supermarkets and convenience shops have remained open. Social distancing has changed the way they operate, however, with staff and customers being told to stay at least two metres apart while inside and queuing to get in. But unions have raised concerns thatrules are not always being followed,externaland haveasked for more personal protective equipment (PPE),externalto be provided. Mr Lillis told the BBC he had been assured that more PPE, including masks, was on its way. But he said self-service checkout areas - where customers are funnelled through a narrow area and may require assistance with scanning and payment - remained a particular concern. ""Supermarket staff aren't quite like medical workers, in that they haven't got to touch people to do their job,"" he said. ""But because of the movements of people, they're bound to come into near contact with people quite frequently."" A SIMPLE GUIDE:How do I protect myself? AVOIDING CONTACT:How to self-isolate and exercise LOOK-UP TOOL:Check cases in your area MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak STRESS:How to look after your mental health Workers including till operators and shelf-stackers were suffering ""anxiety and stress"", Mr Lillis said, while Usdaw had lost ""a few of our members in the last week through coronavirus"". ""Retail workers are out there at the sharp end,"" he added. ""I call them the beating heart of communities. They're out there making sure people get fed and watered, and that's an essential service."" Usdaw, which has more than 420,000 members, is surveying shop staff about their experiences with customers. Of the 7,500 to have responded so far, around 250 have described being physically assaulted. The coronavirus lockdown has been in place for almost a month and, every Thursday evening, millions of people in the UK have taken to pavements, balconies and windows to applaud the efforts of NHS staff. Mr Lillis said he did not think this or a similar tribute was necessary for shop staff and other non-NHS key workers, adding: ""There's no point in telling them that they're wonderful and they're heroes if they haven't got the money to provide for the families."" Tom Ironside, director of business and regulation at the British Retail Consortium, said: ""In recent years retailers have worked hard to increase pay, with many going beyond the legal requirement and extending the National Living Wage rate to staff aged under 25. ""However, with many retailers struggling to maintain viability in the face of the continued crisis, it is not the right time to be adding even greater pressure to an industry that already operates on very fine margins."" A Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy spokesperson said: ""We are committed to ensuring that every worker is fairly rewarded for their contribution to the economy. ""This year's increase to the National Living Wage means that we will be putting an additional Â£930 into the pockets of 2.4 million of the UK's lowest-paid workers this year.""

Staff at Morriston Hospital have paid tribute to Jenelyn Carter, who died after contracting coronavirus. Swansea Bay health board said she was a ""lovely, caring"" healthcare assistant who worked on admissions. Nurse director Mark Madams said she had a ""heart of gold"" and ""would go the extra mile for anyone"". ""We are devastated by her death and offer our sincere condolences to her family and friends,"" he said in a Facebook message. Staff paid tribute on Wednesday. It is""unrealistic"" to expect normal life to return soon, says the government's chief medical adviser. Prof Chris Whitty says the UK will have to live with some disruptive social measures for at least the rest of the year. He says ""in the long run"" the ideal way out would be via a ""highly effective vaccine"" or drugs to treat the disease. But he warns that the chance of having those within the next calendar year was ""incredibly small"". Former Cardiff City manager Jimmy Goodfellow has died aged 76. He played for Port Vale, Workington, Rotherham United and Stockport County before retiring in 1979. Goodfellowbegan his coaching career with Newport Countyas assistant to Len Ashurst and followed him to Cardiff in 1982. He was named joint caretaker manager of the Bluebirds in 1984 before becoming permanent boss for a short spell during the 1984-85 campaign. The first minister says a team has been set up to investigate why people from BAME backgrounds are disproportionately affected by Covid-19.

MPs have been putting questions to ministers over video link The House of Commons has agreed that MPs will be able tovote from homeduring the coronavirus pandemic. A new digital voting system has been developed but there are concerns that it is not yet robust enough. Some MPs expressed concern about the ability to verify who is voting and the alerts letting MPs know when it's time to vote. The Commons leader, Jacob Rees-Mogg, insisted the arrangements would be temporary. He also agreed not to hold any votes until after theProcedure Committee,externalhas reported on the system. However votes will not be held until the Procedure Committee has reported on the proposed system. Local Democracy Reporting Service A barman from Swansea is serving his community in a different way after setting up a Facebook group as the coronavirus pandemic loomed. Patrick Mulder said he didnât expect it to blossom into a support network manned by 185 volunteers throughout the Sketty area. They not only deliver food and prescriptions but arrange memorable moments, including for one Swansea City supporter who is self-isolating with multiple sclerosis. Mr Mulder said: âThe father couldnât visit him and they were both understandably distressed. âHe told us that his son was a big Swansea City fan, and within hours the manager, Steve Cooper, rang him."" Other deliveries have included musical instruments to help people pass the time at home, and a fridge for an NHS worker staying in a hotel to store their insulin medication in. Mr Mulder set up the Sketty Community Outreach Group on 15 March, eight days before the lockdown started. On 21 March, the newly-formed group had 3,500 leaflets printed at Geoffâs Print Shop, Tycoch, and then delivered them around the area. âThat ignited the touch paper and the group has been growing steadily ever since,â said Mr Mulder. Part of its success, he said, was due to Swansea Council local area coordinators Tara Hughes and Ben Davies-Thompson, who have set up a âstreet championâ scheme to match people in need with their nearest volunteer. Rubble, wrecked furniture and hundreds of tyres are among the items which have been dumped near Newport. Fly-tipping in Coedkernew has been a problem for some timebut it has become worse in recent weeks, it is claimed. The ClearWaste app said it had received an 88% increase in tipping reports in Wales since the coronavirus lockdown. Newport councillor Allan Morris said the closure of council tips was a factor but blamed ""unscrupulous"" fly-tippers taking advantage of ""fewer eyes"". He believes the authority's waste sites would ""ideally"" be open, but could not criticise the council for wanting to protect staff.

A Welsh minister has written to council leaders to advise them on how to ensure some second-home owners cannot use a ""loophole"" to claim Â£10,000 grants intended for small businesses. Five councils wrote to the Welsh Government last weekcalling for changes to advice so owners of second homes who pay business rates rather than council tax cannot apply for the grants as part ofa Â£1.1bn Welsh Government package. The Welsh Government had said councils can ask for more evidence from claimants, but it has now issued fresh advice. In a letter to assembly members, Housing Minister Julie James says more than 36,000 grants have been awarded to businesses totalling Â£456.6m. And she outlines how the guidance has been changed: Anglesey council, one of the local authorities which had called for changes, said it would not be able to issue grants to self-catering accommodation businesses immediately while it completed the new checks.

Gareth Bale and his wife Emma have been praised after donating Â£500,000 to the charitable arm of Cardiff and Vale University Health Board. The Cardiff & Vale Health Charity saidit was the couple's wishthat the money is used on ""the response to Covid-19"". The charity said the money will provide ""those extras for staff and patients that normal NHS funding doesn't provide"", during the pandemic. CVUHB chief executive Len Richards said the donation was ""fantastic"". The charity added in a statement: ""They wanted to give something back to their local NHS as Gareth himself was born in the UHW (University Hospital of Wales) maternity unit, and they say UHW have provided many services to themselves and their family and friends.""

The deadline for installing 65 electric vehicle charging points across Gwent has been missed because of the coronavirus pandemic. The original deadline for the area's five councils - Blaenau Gwent, Momouthshire, Newport, Caerphilly and Torfaen - to install the points across the region was 31 March. However, contractors Silverstone Green Energy stopped work after the lockdown was announced on 24 March. The councils had been given a combined Â£459,000 from the UK governmentâs Office for Low Emission Vehicles to install 65 points â but now they have been allowed to complete this work later. It is not yet known when the charging points will be installed and ready for use.
