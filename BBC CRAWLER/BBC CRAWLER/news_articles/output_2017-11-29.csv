Apple apologises and fixes security flaw,"Macbooks running the latest software will automatically be updated Apple has pushed out an update to fix a major security hole in its Mac operating system, admitting it âstumbledâ with its latest software. The flaw,revealed on Tuesday, made it possible to access a Mac without a password, and also have access to powerful administrator rights. The latest version of MacOS will automatically download the update. ""We greatly regret this error and we apologise to all Mac users,â the firm said. ""When our security engineers became aware of the issue Tuesday afternoon, we immediately began working on an update that closes the security hole. ""This morning, as of 8am PT, the update is available for download, and starting later today it will be automatically installed on all systems running the latest version (10.13.1) of MacOS High Sierra.â It is only second time Apple has forcibly updated usersâ machines and comes in response to widespread concern that millions of Mac computers were at risk. Users running older versions of MacOS will see a notification prompting an upgrade. ""Security is a top priority for every Apple product,â the company said. âAnd regrettably we stumbled with this release of MacOS.â It added: ""Our customers deserve better. We are auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again.â Attention is now turning to the way in which the bug was made public. The story hit headlines after the flaw was tweeted by Lemi Ergin, a self-described ""software craftsman"". He was criticised for not adhering to ""responsible disclosure"" guidelines in security research, whereby companies are given a reasonable amount of time to fix a flaw before it is made public. However, after coming for criticism for tweeting the vulnerability, Mr Ergin publisheda post on Medium defending his decision,external. ""I am neither a hacker, nor a security specialist,"" he wrote. ""I solely focus on secure coding practices while programming, but I can never call myself a security specialist."" He said his colleagues at payments firm Iyzico informed Apple about the flaw on 23 November. It had previously been discussed on open Apple support forums on 13 November - though the user described the issue more like a feature than a serious bug. Apple's own statement on Wednesday said the company's security team were not made aware of the problem until 28 November - though it is not clear if another department at the company was aware. The BBC has contacted Apple for clarification.

Disability plan 'will help a million work',"Plans to get one million more disabled people in work over the next 10 years have been set out by the government. Ministers say the new strategy will help those with disabilities keep their jobs and progress in their careers. The new measures include widening the number of people who can issue fitness-to-work notices and additional training for mental health professionals. Labour's Debbie Abrahams said benefit cuts had already pushed more disabled people towards poverty. The pledge comes afterONS figures from June 2017,externalsuggested that disabled people were twice as likely to be unemployed as non-disabled people. About 80% of non-disabled people are in work compared with just under 50% of disabled people. Disabled people 'losing out on jobs' over Access to Work cap Disability assessors 'lack right skills' - BBC News Call to end workplace discrimination Prime Minister Theresa May said a person's life and career ""should not be dictated by their disability or health condition"". ""Everyone deserves the chance to find a job that's right for them,"" she added. ""I am committed to tackling the injustices facing disabled people who want to work, so that everyone can go as far as their talents will take them."" The government says in the past four years 600,000 disabled people have found work. However, the disability charity Scope says progress is too slow. The new strategy includes: Measures to provide access to personalised support for those with mental health issue Extending ""fit note"" certification - which details how a condition affects someone's ability to work - beyond GPs to a wider group of healthcare professionals, including physiotherapists, psychiatrists and senior nurses Reform statutory sick pay The 10-year plan builds on a green paper published last year which pledged to halve the so-called disability employment gap. The government hopes the changes to the fit note system will improve the identification of health conditions and treatments to help workers get back to work quickly. But some disability activists say the problem lies in employers' attitudes. Mik Scarlet, an inclusion specialist, says he chose to be self-employed after some ""disastrous attempts"" at getting work. ""Employers have little idea of how beneficial disabled employees can be to a workforce,"" he said. ""They also don't understand that creating flexible inclusive work systems improves the working environment for all."" BBC disability correspondent Nikki Fox said it was not the first time the government had pledged to get more disabled people into work. However, she said ""the employment gap between disabled and non-disabled people has not significantly changed for some years"". Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary, Ms Abrahams, warned the government's plans ""hinted at"" further cuts. ""The Tories' cuts to social security support are pushing more and more disabled people into poverty,"" she said. ""The Tories have already hit disabled people who are not fit for work but who may be in the future in the work related activity group. ""I hope they are not going to now target the most disabled people in the support group, as their green paper hinted at.""

Court backs claim for 13 years holiday pay,"A UK window salesman who did not receive a paid holiday for 13 years has been backed at the European Court of Justice in his landmark legal battle. Conley King worked for a sash window firm on a self-employed basis, but was later found to have workers' rights. In a closely-watched case, theEU court ruled Mr King was also entitled to his untaken leave,externalat the company. Legal analysts said the decision could have significant implications for firms in the so-called gig economy. Mr King worked as a commission-based salesman for The Sash Window Workshop between 1999 and 2012. After he was dismissed from the firm, a UK tribunal ruled that Mr King should have been classified as a worker. Call for crackdown on gig economy What is the gig economy? He also brought a claim for Â£27,000 of holiday pay he says he should have received. The Sash Window Workshop said Mr King worked ""as a self-employed salesman under an arrangement that suited him"". ""We would like to reiterate that at no point was he prevented by us from taking any time off for holiday or otherwise, as there was no requirement for him to request it or for us to agree to it,"" the company said. The case now returns to the UK Court of Appeal for a further ruling. Mr King was a commission-based salesman for a sash windows firm The European court was asked to decide whether EU law allowed him to claim payment for the entire length of his employment. It decided there was no time limit for his claim, a decision which lawyers said opens the door for similar cases. ""An employer that does not allow a worker to exercise his right to paid annual leave must bear the consequences,"" the court ruled. Legal experts said the decision meant companies which routinely use staff on self-employed contracts - such as taxi or delivery firms - could face potentially huge liabilities if that status is later challenged. James Williams, the barrister who represented Mr King, said it left employers who have miscategorised workers as self-employed, liable for back holiday pay when the workers' employment is terminated. The head of the IWGB trade union, Dr Moyer-Lee, said the ""bombshell judgement"" was a ""game changer for the so-called 'gig economy'"". ""The law is now recognising the massive unpaid debt of 'gig economy' companies to their workers and IWGB members will be coming to collect."" In the gig economy, instead of a regular wage, workers get paid for the ""gigs"" they do, such as a food delivery or a car journey. In the UK, it is estimated that one million people are employed in this type of capacity. Jobs include couriers, ride-hailing drivers andvideo producers. Workers in the gig economy are classed as independent contractors. That means they have no protection against unfair dismissal, no right to redundancy payments, and no right to receive the national minimum wage, paid holiday or sickness pay.

Garrison Keillor fired over 'misconduct',"US author and radio host Garrison Keillor has been fired from his radio station amid a claim of misconduct. Minnesota Public Radio (MPR) said a colleague on Keillor's former show, A Prairie Home Companion, had accused him of inappropriate behaviour. Mr Keillor told the Minneapolis Star Tribune that the claim stems from an occasion when he put his hand on a woman's bare back to console her. The station said it did not know of any allegations involving any other staff. ""I meant to pat her back after she told me about her unhappiness, and her shirt was open and my hand went up it about six inches [15 cm]"",he told the newspaper in an email,external. ""She recoiled. I apologised. I sent her an email of apology later and she replied that she had forgiven me and not to think about it,"" he added. ""We were friends. We continued to be friendly right up until her lawyer called."" He did not say when the alleged incident occurred. MPR said it would: end its contracts with Mr Keillor and his companies stop broadcasting his syndicated show The Writer's Almanac stop rebroadcasting highlights from A Prairie Home Companion change that programme's name separate from an online catalogue and website associated with him MPR President Jon McTaggart said: ""Garrison Keillor has been an important part of the growth and success of MPR, and all of us in the MPR community are saddened by these circumstances. ""While we appreciate the contributions Garrison has made to MPR and to all of public radio, we believe this decision is the right thing to do and is necessary to continue to earn the trust of our audiences, employees and supporters of our public service."" Why so many sexual harassment cases in US, not UK? NBC sacks star Today Show host over sex allegation Mr Keillor hosted A Prairie Home Companion - a variety show with a focus on the fictional town of Lake Wobegon - for 42 years. He went on to become a prolific author, writing a series of books set in Lake Wobegon, as well as other fiction and poetry. He also wrote opinion columns in the Washington Post. On Wednesday he wrote a column saying there was no reason for Senator Al Franken, who is accused of sexual misconduct and was photographed groping a sleeping broadcaster, to resign. Should sexual harassment be a criminal offence? Creating a safe workplace for women in the post-MeToo era After the announcement of his firing, Mr Keillor told the Star Tribune he was ""was the least physically affectionate person"" at his office. ""If I had a dollar for every woman who asked to take a selfie with me and who slipped an arm around me and let it drift down below the beltline, I'd have at least a hundred dollars,"" the radio presenter said. ""So this is poetic irony of a high order. But I'm just fine. I had a good long run and am grateful for it and for everything else.""

Donald Trump retweets far-right videos,"This video can not be played The White House says Trump's Britain First tweets were about border security Donald Trump has retweeted three inflammatory videos from a British far-right group. The first tweet from Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, claims to show a Muslim migrant attacking a man on crutches. This was followed by two more videos of people Ms Fransen claims to be Muslim. Responding to Mr Trump's posts, UK Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said it was ""wrong for the president to have done this"". White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mrs May and other world leaders knew that ""these are real threats that we have to talk about"". ""Whether it's a real video, the threat is real,"" she said. The original video was shared by US conservative commentator Ann Coulter who Mr Trump follows. Trump wrong to share far-right videos - UK PM Why is Britain First big online? What do the videos Trump retweeted actually show? The first video purportedly shows a ""Muslim migrant"" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches. However, the claim in this tweet appears to have little substance. A spokesperson from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service told the BBC that the person arrested for the attack ""was born and raised in the Netherlands"" and was not a migrant, as claimed in the social media post.

The third video originates from the riots that took place in Egypt in 2013, and shows a man being pushed from the top of a building in Alexandria. In 2015, those involved in the the incident were prosecuted, and one man was executed. Read more about the videos here. The tweets were flagged as containing sensitive material by Twitter Britain First was founded in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP). The group has grabbed attention on social media with controversial posts about what they deem ""the Islamification of the UK"". It has put up members to run in European elections and by-elections on anti-immigration and anti-abortion policies, but has not secured any seats. It also contested the most recent London mayoral election, receiving 1.2% of the vote. But its social media strategy has made it much more successful online than at the ballot box. The party has nearly 2 million likes on Facebook - dwarfing the main UK political parties. Ms Fransen, the group's deputy leader, has been charged with using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour""during speeches she made in Belfast. She will appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Thursday 14 December. You can read more about Britain First here. Jayda Fransen has more than 52,000 followers on Twitter Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America Reporter Donald Trump is once again using Twitter to weigh in on contentious religious-tinged political issues in the UK. In the past, he accused London Mayor Sadiq Khan of mishandling a militant attack just hours after it occurred. He misattributed a rise in crime in England and Wales to the ""spread of radical Islamic terror"". Now, he has retweeted a series of unverified videos posted by a far-right British nationalist group. For the president, directing attention toward the UK seems to serve a domestic political purpose. He cites events and opinions there as a warning to Americans of what could happen in the US if they do not heed his policy prescriptions on immigration and border security. The Muslim ban, the US-Mexico wall, increased deportations, the sharp reductions on refugee resettlement - it's all part of the president's ""national security"" package. While most Americans probably haven't heard of Britain First and are unfamiliar with European radical nationalist movements, there are white supremacist groups in the US that follow the actions of these overseas operations quite closely. The president on Wednesday signalled that he watches them too. Read more from Anthony Zurcher here. Mr Trump's decision to retweet the videos met with dismay on social media. Brendan Cox, whose wife, British MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a right-wing extremist who shouted ""Britain first"" before committing the act, has condemned the action. Allow Twitter content?

What Trump team has said about Islam,"Does Donald Trump believe Islam is a religion? It was a straightforward question, asked of Sebastian Gorka, deputy assistant to the president, during aradio interview,externallast week. His answer was anything but straightforward, however. ""It's not a discussion about Islam as a religion or not a religion,"" he replied. ""It's about radical Islamic terrorism. We are prepared to be honest about the threat. We're not going to white it out, delete it as the Obama administration did."" But is it a religion? ""I think you should ask him that question,"" Gorka continued. ""But I would say that's really a misreading of everything he's said over the last 18 months."" A closer look at Mr Trump's comments over the last year and a half only complicates the matter, however - as do the views of the advisers closest to the new president. Mr Trump has repeatedly warned of the dangers of ""radical Islamic terrorism"" - a line viewed as a direct rebuke of Barack Obama, who while president had pointedly refused to use the term. He slammed Mr Obama and Hillary Clinton for being ""founders"" of the so-called Islamic State. He publicly feuded with the parents of a Muslim US soldier killed in Iraq. He has, at times, advocated a temporary ban on Muslims entering the US and instituted a ""watch list"" for those already in the US. These policies and actions, critics say, reveal an anti-Islamic animus that lies at the heart of Mr Trump's politics. ""From start to finish, the 2016 presidential election vividly revealed that Islamaphobia is alive, and potent and politically resonant as ever,""writes,externalUniversity of Detroit Professor Khaled Baydoun. ""Scapegoating Islam and vilifying Muslims was far more than merely campaign messaging; for Donald Trump it was a winning strategy."" Donald Trump once said he thinks Islam hates the US At times Mr Trump did little to dispel this conclusion. ""I think Islam hates us,"" he said during an interview in March 2016. At other moments, he struck a more measured tone, drawing a distinction between the more than 1.6 billion who follow the Islamic faith and the smaller subset of ""bad and dangerous people"" who happen to be Muslims. ""I love the Muslims,"" Mr Trump said in September 2015. ""I think they're great people."" If a presidential administration is a reflection of the man who sits in the Oval Office, it shouldn't be any surprise that Mr Trump's conflicted views about Muslims are also on display in the team of senior advisers that surround him. In one camp are the more outspoken of Mr Trump's advisers, who echo the president's most bellicose anti-Muslim rhetoric. They include National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, senior adviser Steve Bannon and attorney general nominee Jeff Sessions. Mr Flynn, for instance,called Islam,externala ""political ideology"" that ""hides behind this notion of it being a religion"" - the line that prompted the pointed questions for Gorka last week. Michael Flynn (centre) and Stephen Bannon (right) both have been sharply critical of the Islamic faith He'scompared,externalthe religion to ""a malignant cancer"" andtweeted,externalthat a fear of Muslims is ""rational"". Mr Bannon, who served as head of the nationalist media website Breitbart before taking a top position in Mr Trump's presidential campaign,called,externalIslam ""the most radical religion in the world"" and warned that members of the faith had created ""a fifth column here in the United States"". A slightly narrower view has been advanced by Mr Sessions, considered the architect of Mr Trump's immigration policies. ""We have a toxic ideology, hopefully very small within Islam; certainly most people, most Muslims don't agree with this violent, jihadist approach,""he said,external. ""And we need to figure out a better way to identify that."" There are cooler heads in the White House, of course. Defence Secretary James Mattis, in defending the need for US alliances with the Islamic world, said jihadist groupswere,external""dressed in false religious garb"". Before he joined the Trump administration, Mr Mattis was among the many Republicans - including Vice-President Mike Pence - critical of the proposed Muslim immigration ban,saying,externalit was ""causing us great damage right now, and it's sending shock waves through the international system"". This video can not be played President Trump: ""It's not a Muslim ban, but we're totally prepared"" He noted during his confirmation hearings that he had fought alongside Muslim US soldiers. White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, viewed as Bannon's chief rival among presidential advisers, has said there will be no Muslim registry - and taken a softer tone in general. ""There are some aspects of that faith that are problematic,"" Priebussaid,externalof Islam. ""It certainly isn't a blanket for that faith."" The debate over the Trump White House's attitude toward Muslims is more than merely academic. In their lawsuits challenging the legality of the president's order suspending refugee resettlement and immigration from seven predominantly Muslim countries, Mr Trump's opponents have pointed to his bellicose rhetoric and that of his staff as evidence that the policy was unconstitutionally directed at Muslims. Past presidents have gone out of their way to say their issues are not with the Islamic faith - if only to serve as a public counterbalance to their use of US military power in or against Muslim nations. ""The face of terror is not the true faith of Islam,"" Mr Bushsaid,externalshortly after the 9/11 attack on the World Trade Center. ""That's not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace."" George W Bush called Islam a religion of peace while president He would later launch invasions of Muslim countries Afghanistan and Iraq. Mr Obama has made similar comments,noting,externalthat ""it's very important for us to align ourselves with the 99.9 percent of Muslims who are looking for the same thing we're looking for - order, peace, prosperity"". In 2016 he ordered more than 26,000 bombs dropped on Muslim nations like Syria, Iraq, Afghanistan, Libya, Yemen, Somalia and Pakistan. Mr Trump doesn't have the luxury of the same rhetorical cover his predecessors enjoyed. His actions as president will be coloured by his past statements and those of his advisers. The furious reaction to his immigration order is one such example - and it almost certainly won't be the last.

Why is Britain First big online?,"The far-right group whose deputy leader was retweeted by Donald Trump has a specific social media strategy that has made it much more successful online than at the ballot box. From the outset, Britain First's aim has been to make noise on Facebook and other networks rather than to get people elected. The group has nearly 2m likes - far outpacing the Labour Party (1m) and the Conservatives (650,000). But the UK's most popular political organisation on Facebook has been a washout when it comes to electoral politics. Britain First has no elected representatives and rarely even runs candidates for office. When they do, they attract a small amount of the vote. Party leader Paul Golding garnered 1.2% in the 2016 London mayoral election. It was recentlyderegistered as a political party by the Electoral Commission,external. So what explains Britain First's outsized social media following? For one thing, it usespaid advertising,externaland acore group of dedicated followers,externalto spread its message. Britain First deputy leader charged by PSNI The anti-immigration party trying to recruit immigrants WATCH:BBC Three: We Want Our Country Back LISTEN:What's new about the new far right? Britain First has also used less controversial posts - for instance messages encouraging people to support the armed forces or the royal family - and other tactics to drive up the numbers of likes. A report released Wednesday by the campaign organisation Hope Not Hate said that the number of people following the social media accounts of Britain First leadersspikes in the wake of terror attacks,external. The social media strategy has turned the party's Facebook page into an international hub for people attracted to anti-Islam messages - and despite the party's name, its fan base isn't particularly British at all. BBC Trending on Facebook,external According to an analysis carried out by Trending in July, fewer than half (44%) of the group's Facebook likes came from accounts based inside the UK, with large numbers of likes from the US, Australia and Canada. By way of comparison, 87% of the Labour Party's likes at the time came from UK accounts, and the figure for the Conservative Party was 78%. At the time, the party was also inthe midst of a campaign to recruit Polish immigrants to its side, despite its stated goal to end nearly all inward immigration into the UK. The party's deputy leader, Jayda Fransen, told BBC Trending that party operatives were focusing on ""relentless"" direct action. Fransen, who earlier this monthwas charged with using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour""during speeches she made in Belfast, originally posted the three videos that President Trump's account retweeted. She will appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Thursday 14 December. Fransen and Britain First have tried to appeal to Polish immigrants in the UK Fiyaz Mughal, director of the group Faith Matters and founder of Tell Mama, an anti-hate crime organisation, says Trump's retweets ""re-energised far right groups by simply pressing three clicks of a button."" ""They have effectively felt that their work is bleeding into the White House and so there is serious damage over what has happened today and there will be repercussions felt sadly over the next few months,"" he says. ""And for those Muslims who think there is a clash of civilisations taking place it confirms their warped view. ""So what the President has done today is to actually strengthen the hand of extremists.""

NBC said: ""On Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behaviour in the workplace by Matt Lauer. ""As a result, we've decided to terminate his employment."" Lauer co-hosts The Today Show. NBC said it had ""reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident"".

Boy 'abused' by head of Catholic school,"The inquiry into child abuse is examining abuse at Ampleforth College, in North Yorkshire A head teacher of a Catholic boarding school invited a young pupil into his study and then sexually abused him, the inquiry into child abuse has heard. The hearing heard the boy was told to pretend to go to bed in his dorm at Ampleforth College, in North Yorkshire, and then to get up and go to his study. Two other ex-pupils also talked about being abused and beaten at the school. The Independent Inquiry into Child Sexual Abuse is currently examining abuse in the Roman Catholic Church. The Church is one of 13 public organisations being scrutinised by the public inquiry, which is being headed by Prof Alexis Jay. The third day of hearings into allegations involving the Church examined abuse at Ampleforth College, a private school run by Benedictine monks. In a statement, read out to the inquiry, a man said he was abused by the head teacher of Gilling Castle - Ampleforth's preparatory, or primary, school - in the mid 1960s. He said he was under the age of 10 when the abuse took place. The man said the head teacher - who was not named during the hearing - asked him to leave his dormitory and go to his study after bedtime. ""Several times he said he thought it was wrong which did not make sense to me,"" the man's statement said. The man said he received a note from classmates when he was aged 10, saying the headmaster had died. Earlier, two ex-pupils described being beaten in classrooms and in the confessional of the Ampleforth College chapel. The men said they were also sexually abused by a monk and Father Piers Grant-Ferris, who was jailed for abuse in 2006. Grant-Ferris smacked boys' naked bottoms while masturbating, put his hands into their underwear, and took the temperature of a child rectally, one man said. The witness said he told another monk, Father Justin Price, about the abuse and was told Grant-Ferris had ""a problem with boys' bottoms"". Grant-Ferris - who the inquiry was told was nicknamed ""Pervy Piers"" by pupils - was jailed in 2006 for 20 counts of indecent assault. After leaving Ampleforth the witness said he had a ""total psychological collapse"". Thirteen organisations are being scrutinised by the inquiry, headed by Prof Alexis Jay The unnamed monk abused boys both ""physically"" and ""psychologically"", the second witness said. ""He was a nasty, cruel, physically violent man towards me,"" he said, adding that he treated boys at the school ""disgracefully"". The man said he had been sent as a boarder to Ampleforth's prep school at the age of six. He told the inquiry he had to ""shut down"" his emotions to deal with abuse there. ""My biggest problem has been having a shut down of emotions most of my life because I had to at school, otherwise I wouldn't have got on and been able to deal with the school,"" he said. A barrister representing the school earlier this week offered a ""sincere and heartfelt"" apology to abuse victims. Matthias Kelly QC said: ""We wish to apologise for the hurt, injury, distress and damage done to those who were abused as a result of our failings."" Mr Kelly said there had been ""failings, omissions and a lack of transparency"" at the school, but its governance had been improved. The inquiry is examining the extent of any institutional failings over abuse within the Church, in England and Wales. On Tuesday, a former leader of Benedictine Monks in England told the inquiry he was aware of at least six monks who had been made to move monasteries after allegations of abuse surfaced. Dom Richard Yeo said safeguarding had been a matter of ""firefighting"" before the Catholic Church introduced firmer rules in 2001. The former Abbot President of the English Benedictine Congregation and a former abbot of Downside, in Somerset, said no records were kept of monks who were moved between monasteries. ""I should wish to say that this has been a source of shame and regret to all the members of our monasteries,"" he told the hearing. However, he said he recognised that would not be enough for some of the victims of abuse. On Monday - the first day of hearing into allegations surrounding the Catholic Church - the inquiry heardchildren at private Catholic schools could be ""at risk""of sexual abuse despite years of efforts to root out predators. The inquiry heard child protection failures may remain, despite numerous inquiries and convictions.

UK's Brexit offer worth up to 50bn euros,"This video can not be played During a visit to Iraq,Theresa May said the Brexit 'divorce bill' is still being negotiated The UK has offered a larger potential ""divorce bill"" to the EU - which could be worth up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn), the BBC understands. It was ""broadly welcomed"", political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, although No 10 has played down reports the final sum could be up to 55bn euros (Â£49bn). Asked on a trip to Iraq if a figure had been agreed, Theresa May said talks were continuing. And the EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said ""we are not there"" yet. In September Theresa May suggested the UK was willing to pay about 20bn euros to meet obligations arising from its membership but the EU has been calling for its offer to be increased. Laura Kuenssberg: What happens next?. Katya Adler: Brussels 'still guarded over Brexit divorce'' Brexitcast: Divorce bill special The UK is hoping to move on to talking about trade but the EU will only do this when it deems ""sufficient progress"" has been made on three areas - the so-called divorce bill, the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit and the Irish border. Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier have been trying to reach a deal on the so-called divorce bill The EU says the UK needs to settle its accounts before it leaves. It says the UK has made financial commitments that have to be settled as part of an overall withdrawal agreement. The UK accepts that it has some obligations. And it has promised not to leave any other country out of pocket in the current EU budget period from 2014-20. But the devil is in the detail. There are also longer term issues like pensions for EU staff, and how the UK's contribution to these is calculated for years to come, and the question of what happens to building projects that had funding agreed by all EU members including the UK but which will only begin construction after the UK has left. Large amounts of the EU's budget are spent in two areas - agriculture and fisheries, and development of poorer areas. Reality Check: What's happening with the divorce bill? Reality Check: Where does EU money go? Downing Street has played down reports in the Financial Times and Daily Telegraph that a deal has been reached Pressure is mounting to make progress on the Brexit talks before a crunch summit in mid-December, when EU leaders will decide if enough progress has been made on the first set of subjects to open negotiations on a future trade deal between the EU and the UK. According to theDaily Telegraph,externaland theFinancial Times,external, agreement has now been reached between the two sets of negotiators on how the bill could be calculated. Speaking in the Commons, Treasury minister Liz Truss declined to comment on what she described as media speculation and insisted any financial settlement was ""contingent"" on the UK getting the right overall outcome. But Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK would make a ""fair offer"" to help break the current deadlock. ""Now is the moment to get the whole ship off the rocks and move it forwards,"" he said during a trip to Ivory Coast, where he is attending a meeting of European and African leaders. The BBC understands detailed conversations are still taking place on which specific components will be included in the final bill and how they are calculated. The final bill is likely to be paid over many years rather than in a single upfront sum. This video can not be played Grayling: Not time to 'put figure' on Brexit bill At the moment no. But there appears to have been an agreement on the way that the amount the UK pays will be calculated and the BBC understands that the range of possible settlements is between approximately 40bn and 55bn euros. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""There are no numbers for us to discuss this morning. We haven't committed to numbers."" Labour said it was not asking for a precise figure to be published as this was clearly ""sensitive"". But it said there needed to be a ""transparent process"" with the final figure subjected to scrutiny by Parliament and independent bodies. It is trying to force a vote on this next week. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the UK - which according the the House of Commons Librarypaid an estimated Â£12.2bn to the EU in 2016-17,external- would save a ""staggering amount of money"" after Brexit. ""Leaving the EU is always a bargain because we get our money back,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the figures being reported would mean ""Christmas has come early"" for the EU. The long-time Brexit campaigner told ITV's Good Morning Britain that the UK was ""selling out"" and that even if such a sum secured tariff-free access to EU markets, this would not be worth it.

But former chancellor Ken Clarke said the UK had to pay its ""fair share"" and ""repudiating"" the UK's financial obligations would result in a hard Brexit - damaging jobs and investment. Remember there also has to be sufficient progress on the issues of citizens' rights and the Irish border for EU leaders to agree to move the talks on in ten days' time. The first issue should not be a stumbling block - there has been talk of agreement being within ""touching distance"" but the second issue is now the ""main sticking point"", the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. The Irish government has said it wants firm guarantees on what kind of border controls there will be after Brexit and it is prepared to wait until next year, if necessary, for them. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was some talk in Whitehall of trying to agree a position which would stress agreement in the first two areas and ""park"" the Irish question until early next year. But she said EU officials were ""pouring a freezing cold bucket of water"" over the idea of a staged approach. In the meantime, she said both sides were discussing whether a joint paper could be produced before next Monday formalising what has been agreed so far so it could not potentially be unpicked at a later date. MEPs on the European Parliament have warned ""considerable problems"" remain and that more progress is needed before talks can move to the next phase. In a letter to chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, the Parliament's Brexit steering group cited differences between the two sides on citizens' rights and said progress had ""stalled"" on the role of the European Court of Justice. The European Parliament is not leading the negotiations (that is the job of the European Commission) but it will get to vote on the final deal.

Brexit vote 'challenged terror unity',"Intelligence-sharing would continue after Brexit, the EU's chief negotiator said The UK failed to show solidarity with a Europe reeling from terror attacks when it voted for Brexit in 2016, the EU's chief negotiator has suggested. The UK ""chose to be on their own again"" when the need to act together against groups such as Islamic State had never been ""so strong"", Michel Barnier said. In Berlin, he said the UK must now leave bodies such as Europol but could still participate in EU-led operations. No 10 said it intended to still play a ""full part"" in Europe's security. Speaking on a visit to Iraq, Theresa May said the UK was playing a leading role in training its army to fight so-called Islamic State and also depriving the militant group of outlets for its propaganda. There are 1,400 British military and civilian personnel in Iraq, who have helped train and equip 25,000 Iraqi and Kurdish fighters since the UK's combat role ended in 2009. After meeting British troops near Baghdad, she insisted the UK's defence budget was rising and the UK's capabilities would be continually reviewed. Brexitcast: EU divorce bill special UK seeks defence partnership with EU Brexit: All you need to know The UK, which has long-established bilateral defence relations with countries such as France, has said it wants security and intelligence co-operation to continue after Brexit and be bolstered by a new treaty. But Mr Barnier, a former French foreign minister, said it was clear it would not be business as usual in defence and security as in other matters once the UK had left in March 2019. On a visit to Iraq, Theresa May witnessed the UK's contribution to the fight against Islamic State In a speech to a German security conference, he said that while the UK would remain a diplomatic and military power by virtue of its membership of Nato and the UN Security Council, it would no longer be involved in European decision-making in defence matters and would ""lose some levers for wielding influence"". Reflecting on the ""great shock"" caused by the Leave vote in the June 2016 referendum, he said it had come ""after a series of of attacks on European soil, committed by young people who grew up in Europe, in our countries"". A series of attacks in Paris in November 2015 killed 130 people, while a bombing at Brussels airport and on the city's Metro system in April 2016 left 32 people dead. The Leave vote, Mr Barnier said, had come ""six months after the French minister of defence issued a call for solidarity to all his European counterparts to join forces to fight the terrorism of [the so-called Islamic State]"". ""Never had the need to be together, to protect ourselves together, to act together been so strong, so manifest,"" he said. The November 2015 attacks in Paris were the worst on French soil since 1945 ""Yet rather than stay shoulder to shoulder with the union, the British chose to be on their own again."" The UK, which has suffered a string of terror attacks in 2017, has been at the forefront of the fight against IS - carrying out air strikes against the militants in Iraq and Syria. Mr Barnier's comments drew an immediate response from Brexit supporters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his speech, Mr Barnier also made clear the EU was taking on greater responsibility for Europe's defence and although the UK still had an important contribution to make, Brexit would leave it on the outside. The UK, he said, would no longer be able to: lead future EU deployments attend EU defence meetings be a member of the European Defence Agency or Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency This, he said, was the ""logical consequence of the sovereign choice made by the British"". But insisting there must be no ""horse-trading"" over security in the Brexit negotiations, he said common interests and values dictated the UK and EU would continue to work together, with the UK participating in selective EU operations on a voluntarily basis. Cooperation, he added, was also vital in areas such as: cyber-security intelligence procurement research and development ""The construction of a 'Europe of Defence' has begun,"" he said. ""Obviously, we will not wait for the United Kingdom to implement it, but when the time comes we will be ready to cooperate with the United Kingdom. ""This partnership will be in our best interests, since it is what the European citizens expect and it will contribute to the stability and security of our continent and our neighbourhood."" Negotiations on the UK's future relations with the EU, including on defence, have yet to begin. But Downing Street said: ""We've been clear that we want to play a full part in the security of the EU and Europe after we leave, and we think that's in the interests of both Britain and the European Union.""

Poppi dad refuses to answer questions,"This video can not be played Paul Worthington had his face covered when he arrived at the inquest The father of a 13-month-old girl who a judge said probably sexually assaulted her before she died has refused to answer questions about her death. Poppi Worthington died suddenly at a house in Barrow, Cumbria, in December 2012. No-one has ever been prosecuted. Her father Paul Worthington, 49, was escorted into a second inquest hearing in Kendal by police officers. He used his right to refuse to answer 69 questions about her meals, sleeping patterns and health. Mr Worthington first attempted to decline answering questions on when his relationship with Poppi's mother began, under rule 22 of the Coroner's Inquest Rules 2013, which protects witnesses from incriminating themselves. Paul Worthington said answering some questions could incriminate him But coroner David Roberts said the rules did not apply to ""scene-setting questions"". Mr Worthington said the ""on and off"" relationship began in 2009. Mr Worthington told the coroner that Poppi's birth was unplanned and he later had a vasectomy. Key dates in the Poppi investigation Report condemns catalogue of failures Mother tells of ""bubbly"" toddler He said Poppi was ""generally fit as a fiddle"" and was a good sleeper who would sleep through the night, and was usually the first of the household to wake up. Alison Hewitt, counsel for the coroner, asked him if he normally heard Poppi when she woke up as he often slept in the next room. He declined to answer. Poppi's mother previously told the inquest her daughter would usually rub her bottle along the bars of her cot and shout ""mum"" when she woke up. Poppi Worthington was not breathing when she was brought to hospital Mr Worthington was then asked a series of questions about the morning routine on 11 December, the day before Poppi died. He replied to each: ""I refer to my previous statements, I rely on my right not to answer under rule 22."" Ms Hewitt read a previous statement he had given, in which he said he got Poppi out of bed and took her downstairs. He said she was playing normally and seemed fine. Ms Hewitt asked him about statements he had given about going to bed that night with a laptop. She asked him what the laptop was being used for. He declined to answer. Ms Hewitt then read him what he had said in the High Court. Cumbria coroner David Roberts instructed Mr Worthington to answer some questions When asked what he was looking at, he had said football results, Facebook and then ""X-rated adult stuff for 10 minutes before going to sleep"". Ms Hewitt asked the nature of the pornography, he again refused to answer. The inquest previously heard Poppi's mother got the laptop at about 02:00 GMT and took it downstairs with her. Ms Hewitt asked Mr Worthington if he was then the only person who could account for what happened upstairs before he ran down with Poppi shortly before 06:00 on 12 December. He declined to answer. She also asked him what happened to the laptop, he again declined to answer. Mr Worthington has never been charged with any offence and denies any responsibility over her death. The new inquest, in County Hall, Kendal, was ordered after a seven-minute hearing in 2014 determined Poppi's death was ""unascertained"".

Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict,"With Theresa May in the Middle East - stand-ins Damian Green and Emily Thornberry faced each other at Prime Minister's Questions. How did they do? The pair clashed over nursing numbers in the NHS - and why so many are quitting. Standard fare, you might think, but with Labour's Emily Thornberry in typically theatrical form at the despatch box it was far from a standard PMQs. The shadow foreign secretary kicked off with a risky joke about waving the Cross of St George at an England rugby match - risky because she was sacked by Ed Miliband in 2014 for allegedlysending a ""snobby"" tweet about a terraced house with three England flagsand a white van parked outside.

Mothers not told of stillbirth filming,"This video can not be played Cameras with warnings have been put up in Clinic 23 of the Rosie Hospital A charity says it has ""serious concerns"" about a hospital which has allowed women to be unwittingly filmed at critical points in their pregnancy. Cameras and a written notice have been put up at the Rosie Hospital, Cambridge for a Channel 4 stillbirth documentary. One mother who was filmed said she thought the idea of installing cameras was ""morally wrong"". Production company True Vision said no footage would be viewed or downloaded without the patient's permission. The cameras, which film 24 hours a day, are in a section of the maternity unit mothers are taken to if they have serious problems after their first trimester. The devices have been in position for three months. Healthcare professionals do not tell patients the cameras are there but notices in the room do warn that filming is taking place. If there is a stillbirth at a later date, a member of staff asks if the woman would give her consent to talk to the film crew and give permission for the footage to be shown. Cambridge University Hospitals said it took part in the documentary after women claimed there was not enough information on stillbirth The recording is automatically deleted after a certain amount of time if permission is not given. Tara, a mother who discovered she had been filmed but whose pregnancy turned out to be healthy, said she felt the filming was ""morally wrong"" adding: ""I think if I was receiving bad news the last thing I would want is to share it with a camera."" The human rights charity Birthrights has written to the hospital saying it had ""serious concerns"" over ""whether consent is being lawfully obtained and whether women are being treated in a respectful way"". The charity, which acknowledged the ""potential benefits of a sensitively made documentary"" about stillbirths, said: ""Such a filming project would engage individuals' right to privacy, which is a reasonable expectation for medical procedures, consultations and examinations."" A spokesman for True Vision said: ""Patients are made aware that that filming is taking place in parts of the clinic but that no footage of them will be viewed or downloaded in any way without their express permission. ""Anyone approached to take part in the programme will have the implications of taking part in filming clearly explained and all contributors have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Dr Jeremy Brockelsby, clinical lead for women's services at Cambridge University Hospitals, said it took part in the documentary after women said there was not enough information on stillbirth. He added: ""Because of the sensitivity of the subject, we established a robust consent process with True Vision to safeguard women who visit [the critical care clinic].""

Trump wrong to share far-right videos - PM,"Donald Trump met Theresa May at the White House in January It was wrong for US President Donald Trump to retweet videos posted by far-right group Britain First, Downing Street has said. Mr Trump shared three posts by the group's deputy leader, including unverified footage purporting to show Muslims committing crimes. Theresa May's spokesman said Britain First used ""hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions"". Labour's Jeremy Corbyn called the retweets ""abhorrent"" and ""dangerous"". Britain First was founded in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP). The group has grabbed attention on social media with controversial posts about what it deems ""the Islamification of the UK"". What the videos Trump shared actually show Why is Britain First big online? Trump retweets far-right videos What Team Trump has said about Islam It has previously put up members to run in European elections and by-elections on anti-immigration and anti-abortion policies, but has yet to secure any seats. The first tweet, from deputy leader Jayda Fransen, claims to show a Muslim migrant attacking a man on crutches. This was followed by two more videos of people Ms Fransen claims to be Muslim. The tweets were flagged as containing sensitive material by Twitter White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mrs May and other world leaders knew the videos highlighted ""real threats that we have to talk about"". ""Whether it's a real video, the threat is real,"" she added. However, Mr Trump's tweets - shared with his 43.6 million followers - prompted a wave of criticism in the UK. Mr Corbyn tweeted: ""I hope our government will condemn far-right retweets by Donald Trump. They are abhorrent, dangerous and a threat to our society."" Veteran Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames said Mr Trump had finally proved he is ""wholly unsuited"" to the role of president. Meanwhile, fellow Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi has written a letter to Mr Trump urging him to delete the retweets This video can not be played Brendan Cox, the husband of Jo Cox, said Mr Trump was ""legitimising hatred"" Speaking in the Commons, Labour MP David Lammy accused Mr Trump of ""promoting a fascist, racist, extremist hate group"". Fellow Labour MP Stephen Doughty said the videos were ""highly inflammatory"", while his colleague Yvette Cooper, a former shadow home secretary, said Mr Trump had given Britain First a ""huge platform"". Theresa May is currently on an overseas trip, but both Mr Doughty and Ms Cooper asked the home secretary or foreign secretary to make a statement on the government's behalf. Both declined, but later a Downing Street spokesman said: ""British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right which is the antithesis of the values that this country represents - decency, tolerance and respect."" He added: ""It is wrong for the president to have done this."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson later tweeted that Britain First was ""a divisive, hateful group"", while Sajid Javid, minister for communities and local government, said Mr Trump was ""wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing"". However, Downing Street made clear the invitation to the US president to make a state visit to the UK still stood, despite fresh calls for it to be rescinded. Allow Twitter content?

"Brexit vote 'challenged terror unity'Michel Barnier says the UK chose to be ""on their own"" when solidarity was called for.12m13 minutes agoUK Politics","Intelligence-sharing would continue after Brexit, the EU's chief negotiator said The UK failed to show solidarity with a Europe reeling from terror attacks when it voted for Brexit in 2016, the EU's chief negotiator has suggested. The UK ""chose to be on their own again"" when the need to act together against groups such as Islamic State had never been ""so strong"", Michel Barnier said. In Berlin, he said the UK must now leave bodies such as Europol but could still participate in EU-led operations. No 10 said it intended to still play a ""full part"" in Europe's security. Speaking on a visit to Iraq, Theresa May said the UK was playing a leading role in training its army to fight so-called Islamic State and also depriving the militant group of outlets for its propaganda. There are 1,400 British military and civilian personnel in Iraq, who have helped train and equip 25,000 Iraqi and Kurdish fighters since the UK's combat role ended in 2009. After meeting British troops near Baghdad, she insisted the UK's defence budget was rising and the UK's capabilities would be continually reviewed. Brexitcast: EU divorce bill special UK seeks defence partnership with EU Brexit: All you need to know The UK, which has long-established bilateral defence relations with countries such as France, has said it wants security and intelligence co-operation to continue after Brexit and be bolstered by a new treaty. But Mr Barnier, a former French foreign minister, said it was clear it would not be business as usual in defence and security as in other matters once the UK had left in March 2019. On a visit to Iraq, Theresa May witnessed the UK's contribution to the fight against Islamic State In a speech to a German security conference, he said that while the UK would remain a diplomatic and military power by virtue of its membership of Nato and the UN Security Council, it would no longer be involved in European decision-making in defence matters and would ""lose some levers for wielding influence"". Reflecting on the ""great shock"" caused by the Leave vote in the June 2016 referendum, he said it had come ""after a series of of attacks on European soil, committed by young people who grew up in Europe, in our countries"". A series of attacks in Paris in November 2015 killed 130 people, while a bombing at Brussels airport and on the city's Metro system in April 2016 left 32 people dead. The Leave vote, Mr Barnier said, had come ""six months after the French minister of defence issued a call for solidarity to all his European counterparts to join forces to fight the terrorism of [the so-called Islamic State]"". ""Never had the need to be together, to protect ourselves together, to act together been so strong, so manifest,"" he said. The November 2015 attacks in Paris were the worst on French soil since 1945 ""Yet rather than stay shoulder to shoulder with the union, the British chose to be on their own again."" The UK, which has suffered a string of terror attacks in 2017, has been at the forefront of the fight against IS - carrying out air strikes against the militants in Iraq and Syria. Mr Barnier's comments drew an immediate response from Brexit supporters. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In his speech, Mr Barnier also made clear the EU was taking on greater responsibility for Europe's defence and although the UK still had an important contribution to make, Brexit would leave it on the outside. The UK, he said, would no longer be able to: lead future EU deployments attend EU defence meetings be a member of the European Defence Agency or Europol, the EU's law enforcement agency This, he said, was the ""logical consequence of the sovereign choice made by the British"". But insisting there must be no ""horse-trading"" over security in the Brexit negotiations, he said common interests and values dictated the UK and EU would continue to work together, with the UK participating in selective EU operations on a voluntarily basis. Cooperation, he added, was also vital in areas such as: cyber-security intelligence procurement research and development ""The construction of a 'Europe of Defence' has begun,"" he said. ""Obviously, we will not wait for the United Kingdom to implement it, but when the time comes we will be ready to cooperate with the United Kingdom. ""This partnership will be in our best interests, since it is what the European citizens expect and it will contribute to the stability and security of our continent and our neighbourhood."" Negotiations on the UK's future relations with the EU, including on defence, have yet to begin. But Downing Street said: ""We've been clear that we want to play a full part in the security of the EU and Europe after we leave, and we think that's in the interests of both Britain and the European Union.""

The latest version of MacOS will automatically download the update. ""We greatly regret this error and we apologise to all Mac users,â the firm said. ""When our security engineers became aware of the issue Tuesday afternoon, we immediately began working on an update that closes the security hole. ""This morning, as of 8am PT, the update is available for download, and starting later today it will be automatically installed on all systems running the latest version (10.13.1) of MacOS High Sierra.â It is only second time Apple has forcibly updated usersâ machines and comes in response to widespread concern that millions of Mac computers were at risk. Users running older versions of MacOS will see a notification prompting an upgrade. ""Security is a top priority for every Apple product,â the company said. âAnd regrettably we stumbled with this release of MacOS.â It added: ""Our customers deserve better. We are auditing our development processes to help prevent this from happening again.â Attention is now turning to the way in which the bug was made public. The story hit headlines after the flaw was tweeted by Lemi Ergin, a self-described ""software craftsman"". He was criticised for not adhering to ""responsible disclosure"" guidelines in security research, whereby companies are given a reasonable amount of time to fix a flaw before it is made public. However, after coming for criticism for tweeting the vulnerability, Mr Ergin publisheda post on Medium defending his decision,external. ""I am neither a hacker, nor a security specialist,"" he wrote. ""I solely focus on secure coding practices while programming, but I can never call myself a security specialist."" He said his colleagues at payments firm Iyzico informed Apple about the flaw on 23 November. It had previously been discussed on open Apple support forums on 13 November - though the user described the issue more like a feature than a serious bug. Apple's own statement on Wednesday said the company's security team were not made aware of the problem until 28 November - though it is not clear if another department at the company was aware.

Who are Britain First?,"Although their manifesto calls for a near-total halt to immigration, the far-right political party Britain First is now actively trying to appeal to Polish immigrants. They are a fringe group, with no elected officials at any level, but Britain First has about 1.9 million Facebook likes - more than any other UK political party. And now they're trying to use that social media footprint to make explicit appeals to Polish immigrants living in the UK. A string of Britain First videos that seem designed to attract a Polish audience have appeared online. Recent ones include a video from Jacek Miedlar, a Polish far-right former priest, an interview with a Polish media outlet that has over half a million views, and videos by Polish Britain First supporters encouraging others to support the party. Miedlar, who has over 25,000 subscribers on YouTube, is an activist known for his anti-Semitic and anti-Islamic views. He has tried to travel to the UK twice this year to attend Britain First rallies but was stopped by UK authorities. The videos have been posted despite Britain First's anti-immigration manifesto which calls for cash payments to foreigners to leave the UK, a complete halt to immigration except for people who marry British citizens, and a call to make it ""an act of treason to implement any policy or measure, or sign any agreement, that facilitates and/or results in significant numbers of foreigners entering the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom with the aim of settling."" WATCH:#BBCtrending: The rise of Britain First online WATCH:BBC Three: We Want Our Country Back LISTEN:on BBC Trending radio Visit BBC Trending onFacebook,external Despite the party's hard line on immigration, Britain First deputy leader Jayda Fransen told BBC Trending that post-Brexit, all European immigrants who are already in the UK should be allowed to stay, as long as they aren't criminals or Muslims. The party also supports a total ban on Islam in the UK, a policy they believe will attract some support from Polish migrants. Poles form thelargest immigrant communityin Britain. There were an estimated 831,000 Polish-born residents in 2015 - a jump of almost 750,000 compared with the number in 2004, the year Poland joined the European Union. Rafal Pankowski from the Polish anti-hate charity Never Again says the party's attempts to appeal to UK-based Polish people may have something to do with what he perceives to be a trend towards the far-right in Polish society. ""We have been witnessing a rise in far-right activity in Poland itself as well,"" he says. ""And unfortunately the Polish people in the UK have been victims of discrimination and hate crime especially since the Brexit referendum. And some of them have been turning to Polish far-right nationalist groups for a sense of belonging."" A number of videos have appeared on the Britain First Youtube channel seemingly aimed at the UK's Polish population Wiktor Moszczynski, a former spokesperson for the Federation of Poles in Great Britain, agrees that there has been a spike of far-right activity amongst Polish people living in the UK, but says that such activity has recently died down. ""At the moment the trend tends to be towards the right in Polish society, both in Poland and to some extent here in the UK, but when I say right that doesn't necessarily mean radical right,"" Moszczynski tells BBC Trending radio. ""Suddenly these groups began turning up in demonstrations in the UK over the last two or three years generally wearing Polish fascist symbols, but what I do have to say is I have not seen anything of this in the last year,"" he says. ""I have been spoken to by the police who are very concerned about these groups, so we do know that there may still be an undercurrent. But at the moment the problem seems to have been in remission, temporarily at least."" He says a majority of the younger Polish community are resistant to the influence of far-right groups, including Britain First, but nevertheless the far-right spike is ""not pleasant, particularly at a time when we're trying to build up sympathy for the Poles living in this country on the way they've been treated after the Brexit vote."" A recentreport,externalfrom the campaigning group Hope Not Hate said the largest and most organised neo-Nazi group in the UK is the National Rebirth of Poland. The presence of groups like these, Hope Not Hate says, has fuelled extreme far-right activists. Britain First rarely runs candidates. When they do they receive a small amount of the vote, such as the 1.2% of the vote party leader Paul Golding attracted in the 2016 London mayoral election. Its outsized social media following is due to a combination of factors includingpaid advertising,external, acore group of dedicated followers,external, and the use of less controversial posts - for instance messages encouraging people to support the troops or the royal family - and other tactics to drive up the numbers of likes. The group's Facebook page has also become something of an international hub people attracted to its anti-Islam message. According to an analysis by Trending, less than half (44%) of the group's Facebook likes come from accounts based inside the UK, with large numbers of likes coming from the US, Australia and Canada. Around 23,000 of the page's likes come from Polish accounts. By way of comparison, 87% of the Labour Party's 1 million likes come from UK accounts. The figure for the Conservative Party (more than 600,000 likes) is 78%. Fransen claims the party has a ""growing number"" of Polish members and supporters, but refused to provide membership figures. She says the party's low appeal at the ballot box can be explained by the fact that the group has been concentrating on direct action, including turning up at the homes and offices of elected officials. Former Polish wrestling champion Marian Lukasik (left) called for the assassination of Angela Merkel over her country's refugee policy Pankowski believes the membership figures are very small, yet says his organisation saw via social media a number of Polish flags and Polish people at a Britain First rally in Birmingham last month. In one video from the event, a UK-based Polish former wrestling champion Marian Lukasik, can be heard advocating the assassination of German Chancellor Angela Merkel because of her country's refugee policy. Lukasik has recently made other videos in support of Britain First. ""Britain First decided to attract support among the Polish community in the UK against Muslims, and a small section of the Polish community in the UK is probably prone to such messages,"" Pankowski says. ""But obviously it's ironic because Polish migrants and Muslim migrants in the UK actually have a lot in common in terms of the everyday challenges they face.""

War criminal dies after drinking poison,"This video can not be played Slobodan Praljak drank a small vial of liquid after his prison sentence was upheld A Bosnian Croat war criminal has died after drinking poison during an appeal hearing in The Hague. Slobodan Praljak, 72, died in hospital, with the UN court announcing that the courtroom was now ""a crime scene"". On hearing that his 20-year jail term had been upheld, the ex-commander of Bosnian Croat forces said he was not a criminal and then drank from a bottle. In 2013, he was sentenced for crimes in the city of Mostar during the Bosnian war from 1992-95. Praljak was one of six former Bosnian Croat political and military leaders up before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). They were attending the final appeals judgment to be handed down by the court. Though allies against the Bosnian Serbs in the war, Bosnian Croats and Muslims also fought each other for a period of 11 months, with Mostar seeing some of the fiercest fighting. Balkans war: a brief guide What now for victims? Exploring the corridors of the Hague tribunal After hearing the verdict, General Praljak stood and raised his hand to his mouth, tipped his head back and appeared to swallow a glass of liquid. ""I have taken poison,"" he said. Presiding judge Carmel Agius immediately suspended the proceedings and an ambulance was called. ""Okay,"" the judge said. ""We suspend the... We suspend... Please, the curtains. Don't take away the glass that he used when he drank something."" Emergency rescue workers were called into the court building to assist Slobodan Praljak An ambulance could later be seen arriving outside the tribunal while a helicopter hovered above the scene. Several emergency rescue workers also rushed into the building carrying equipment in backpacks. In a statement, the ICTY said Praljak ""was immediately assisted by the ICTY medical staff"". It said Praljak ""was transported to a nearby hospital to receive further medical assistance where he passed"".

""The government expresses its condolences to all victims of all crimes committed in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We voice dissatisfaction and regret about the verdict,"" Mr Plenkovic said. In Mostar, Bosnian Croats lit candles and prayed for Slobodan Praljak at a makeshift memorial Natacha Gaveau Ivanovic, Praljak's lawyer, told the BBC that she did not believe the tribunal treated her client fairly. ""I have no idea what happened and how it happened but for me what is very important, more important is why he did it,"" she said. The lawyer said she thought her client drank poison because he believed that he was an ""innocent man"". She said that he had the right to ""consider that"" because the tribunal ""didn't limit itself to judge just personal responsibility, they took on them to judge [the] politics of people, of a state, the history"". She added: ""It's very hard from the people who are from this country to accept that, and actually they cannot accept it."" Praljak, the former commander of the main staff of the Bosnian Croat defence forces (HVO), was jailed for crimes against humanity. Informed that soldiers were rounding up Muslims in Prozor in the summer of 1993, he had failed to make any serious efforts to stop the action, the UN war crimes tribunal found. Praljak had also failed to act on information that murders were being planned, as well as attacks on members of international organisations and the destruction of the city's historic Old Bridge and mosques. Mostar's Old Bridge has since been restored after being damaged during the war Those appearing with him included Jadranko Prlic, the former prime minister of the Bosnian Croats' breakaway statelet. Set up by mandate of the UN Security Council in 1993, the ICTY is due to close when its mandate expires at the end of the year. What now for Bosnia victims as Hague tribunal closes?

Praljak, the former commander of the main staff of the Bosnian Croat defence forces (HVO), was jailed for crimes against humanity. Informed that soldiers were rounding up Muslims in Prozor in the summer of 1993, he had failed to make any serious efforts to stop the action, the UN war crimes tribunal found. Praljak had also failed to act on information that murders were being planned, as well as attacks on members of international organisations and the destruction of the city's historic Old Bridge and mosques.

"Breaking|Breaking newsTrump wrong to share far-right videos - PMIt was ""wrong"" for President Trump to retweet videos posted by far-right group, Downing Street says8m9 minutes agoUK Politics","Donald Trump met Theresa May at the White House in January It was wrong for US President Donald Trump to retweet videos posted by far-right group Britain First, Downing Street has said. Mr Trump shared three posts by the group's deputy leader, including unverified footage purporting to show Muslims committing crimes. Theresa May's spokesman said Britain First used ""hateful narratives which peddle lies and stoke tensions"". Labour's Jeremy Corbyn called the retweets ""abhorrent"" and ""dangerous"". Britain First was founded in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP). The group has grabbed attention on social media with controversial posts about what it deems ""the Islamification of the UK"". What the videos Trump shared actually show Why is Britain First big online? Trump retweets far-right videos What Team Trump has said about Islam It has previously put up members to run in European elections and by-elections on anti-immigration and anti-abortion policies, but has yet to secure any seats. The first tweet, from deputy leader Jayda Fransen, claims to show a Muslim migrant attacking a man on crutches. This was followed by two more videos of people Ms Fransen claims to be Muslim. The tweets were flagged as containing sensitive material by Twitter White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mrs May and other world leaders knew the videos highlighted ""real threats that we have to talk about"". ""Whether it's a real video, the threat is real,"" she added. However, Mr Trump's tweets - shared with his 43.6 million followers - prompted a wave of criticism in the UK. Mr Corbyn tweeted: ""I hope our government will condemn far-right retweets by Donald Trump. They are abhorrent, dangerous and a threat to our society."" Veteran Tory MP Sir Nicholas Soames said Mr Trump had finally proved he is ""wholly unsuited"" to the role of president. Meanwhile, fellow Conservative MP Nadhim Zahawi has written a letter to Mr Trump urging him to delete the retweets This video can not be played Brendan Cox, the husband of Jo Cox, said Mr Trump was ""legitimising hatred"" Speaking in the Commons, Labour MP David Lammy accused Mr Trump of ""promoting a fascist, racist, extremist hate group"". Fellow Labour MP Stephen Doughty said the videos were ""highly inflammatory"", while his colleague Yvette Cooper, a former shadow home secretary, said Mr Trump had given Britain First a ""huge platform"". Theresa May is currently on an overseas trip, but both Mr Doughty and Ms Cooper asked the home secretary or foreign secretary to make a statement on the government's behalf. Both declined, but later a Downing Street spokesman said: ""British people overwhelmingly reject the prejudiced rhetoric of the far right which is the antithesis of the values that this country represents - decency, tolerance and respect."" He added: ""It is wrong for the president to have done this."" Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson later tweeted that Britain First was ""a divisive, hateful group"", while Sajid Javid, minister for communities and local government, said Mr Trump was ""wrong and I refuse to let it go and say nothing"". However, Downing Street made clear the invitation to the US president to make a state visit to the UK still stood, despite fresh calls for it to be rescinded. Allow Twitter content?

Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby said it was ""deeply disturbing"" that Mr Trump had ""chosen to amplify the voice of far-right extremists"". ""I join the urgent call of faith groups and others for President Trump not just to remove these tweets, but to make clear his opposition to racism and hatred in all forms."" Brendan Cox - whose wife, British MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a right-wing extremist who shouted ""Britain first"" before committing the act - also condemned Mr Trump. He told the BBC: ""If you look at Trump this isn't a mistake, this is a strategy. He consistently does this. ""He's retweeted people on the far right in the US, he's shared anti-Semitic memes in the past and his whole campaign was based on calling Mexicans rapists and saying he'd ban Muslims from the country. ""I think we have to recognise now... that this is a president who is a purveyor of hate."" This video can not be played White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders says Trump's tweets were about border security Mr Cox said there was ""no chance"" of Mr Trump now visiting the UK, saying his tweets were the ""final nail in the coffin"". Writing for MailOnline,external, columnist and Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan said the tweets were ""the worst thing"" Mr Trump had done as president. Mr Morgan, a friend of Mr Trump, wrote: ""I urge you to immediately undo those three re-tweets, and apologize unreservedly. ""That won't repair the terrible damage you've done. But it will at least acknowledge that you understand just how wrong it was. ""If you don't, we will be left to assume that you too are a hateful Islamophobe and racist."" Allow Twitter content?

The Muslim Council for Britain had called on the UK government to ""distance"" itself from the comments. ""This is the clearest endorsement yet from the US president of the far-right and their vile anti-Muslim propaganda,"" a spokeswoman said. Earlier, responding to the president's retweets, Ms Fransen tweeted: ""God bless you Trump! God bless America!"" The message was also shared on Britain First's Twitter account. Ms Fransen was chargedwith using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour"" during speeches she made in Belfast in August. She will appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Thursday 14 December. Donald Trump is once again using Twitter to weigh in on contentious religious-tinged political issues in the UK. In the past, he's attacked London Mayor Sadiq Khan, saying he mishandled a militant attack just hours after it occurred. He misattributed a rise in crime in England and Wales to the ""spread of radical Islamic terror"". Now, he has retweeted a series of unverified videos posted by a far-right British nationalist group. For the president, directing attention toward the UK seems to serve a domestic political purpose. He cites events and opinions in the country as a warning to Americans of what could happen in the US if they do not heed his policy prescriptions on immigration and border security. The Muslim ban, the US-Mexico wall, increased deportations, the sharp reductions on refugee resettlement - it's all part of the president's ""national security"" package. While most Americans probably haven't heard of Britain First and are unfamiliar with European radical nationalist movements, there are white supremacist groups in the US that follow the actions of these overseas operations quite closely. The president on Wednesday signalled that he watches them too. Donald Trump retweets far-right videos What Trump team has said about Islam Why is Britain First big online?

"Bellfield 'confessed' to Russell murdersSerial killer Levi Bellfield has confessed to one of the UK's most notorious murder cases, it is claimed.7m7 minutes agoWales","Serial killer Levi Bellfield is alleged to have confessed to one of the UK's most notorious murder cases. Lin Russell, 45, and daughter Megan, six, were killed months after moving to Kent from north Wales. Josie, nine, survived despite horrific injuries. Michael Stone was found guilty in 2001 largely on the strength of a disputed cell confession. When contacted by BBC Wales Bellfield denied being responsible for the murders and making any confession. Shaun and Lin Russell with daughters Megan (centre) and Josie (right) At a press conference on Wednesday by Stone's legal team, solicitor Paul Bacon said: ""We have seen evidence of a full confession by Levi Bellfield that he has admitted the Russell murders and in the confession Bellfield describes how he came across Lin Russell and her two children. ""How he attacked them with a hammer and he explains his motivation for the killing. The confession is detailed and has a number of facts that are not in the public domain. What is Levi Bellfield alleged to have said? ""We now have an independent witness who has seen Levi Bellfield close to the scene of the murders at about the time they were committed and importantly we have identified forensic material from the scene of the murders which corroborates the confession made by Levi Bellfield. Serial killer Bellfield worked as a bouncer, drug dealer and wheel clamping contractor ""The Russell murders by Levi Bellfield fits perfectly with his modus operandi. He is a man known to attack and murder women. His weapon of choice is a hammer. ""This material including the detailed confession is before the Criminal Cases Review Commission. We are of the view that this evidence must, as a matter of urgency be brought before the Court of Appeal."" This video can not be played Barbara Stone: Mick's been in prison 20 years too long Stone's legal team are calling for an independent police force to investigate the new evidence. They say all conversations had been written up contemporaneously and immediately reported to a solicitor by the prisoner who Bellfield allegedly confessed to. It is claimed Bellfield - currently serving two whole life terms - said he was worried about DNA advances saying ""my life in jail would be over if they could prove it was me"" and that it would ""tear his mother in two"". Known as the 'Bus Stop Killer', he randomly launched a so-called 'blitz attack' from behind, striking his victims repeatedly on the head with a hammer. Amelie Delagrange, murder; Kate Sheedy, attempted murder; Milly Dowler, abduction/murder; Marsha McDonnell, murder In 2011 the nightclub bouncer, drug dealer, and wheel-clamping contractor was convicted of abducting and murdering 13-year-old Milly Dowler as she walked home from school in Surrey in 2002. By then he had already been convicted of three other attacks in south west London - murdering 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell in 2003, Amelie Delagrange, 22, in 2004 and in the same year attempting to kill 18-year-old Kate Sheedy, by running her over. She survived her injuries. It is widely believed by detectives that Bellfield is responsible for numerous crimes dating back to the 1980s. Legal team Mark McDonald QC and solicitor Paul Bacon (centre) with Michael Stone's sister Barbara And this is not the first time his name has been linked with the Russell murders. Even though the attack happened over 20 years ago it remains one of the UK's most notorious cases. The mother and two daughters were attacked just before 16:30 BST on 9 July 1996, as they walked with the family dog home from school in Chillenden, near Dover. Half way along a country lane, they were accosted by a man, tied up, made to sit in a copse, blindfolded and bludgeoned with a claw hammer, one by one. A car had passed the Russells on the unmade track before the driver stopped and attacked them When they were found eight hours later; it was thought all were dead. Josie was found to have a faint pulse. Remarkably, she survived. She lives and works as an artist in north Wales, having returned to Gwynedd with her father soon after the attack. A year after the murders a tip off to Crimewatch from a psychologist who worked at a local psychiatric assessment centre, led to the arrest of 36-year-old Michael Stone from Gillingham. Michael Stone had a criminal history In October 1998, Stone, a heroin addict with a criminal history, was convicted. In the absence of any forensic evidence, the jury believed the main thrust of the prosecution's case - three prison inmates who claimed Stone had confessed. One of the inmates admitted soon after the trial ended that they had lied and another was discredited. Stone's legal team challenged his conviction. A retrial was ordered. But one of the inmates, Damien Daley, then aged 26, held firm to his claim that Stone had confessed to him in grisly detail. The judge's summing up to the jury was unequivocal: ""The case stands or falls on the alleged confession of Damian Daley."" In late 2001, Stone was once again found guilty and given three life sentences. As the judge addressed him, Stone cried out: ""It wasn't me your Honour, I didn't do it!"" Since then Stone has failed in two appeal bids. ""Given what we know about the lack of evidenceâ¦ presented to the jury in the actual trial,"" Stone's barrister Mark McDonald QC says, ""this confession is so profound, significant, that it goes to the heart of the conviction of Michael Stone. It's unsafe."" Bellfield denies any part in the murders or making a confession When asked to respond to the possibility of new allegations in this case, Kent Police said that Stone's protests of innocence had been thoroughly tested by the judicial system. Ever since Bellfield's conviction for the murder of Milly Dowler, Stone's legal team have claimed Bellfield may have been responsible for the Russell murders. Meanwhile, Bellfield has been contacted by BBC Wales Investigates and denies both the murders and the confession. He claims he has three letters from Stone and has complained about his ""persistent attempts"" to get him to take responsibility. He also alleges Stone has offered to give him a share of any compensation money he might get. Lie detector test Stone vehemently denies this. Bellfield added that he had challenged Stone to a lie detector test. Stone has spoken about his reluctance to do this claiming he had been advised that his history of psychiatric problems and drug addiction could impact its accuracy. Recently there has been a war of words between the two convicted killers from behind bars at Durham's Frankland prison where they are both being held, which has been reported in newspapers. A BBC Two investigation of the Russell murders entitled The Chillenden Murders was broadcast in June this year. A panel of experts was given access to all case files to re-examine the evidence. It is this programme which is claimed to have prompted Bellfield's alleged confession. The panel concluded that despite advancements in DNA there was still no forensic link to Stone and it was likely another man was at the scene.

Rail revamp aims to tackle train delays,"Firms which operate passenger services would also manage the tracks their trains run on, under government plans to fix ""creaking"" UK railways. East Coast mainline would be the first service to try the new model from 2020. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""It means when things go wrong, there's one team to sort it out"". The move is part of a new governmentrail strategy,externalthat could see the reopening of some lines that were closed in the 1960s. At the moment Network Rail, which is state-owned, looks after the track and other infrastructure while train services are operated by private companies. Mr Grayling said Network Rail was a ""big blob at the centre"" and said it ""makes sense"" to run trains and the track together. ""The system is creaking - it's bursting at the seams,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The East Coast mainline, which connects London, the North East and Scotland, would be the first of a ""new generation of long-term regional partnerships,"" he said. Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Trains' founder, said the current system of running the track and trains separately ""doesn't work"" and causes delays. He hasblamed a ""far too big"" Network Rail for causing disruption, adding: ""I've always said that having a single, centralised rail infrastructure provider across the UK doesn't work. ""There needs to be a greater local focus and [Mr Grayling's] announcement is a welcome move in this direction."" Meanwhile, some rail routes lost under Richard Beeching in the 1960s and British Rail in the 1970s could be restored. Some 4,000 miles of track was closed in the 1960s, mainly in rural areas, which became known as the Beeching cuts. Mr Grayling said rail lines would be re-opened if they unlock jobs, encourage house building, ease congestion and offer ""value for money"". Work on the Oxford to Cambridge route starts next summer, and plans to re-open routes around Bristol, Birmingham, Exeter and the North East are being considered. The government will also consider splitting up two of the biggest train operators - Great Western and GTR, which comprises Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern. That could result in one company running high-speed lines between London, Bristol and south Wales, while another runs local services across the South West. By BBC Transport Correspondent Richard Westcott: I have never met anyone in the rail industry - either pro- or anti-privatisation - who thinks it was a good idea to split up who runs the trains and who runs the track and signals. But that is what we have got. There have been plenty of stories about Network Rail teams arguing with train company teams about who should fix a problem and who should pay - causing plenty of unnecessary delays. Now, the government has said it will change things to create joint teams - with one boss, public and private working together, to solve problems on the line. The biggest experiment will be on the East Coast mainline, where Virgin-Stagecoach is struggling to make money and has become frustrated with the physical state of the line. A new public-private partnership is being set up to run the train and tracks together. But we have no idea yet how it will work, who will pay for things, or when passengers might feel the benefit. This video can not be played It has been announced that 4,000 miles of railway line and 2,000 stations will close. But Labour has called the ideas ""un-funded proposals"", with shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald describing the plans as ""unambitious"". ""The Tories' record is of delayed, downgraded and cancelled investment, huge disparities in regional transport spending and soaring fares that are pricing passengers off the railway,"" he said. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said it was a ""scandal"" that the plans did not consider publicly-owned railways. He said: ""The planned breaking up of Great Western and GTR is a massive admission of failure by the government but still they rule out the highly popular option of public ownership."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said the union would be ""pleased to see the lines cut by Beeching restored"". However, he said Mr Grayling's new plans would not boost jobs and housing, asking: ""Where is the bold strategic vision for rail - and integrated transport links - in this country?"" Councils and business have also been asked to submit proposals for new lines. However, the government has no plans to make new money available to fund any such suggestions, the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott said. Richard Beeching's brief as chairman of the British Transport Commission was simple: ""Make the railways pay."" British Rail was losing Â£140m a year when Dr Beeching took over the commission. His solution, announced on 27 March 1963, was equally straightforward - massive cuts. The Conservative government welcomed the report, but thousands of people - many in remote rural areas - were horrified they would lose their local branch lines. Opposition from the pressure groups failed and during the 1960s ""Beeching's Axe"" fell on 2,128 stations and more than 67,000 British Rail jobs.

Bellfield 'confessed' to Russell murders,"Serial killer Levi Bellfield is alleged to have confessed to one of the UK's most notorious murder cases. Lin Russell, 45, and daughter Megan, six, were killed months after moving to Kent from north Wales. Josie, nine, survived despite horrific injuries. Michael Stone was found guilty in 2001 largely on the strength of a disputed cell confession. When contacted by BBC Wales Bellfield denied being responsible for the murders and making any confession. Shaun and Lin Russell with daughters Megan (centre) and Josie (right) At a press conference on Wednesday by Stone's legal team, solicitor Paul Bacon said: ""We have seen evidence of a full confession by Levi Bellfield that he has admitted the Russell murders and in the confession Bellfield describes how he came across Lin Russell and her two children. ""How he attacked them with a hammer and he explains his motivation for the killing. The confession is detailed and has a number of facts that are not in the public domain. What is Levi Bellfield alleged to have said? ""We now have an independent witness who has seen Levi Bellfield close to the scene of the murders at about the time they were committed and importantly we have identified forensic material from the scene of the murders which corroborates the confession made by Levi Bellfield. Serial killer Bellfield worked as a bouncer, drug dealer and wheel clamping contractor ""The Russell murders by Levi Bellfield fits perfectly with his modus operandi. He is a man known to attack and murder women. His weapon of choice is a hammer. ""This material including the detailed confession is before the Criminal Cases Review Commission. We are of the view that this evidence must, as a matter of urgency be brought before the Court of Appeal."" This video can not be played Barbara Stone: Mick's been in prison 20 years too long Stone's legal team are calling for an independent police force to investigate the new evidence. They say all conversations had been written up contemporaneously and immediately reported to a solicitor by the prisoner who Bellfield allegedly confessed to. It is claimed Bellfield - currently serving two whole life terms - said he was worried about DNA advances saying ""my life in jail would be over if they could prove it was me"" and that it would ""tear his mother in two"". Known as the 'Bus Stop Killer', he randomly launched a so-called 'blitz attack' from behind, striking his victims repeatedly on the head with a hammer. Amelie Delagrange, murder; Kate Sheedy, attempted murder; Milly Dowler, abduction/murder; Marsha McDonnell, murder In 2011 the nightclub bouncer, drug dealer, and wheel-clamping contractor was convicted of abducting and murdering 13-year-old Milly Dowler as she walked home from school in Surrey in 2002. By then he had already been convicted of three other attacks in south west London - murdering 19-year-old Marsha McDonnell in 2003, Amelie Delagrange, 22, in 2004 and in the same year attempting to kill 18-year-old Kate Sheedy, by running her over. She survived her injuries. It is widely believed by detectives that Bellfield is responsible for numerous crimes dating back to the 1980s. Legal team Mark McDonald QC and solicitor Paul Bacon (centre) with Michael Stone's sister Barbara And this is not the first time his name has been linked with the Russell murders. Even though the attack happened over 20 years ago it remains one of the UK's most notorious cases. The mother and two daughters were attacked just before 16:30 BST on 9 July 1996, as they walked with the family dog home from school in Chillenden, near Dover. Half way along a country lane, they were accosted by a man, tied up, made to sit in a copse, blindfolded and bludgeoned with a claw hammer, one by one. A car had passed the Russells on the unmade track before the driver stopped and attacked them When they were found eight hours later; it was thought all were dead. Josie was found to have a faint pulse. Remarkably, she survived. She lives and works as an artist in north Wales, having returned to Gwynedd with her father soon after the attack. A year after the murders a tip off to Crimewatch from a psychologist who worked at a local psychiatric assessment centre, led to the arrest of 36-year-old Michael Stone from Gillingham. Michael Stone had a criminal history In October 1998, Stone, a heroin addict with a criminal history, was convicted. In the absence of any forensic evidence, the jury believed the main thrust of the prosecution's case - three prison inmates who claimed Stone had confessed. One of the inmates admitted soon after the trial ended that they had lied and another was discredited. Stone's legal team challenged his conviction. A retrial was ordered. But one of the inmates, Damien Daley, then aged 26, held firm to his claim that Stone had confessed to him in grisly detail. The judge's summing up to the jury was unequivocal: ""The case stands or falls on the alleged confession of Damian Daley."" In late 2001, Stone was once again found guilty and given three life sentences. As the judge addressed him, Stone cried out: ""It wasn't me your Honour, I didn't do it!"" Since then Stone has failed in two appeal bids. ""Given what we know about the lack of evidenceâ¦ presented to the jury in the actual trial,"" Stone's barrister Mark McDonald QC says, ""this confession is so profound, significant, that it goes to the heart of the conviction of Michael Stone. It's unsafe."" Bellfield denies any part in the murders or making a confession When asked to respond to the possibility of new allegations in this case, Kent Police said that Stone's protests of innocence had been thoroughly tested by the judicial system. Ever since Bellfield's conviction for the murder of Milly Dowler, Stone's legal team have claimed Bellfield may have been responsible for the Russell murders. Meanwhile, Bellfield has been contacted by BBC Wales Investigates and denies both the murders and the confession. He claims he has three letters from Stone and has complained about his ""persistent attempts"" to get him to take responsibility. He also alleges Stone has offered to give him a share of any compensation money he might get. Lie detector test Stone vehemently denies this. Bellfield added that he had challenged Stone to a lie detector test. Stone has spoken about his reluctance to do this claiming he had been advised that his history of psychiatric problems and drug addiction could impact its accuracy. Recently there has been a war of words between the two convicted killers from behind bars at Durham's Frankland prison where they are both being held, which has been reported in newspapers. A BBC Two investigation of the Russell murders entitled The Chillenden Murders was broadcast in June this year. A panel of experts was given access to all case files to re-examine the evidence. It is this programme which is claimed to have prompted Bellfield's alleged confession. The panel concluded that despite advancements in DNA there was still no forensic link to Stone and it was likely another man was at the scene.

India hotel guest 'stole 120 TVs',"Bangalore police with Vasudev Nanaiah and some of the television sets he allegedly stole A man has been arrested for allegedly stealing more than 120 television sets from budget hotels across southern India over a four-month period. A senior police officer told BBC Hindi's Imran Qureshi that hotel staff never suspected Vasudev Nanaiah as he was a ""decent and well-behaved"" guest. Mr Nanaiah would check in carrying a ""fairly large suitcase"", police said. He had been caught stealing a TV from a hotel in October and was out on bail when arrested again. Police alleged he went back to stealing within days of leaving prison. Deputy commissioner of police Chetan Singh Rathor said that if Mr Nanaiah's suitcase was too small, ""he would assess the size of the TV set in the room and get a new one"". ""He would walk in and out of the hotel on some pretext so many times that the hotel reception would not realise when he had walked out with the TV set never to return,'' Mr Rathor said. Mr Nanaiah was caught after the man to whom he allegedly tried to sell the television sets informed the police. Bangalore police have filed 21 cases of theft and are hoping for a longer jail term. A court will decide whether he requires a psychiatric evaluation.

Loan sharks 'hang around the school gates',"Loan sharks have stood at school gates handing out cards to children as they leave, suggesting mums call them if they need new trainers. Illegal money lenders have also stationed themselves outside food banks, in casinos, or outside post offices to wait for pensioners. The reports come in a new review by the Financial Conduct Authority aiming to shed light on criminals' activities. It concluded that borrowing from these people is ""a way of life"" for many. However, the FCA said there was no evidence of a particular rise in this black market. Fears had been raised thata crackdown on payday lenders, who are regulated and licensed by the City watchdog, could lead to some people being turned down for loans following stricter affordability checks and turn to loan sharks instead. These are some of the stories told by debt advisors and others during theFCA investigation,external: ""One lender coerced a borrower who owed him money into setting up a cannabis farm in his spare room. They put the risk onto their victims and control them through debt and fear."" ""Pensioners borrowed small sums week to week, paying back the money to the loan shark at the post office when they get their pension. Sometimes the lender held the pensioners' cards or passbooks between pension payment days."" ""In one estate loan sharks were hanging around the school gate, handing out their details on cards to the children as they left school, telling them to get their mums to ring them if they wanted new trainers."" ""One young woman was punched in the face at a house party in front of a room full of her peers as punishment for non-payment. No-one would report the attacker even though many people saw what happened and who had done it."" The common thread among borrowers, according to the report, is that their income has fallen short and they need money urgently. Many go to under-the-table lenders at work, with numerous reports of this lending going on in hospitals or in rural areas. Lenders, when they tell people what they charge, expect to be paid interest of Â£167 on a Â£250 loan. This is an extortionate rate of interest, but the FCA says that some illegal money lenders actually undercut the regulated money lending industry. Many illegal lenders are trying to pass on stolen cash as loans. Failing to repay can have serious consequences for borrowers. Non-payers can expect to be ""threatened or exposed"" on social media, according to the report. Others have been coerced into prostitution and drug running, or fear the safety of their family owing to retribution. The FCA is conducting an inquiry into high-cost credit, and as part of this has reviewed the effect of stricter rules facing payday lenders, such as checking borrowers' ability to repay. It has stuck to its estimates that 5% of people turned down for a loan with regulated lenders would consider going to loan sharks. The regulator has already suggested that charges for unarranged bank overdrafts could be banned. It has also highlighted concerns about the rent-to-own market, typically used by consumers to buy fridges, freezers and televisions. Figures published by the Bank of England on Wednesday show that unsecured borrowing through loans, overdrafts and credit cards is still growing at 9.6% a year, but this rate had slowed slightly during the summer.

Julius Caesar's invasion site 'uncovered',"This video can not be played Archaeologists have identified Pegwell Bay as the place they believe the Romans landed Archaeologists believe they may have uncovered the first evidence of Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain in 54BC. The discovery of a defensive ditch and weapons led them to identify Pegwell Bay in Thanet, Kent, as the place they believe the Romans landed. The ditch, in the nearby hamlet of Ebbsfleet, was part of a large fort, the University of Leicester team says. Its location was consistent with clues provided by Caesar's own account of the invasion, the team said. Archaeologists from the University of Leicester believe the ditch was part of a large fort in Kent The team found part of a Roman pilum - a type of javelin Caesar's 54BC invasion, which ultimately ended in retreat, came almost 100 years before Claudius's conquest in AD43. The 5m-wide ditch was discovered during an excavation ahead of a new road being built. The university said its shape was very similar to Roman defences found in France. It is thought it formed part of a large fort protecting Caesar's ships on the nearby beach. Born into a prestigious patrician family in 100BC, he became one of the key figures in 1st Century BC Roman politics. He formed a political pact, known as the First Triumvirate, with Pompey and Crassus. After successful military campaigns against the Gauls he invaded Britain, where he was eventually forced into retreat. He defeated Pompey in a civil war and declared himself dictator, but was famously assassinated by Brutus, Cassius and other senators in 44BC. His adopted son Octavian became Augustus, the first Roman Emperor. Julius Caesar's invasion of Britain came almost 100 years before Claudius's successful conquest in AD43 Pottery found at the site was consistent with the 54BC arrival date and the team also found iron weapons, including a Roman javelin. Archaeologist Dr Andrew Fitzpatrick said descriptions from Caesar's account of the invasion - which describes him leading a force of about 800 ships, 20,000 soldiers and 2,000 cavalry - suggested it was the correct landing site. ""The presence of cliffs, the existence of a large open bay, and the presence of higher ground nearby, are consistent with the 54BC landing having been in Pegwell Bay,"" he said. ""It's a big force, and you need a big landing place, because simply to land that number of vessels you need a big front. ""We think that the location of the site fits very closely with what Julius Caesar gives in a series of clues - he doesn't tell us in detail, but he gives some snippets, and by piecing those snippets together we think it fits very well."" Dr Fitzpatrick said the low-lying, coastal nature of the site was ""defending the coast rather than looking inland"", which led them to believe it could be Caesar's base. The defensive ditch is about two metres deep Prof Colin Haselgrove, who led the investigation, said it was likely treaties set up in the wake of Caesar's invasion made it easier for the Romans to conquer parts of Britain almost 100 years later. He said: ""The conquest of south-east England seems to have been rapid, probably because the kings in the region were already allied to Rome. ""This was the beginning of the permanent Roman occupation of Britain, which included Wales and some of Scotland and lasted for almost 400 years."" The findings will be explored further as part of Digging For Britain, on BBC Four at 21:00 GMT and afterwards on BBC iPlayer.

"Mothers not told of stillbirth filming""Serious concerns"" are raised over the filming of a TV documentary about stillbirths at a hospital.3h3 hours agoCambridgeshire","This video can not be played Cameras with warnings have been put up in Clinic 23 of the Rosie Hospital A charity says it has ""serious concerns"" about a hospital which has allowed women to be unwittingly filmed at critical points in their pregnancy. Cameras and a written notice have been put up at the Rosie Hospital, Cambridge for a Channel 4 stillbirth documentary. One mother who was filmed said she thought the idea of installing cameras was ""morally wrong"". Production company True Vision said no footage would be viewed or downloaded without the patient's permission. The cameras, which film 24 hours a day, are in a section of the maternity unit mothers are taken to if they have serious problems after their first trimester. The devices have been in position for three months. Healthcare professionals do not tell patients the cameras are there but notices in the room do warn that filming is taking place. If there is a stillbirth at a later date, a member of staff asks if the woman would give her consent to talk to the film crew and give permission for the footage to be shown. Cambridge University Hospitals said it took part in the documentary after women claimed there was not enough information on stillbirth The recording is automatically deleted after a certain amount of time if permission is not given. Tara, a mother who discovered she had been filmed but whose pregnancy turned out to be healthy, said she felt the filming was ""morally wrong"" adding: ""I think if I was receiving bad news the last thing I would want is to share it with a camera."" The human rights charity Birthrights has written to the hospital saying it had ""serious concerns"" over ""whether consent is being lawfully obtained and whether women are being treated in a respectful way"". The charity, which acknowledged the ""potential benefits of a sensitively made documentary"" about stillbirths, said: ""Such a filming project would engage individuals' right to privacy, which is a reasonable expectation for medical procedures, consultations and examinations."" A spokesman for True Vision said: ""Patients are made aware that that filming is taking place in parts of the clinic but that no footage of them will be viewed or downloaded in any way without their express permission. ""Anyone approached to take part in the programme will have the implications of taking part in filming clearly explained and all contributors have the right to withdraw their consent at any time. Dr Jeremy Brockelsby, clinical lead for women's services at Cambridge University Hospitals, said it took part in the documentary after women said there was not enough information on stillbirth. He added: ""Because of the sensitivity of the subject, we established a robust consent process with True Vision to safeguard women who visit [the critical care clinic].""

Uber says 2.7m Brits hit by breach,"Uber had not previously revealed exactly how many of the affected users were UK-based Uber has revealed,externalthat 2.7 million British riders and drivers were affected by a 2016 data breach that itcovered up for more than a year. A total of 57 million worldwide had data exposed in the breach, but the firm had not specified how many were UK-based before. The stolen information includes names, email addresses and phone numbers and - for US drivers - licence numbers. Uber should notify UK users who have been affected, the data regulator said. According to Uber, the 2.7 million figure is ""approximate rather than an accurate and definitive account"" - this is because the information gathered by the firm's app does not always specify where users live. A spokesman for Uber told the BBC the firm is not able to clarify how many UK drivers are included in the 2.7 million. The firm has said it has a total of five million active users and 50,000 drivers in the UK. The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) had previously said it had""huge concerns"" about the breach. Responding to the latest news, a spokesman for the ICO said: ""As part of our investigation we are still waiting for technical reports which should give full confirmation of the figures and the type of personal data that has been compromised."" ""We would expect Uber to alert all those affected in the UK as soon as possible."" Similarly, the UK's Minister of State for Digital, Matt Hancock, said, ""The Government expects Uber to respond fully to the incident with the urgency it demands and to provide the appropriate support to its customers and drivers in the UK."" The ICO believes the data could be used by scammers trying to target victims of the breach. Both Uber and the ICO have directed users toadvice from the UK's National Cyber Security Centre,externalthat was published following news of the breach. The latest development was described as ""shocking"" by London Mayor Sadiq Khan. ""Uber needs to urgently confirm which of their customers are affected, what is being done to ensure these customers don't suffer adversely, and what action is being taken to prevent this happening again in the future,"" he said. When news of the breach was revealed last week, chief executive Dara Khosrowshahi said, ""None of this should have happened, and I will not make excuses for it."" The story was firstbroken by Bloomberg,external, which reported that Uber not only sought to cover up the incident but also paid hackers $100,000 (Â£75,000) to delete the data they had stolen.

Commander in Tweet,"Trump's Twitter page in April 2009 Donald Trump's Twitter account wasn't always the powerful spectacle it has become. Journalist Adam Harris goes through the archives to see how it evolved. In the month since the election, Mr Trump has taken to Twitter to lambast what he views as unfavourable media coverage, rail against corporations who might take jobs overseas and defend his phone calls with international leaders. Journalists and pundits are still trying to discover if there is a method to Mr Trump's Twitter madness. We looked at his seven-year Twitter history to see what could be learned. His interaction with Twitter began much like any other high profile account managed by a group of marketing professionals. In May 2009, Mr Trump, then a private businessman, sent his first tweet promoting a forthcoming appearance on the Late Show with David Letterman. At the time, Peter Costanzo, a marketing staffer at his publishing company, suggested a social media push for Mr Trump's book, Think Like a Champion. Someone had been sending out parody tweets under the @DonaldTrump hashtag, and so the businessman took @RealDonaldTrump, Costanzo told journalist Jacob Weisberg onthe Slate Trumpcast.,external There were tweets about The Apprentice, his appearances, family milestones and quotes from Mr Trump himself. The tweets directly from him were usually tagged ""from Donald Trump,"" but rarely veered into politics. By June 2011, tweets no longer acknowledged whether they were directly from Mr Trump or originated with his team and the lines between his businesses and political pursuits began to blur. Mr Trump began criticising Republicans for plans toget rid of Medicare,externaland President Barack Obama for Obamacare, spending andtaking vacations,external. Hetweeted:,external""China is our enemy, they want to destroy us."" There was also a shift in how often the President-elect tweeted. From May 2009 until the end of May 2011, it was slightly more than 275 times. He more than doubled that in the last six months of 2011, with his Twitter output accelerating from nearly 150 tweets a year to more than 100 tweets a month. In 2016, he averaged 375 tweets a month through to the end of November, according to TrumpTwitterArchive.com, a searchable database dedicated to cataloguing all of Mr Trump's tweets. Mr Trump announced his candidacy for the president of the United States in on 16 June 2015. Ahead of his announcement, he retweeted more than a dozen tweetscelebrating,externalthe idea of aTrump run,external. Employing a now-outdated form of retweeting, which places quotes around the text you wish to share, Trump has manually retweeted other accounts roughly 10,000 times. In 2015, staffers at Gawker Mediacreated a bot,externalthat tweeted Benito Mussolini quotes and attributed them to Mr Trump, who in Februaryretweeted the account.,external In January, Mr Trumpretweeted Twitter user,external""WhiteGenocideTM,"" whose profile linked to a website containing a pro-Adolf Hitler documentary and whose Twitter feed ""was largely a collection of retweets about violence allegedly committed by African-American suspects and anti-Arab posts,"" according to CNN. He faced an almost immediate backlash, but did not delete the tweet, which attacks former Republican rival Jeb Bush. Less than a month later, Mr Trump again retweeted ""WhiteGenocideTM."" The tweet read, ""You always have the best crowds. #MakeAmericaGreatAgain,"" and wasdeleted two minutes later,external. Mr Trump recently retweeted several fans who were mocking CNN reporter Jeff Zeleny. One of those fans,a 16-year-old,external, tweeted, ""@jeffzeleny Pathetic â you have no sufficient evidence that Donald Trump did not suffer from voter fraud, shame! Bad reporter"" Early in 2015, Mr Trump was asked by a reporter whetherhe agrees with what he retweets,external. ""I do retweets, and I mean, to a certain extent, I do, yeah. I think that's right. Do you want me to say no? You know, I retweet, I retweet for a reason,"" he said. But Mr Trump still prefers tweets to more traditional media - he hasn't held a press conference since 27 July. Although he has only given a handful of interviews since being elected, he has tweeted more than 130 times about topics ranging from themedia,externaltoforeign policy,externaltodomestic affairs,external. Indeed, Mr Trump does favour tweets over contact with the press - a policy he tweeted out, of course. ""If the press would cover me accurately & honourably,"" he tweeted on Monday, ""I would have far less reason to 'Tweet'."" On the other hand, his tweets appear to be influenced by the media - his tweet that said flag burners should be jailed came roughly 30 minutes after Fox News ran a story on flag burners. And on 29 November, Mr Trump tweeted that Green Party nominee Jill Stein's recount effort was a ""scam"", joined by ""badly defeated"" Democrats. The tweet, however, followed a Fox News segment reporting that the Clinton campaign would join the recount efforts in Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. As the President-elect, Mr Trump's tweets have added import. On Tuesday, Mr Trump criticised Boeing for the price tag associated with the manufacture of Air Force One, which he said would cost taxpayers $4bn. The company saw a near immediate dent in its share prices, but recovered after revealing that it does not yet have the contract to build it. Instead it has a development deal with the government. ""We are currently under contract for $170 million to help determine the capabilities of these complex military aircraft that serve the unique requirements of the President of the United States,"" said Boeing spokesman Todd Belcher in a statement. ""We look forward to working with the US Air Force on subsequent phases of the programme allowing us to deliver the best planes for the president at the best value for the American taxpayer."" It took six years after being inaugurated for Mr Obama to give up his Blackberry. According to senior advisor Kellyanne Conway, who spoke during in an interview with Jake Tapper, it is still undecided whether Trump will continue to have personal access to his Twitter account when he assumes office.

More stories from across Yorkshire Police said a car crashed into a tree in the Meanwood area of Leeds on Saturday night Appearing in the glass-fronted dock wearing a tracksuit, the boy had his left arm in a sling and with visible injuries to his right eye. Answering to district judge Marie Mallon, he spoke only to give his name, address and date of birth. After he was remanded in custody, the boy leaned his head against the glass and cried as he spoke to a man and a woman believed to be his parents. He moved his fingers through the gaps in the court security barrier for the woman to hold before he was led away. The boy is due to appear at Leeds Crown Court on 13 December.

Apple rushes to fix major password bugA remarkably simple flaw in Apple's Mac operating system has been discovered.11h11 hours agoTechnology,"Apple said it was working on a fix to the problem - but has offered a workaround Apple has said it is working to fix a serious bug within its Mac operating system. The flaw in MacOS High Sierra - the most recent version - makes it possible to gain entry to the machine without a password, and also have access to powerful administrator rights. âWe are working on a software update to address this issue,â Apple said in a statement. The bug was discovered by Turkish developer Lemi Ergin. He found that by entering the username ""root"", leaving the password field blank, and hitting ""enter"" a few times, he would be granted unrestricted access to the target machine. Mr Ergin faced criticism for apparently not following responsible disclosure guidelines typically observed by security professionals. Those guidelines instruct security experts to notify companies of flaws in their products, giving them a reasonable amount of time to fix the flaw before going public. Mr Ergin did not respond to those claims when asked on Twitter, and the BBC was unable to reach him on Tuesday. Apple would not confirm or deny whether it knew about the flaw beforehand. However,a member of Apple's support forums had posted details of the flaw,externalmore than two weeks ago, though the message appears to suggest the vulnerability could be a useful feature for troubleshooting rather than a critical security threat. The exploit Considering the power it gives, the bug is remarkably simple, described by security experts as a ""howler"" and ""embarrassing"". Those with root access can do more than a normal user, such as read and write the files of other accounts on the same machine. A superuser could also delete crucial system files, rendering the computer useless - or install malware that typical security software would find hard to detect. Typically, the bug cannot be exploited remotely, meaning for most users the threat only exists if a malicious person has physical access to the machine. That said, if remote access has been granted to the computer for some other reason, such as offering tech support, then the flaw could be executed using that connection. The timing of the disclosure presents a major issue to Apple as it now must hurriedly put in place a fix before the vulnerability can be exploited by criminals. ""Haste and security donât make good bedfellows,â said Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey. ""They will need to be careful the patch doesnât introduce some other problem as theyâve not had time to properly test it."" While Apple works on its fix, it offered a workaround for users concerned about the bug. âSetting a root password prevents unauthorized access to your Mac,â the company explained. ""To enable the Root User and set a password, please follow the instructions here:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012,external.

Secrecy row over Brexit papers,"This video can not be played Keir Starmer asks about the existence of the documents but Robin Walker says they did not ""exist in the form requested"". Parliament is being treated with contempt over the partial release of Brexit documents, Labour has claimed. MPs will see for the first time later studies of how the UK's exit will affect 58 sectors of the economy, but certain sections will not be released. Ministers say they are being as ""open as possible"" but some sensitive details which risk ""undermining the UK's negotiating hand"" will be kept private. Labour said the will of Parliament was being ignored and transparency ditched. The 850-pages of documents - which MPs demanded be published in a vote earlier this month - has been handed to the Commons and Lords Brexit committees, whose members will begin to study it in private later. 'I gave up my job to fight Brexit' Brexit minister Robin Walker said he hoped the ""accessible and informative"" material would be made available to all MPs in due course - in a reading room - but defended the removal of commercially sensitive details which he suggested could damage the UK's negotiating strategy. But Labour MP Hilary Benn, who chairs the Brexit committee, said it was ""their job"" to decide what was published and he objected to the suggestion it could not be trusted to respect confidentiality. In other Brexit news, a Downing Street source said there was no settlement on the UK's so-called divorce bill, as newspaper reports - citing a range of figures - claimed it had been agreed. David Davis pictured during his appearance before the Brexit committee There has been huge speculation about what is in the Brexit papers, which reportedly run to 800 pages. Until now only senior ministers and civil servants knew what was in the papers, which were kept in a safe overnight in several lever arch folders. The Commons and Lords Brexit committee will starting reading them in private later, while they have also been shared with the Scottish and Welsh governments and Northern Irish officials. But there are bits which they won't be able to see because they have either been handed over with bits blacked out, or not been handed over by ministers. Allow Twitter content?

The BBC's economics editor Kamal Ahmed says he has been told that the reports are not - as has been claimed by some - in-depth ""impact assessments"". He says they will not put a figure on the costs to different industries if there is no comprehensive free trade agreement between the UK and EU after the UK leaves in March 2019. The government says the reports will show the size of each of the sectors, their worth to the UK economy and how they are regulated at the moment within the EU single market and customs union. The letter from Davis Davis to the committee was not well received by some In a letter to the Commons committee, Brexit Secretary David Davis said certain details were being kept private because there was no guarantee all of the 21 MPs on the committee would keep them secret. One Conservative member of the committee, Craig McKinlay, has backed this stance, suggesting some of his fellow committee members may ""use this information against the national interest"". The cross-party committee, he told the BBC, was ""deeply divided"" between those ""refighting the referendum"" and those who want to ""move on"" and he trusted the government to decide what information to share. ""If we get this wrong, it could cost the country billions,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today. This video can not be played Sir Keir Starmer says the government could be in contempt of Parliament if it withholds Brexit data from MPs Earlier this month, MPs voted for the documents to be released, although Conservative MPs abstained. Ministers claim the analysis ""does not exist in the form Parliament requested"" and claim they have satisfied the terms of the parliamentary motion, but Labour disagrees and says the MPs' decision was clearly ""binding"".

""Whether he's in contempt of parliament is a matter we'll come to at some later date - but he's certainly treating parliament with contempt."" Many Tory MPs, including prominent Brexiteers, also criticised the government's actions, Philip Hollobone telling MPs it was ""skating on very thin parliamentary ice"". Speaking in Parliament, the SNP's Pete Wishart said the ""government must be held accountable for its failure to comply"" but Commons Speaker John Bercow said any MPs alleging contempt of Parliament must write to him officially, assuring them he would respond promptly. It is up to the Speaker to rule on whether Parliamentary rules have been flouted and to decide whether to refer it to the Committee on Standards and Privileges for investigation. Read Laura Kuenssberg's take on the row Kamal Ahmed on economic costs The amount of money the UK will pay as part of Brexit has been one of the main sticking points in the first round of negotiations with the EU. Brussels has consistently called for the UK to put more cash on the table and last week Theresa May won ministers' backing to increase the offer. According to theDaily Telegraph,externaland theFinancial Times,external, agreement has been reached between the two sets of negotiators on how the bill could be calculated.

Blog: Meanwhile in Brussels...,"Formal negotiations between the UK and EU began in June If you can tear yourself away from episode 75 of the saga over the government's existent or non-existent Brexit papers, there is something pretty important going on in Brussels as we speak. It could determine whether or not the prime minister gets her way next month and manages to move on from the purgatory of the first phase of the Brexit talks - relieving, if only temporarily, some of the pressure on her to show that she has even a loose grip on the whole procedure. The test, which is a ultimately a political judgement, is, as we've discussed here before, whether the negotiations are deemed to havemade 'sufficient progress'to move on to discussions about the long-term relationship between the UK and the EU. So with the mood music suggesting the bill is broadly settled - although there is no final precise agreement - what happens next? Secrecy row over Brexit papers 'I gave up my job to fight Brexit' To hammer the over-used divorce metaphor, for eight months they've been arguing over who gets the vinyl collection, the pot plants, and who keeps the house - the next stage is over who gets long-term custody of the kids. As we've been reporting, none of the three primary areas - money, citizens' rights or Ireland - are yet settled enough for the ""sufficient progress"" hurdle to be cleared. But there has been plenty of movement in the first two areas, and it's on number three, the Irish border, that there is still the most distance to travel. There is though careful choreography being put in place to try to get the summit in the middle of next month to be the magic moment. So in theory, all the officials and politicians who have been living and breathing this for weeks can collapse with exhaustion for the Christmas holidays. Theresa May can tell her backbenches and the British business community that she is on track, that they can go away and gorge on Christmas pudding and come back and worry about the longer term next year - she hopes. Here is how it might, just might, work, if the stars align. And if you are not interested in the sausage machine of how EU deals are done, it might be better to look away now. Both sides are discussing now whether the two key officials, Olly Robbins (the PM's top Brexit adviser) on the UK side, and Sabine Weyand  (Michel Barnier's deputy) on the EU side can produce a joint paper, what's been described to me as an ""agreed truth"", before next Monday. This video can not be played RTÃ's Europe editor tells Brexitcast that Ireland 'has one shot at this'. The idea is that the negotiating rivals can come together to formalise what has been agreed so far, to write it down in black and white so that the conclusions of phase one can be closed, signed off, and by implication, not unpicked at a later stage in the future dramas of the second bit of the deal-making. In the possible scenario that everyone likes it (and I'm not suggesting this is in any way a dead cert) the paper may be published at the end of this week potentially. The message from negotiators to the rest of the EU - this is where we agree that we have got to, up to you to agree whether, in political terms, that is progress enough. And remember while the decision to move on or not lies officially with the European Council, the 27 political leaders, they will act on the basis of what's recommended by their negotiating team. So if the joint paper does emerge, it will be a big hint that moving on is nigh. One Brussels source suggests however that it is just ""one of the options"" and there is a ""lot of work to do"" before that document can be agreed, let alone come blinking into the glare of the public domain. I'm told that officials are discussing precisely this over the next few days. If that happens though, it's possible that the Brexit Secretary David Davis will also make the journey to Brussels next Monday and potentially give a press conference alongside Michel Barnier, declaring the conclusions of both sides at this critical junction - with the prime minister expected to follow for lunch or more likely dinner with the president of the Commission, Jean Claude Juncker that day too. Sources suggest these steps are vital so both sides ""know where we stand"" before the political preparation to get the EU leaders to sign on the dotted line at the summit in the middle of next month. Nothing is fixed about these scenarios but both sides agree that next Monday looks like being a critical day. The next step in this vital choreography is expected then to be a meeting of EU ambassadors and the leaders' 'sherpas', their senior officials, on 6 December, again in Brussels. From then on the discussion moves to drafting the actual conclusions that Theresa May and her counterparts can agree. And if, if, that all goes well, (the further on in the process, the bigger the 'IF' becomes), then the agreement could be ready to go for a relatively smooth discussion when the leaders sit down together on 14 December. Maybe. Nothing about this is definite. There are still things to be resolved and pressure particularly on the UK to find a form of words that gives more concrete commitment on its ambitions to keep the Irish border as free as possible. It's not clear this will be enough. The Irish border has become a key issue in Brexit negotiations One source on this side of the Channel told me ""we can't do more than be as reassuring as we can"". But in Brussels the whole situation is still described as ""very difficult"", saying ""it's not just about a few cameras in a few trees, it's a much more serious political issue than that"". But what the UK hopes for is enough progress in the next vital few days to get a straightforward green light to move on to the next phase. If not, there is, it's suggested in London, a middle ground where progress on citizens' rights and the money are agreed, with Ireland to be settled at a later date - although a bucket of freezing water was thrown over that by others in the EU where I'm told there has been no real discussion of such a halfway marker. Or, it's still possible that there is an almighty bust up. There are plenty of unresolved issues that could trip things up - an Irish veto over the UK position on the border; what happens to child benefit for EU citizens in Britain; a failure to agree more on the role of the European court, or the EU presses Theresa May too hard on the money. There could yet be a falling out over her desire to make the financial settlement conditional on trade and transition, what could be yet, in the words of an EU source ""a deal breaker for the 27"". If it's all off in December, well who knows. The prime minister could end up with what feels like a political crisis - Eurosceptics pushing her in one direction to walk away from the talks, and an equal and opposite force in the other direction, the business lobby pulling her hard to get back to the table immediately. The prospect of that clash perhaps makes the ongoing mess over the mysterious Brexit papers that either do, or don't, really exist feel like a walk in the park.

"Breaking|Breaking newsTrump account retweets anti-Muslim videosDonald Trump's Twitter account has retweeted three inflammatory videos from the far-right group, Britain First.5m5 minutes agoUS & Canada","This video can not be played The White House says Trump's Britain First tweets were about border security Donald Trump has retweeted three inflammatory videos from a British far-right group. The first tweet from Jayda Fransen, the deputy leader of Britain First, claims to show a Muslim migrant attacking a man on crutches. This was followed by two more videos of people Ms Fransen claims to be Muslim. Responding to Mr Trump's posts, UK Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said it was ""wrong for the president to have done this"". White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said Mrs May and other world leaders knew that ""these are real threats that we have to talk about"". ""Whether it's a real video, the threat is real,"" she said. The original video was shared by US conservative commentator Ann Coulter who Mr Trump follows. Trump wrong to share far-right videos - UK PM Why is Britain First big online? What do the videos Trump retweeted actually show? The first video purportedly shows a ""Muslim migrant"" attacking a young Dutch man on crutches. However, the claim in this tweet appears to have little substance. A spokesperson from the Dutch Public Prosecution Service told the BBC that the person arrested for the attack ""was born and raised in the Netherlands"" and was not a migrant, as claimed in the social media post.

The second video retweeted by Mr Trump shows a man smashing a statue of the Virgin Mary. This video was uploaded to YouTube in 2013. The man in the clip says: ""No-one but Allah will be worshipped in the land of the Levant,"" which could place him in Syria. The third video originates from the riots that took place in Egypt in 2013, and shows a man being pushed from the top of a building in Alexandria. In 2015, those involved in the the incident were prosecuted, and one man was executed. Read more about the videos here. The tweets were flagged as containing sensitive material by Twitter Britain First was founded in 2011 by former members of the far-right British National Party (BNP). The group has grabbed attention on social media with controversial posts about what they deem ""the Islamification of the UK"". It has put up members to run in European elections and by-elections on anti-immigration and anti-abortion policies, but has not secured any seats. It also contested the most recent London mayoral election, receiving 1.2% of the vote. But its social media strategy has made it much more successful online than at the ballot box. The party has nearly 2 million likes on Facebook - dwarfing the main UK political parties. Ms Fransen, the group's deputy leader, has been charged with using ""threatening, abusive or insulting words or behaviour""during speeches she made in Belfast. She will appear at Belfast Magistrates' Court on Thursday 14 December. You can read more about Britain First here. Jayda Fransen has more than 52,000 followers on Twitter Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC News North America Reporter Donald Trump is once again using Twitter to weigh in on contentious religious-tinged political issues in the UK. In the past, he accused London Mayor Sadiq Khan of mishandling a militant attack just hours after it occurred. He misattributed a rise in crime in England and Wales to the ""spread of radical Islamic terror"". Now, he has retweeted a series of unverified videos posted by a far-right British nationalist group. For the president, directing attention toward the UK seems to serve a domestic political purpose. He cites events and opinions there as a warning to Americans of what could happen in the US if they do not heed his policy prescriptions on immigration and border security. The Muslim ban, the US-Mexico wall, increased deportations, the sharp reductions on refugee resettlement - it's all part of the president's ""national security"" package. While most Americans probably haven't heard of Britain First and are unfamiliar with European radical nationalist movements, there are white supremacist groups in the US that follow the actions of these overseas operations quite closely. The president on Wednesday signalled that he watches them too. Read more from Anthony Zurcher here. Mr Trump's decision to retweet the videos met with dismay on social media. Brendan Cox, whose wife, British MP Jo Cox, was murdered by a right-wing extremist who shouted ""Britain first"" before committing the act, has condemned the action. Allow Twitter content?

"Free ATMs 'must be available across UK'Nicky Morgan, of the Treasury Committee, says any fall in the number of ATMs would ""clearly be of concern"".12h12 hours agoBusiness","The network that oversees free-to-use cash machines across the UK must ensure there is an even spread of ATMs across the country, an influential MP says. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, said any big fall in the number of ATMs would ""clearly be of concern"". She has written to the head of the Link network amid debate over an overhaul of the system. There are fears of ""ATM deserts"" but Link said such worries were misplaced. Who do we trust after cash? Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future? Under proposals published earlier this month, Link would reduce the amount it charges card issuers to allow customers to use the machines from around 25p per withdrawal to 20p. It said the changes - which would come into effect next April - would help protect the network, which currently includes 55,000 free-to-use machines. However, the ATM Industry Association said that this could cause problems of access for customers - a concern picked up by Ms Morgan and her committee of MPs. ""It seems intuitive that a 20% reduction in the interchange fee received by an ATM operator may mean that some machines are no longer economically viable,"" she said, noting that there were plans for subsidies when an ATM was not viable. Her letter asks what assurances can be provided to the Treasury Committee that the proposals will preserve the existing geographical spread of ATMs and have no negative impact on financial inclusion. It also asks how many ATMs are projected to close as a result of the proposals and what arrangements will be in place to monitor ATM changes. Sir Mark Boleat, who chairs Link and to whom the letter is addressed, said: ""We do not envisage any scenario where there will be areas of the UK which will not continue to have free access to their money. ""Our proposals include a strong financial inclusion programme that will ensure that there is positive impact on financial inclusion."" However, Ron Delnevo, executive director of the ATM Industry Association, said: ""It is wonderful news that the Treasury Select Committee is examining this threat to financial inclusion with the urgency that it warrants. ""It is now essential that Link addresses these concerns with adequate and detailed responses before rushing through any ill-considered decisions, which threaten the viability and vitality of thousands of communities around the UK by denying them access to cash from free ATMs."" Free cash machines could be cut back Cash 'lives on' after 50 years of ATMs Can a bank in a box replace a branch?

War crimes suspect 'takes poison' in court,"This video can not be played Slobodan Praljak drank a small vial of liquid after his prison sentence was upheld A Bosnian Croat war criminal has died after drinking poison during an appeal hearing in The Hague. Slobodan Praljak, 72, died in hospital, with the UN court announcing that the courtroom was now ""a crime scene"". On hearing that his 20-year jail term had been upheld, the ex-commander of Bosnian Croat forces said he was not a criminal and then drank from a bottle. In 2013, he was sentenced for crimes in the city of Mostar during the Bosnian war from 1992-95. Praljak was one of six former Bosnian Croat political and military leaders up before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). They were attending the final appeals judgment to be handed down by the court. Though allies against the Bosnian Serbs in the war, Bosnian Croats and Muslims also fought each other for a period of 11 months, with Mostar seeing some of the fiercest fighting. Balkans war: a brief guide What now for victims? Exploring the corridors of the Hague tribunal After hearing the verdict, General Praljak stood and raised his hand to his mouth, tipped his head back and appeared to swallow a glass of liquid. ""I have taken poison,"" he said. Presiding judge Carmel Agius immediately suspended the proceedings and an ambulance was called. ""Okay,"" the judge said. ""We suspend the... We suspend... Please, the curtains. Don't take away the glass that he used when he drank something."" Emergency rescue workers were called into the court building to assist Slobodan Praljak An ambulance could later be seen arriving outside the tribunal while a helicopter hovered above the scene. Several emergency rescue workers also rushed into the building carrying equipment in backpacks. In a statement, the ICTY said Praljak ""was immediately assisted by the ICTY medical staff"". It said Praljak ""was transported to a nearby hospital to receive further medical assistance where he passed"".

""The government expresses its condolences to all victims of all crimes committed in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We voice dissatisfaction and regret about the verdict,"" Mr Plenkovic said. In Mostar, Bosnian Croats lit candles and prayed for Slobodan Praljak at a makeshift memorial Natacha Gaveau Ivanovic, Praljak's lawyer, told the BBC that she did not believe the tribunal treated her client fairly. ""I have no idea what happened and how it happened but for me what is very important, more important is why he did it,"" she said. The lawyer said she thought her client drank poison because he believed that he was an ""innocent man"". She said that he had the right to ""consider that"" because the tribunal ""didn't limit itself to judge just personal responsibility, they took on them to judge [the] politics of people, of a state, the history"". She added: ""It's very hard from the people who are from this country to accept that, and actually they cannot accept it."" Praljak, the former commander of the main staff of the Bosnian Croat defence forces (HVO), was jailed for crimes against humanity. Informed that soldiers were rounding up Muslims in Prozor in the summer of 1993, he had failed to make any serious efforts to stop the action, the UN war crimes tribunal found. Praljak had also failed to act on information that murders were being planned, as well as attacks on members of international organisations and the destruction of the city's historic Old Bridge and mosques. Mostar's Old Bridge has since been restored after being damaged during the war Those appearing with him included Jadranko Prlic, the former prime minister of the Bosnian Croats' breakaway statelet.

N Korea says new missile can hit entire US,"North Korea has repeatedly tested missiles this year, including this launch in July North Korea says it has successfully tested a new type of intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) that can reach the whole of continental United States. State television said Pyongyang had achieved its mission of becoming a nuclear state. The Hwasong-15 missile, described as its ""most powerful"", was launched in darkness early on Wednesday. It landed in Japanese waters but flew higher than any other missile the North had previously tested. The test, which defied international sanctions imposed over the North's weapons programme, drew swift international condemnation, with the UN Security Council due to convene an emergency session. South Korea responded by carrying out live-fire drills, launching one of its own ballistic missiles. South Korea launched a Hyunmoo-2 missile in response on Wednesday What do we know about the new missile? What damage could North Korea do? Are missiles a risk to planes? News of the launch was announced on state television in a special broadcast at midday, as well as in a report released by state news agency KCNA. Pyongyang says the missile reached an altitude of 4,475km (2,780 miles) and flew 950km in 53 minutes, close to independent estimates made by South Korea's military. The projectile, fired at a steep incline, did not fly over Japan as some have done in the past, and landed about 250km short of its northern coast, according to Japanese officials. North Korea haspreviously saidthat its projectiles can hit the US but this marks the first time it says it can do it with this new type of missile, which appears to be an upgraded version of previous models. KCNA added that North Korean leader Kim Jong-un, who personally signed off on the launch, ""declared with pride that now we have finally realised the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, the cause of building a rocket power"". This video can not be played North Korea missile 'higher' than previous tests, says US Defence Secretary Mattis The report said that ""as a responsible nuclear power and a peace-loving state"", North Korea would ""make every possible effort to serve the noble purpose of defending peace and stability of the world"". It said its weapons, meant as a defence against ""the US imperialists' nuclear blackmail policy"", would ""not pose any threat to any country"" as long as North Korean interests were not infringed upon. ""This is our solemn declaration."" Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? North Korea's missile programme This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? An analysis bythe US-based Union of Concerned Scientists concludes that,externalthe missile could have travelled more than 13,000km on a standard trajectory, thus reaching ""any part of the continental United States"". But it seems likely, the analysis adds, that the missile had a very light mock warhead, meaning it might lack the power to carry a nuclear payload, which is much heavier, over that distance. North Korea however says the Hwasong-15 could reach mainland US carrying a ""super-large heavy warhead"". Paul Adams, BBC News, Seoul The statement was read out by veteran North Korean presenter Ri Chun Hee, who usually delivers important announcements Experts believe North Korea is still two to three years away from the ultimate goal of being able to deliver a nuclear warhead successfully using an ICBM. This involves some of the most delicate, challenging technology. It is no good putting a nuclear weapon on an ICBM if the warhead disintegrates on its re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere. No-one really thinks North Korea has cracked this challenge yet. And what of Pyongyang's ""solemn declaration"" that its missiles won't pose a threat to anyone ""as long as the interests of the DPRK are not infringed upon""? It might sound like an olive branch but it is likely to be greeted with more than a little scepticism. Its ""interests"", after all, include the development of the most destructive weapons known to mankind. Most experts expect to see no let-up in Kim Jong-un's single-minded pursuit of a full nuclear capability. And that almost certainly means more sanctions and pressure by those countries, led by the United States, who are determined to stop him. Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe said such launches were intolerable Prior to North Korea's statement,US defence secretary James Mattis saidthe missile launch had gone  ""higher, frankly, than any previous shots they have taken"", and said North Korea posed a worldwide threat. US President Donald Trump was briefed while the missile was still in the air, the White House said. Afterwards he said: ""We will take care of it."" In other reaction: UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres said the launch had violated sanctions and shown ""complete disregard for the united view of the international community"" China expressed ""grave concern"" and urged all parties to show caution Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe called the launch an intolerable, violent act The Kremlin described the test as a ""provocation"" South Korean President Moon Jae-in accused the North of ""reckless"" behaviour but added that there was no choice but to keep applying sanctions The launch is the latest in a series of weapons tests that have raised tensions to unprecedented levels, as North Korea ignores criticism and continues to develop its nuclear and missile programmes.

Apple rushes to fix major password bug,"Apple said it was working on a fix to the problem - but has offered a workaround Apple has said it is working to fix a serious bug within its Mac operating system. The flaw in MacOS High Sierra - the most recent version - makes it possible to gain entry to the machine without a password, and also have access to powerful administrator rights. âWe are working on a software update to address this issue,â Apple said in a statement. The bug was discovered by Turkish developer Lemi Ergin. He found that by entering the username ""root"", leaving the password field blank, and hitting ""enter"" a few times, he would be granted unrestricted access to the target machine. Mr Ergin faced criticism for apparently not following responsible disclosure guidelines typically observed by security professionals. Those guidelines instruct security experts to notify companies of flaws in their products, giving them a reasonable amount of time to fix the flaw before going public. Mr Ergin did not respond to those claims when asked on Twitter, and the BBC was unable to reach him on Tuesday. Apple would not confirm or deny whether it knew about the flaw beforehand. However,a member of Apple's support forums had posted details of the flaw,externalmore than two weeks ago, though the message appears to suggest the vulnerability could be a useful feature for troubleshooting rather than a critical security threat. The exploit Considering the power it gives, the bug is remarkably simple, described by security experts as a ""howler"" and ""embarrassing"". Those with root access can do more than a normal user, such as read and write the files of other accounts on the same machine. A superuser could also delete crucial system files, rendering the computer useless - or install malware that typical security software would find hard to detect. Typically, the bug cannot be exploited remotely, meaning for most users the threat only exists if a malicious person has physical access to the machine. That said, if remote access has been granted to the computer for some other reason, such as offering tech support, then the flaw could be executed using that connection. The timing of the disclosure presents a major issue to Apple as it now must hurriedly put in place a fix before the vulnerability can be exploited by criminals. ""Haste and security donât make good bedfellows,â said Prof Alan Woodward from the University of Surrey. ""They will need to be careful the patch doesnât introduce some other problem as theyâve not had time to properly test it."" While Apple works on its fix, it offered a workaround for users concerned about the bug. âSetting a root password prevents unauthorized access to your Mac,â the company explained. ""To enable the Root User and set a password, please follow the instructions here:https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT204012,external. ""If a Root User is already enabled, to ensure a blank password is not set, please follow the instructions from the âChange the root passwordâ section.â Fuller instructions on how to set the root password werewritten up by MacRumors,external. For those not confident enough to change system settings like this, security experts advise simply - don't let your Mac out of your sight, and be sure to apply the system update when prompted.

"Brits Critics' Choice list is all-femaleJorja Smith, Stefflon Don and Mabel are nominated for the prestigious Critics' Choice award.1han hour agoEntertainment & Arts","Brits Critics' Choice nominees (L-R): Mabel, Jorja Smith and Stefflon Don Before they were famous, Sam Smith, Florence + The Machine, Adele and Emeli Sande were all tipped for success by the Brits' Critics' Choice award. This year's line-up has just been announced and, for the first time, it's an all-female field. Birmingham-born MC Stefflon Don is joined on the list by soul singers Jorja Smith and Mabel. The winner will be announced on 4 December, ahead of next year's Brit Awards. Stefflon Don has already tasted chart success this year, reaching the top 10 with Hurtin' Me, and featuring in Jax Jones' dance smash Instruction. Mabel, who is Neneh Cherry's youngest daughter, has also scored a top 10 hit with the slinky single Finders Keepers. All three artists are previous nominees for the BBC Sound Of... poll, which unveiled itslatest longlist on Monday. This year's Brit Award winners will receive a statue designed by artist Sir Anish Kapoor The Brit nominees were chosen by a panel of music industry experts - including critics, record label employees and the heads of the UK's biggest radio stations. More than 100 artists were considered, with each voter selecting their own shortlist of five up-and-coming artists. Last year's winner was soul star Rag N Bone Man, who went on to have the year's biggest-selling debut album. Before they become ubiquitous, brush up on the 2018 nominees below. MABEL Born in the mountains of Malaga, Mabel was raised between Spain, London and Stockholm. Like her parents, Neneh Cherry and Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey, her music is hard to classify, but it's rooted in the 90s R&B she used to dance to in her bedroom. Age:21 From:London Inspired by:Destiny's Child, Lauryn Hill, Brandy, Aaliyah For fans of:Rihanna, Jhene Aiko, SZA Did you know?Her nickname is Lil' Bassy because, as a child, she would fall asleep to the sound of speaker-rattling bass in her dad's recording studio. She says:""Being nominated for the Critics Choice award really is a dream come true for me.  So much hard work has gone into getting to this point, so to be acknowledged by something like the BRIT Awards means the world.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsWar crimes suspect 'takes poison' in courtWar crimes court hearing in The Hague suspended after accused apparently ""takes poison"" upon guilty verdict4m5 minutes agoEurope","This video can not be played Slobodan Praljak drank a small vial of liquid after his prison sentence was upheld A Bosnian Croat war criminal has died after drinking poison during an appeal hearing in The Hague. Slobodan Praljak, 72, died in hospital, with the UN court announcing that the courtroom was now ""a crime scene"". On hearing that his 20-year jail term had been upheld, the ex-commander of Bosnian Croat forces said he was not a criminal and then drank from a bottle. In 2013, he was sentenced for crimes in the city of Mostar during the Bosnian war from 1992-95. Praljak was one of six former Bosnian Croat political and military leaders up before the International Criminal Tribunal for the former Yugoslavia (ICTY). They were attending the final appeals judgment to be handed down by the court. Though allies against the Bosnian Serbs in the war, Bosnian Croats and Muslims also fought each other for a period of 11 months, with Mostar seeing some of the fiercest fighting. Balkans war: a brief guide What now for victims? Exploring the corridors of the Hague tribunal After hearing the verdict, General Praljak stood and raised his hand to his mouth, tipped his head back and appeared to swallow a glass of liquid. ""I have taken poison,"" he said. Presiding judge Carmel Agius immediately suspended the proceedings and an ambulance was called. ""Okay,"" the judge said. ""We suspend the... We suspend... Please, the curtains. Don't take away the glass that he used when he drank something."" Emergency rescue workers were called into the court building to assist Slobodan Praljak An ambulance could later be seen arriving outside the tribunal while a helicopter hovered above the scene. Several emergency rescue workers also rushed into the building carrying equipment in backpacks. In a statement, the ICTY said Praljak ""was immediately assisted by the ICTY medical staff"". It said Praljak ""was transported to a nearby hospital to receive further medical assistance where he passed"". An independent investigation is now under way. 1945:Born in Capljina, modern-day Bosnia-Herzegovina 1970-72:Graduates in Zagreb with diplomas in engineering, philosophy, sociology, and drama 1970s-80s:Teaches philosophy and sociology, works as theatre director, produces TV films and documentaries 1991:Joins Croatia's army as wars erupt in Yugoslavia, promoted to Maj Gen rank 1993:Becomes commander of the main staff of the Bosnian Croat defence forces (HVO) After wars:Goes into business 2004:Turns himself to The Hague court, granted provisional release 2012:Ordered to return to detention unit in The Hague 2013:Sentenced to 20 years in prison 29 Nov 2017:Dies by drinking poison in courtroom after his jail sentencing is upheld Meanwhile, Croatian Prime Minister Andrej Plenkovic said he regretted the death of Slobodan Praljak. ""His act, which we all unfortunately witnessed today, speaks most of a deep moral injustice towards six indicted Croats from Bosnia and the Croatian people. ""The government expresses its condolences to all victims of all crimes committed in the war in Bosnia-Herzegovina. We voice dissatisfaction and regret about the verdict,"" Mr Plenkovic said. In Mostar, Bosnian Croats lit candles and prayed for Slobodan Praljak at a makeshift memorial Natacha Gaveau Ivanovic, Praljak's lawyer, told the BBC that she did not believe the tribunal treated her client fairly. ""I have no idea what happened and how it happened but for me what is very important, more important is why he did it,"" she said. The lawyer said she thought her client drank poison because he believed that he was an ""innocent man"". She said that he had the right to ""consider that"" because the tribunal ""didn't limit itself to judge just personal responsibility, they took on them to judge [the] politics of people, of a state, the history"". She added: ""It's very hard from the people who are from this country to accept that, and actually they cannot accept it."" Praljak, the former commander of the main staff of the Bosnian Croat defence forces (HVO), was jailed for crimes against humanity. Informed that soldiers were rounding up Muslims in Prozor in the summer of 1993, he had failed to make any serious efforts to stop the action, the UN war crimes tribunal found. Praljak had also failed to act on information that murders were being planned, as well as attacks on members of international organisations and the destruction of the city's historic Old Bridge and mosques.

"Under-age social media use 'on the rise'Children are also increasingly using social media to access news, but most know some of it is fake.11h11 hours agoTechnologyComments","Half of children aged 11 and 12 have a social media profile, despite most platforms' minimum age being 13, a study from regulator Ofcom suggests. Children's charity the NSPCC called on the government to act on the issue of under-age profiles. The media watchdog also said children were increasingly getting their news from social media, but most were aware of the concept of fake news. Just 32% believed that news accessed on such platforms was reported truthfully. Ofcom's Children and Parents Media Use and Attitudes report,externalfound that 46% of 11-year-olds, 51% of 12-year-olds and 28% of 10-year-olds now have a social media profile. Parental awareness of the age limit was low - with about eight in 10 of those parents whose children use Instagram or Snapchat unaware of the restrictions. More than four in 10 said they would allow their child to use social media ahead of them reaching the minimum age required. Social media use 'harms moral development' Posting children's photos on social media divides nation Children 'consuming online time like junk food' The NSPCC said: ""Social networks are clearly turning a blind eye when it comes to children under 13 signing up for their services. ""For too long sites like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat have failed to protect children on their platforms and government urgently needs to step in."" It is recommending that ministers force social networks to design child protections into their services via an amendment to the Data Protection Bill, which is due to be voted on in two week's time. A spokeswoman for Facebook - which also owns Instagram -  said that it enforced its pre-teen ban. ""When we become aware that someone is under 13 and they have therefore lied about their age, we remove their account and we use cookies to prevent them from signing up again,"" she said. The BBC has also sought comment from Snapchat. The report suggested that older children - aged 12 to 15 - were relatively sophisticated consumers of news. More than half (54%) said they used social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter to access online news, making it the second most popular source after television (62%). Nearly three-quarters (73%) were aware of ""fake news"" and four in 10 said they had seen such a story. Of those aware of fake news, 86% said they would make an effort to fact-check stories. Methods include: Seeing if a news story appears elsewhere (48%) Reading comments after the report to verify its authenticity (39%) Checking whether the organisation behind it is one they trust (26%) Assessing the professional quality of the article (20%) Emily Keaney, head of children's research at Ofcom, said: ""It's reassuring that almost all children now say that they have strategies for checking whether a social media news story is true or false. ""There may be two reasons behind this: lower trust in news shared through social media, but the digital generation are also becoming savvy online."" Snapchat has rapidly grown in popularity among youngsters, Ofcom found, while Facebook is on the wane. In 2014, 69% of 12 to 15-year-olds had a social media profile, and most of these (66%) said their main one was on Facebook. That has now dropped to 40%. And, in more bad news for traditional broadcasters, YouTube has become a more recognised brand among children than the BBC and ITV. Some 90% of 12 to 15-year-olds used YouTube, watching music videos and those showing pranks and challenges.

New York attack suspect pleads not guiltySayfullo Saipov is accused of killing eight people after driving a truck into pedestrians in October.11h11 hours agoUS & Canada,"Sayfullo Saipov faces 22 murder and terrorism charges A man accused of killing eight people and injuring 12 after driving a truck into pedestrians in New York in October has pleaded not guilty to charges of murder and terrorism. Sayfullo Saipov, who arrived in the US from Uzbekistan in 2010, entered his plea at a federal court on Tuesday. He faces 22 murder and terrorism charges, including providing material support to so-called Islamic State. Mr Saipov was arrested immediately after the 31 October Manhattan attack. It was the deadliest attack on the city since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. The most serious of the charges carry the death penalty, though prosecutors have not yet said whether they will seek it. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for Mr Saipov to face the death penalty. Who is New York attack suspect Saipov? Why Uzbek migrants are radicalised 'He was revving - I saw him hit people' He appeared in court wearing a dark blue prison uniform with his feet chained. A court-appointed lawyer spoke on his behalf and entered a plea of not guilty. He was shot by a police officer immediately after the attack and arrested. In a criminal complaint filed the day after the incident, prosecutors described how Mr Saipov had reportedly bragged about what he had done from his hospital bed. According to investigators, he detailed how he had been inspired by propaganda videos produced by IS and had begun planning the attack a year earlier. Mr Saipov also said he ""felt good about what he had done"" and asked to display the militant group's flag in his hospital room, investigators added. The next hearing in his case is scheduled for 23 January. This video can not be played New York truck attack: Who is Sayfullo Saipov?

"Brits Critics' Choice list is all-femaleJorja Smith, Stefflon Don and Mabel are nominated for the prestigious Critics' Choice award.5m6 minutes agoEntertainment & Arts","Brits Critics' Choice nominees (L-R): Mabel, Jorja Smith and Stefflon Don Before they were famous, Sam Smith, Florence + The Machine, Adele and Emeli Sande were all tipped for success by the Brits' Critics' Choice award. This year's line-up has just been announced and, for the first time, it's an all-female field. Birmingham-born MC Stefflon Don is joined on the list by soul singers Jorja Smith and Mabel. The winner will be announced on 4 December, ahead of next year's Brit Awards. Stefflon Don has already tasted chart success this year, reaching the top 10 with Hurtin' Me, and featuring in Jax Jones' dance smash Instruction. Mabel, who is Neneh Cherry's youngest daughter, has also scored a top 10 hit with the slinky single Finders Keepers. All three artists are previous nominees for the BBC Sound Of... poll, which unveiled itslatest longlist on Monday. This year's Brit Award winners will receive a statue designed by artist Sir Anish Kapoor The Brit nominees were chosen by a panel of music industry experts - including critics, record label employees and the heads of the UK's biggest radio stations. More than 100 artists were considered, with each voter selecting their own shortlist of five up-and-coming artists. Last year's winner was soul star Rag N Bone Man, who went on to have the year's biggest-selling debut album. Before they become ubiquitous, brush up on the 2018 nominees below. MABEL Born in the mountains of Malaga, Mabel was raised between Spain, London and Stockholm. Like her parents, Neneh Cherry and Massive Attack producer Cameron McVey, her music is hard to classify, but it's rooted in the 90s R&B she used to dance to in her bedroom. Age:21 From:London Inspired by:Destiny's Child, Lauryn Hill, Brandy, Aaliyah For fans of:Rihanna, Jhene Aiko, SZA Did you know?Her nickname is Lil' Bassy because, as a child, she would fall asleep to the sound of speaker-rattling bass in her dad's recording studio. She says:""Being nominated for the Critics Choice award really is a dream come true for me.  So much hard work has gone into getting to this point, so to be acknowledged by something like the BRIT Awards means the world.""

She brewed her last (professional) coffee soon afterwards. Age:20 From:Walsall Inspired by:Amy Winehouse, Mos Def and Damian Marley For fans of:Drake, FKA Twigs, Nao Did you know?Jorja finished her debut album this year, but held it back because her favourite number is 11, and 2+0+1+8 = 11.

"Bitcoin crosses $10,000 milestone","Bitcoin's value has fluctuated widely during its nine-year existence The value of one bitcoin has gone past $10,000 (Â£7,493). The virtual currency reached the benchmark for the first time, just days after it passed $9,000. It caps a remarkable rise in value for the crypto-currency, which was trading below $1,000 at the start of the year. Some experts believe theasset still has far to soar,external, but others say it represents a speculative bubble with nothing tangible at its core that could burst any time. The total value of all thebitcoins in existence has now,externalsurpassed $167bn. What's behind the Bitcoin gold rush? Bitcoin first reached $1,000 in late-2013 and then dipped significantly before starting a volatile climb to its current value. It is not entirely clear what has driven the sudden rise in value, especially because the past few weeks have been marked by action by some financial regulators to limit its use. One factor that may have helped was the US-based derivatives marketplace operator CME Group's announcement at the start of the month that it planned to launch a Bitcoin futures product before the end of 2017, which bolstered confidence in its prospects. Another was a decision to drop a controversial plan known as Segwit2x. This would have altered the way Bitcoin's underlying technology, the blockchain, worked, to help it handle more transactions. But the move risked splitting the community. Many industry watchers believe the rapid rise in value will not be sustained and expect its value to suddenly fall sharply. Bitcoins were first produced in 2009 and took a long time to become an accepted holder of monetary value that could be swapped for real-world cash. One early transaction involved using 10,000 bitcoins to buy two pizzas. The boom has led to a general rise in many other virtual currencies. One, known as Ethereum, is now worth about $480, but at the start of 2017 each one was worth only about $10. Many others are also trying to profit from the growing interest in crypto-currencies. Con artists are sending Bitcoin-based scams to phone users, pretending to be from the news site CoinDesk Many malware writers are now seeking to install software on vulnerable websites that create or ""mine"" the coins. In addition, scammers have sent fake text messages to people's phones, claiming they own some of the digital currency, in an effort to tempt them into opening a dangerous link. What is Bitcoin?

Saudi prince freed after corruption raidPrince Miteb bin Abdullah spent three weeks in detention on allegations of corruption.8h8 hours agoMiddle East,"Prince Miteb was the most politically influential royal detained in the corruption crackdown Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah has been released more than three weeks after he was detained on allegations of corruption, officials have said. Prince Miteb, once seen as a contender to the throne, was freed after agreeing an ""acceptable settlement"" with authorities of more than $1bn (Â£750m). He was one of more than 200 princes, ministers and businessmen detained in an anti-corruption drive on 4 November. At least three others have also agreed settlements, the officials said. ""Yes, Prince Miteb was released this morning [Tuesday],"" a source close to the government told the Agence France-Presse news agency. The prince has so far not commented, and it was not clear whether he was now able to move freely or whether he was under some form of house arrest. Saudi detentions: Living inside 'five-star prison' Anti-corruption probe 'finds $100bn was embezzled' The 65-year-old son of the late King Abdullah was the most politically influential royal detained under the orders of a newly formed anti-corruption committee headed by his 32-year-old cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Miteb was minister of the National Guard, an elite security force with 100,000 personnel that is tasked with protecting royal leaders, but was sacked hours before his detention. An official involved in the investigation told Reuters news agency the settlement agreed by the prince ""included admitting corruption involving known cases"". This video can not be played A peek inside the Ritz-Carlton as it hosts those suspected of corruption The authorities have not publicly named any of the208 people who Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said had been ""called in for questioning"". They have also not released any details of the charges they faced, and are not believed to have given them access to their lawyers. Prince Miteb was reportedly held at the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh along with his brother Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh province; the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Alwalid al-Ibrahim, owner of the TV network MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; and Khalid al-Tuwaijri, former chief of the Royal Court. Mohammed bin Salman: power behind the throne Saudi Crown Prince: Five things to know In an interview with the New York Times published on Thursday,Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said 95% of those so far detained in the anti-corruption drive had agreed to hand over cash or shares to the Saudi state,externalonce ""we show them all the files that we have"". Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the authorities hoped to recover as much as $100bn ""About one per cent are able to prove they are clean and their case is dropped right there,"" he added. ""About four per cent say they are not corrupt and with their lawyers want to go to court. Prince Mohammed also said it was ""ludicrous"" that analysts had suggested the campaign was a power grab. He noted that many of those detained had publicly pledged allegiance to him when his 81-year-old father, King Salman, named him first-in-line to the throne in June. The prince hopes to recover much of the $100bn that the attorney general said was ""misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades"". Many ordinary Saudis have welcomed the move to tackle corruption with the hope that some of their nation's oil wealth will be redistributed to the general population.

Some lost rail routes may be 'restored',"Firms which operate passenger services would also manage the tracks their trains run on, under government plans to fix ""creaking"" UK railways. East Coast mainline would be the first service to try the new model from 2020. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""It means when things go wrong, there's one team to sort it out"". The move is part of a new governmentrail strategy,externalthat could see the reopening of some lines that were closed in the 1960s. At the moment Network Rail, which is state-owned, looks after the track and other infrastructure while train services are operated by private companies. Mr Grayling said Network Rail was a ""big blob at the centre"" and said it ""makes sense"" to run trains and the track together. ""The system is creaking - it's bursting at the seams,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The East Coast mainline, which connects London, the North East and Scotland, would be the first of a ""new generation of long-term regional partnerships,"" he said. Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Trains' founder, said the current system of running the track and trains separately ""doesn't work"" and causes delays. He hasblamed a ""far too big"" Network Rail for causing disruption, adding: ""I've always said that having a single, centralised rail infrastructure provider across the UK doesn't work. ""There needs to be a greater local focus and [Mr Grayling's] announcement is a welcome move in this direction."" Meanwhile, some rail routes lost under Richard Beeching in the 1960s and British Rail in the 1970s could be restored. Some 4,000 miles of track was closed in the 1960s, mainly in rural areas, which became known as the Beeching cuts. Mr Grayling said rail lines would be re-opened if they unlock jobs, encourage house building, ease congestion and offer ""value for money"". Work on the Oxford to Cambridge route starts next summer, and plans to re-open routes around Bristol, Birmingham, Exeter and the North East are being considered. The government will also consider splitting up two of the biggest train operators - Great Western and GTR, which comprises Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern. That could result in one company running high-speed lines between London, Bristol and south Wales, while another runs local services across the South West. By BBC Transport Correspondent Richard Westcott: I have never met anyone in the rail industry - either pro- or anti-privatisation - who thinks it was a good idea to split up who runs the trains and who runs the track and signals. But that is what we have got. There have been plenty of stories about Network Rail teams arguing with train company teams about who should fix a problem and who should pay - causing plenty of unnecessary delays. Now, the government has said it will change things to create joint teams - with one boss, public and private working together, to solve problems on the line. The biggest experiment will be on the East Coast mainline, where Virgin-Stagecoach is struggling to make money and has become frustrated with the physical state of the line. A new public-private partnership is being set up to run the train and tracks together. But we have no idea yet how it will work, who will pay for things, or when passengers might feel the benefit. This video can not be played It has been announced that 4,000 miles of railway line and 2,000 stations will close. But Labour has called the ideas ""un-funded proposals"", with shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald describing the plans as ""unambitious"". ""The Tories' record is of delayed, downgraded and cancelled investment, huge disparities in regional transport spending and soaring fares that are pricing passengers off the railway,"" he said. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said it was a ""scandal"" that the plans did not consider publicly-owned railways. He said: ""The planned breaking up of Great Western and GTR is a massive admission of failure by the government but still they rule out the highly popular option of public ownership."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said the union would be ""pleased to see the lines cut by Beeching restored"". However, he said Mr Grayling's new plans would not boost jobs and housing, asking: ""Where is the bold strategic vision for rail - and integrated transport links - in this country?"" Councils and business have also been asked to submit proposals for new lines. However, the government has no plans to make new money available to fund any such suggestions, the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott said. Richard Beeching's brief as chairman of the British Transport Commission was simple: ""Make the railways pay."" British Rail was losing Â£140m a year when Dr Beeching took over the commission. His solution, announced on 27 March 1963, was equally straightforward - massive cuts. The Conservative government welcomed the report, but thousands of people - many in remote rural areas - were horrified they would lose their local branch lines. Opposition from the pressure groups failed and during the 1960s ""Beeching's Axe"" fell on 2,128 stations and more than 67,000 British Rail jobs.

Sayfullo Saipov, who arrived in the US from Uzbekistan in 2010, entered his plea at a federal court on Tuesday. He faces 22 murder and terrorism charges, including providing material support to so-called Islamic State. Mr Saipov was arrested immediately after the 31 October Manhattan attack. It was the deadliest attack on the city since the 9/11 terrorist attacks on the World Trade Center in 2001. The most serious of the charges carry the death penalty, though prosecutors have not yet said whether they will seek it. US President Donald Trump has repeatedly called for Mr Saipov to face the death penalty. Who is New York attack suspect Saipov?

"Clearer label plan to cut food wasteConfusion over food labels is prompting people to throw away usable produce, waste agency claims.6h6 hours agoUK","A new attempt is being made to improve labelling to prevent edible food going to waste. The waste agency Wrap says food labels use too many different terms, prompting people to throw away usable produce. Milk labels, for instance, typically say milk keeps three days in the fridge after opening - whereas actually it can keep far longer. Wrap says a third of the UK's 2 million tonnes of annual food waste is due to confusion over date labels. Wrap has long been campaigning against labels that induce waste. Five years ago it persuaded firms to stop using the phrase ""sell by"" and replace it with ""display until"". It now wants retailers to prioritise the term ""best before"" - suggesting clearly that the food can still be safely eaten after that date, even though it is less fresh. 1.  Should you keep apples in the fridge? 2. How cold should you keep your fridge? 3. Should you keep onions in the fridge? 4. Where in the fridge should you store foods that need most chilling, like meat? 5. Should you keep potatoes in the fridge? 6. Should you keep pineapple in the fridge? 7. Should you keep bread in the fridge? For answers, see below Judgement on the usability of food is one of the great inter-generational dividers. Older people tend to sniff food and peer for signs of furry mould - then eat it if they haven't fallen over. Young people brought up in the health-and-safety era typically take a more literal approach based on labels. That is why Wrap wants to influence the labels themselves. Wrap's Andrew Parry told BBC News: ""We think food companies are often too conservative with their labelling. ""Obviously we don't want people getting listeria (which you can't smell) but we don't want people throwing away edible food either. ""We think people need much clearer consistent advice on, say, which foods need chilling, and at what temperature."" Wrap wants firms to include a little blue fridge icon to inform people what needs to be kept in the fridge. It also wants people to ensure their fridges are at 5C or less which maximises storage time. A survey showed that 30% of households had their fridges set much warmer. Food waste is no longer just a question of household budgets. Wasting food increases the demand for more agriculture on forest land, which in turn depletes wildlife. It also increases greenhouse gases. The government is backing the Wrap initiative. Environment minister Therese Coffey said: ""We know that confusing labels can contribute to food waste by suggesting that edible items need to be thrown away sooner than is necessary. ""This new guidance will make packaging much clearer for consumers, saving them money and reducing waste."" Wrap say changes to products, packaging and labelling made in response to earlier recommendations avoided nearly 150,000 tonnes of food being wasted in 2015, saving families an estimated Â£400m. 1. Yes, they last far longer. Take them out the night before if you don't like chilled apple. Most waste food is from the fruit bowl 2. 5C or less 3. No, they go soggy 4. The bottom - cool air sinks 5. No - it turns the starch into sugar so you're left with sweet, gritty spuds 6. Yes and no. Yes to cut pineapple. No to whole pineapple - it turns brown 7. Probably not. Cold delays it going mouldy, but makes it stale quicker. This doesn't apply if you always make toast.

Harry and Meghan to wed at Windsor in May,"This video can not be played Meghan Markle has revealed that Prince Harry proposed on a Sunday night at home Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, in May, Kensington Palace says. The Royal Family will pay for the wedding, including the service, music, flowers and reception - the date will be announced later. Ms Markle, 36, a Protestant, will be baptised into the Church of England and confirmed before the wedding. A spokesman for the prince said the pair would make sure the wedding ""reflects who they are as a couple"". Jason Knauf said Prince Harry, 33, and Ms Markle were ""leading the planning process for all aspects of the wedding"" and were working through ideas on how members of the public could ""feel part of the celebrations"". ""This wedding, like all weddings, will be a moment of fun and joy that will reflect the characters of the bride and groom,"" he added. Harry: Stars were aligned when I met Meghan Full interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle The prince and the actress Who is Meghan Markle? Profile: Prince Harry Mr Knauf described Windsor as a ""very special place"" for the couple, saying they had spent time there together since meeting in July 2016. He also revealed that the American actress intends to become a British citizen and will work towards it in the coming years. St George's Chapel was the venue for a service of prayer and dedication after Harry's father, the Prince of Wales, married the Duchess of Cornwall at the Windsor Guildhall in 2005. It was also chosen for the wedding of Harry's cousin, Peter Phillips, and Autumn Kelly in 2008, and the Earl and Countess of Wessex in 1999. BBC royal correspondent Daniela Relph said St George's Chapel held many happy childhood memories for Prince Harry, and while a more intimate venue than Westminster Abbey or St Paul's Cathedral, was grand enough for royal wedding. This video can not be played Kate on Harry and Meghan: ""William and I are absolutely thrilled"" Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, and Ms Markle announced their engagement on Monday. Mr Knauf said it was ""an incredibly happy day"" for the couple and they were ""overwhelmed by support from the UK and around the world"". Their 16-month relationship began when they met on a blind date in London arranged by a mutual friend. The couple gave their first joint TV interview to the BBC's Mishal Husain on Monday  - revealing the proposal came as they made roast chicken at home earlier this month. They also discussed Ms Markle's pet dogs and Mr Knauf revealed that while one of them, Guy, was legally allowed to stay with her in the UK, the other, Bogart, would not be joining her. The other American in Prince Harry's life Why she won't be Princess Meghan Can you remarry in church after divorce? The prince and Ms Markle will carry out their first official engagement together in Nottingham on Friday. They will go on a walkabout and visit the Nottingham Contemporary which is hosting a Terrence Higgins Trust World Aids Day charity fair, and Nottingham Academy to meet head teachers. Their spokesman said Ms Markle would not be continuing her work on gender with the United Nations or with other organisations, and instead would start new charity work as a full-time royal. She is to become the fourth patron of the Royal Foundation of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Speaking during a visit to the Foundling Museum in London on Tuesday, the Duchess of Cambridge said both she and Prince William hoped the couple ""enjoy this happy moment"". By Adam Whitty, BBC News, Windsor St George's Chapel is shrouded in darkness tonight, the 15th Century gothic building shielded by the walls of Windsor Castle. However, on a cold and dark night, there is a real atmosphere of warmth and light in Windsor with the knowledge this town will be the centre of the world in six months' time. A shop worker (whose tills will surely be ringing relentlessly in the build up to the big day) said the day would be like a ""fairytale"" for Windsor and the country as a whole. A woman called Elaine, who used to volunteer in the chapel for a number of years, said St George's offered a much more intimate experience for an occasion like this. ""We just think of ourselves as really lucky,"" she said. ""It's going to be an incredible atmosphere on the day."" The couple announced plans for a spring wedding on Monday, but by choosing May, have avoided a potential clash with the birth of the Duchess of Cambridge's third child and the Queen's appearance at the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in London and Windsor - both of which are in April. Downing Street has said there are no plans for a bank holidayto mark the wedding, after the possibility was mooted on social media. Ms Markle was previously married, but the Church of England agreed in 2002 that divorced people would be allowed to remarry in church. What?A 15th Century gothic chapel, set in the grounds of Windsor Castle. Size:Holds 800 guests - Westminster Abbey has a capacity of 2,000.

Saudi prince freed after corruption raid,"Prince Miteb was the most politically influential royal detained in the corruption crackdown Saudi Prince Miteb bin Abdullah has been released more than three weeks after he was detained on allegations of corruption, officials have said. Prince Miteb, once seen as a contender to the throne, was freed after agreeing an ""acceptable settlement"" with authorities of more than $1bn (Â£750m). He was one of more than 200 princes, ministers and businessmen detained in an anti-corruption drive on 4 November. At least three others have also agreed settlements, the officials said. ""Yes, Prince Miteb was released this morning [Tuesday],"" a source close to the government told the Agence France-Presse news agency. The prince has so far not commented, and it was not clear whether he was now able to move freely or whether he was under some form of house arrest. Saudi detentions: Living inside 'five-star prison' Anti-corruption probe 'finds $100bn was embezzled' The 65-year-old son of the late King Abdullah was the most politically influential royal detained under the orders of a newly formed anti-corruption committee headed by his 32-year-old cousin, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Prince Miteb was minister of the National Guard, an elite security force with 100,000 personnel that is tasked with protecting royal leaders, but was sacked hours before his detention. An official involved in the investigation told Reuters news agency the settlement agreed by the prince ""included admitting corruption involving known cases"". This video can not be played A peek inside the Ritz-Carlton as it hosts those suspected of corruption The authorities have not publicly named any of the208 people who Attorney General Sheikh Saud al-Mojeb said had been ""called in for questioning"". They have also not released any details of the charges they faced, and are not believed to have given them access to their lawyers. Prince Miteb was reportedly held at the five-star Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh along with his brother Prince Turki bin Abdullah, a former governor of Riyadh province; the billionaire investor Prince Alwaleed bin Talal; Alwalid al-Ibrahim, owner of the TV network MBC; Amr al-Dabbagh, former head of the Saudi Arabian General Investment Authority; and Khalid al-Tuwaijri, former chief of the Royal Court. Mohammed bin Salman: power behind the throne Saudi Crown Prince: Five things to know In an interview with the New York Times published on Thursday,Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said 95% of those so far detained in the anti-corruption drive had agreed to hand over cash or shares to the Saudi state,externalonce ""we show them all the files that we have"". Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman said the authorities hoped to recover as much as $100bn ""About one per cent are able to prove they are clean and their case is dropped right there,"" he added. ""About four per cent say they are not corrupt and with their lawyers want to go to court. Prince Mohammed also said it was ""ludicrous"" that analysts had suggested the campaign was a power grab. He noted that many of those detained had publicly pledged allegiance to him when his 81-year-old father, King Salman, named him first-in-line to the throne in June. The prince hopes to recover much of the $100bn that the attorney general said was ""misused through systematic corruption and embezzlement over several decades"". Many ordinary Saudis have welcomed the move to tackle corruption with the hope that some of their nation's oil wealth will be redistributed to the general population.

Why Meghan won't be called 'princess'VideoVideoWindsor residents 'so excited'Students plan 'Prince Harry's stag do',"A series of complex and ancient laws will apply to the title that Prince Harry's future wife will receive Why won't Meghan Markle be known as Princess Meghan when she ties the knot with Prince Harry next year? The brutal answer is that, by the standards of British royal protocol, the former Hollywood star lacks ""royal blood"". That means that she cannot call herself Princess Meghan. The arcane rules mean that Meghan will be compelled to follow the example of her future sister-in-law. When Catherine Middleton and Prince William were pronounced ""man and wife"" in 2011, she automatically became Her Royal Highness, Princess William of Wales. The overwhelming likelihood is that the new royal fiancee will in turn officially become HRH Princess Henry of Wales. So we can forget about Princess Kate and we can forget about Princess Meg. The reason for this is simple:  Catherine Middleton was not of royal blood, and what applies to her will also apply in the case of Meghan Markle. The rules which applied to Catherine Middleton (left) at the time of her marriage will also apply to Meghan Markle It is royal blood which is the key determinant when it comes to deciding how a princess is named Royal blood meant that the Queen's late sister Margaret was entitled to call herself Princess Margaret. Likewise the Queen's daughter is Princess Anne and her granddaughters are Princess Beatrice and Princess Eugenie. More royal wedding details expected Harry: Stars were aligned when I met Meghan Full interview with Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Diana Spencer was never officially known as Princess Diana Royal blood made them  princesses in their own right. But Sarah Ferguson was never Princess Sarah and Sophie Rhys-Jones - the wife of Prince Edward - is not Princess Sophie. The rules also meant - to the consternation of many - that Lady Diana Spencer was never officially Princess Diana. She was the Princess of Wales and, after her divorce from Prince Charles, she was Diana, Princess of Wales. As the BBC's Nicholas Witchell explained at the time of William and Kate's engagement in 2011, the Royal Family has not flourished for 1,000 years or so without finding a solution to this somewhat baffling and arguably meaningless issue of what people should be called. From the point of view of Buckingham Palace, handy titles or ""handles"" are required for the members of the family who occupy prestigious but somewhat peripheral roles to the main business of monarchy. The Queen's first cousins are, respectively, the Dukes of Gloucester and Kent, and when her disgraced uncleabandoned the throne to marry an American divorcee in 1936, he became the Duke of Windsor. The prince and the actress Who is Meghan Markle? Profile: Prince Harry Such ducal titles are frequently bestowed upon marriage, our correspondent reported, precisely because they give the new entrant to the family a grand-sounding title without making them princesses or princes in their own right. So when Prince Andrew married Sarah Ferguson in 1986, the Queen made him Duke of York, thus she became the Duchess of York - a title she continues to hold despite her divorce. The Duke of Edinburgh (right in 1950) only became Prince Philip when the Queen accorded him the title Similarly, when Prince Edward married Sophie Rhys-Jones, he became the Earl of Wessex and his new wife the Countess of Wessex. It could be that the Queen makes the same kind of move in the cases of Kate and Meghan, and dusts off a long-defunct royal dukedom - Sussex (the favourite for Harry and Meghan), Albany and Clarence are among the vacant ones. But as with many things connected to British royal protocol, there is always an exception to the rule - the Queen's husband Philip married into the royal family, and yet he is a prince. When he married the then Princess Elizabeth in 1947, the then British King, George VI, created him ""Duke of Edinburgh"". Although he was a prince in some European countries prior to marrying the Queen, in Britain he officially became Prince Philip in February 1957 when the Queen ""accorded him the style and title of a Prince of the United Kingdom"". She could also make both Kate and Meghan princesses in their own right - but such are the rigid traditions surrounding this issue that Britain's first Princess Meghan is likely to be some time away.

Asylum seekers face appeals 'lottery',"Asylum seekers are facing a ""lottery"" depending on where their appeal is heard, research by the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme has found. Appeals are twice as likely to be successful at some centres compared with others, data obtained through a Freedom of Information request found. Shadow attorney general Shami Chakrabarti called for an urgent investigation into the findings. The Ministry of Justice declined our request for a comment. One legal supervisor said the situation was so severe that they had heard of cases where lawyers had lied about the address of their client to get their case heard at a different location. The data concerns 36,000 ordinary asylum appeals from January 2013 to September 2016. The disparity is illustrated by comparing two busy London centres - at Harmondsworth 24% of appeals were successful while at Taylor House it was 47%. The figures exclude appeals that concluded as fast-track cases. Access to good quality legal representation in certain parts of the country and a different ""culture"" at hearing centres were repeatedly cited as reasons, during the research. Legal supervisor Laura Smith, of Duncan Lewis solicitors, said the statistics were ""not surprising at all"". ""It's the kind of arbitrary decision-making which I see across the systems all the time,"" she said, ""that two cases with merit can have completely different results, based on different judges and different hearing centres."" Ms Smith said she encouraged her clients to move to the district covered by Taylor House if they were able to do so. And she even knew of lawyers who lied about their client's address. This video can not be played Shami Chakrabarti says ""legal aid deserts"" are failing asylum seekers Two centres with a very low number of successful appeals, Harmondsworth and Yarl's Wood, were also the tribunals that had heard the highest proportion of cases in which the asylum seeker had no legal representation at all in the same period, a further Freedom of Information request found. Some 32% of cases heard at Harmondsworth featured unrepresented asylum seekers, 23% at Yarl's Wood. ""There are what has become known as legal-aid deserts,"" said Catriona Jarvis, a retired judge who sat at tribunals across the country for 12 years. ""It's wholly wrong. It shouldn't be a lottery."" Cuts to government legal aid since 2013 have reduced the financial incentive for immigration lawyers to take on time-consuming asylum appeals. ""These are areas of the country where there are no firms of solicitors who are providing immigration asylum law services,"" Mrs Jarvis said. ""That becomes incredibly problematic for asylum seekers who have been sent to live in those parts of the country."" Baroness Chakrabarti described the variations as ""very upsetting"" and said they could not be due to coincidence or weak cases. She said: ""Legal-aid deserts for people in different parts of the country means people are going into asylum appeals unrepresented. ""That's completely unacceptable in a humane democracy."" A spokesman for the judiciary said all judges considered each case individually based on the relevant facts and the law. The statement said: ""First-tier tribunal immigration judges are deployed across the various hearing centres and do not sit solely in any single one, so it is difficult draw any inferences from the available statistics. ""Ultimately, independent judicial decisions are reviewable on appeal if either side is dissatisfied with the outcome.""

Under-age social media use 'on the rise',"Half of children aged 11 and 12 have a social media profile, despite most platforms' minimum age being 13, a study from regulator Ofcom suggests. Children's charity the NSPCC called on the government to act on the issue of under-age profiles. The media watchdog also said children were increasingly getting their news from social media, but most were aware of the concept of fake news. Just 32% believed that news accessed on such platforms was reported truthfully. Ofcom's Children and Parents Media Use and Attitudes report,externalfound that 46% of 11-year-olds, 51% of 12-year-olds and 28% of 10-year-olds now have a social media profile. Parental awareness of the age limit was low - with about eight in 10 of those parents whose children use Instagram or Snapchat unaware of the restrictions. More than four in 10 said they would allow their child to use social media ahead of them reaching the minimum age required. Social media use 'harms moral development' Posting children's photos on social media divides nation Children 'consuming online time like junk food' The NSPCC said: ""Social networks are clearly turning a blind eye when it comes to children under 13 signing up for their services. ""For too long sites like Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat have failed to protect children on their platforms and government urgently needs to step in."" It is recommending that ministers force social networks to design child protections into their services via an amendment to the Data Protection Bill, which is due to be voted on in two week's time. A spokeswoman for Facebook - which also owns Instagram -  said that it enforced its pre-teen ban. ""When we become aware that someone is under 13 and they have therefore lied about their age, we remove their account and we use cookies to prevent them from signing up again,"" she said. The BBC has also sought comment from Snapchat. The report suggested that older children - aged 12 to 15 - were relatively sophisticated consumers of news. More than half (54%) said they used social media platforms such as Snapchat, Facebook and Twitter to access online news, making it the second most popular source after television (62%). Nearly three-quarters (73%) were aware of ""fake news"" and four in 10 said they had seen such a story. Of those aware of fake news, 86% said they would make an effort to fact-check stories. Methods include: Seeing if a news story appears elsewhere (48%) Reading comments after the report to verify its authenticity (39%) Checking whether the organisation behind it is one they trust (26%) Assessing the professional quality of the article (20%) Emily Keaney, head of children's research at Ofcom, said: ""It's reassuring that almost all children now say that they have strategies for checking whether a social media news story is true or false. ""There may be two reasons behind this: lower trust in news shared through social media, but the digital generation are also becoming savvy online."" Snapchat has rapidly grown in popularity among youngsters, Ofcom found, while Facebook is on the wane. In 2014, 69% of 12 to 15-year-olds had a social media profile, and most of these (66%) said their main one was on Facebook. That has now dropped to 40%. And, in more bad news for traditional broadcasters, YouTube has become a more recognised brand among children than the BBC and ITV. Some 90% of 12 to 15-year-olds used YouTube, watching music videos and those showing pranks and challenges.

Free ATMs 'must be available across UK',"The network that oversees free-to-use cash machines across the UK must ensure there is an even spread of ATMs across the country, an influential MP says. Nicky Morgan, who chairs the Commons Treasury Committee, said any big fall in the number of ATMs would ""clearly be of concern"". She has written to the head of the Link network amid debate over an overhaul of the system. There are fears of ""ATM deserts"" but Link said such worries were misplaced. Who do we trust after cash? Bitcoin - risky bubble or the future? Under proposals published earlier this month, Link would reduce the amount it charges card issuers to allow customers to use the machines from around 25p per withdrawal to 20p. It said the changes - which would come into effect next April - would help protect the network, which currently includes 55,000 free-to-use machines. However, the ATM Industry Association said that this could cause problems of access for customers - a concern picked up by Ms Morgan and her committee of MPs. ""It seems intuitive that a 20% reduction in the interchange fee received by an ATM operator may mean that some machines are no longer economically viable,"" she said, noting that there were plans for subsidies when an ATM was not viable. Her letter asks what assurances can be provided to the Treasury Committee that the proposals will preserve the existing geographical spread of ATMs and have no negative impact on financial inclusion. It also asks how many ATMs are projected to close as a result of the proposals and what arrangements will be in place to monitor ATM changes. Sir Mark Boleat, who chairs Link and to whom the letter is addressed, said: ""We do not envisage any scenario where there will be areas of the UK which will not continue to have free access to their money. ""Our proposals include a strong financial inclusion programme that will ensure that there is positive impact on financial inclusion."" However, Ron Delnevo, executive director of the ATM Industry Association, said: ""It is wonderful news that the Treasury Select Committee is examining this threat to financial inclusion with the urgency that it warrants. ""It is now essential that Link addresses these concerns with adequate and detailed responses before rushing through any ill-considered decisions, which threaten the viability and vitality of thousands of communities around the UK by denying them access to cash from free ATMs."" Free cash machines could be cut back Cash 'lives on' after 50 years of ATMs Can a bank in a box replace a branch?

Clearer label plan to cut food waste,"A new attempt is being made to improve labelling to prevent edible food going to waste. The waste agency Wrap says food labels use too many different terms, prompting people to throw away usable produce. Milk labels, for instance, typically say milk keeps three days in the fridge after opening - whereas actually it can keep far longer. Wrap says a third of the UK's 2 million tonnes of annual food waste is due to confusion over date labels. Wrap has long been campaigning against labels that induce waste. Five years ago it persuaded firms to stop using the phrase ""sell by"" and replace it with ""display until"". It now wants retailers to prioritise the term ""best before"" - suggesting clearly that the food can still be safely eaten after that date, even though it is less fresh. 1.  Should you keep apples in the fridge? 2. How cold should you keep your fridge? 3. Should you keep onions in the fridge? 4. Where in the fridge should you store foods that need most chilling, like meat? 5. Should you keep potatoes in the fridge? 6. Should you keep pineapple in the fridge? 7. Should you keep bread in the fridge? For answers, see below Judgement on the usability of food is one of the great inter-generational dividers. Older people tend to sniff food and peer for signs of furry mould - then eat it if they haven't fallen over. Young people brought up in the health-and-safety era typically take a more literal approach based on labels. That is why Wrap wants to influence the labels themselves. Wrap's Andrew Parry told BBC News: ""We think food companies are often too conservative with their labelling. ""Obviously we don't want people getting listeria (which you can't smell) but we don't want people throwing away edible food either. ""We think people need much clearer consistent advice on, say, which foods need chilling, and at what temperature."" Wrap wants firms to include a little blue fridge icon to inform people what needs to be kept in the fridge. It also wants people to ensure their fridges are at 5C or less which maximises storage time. A survey showed that 30% of households had their fridges set much warmer. Food waste is no longer just a question of household budgets. Wasting food increases the demand for more agriculture on forest land, which in turn depletes wildlife. It also increases greenhouse gases. The government is backing the Wrap initiative. Environment minister Therese Coffey said: ""We know that confusing labels can contribute to food waste by suggesting that edible items need to be thrown away sooner than is necessary. ""This new guidance will make packaging much clearer for consumers, saving them money and reducing waste."" Wrap say changes to products, packaging and labelling made in response to earlier recommendations avoided nearly 150,000 tonnes of food being wasted in 2015, saving families an estimated Â£400m. 1. Yes, they last far longer. Take them out the night before if you don't like chilled apple. Most waste food is from the fruit bowl 2. 5C or less 3. No, they go soggy 4. The bottom - cool air sinks 5. No - it turns the starch into sugar so you're left with sweet, gritty spuds 6. Yes and no. Yes to cut pineapple. No to whole pineapple - it turns brown 7. Probably not. Cold delays it going mouldy, but makes it stale quicker. This doesn't apply if you always make toast.

N Korea missile launch 'a global threat',"This video can not be played North Korea missile 'higher' than previous tests, says US Defence Secretary Mattis North Korea has fired its highest-ever intercontinental ballistic missile and poses a worldwide threat, US Secretary of Defence James Mattis has said. The missile, launched early on Wednesday, landed in Japanese waters. It reached an altitude of 4,500km (2,800 miles) and flew 960km, according to South Korea's military. It was the latest in a series of weapons tests that has raised tensions. Pyongyang last launched a ballistic missile in September. It also conducted its sixth nuclear test that month. North Korea has continued to develop its nuclear and missile programme despite global condemnation and sanctions. The UN Security Council is due to convene an emergency session to discuss the latest test. What damage could North Korea do? Are missiles a risk to planes? Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? North Korea's missile programme Mr Mattis said the missile launch ""went higher, frankly, than any previous shots they have taken"". The North was building ""ballistic missiles that threaten everywhere in the world"", he added. US President Donald Trump was briefed while the missile was still in the air, the White House said. Afterwards he said: ""We will take care of it."" The US-based Union of Concerned Scientists said,externalthe missile could have travelled more than 13,000km on a standard trajectory, thus reaching ""any part of the continental United States"". But it added it seemed likely that the missile had a very light mock warhead - which meant that it could be incapable of carrying a nuclear warhead, which is much heavier, for that distance. This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? Wednesday's missile was launched from Pyongsong, in South Pyongan province, reported South Korean news agency Yonhap. Japanese officials said the projectile travelled for about 50 minutes - but did not fly over Japan, as some have done in the past - and landed about 250km off its northern coast. Japan also said it would ""never accept North Korea's continuous provocative behaviour"", while South Korea condemned the launch and responded with a missile exercise of its own. The EU has called the launch a ""further unacceptable violation"" of North Korea's international obligations, while Britain's ambassador to the UN called it ""a reckless act"". Jonathan Marcus, BBC Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent This missile test, the first for some two months, suggests that the lull in firings was not due to North Korea being cowed by Mr Trump's rhetoric or even by Chinese pressure. Experts have indeed pointed to similar seasonal slowdowns in testing in the past. President Trump, responding to the test, says that his administration will handle it. But handle it how? The US has called for an urgent meeting of the UN Security Council. And Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has spoken of stepping up the pressure on Pyongyang. But North Korea is already one of the most isolated and heavily sanctioned states in the world. There are few new levers to pull. North Korea is seemingly a problem without a solution and its nuclear and missile programmes are now, once again, back at the top of the Trump administration's security agenda. North Korea's last nuclear test reportedly involved a miniaturised hydrogen bomb that could be loaded onto a long-range missile. Last week, Mr Trump announced that theUS was re-designating North Korea a state sponsor of terrorismbecause of its missile and nuclear programme. The US imposed fresh sanctions against Pyongyang. The measures targeted North Korean shipping operations and Chinese companies that traded with the North. North Korea has carried out numerous missile tests this year. Some of these exploded shortly after launch, but others travelled for hundreds of miles before landing in the sea. Here are some of the major tests reported so far: 12 February- A medium-range ballistic missile launched from Banghyon air base near the west coast. It flew east towards the Sea of Japan for about 500km. 5 April- A medium-range ballistic missile fired from the eastern port of Sinpo into the Sea of Japan. South Korea's defence ministry said the missile flew about 60km. 4 July- Pyongyang claimed to have successfully tested an intercontinental ballistic missile for the first time. Officials said it reached an altitude of 2,802km and flew for 39 minutes. 29 August- North Korea fired what is thought to be its first nuclear-weapon capable ballistic missile over Japan. It was launched from near Pyongyang and reached a height of about 550km. 15 September- A ballistic missile was fired across Japan for the second time and landed in the sea off Hokkaido. It reached an altitude of about 770km and travelled 3,700km. N Korea missile 'higher' than any before. Video, 00:00:44N Korea missile 'higher' than any before What damage could North Korea do?

UK's Brexit offer 'worth up to 55bn euros',"This video can not be played During a visit to Iraq,Theresa May said the Brexit 'divorce bill' is still being negotiated The UK has offered a larger potential ""divorce bill"" to the EU - which could be worth up to 50bn euros (Â£44bn), the BBC understands. It was ""broadly welcomed"", political editor Laura Kuenssberg said, although No 10 has played down reports the final sum could be up to 55bn euros (Â£49bn). Asked on a trip to Iraq if a figure had been agreed, Theresa May said talks were continuing. And the EU's negotiator Michel Barnier said ""we are not there"" yet. In September Theresa May suggested the UK was willing to pay about 20bn euros to meet obligations arising from its membership but the EU has been calling for its offer to be increased. Laura Kuenssberg: What happens next?. Katya Adler: Brussels 'still guarded over Brexit divorce'' Brexitcast: Divorce bill special The UK is hoping to move on to talking about trade but the EU will only do this when it deems ""sufficient progress"" has been made on three areas - the so-called divorce bill, the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit and the Irish border. Brexit Secretary David Davis and EU chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier have been trying to reach a deal on the so-called divorce bill The EU says the UK needs to settle its accounts before it leaves. It says the UK has made financial commitments that have to be settled as part of an overall withdrawal agreement. The UK accepts that it has some obligations. And it has promised not to leave any other country out of pocket in the current EU budget period from 2014-20. But the devil is in the detail. There are also longer term issues like pensions for EU staff, and how the UK's contribution to these is calculated for years to come, and the question of what happens to building projects that had funding agreed by all EU members including the UK but which will only begin construction after the UK has left. Large amounts of the EU's budget are spent in two areas - agriculture and fisheries, and development of poorer areas. Reality Check: What's happening with the divorce bill? Reality Check: Where does EU money go? Downing Street has played down reports in the Financial Times and Daily Telegraph that a deal has been reached Pressure is mounting to make progress on the Brexit talks before a crunch summit in mid-December, when EU leaders will decide if enough progress has been made on the first set of subjects to open negotiations on a future trade deal between the EU and the UK. According to theDaily Telegraph,externaland theFinancial Times,external, agreement has now been reached between the two sets of negotiators on how the bill could be calculated. Speaking in the Commons, Treasury minister Liz Truss declined to comment on what she described as media speculation and insisted any financial settlement was ""contingent"" on the UK getting the right overall outcome. But Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said the UK would make a ""fair offer"" to help break the current deadlock. ""Now is the moment to get the whole ship off the rocks and move it forwards,"" he said during a trip to Ivory Coast, where he is attending a meeting of European and African leaders. The BBC understands detailed conversations are still taking place on which specific components will be included in the final bill and how they are calculated. The final bill is likely to be paid over many years rather than in a single upfront sum. This video can not be played Grayling: Not time to 'put figure' on Brexit bill At the moment no. But there appears to have been an agreement on the way that the amount the UK pays will be calculated and the BBC understands that the range of possible settlements is between approximately 40bn and 55bn euros. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling told BBC Radio 4's Today: ""There are no numbers for us to discuss this morning. We haven't committed to numbers."" Labour said it was not asking for a precise figure to be published as this was clearly ""sensitive"". But it said there needed to be a ""transparent process"" with the final figure subjected to scrutiny by Parliament and independent bodies. It is trying to force a vote on this next week. Former Tory leader Iain Duncan Smith said the UK - which according the the House of Commons Librarypaid an estimated Â£12.2bn to the EU in 2016-17,external- would save a ""staggering amount of money"" after Brexit. ""Leaving the EU is always a bargain because we get our money back,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage said the figures being reported would mean ""Christmas has come early"" for the EU. The long-time Brexit campaigner told ITV's Good Morning Britain that the UK was ""selling out"" and that even if such a sum secured tariff-free access to EU markets, this would not be worth it.

But former chancellor Ken Clarke said the UK had to pay its ""fair share"" and ""repudiating"" the UK's financial obligations would result in a hard Brexit - damaging jobs and investment. Remember there also has to be sufficient progress on the issues of citizens' rights and the Irish border for EU leaders to agree to move the talks on in ten days' time. The first issue should not be a stumbling block - there has been talk of agreement being within ""touching distance"" but the second issue is now the ""main sticking point"", the BBC's Europe editor Katya Adler says. The Irish government has said it wants firm guarantees on what kind of border controls there will be after Brexit and it is prepared to wait until next year, if necessary, for them. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was some talk in Whitehall of trying to agree a position which would stress agreement in the first two areas and ""park"" the Irish question until early next year. But she said EU officials were ""pouring a freezing cold bucket of water"" over the idea of a staged approach. In the meantime, she said both sides were discussing whether a joint paper could be produced before next Monday formalising what has been agreed so far so it could not potentially be unpicked at a later date. MEPs on the European Parliament have warned ""considerable problems"" remain and that more progress is needed before talks can move to the next phase. In a letter to chief EU negotiator Michel Barnier, the Parliament's Brexit steering group cited differences between the two sides on citizens' rights and said progress had ""stalled"" on the role of the European Court of Justice. The European Parliament is not leading the negotiations (that is the job of the European Commission) but it will get to vote on the final deal.

What damage could N Korea do?,"This video can not be played North Korea's recent missile tests have escalated tensions in the region North Korea is an isolated, impoverished but highly militarised state. Its leadership has one essential goal - survival. That is why they have placed huge resources in their nuclear and missile programmes as the ultimate insurance policy for the regime. Any use of its nuclear capability would be catastrophic - especially so for North Korea itself. The regime would not survive the ensuing conflict. But this awful prospect is not necessarily the immediate worry. It is the threat of the escalating war of words between Washington and Pyongyang moving from rhetoric to reality. North Korea is a country that has episodically resorted to the use of force in the past and could do so again. In March 2010 it is believed to have sunk a small South Korean warship. In the same year its artillery shelled a South Korean island and if this current crisis does go hot, it is likely to be South Korea that is on the receiving end of the North's anger. North Korea's missile programme Can the US defend itself against North Korea? North Korea's military has the numerical advantage over the South and is deployed close to the Demilitarised Zone (DMZ) marking the boundary between the two Koreas. It is frequently suggested that North Korean artillery and rocket forces (its strongest card) could level the South Korean capital Seoul within hours of the outbreak of a conflict. This is not actually so. Seoul is some 40km (24 miles) from the DMZ and can only be reached by the North's longest range artillery pieces. Their firing would betray their positions - many of them are not very mobile - and this would leave them vulnerable to attack by the South. South Korea has by far the qualitative edge and it is of course backed up by the extensive strike power of the US military. Any reprise of the Korean War of the 1950s - the movement of the North's forces southwards - would create huge numbers of civilian casualties (indeed among them would be many Chinese students and businesspeople resident in Seoul) but would inevitably end in a catastrophe for the North Korean regime. This video can not be played ""You can feel the ground shake"": A rare live report from a N Korean military parade Such a Korean War Mark II is hopefully unlikely. But the danger is that the North might seek to use its military forces for provocations or other steps that might precipitate a more generalised conflict. Quite apart from the reach of its artillery and rocket forces, the North has an extensive chemical arsenal. It may also have biological weapons. It has large numbers of highly trained special forces and other units designed to infiltrate the South. And it has developed a cyber attack capability as well. So it has many means by which it might seek to take military action. But any attack against the US or its allies in the current context risks a more generalised war. And assuming that the Pyongyang regime is not suicidal  - and despite many of the rhetorical claims to the contrary, this is not an irrational regime - then the North Korean leadership must be aware of the risks they run. The North Korea crisis in 300 words Analysis: Where do we go after 'fire and fury'? Can North Korea nuclear threat focus minds? From the North Korean perspective, having a nuclear weapon and an intercontinental missile capability to hold at risk the territory of the continental United States is entirely rational. The demise of the dictatorships in Iraq and Libya, the North Koreans would argue, was in large part because they did not have recourse to the ultimate weapon. Risking an all-out war with the United States though that could only end in the regime's demise makes no sense. Any war on the Korean peninsula would play to Washington's advantages. North Korean forces would be channelled southwards into limited avenues of advance due to the topography and the Pentagon could employ the classic concepts of its air-land battle to defeat them. Such a war though is unthinkable. It is in neither side's interests. The risk now is entirely of mistake, miscalculation and actions taken on the basis of clumsy and confused rhetorical signals. The North Koreans usually broadcast at full volume. The US now needs to be cautious about the tone of its own messaging.

N Korea's missile programme,"With the war of words between the US and North Korea escalating, focus has turned to Pyongyang's missile programme. But just how advanced is it? North Korea's missile arsenal has progressed over the decades from crude artillery rockets derived from World War II designs to testing what it says are long-range missiles that may be able to strike targets in the US. Intercontinental missiles North Korea's latest efforts are focused on building reliable long-range missiles, which would have the potential of reaching the mainland United States. On 4 July 2017, Pyongyang said it had carried out its first successful test of an inter-continental ballistic missile (ICBM). It said the Hwasong-14 could hit ""any part of the world"", but initial US estimates put the range as shorter than that. The US military described it as an intermediate-range missile, but a number of US experts said they believed the missile could reach the US state of Alaska. On 28 July 2017, North Korea carried out its second and latest ICBM test, with the missile reaching an altitude of about 3,000km and landing in the sea off Japan. Pyongyang has also displayed two types of ICBMs, known as the KN-08 and KN-14, at military parades since 2012. Carried and launched from the back of a modified truck, the three-stage KN-08 is believed to have a range of about 11,500km. The KN-14 appears to be a two-stage missile, with a possible range of around 10,000km. Neither has yet been tested, and the relationship between them and the Hwasong-14 is not yet clear. Media reports in the US have claimed that Pyongyang has now made a nuclear warhead small enough to fit inside its missiles.  While not confirmed, this has been seen as one of the last obstacles to North Korea being a fully nuclear-armed state. A report in theWashington Post,external, citing US intelligence officials, suggested North Korea was developing nuclear weapons capable of hitting the US at a much faster rate than expected. A Japanese government defence paper also said the weapons programme had ""advanced considerably"" and that North Korea possibly now had nuclear weapons. Inter-continental ballistic missiles are seen as the last word in power projection because they allow a country to wield massive firepower against an opponent on the other side of the planet. The only real reason to spend the money, time and effort building them is to have the capability to fire nuclear weapons. During the Cold War, Russia and the United States sought different ways to protect and deliver their missiles, which were hidden in silos, piggybacked on huge trucks or carried by submarines. All ICBMs are designed along similar lines. They are multi-stage rockets powered by solid or liquid fuel, and carry their weapon payload out of the atmosphere into space. The weapon payload - usually a thermonuclear bomb - then re-enters the atmosphere and detonates either above or directly on top of its target. Some ICBMs have a ""multiple independently targetable re-entry vehicle"", or Mirv. The country is highly militarised This has multiple warheads and decoys, allowing it to strike multiple targets and confuse missile defence systems. In the Cold War period, the range and potential threat of ICBMs were seen as key to the concept of ""Mutually Assured Destruction"" or MAD. MAD supposedly helped maintain peace because neither side could ""win"" without suffering incalculable damage. North Korea's own missile programme began with Scuds, with its first batch reportedly coming via Egypt in 1976. By 1984 it was building its own versions called Hwasongs. These missiles have an estimated maximum range of about 1,000km, and carry conventional, chemical and possibly biological warheads. From the Hwasong came the Nodong design - effectively an upscaled Hwasong/Scud with an extended range of 1,300km. In anApril 2016 analysis,,externalthe International Institute for Strategic Studies said the missiles were a ""proven system which can hit all of South Korea and much of Japan"". More capable missiles followed with the development of the Musudan range, which was most recently tested in 2016. Estimates differ dramatically on its how far it can fly, with Israeli intelligence putting it at 2,500km and the US Missile Defense Agency estimating about 3,200km. Other sources suggest a possible 4,000km. Another development came in August 2016 when North Korea announced it had tested a submarine based ""surface-to-surface, medium-to-long-range ballistic missile"", called the Pukguksong.

The North's other WMDs,"The warning from the South Korean President Moon Jae-in of the potential threat from North Korean chemical and biological weapons is timely, underscoring that Pyongyang has invested heavily in a variety of weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programmes. Mr Moon also warned of the danger of a North Korean electro-magnetic pulse (EMP) attack that could cripple a country's electrical grid and critical infrastructure. So while attention focuses on Pyongyang's nuclear weapons programme and the long-range missiles capable of delivering a nuclear warhead, how much do we know about these other secretive WMD programmes? Are Pyongyang's missiles a risk to planes? Pyongyang's missile and nuclear programme Reality Check: Minutes to shelter from a missile Special report: Korea crisis North Korea makes no secret of its nuclear weapons ambitions. In marked contrast, it does not admit to having chemical or biological weapons. It has signed up to a treaty banning biological weapons, but it has not acceded to the equivalent agreement banning chemical weapons. US and South Korean experts believe that, in fact, North Korea does have a significant chemical weapons programme, with stockpiles of munitions containing nerve, choking and blister agents; such substances as phosgene; hydrogen cyanide; mustard; and sarin. North Korea has a huge artillery and rocket force capable of delivering such munitions, though it remains unclear if it is able to produce chemical warheads that would survive the stresses of a flight on a ballistic missile. Much less is known about North Korea's activities in the biological weapons field. South Korean intelligence believes that the North is well-able to produce and weaponise pathogens like anthrax, botulism and typhus, but it is far from clear if these programmes have gone beyond the research stage. The EMP threat is something that is widely written about - it has especially been taken up in US conservative circles - and the debate has gained added currency in the wake of North Korean threats to mount such an attack. In essence, this would involve the detonation of a small nuclear device in the atmosphere - you would not even need a nuclear missile, a balloon could be released from a cargo ship - which results in a massive power-surge that damages and disables electrical circuitry over a huge area. Crippled infrastructure that might not be repairable for months could lead to death, chaos and lawlessness on a vast scale. In 2008, a US commission investigating the threat concluded that ""the electromagnetic pulse generated by a high-altitude nuclear explosion is one of a small number of threats that can hold our society at risk of catastrophic consequences"". This video can not be played South Korea tested missiles in response to the North's new launch Experts differ on the likelihood of such an attack emanating from North Korea, whatever the threats. Of course, in the Korean context there is already a nuclear threat and, to the extent that an EMP attack involves the detonation of a nuclear device, Pyongyang would be risking catastrophic reprisal and potentially the end of the regime. All these fears underscore the problem of dealing with Pyongyang. There is a tension between keeping the international community united behind UN sanctions resolutions and applying the scale of pressure that the Trump administration wants (and which it believes can only come from China). In the meantime, North Korea's programmes advance. A senior US general now warns that Pyongyang's recent test may well have been a hydrogen bomb, marking a significant advance in the North's capabilities. And all the while, the danger of a test going wrong - of debris landing on Japan or Guam - or of miscalculation grows, and with that the threat of crisis turning into conflict.

"Some lost rail routes may be 'restored'More than 4,000 miles of rail routes were closed in the 1960s as part of major cost cuts.","Firms which operate passenger services would also manage the tracks their trains run on, under government plans to fix ""creaking"" UK railways. East Coast mainline would be the first service to try the new model from 2020. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""It means when things go wrong, there's one team to sort it out"". The move is part of a new governmentrail strategy,externalthat could see the reopening of some lines that were closed in the 1960s. At the moment Network Rail, which is state-owned, looks after the track and other infrastructure while train services are operated by private companies. Mr Grayling said Network Rail was a ""big blob at the centre"" and said it ""makes sense"" to run trains and the track together. ""The system is creaking - it's bursting at the seams,"" he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The East Coast mainline, which connects London, the North East and Scotland, would be the first of a ""new generation of long-term regional partnerships,"" he said. Sir Richard Branson, Virgin Trains' founder, said the current system of running the track and trains separately ""doesn't work"" and causes delays. He hasblamed a ""far too big"" Network Rail for causing disruption, adding: ""I've always said that having a single, centralised rail infrastructure provider across the UK doesn't work. ""There needs to be a greater local focus and [Mr Grayling's] announcement is a welcome move in this direction."" Meanwhile, some rail routes lost under Richard Beeching in the 1960s and British Rail in the 1970s could be restored. Some 4,000 miles of track was closed in the 1960s, mainly in rural areas, which became known as the Beeching cuts. Mr Grayling said rail lines would be re-opened if they unlock jobs, encourage house building, ease congestion and offer ""value for money"". Work on the Oxford to Cambridge route starts next summer, and plans to re-open routes around Bristol, Birmingham, Exeter and the North East are being considered. The government will also consider splitting up two of the biggest train operators - Great Western and GTR, which comprises Southern, Thameslink and Great Northern. That could result in one company running high-speed lines between London, Bristol and south Wales, while another runs local services across the South West. By BBC Transport Correspondent Richard Westcott: I have never met anyone in the rail industry - either pro- or anti-privatisation - who thinks it was a good idea to split up who runs the trains and who runs the track and signals. But that is what we have got. There have been plenty of stories about Network Rail teams arguing with train company teams about who should fix a problem and who should pay - causing plenty of unnecessary delays. Now, the government has said it will change things to create joint teams - with one boss, public and private working together, to solve problems on the line. The biggest experiment will be on the East Coast mainline, where Virgin-Stagecoach is struggling to make money and has become frustrated with the physical state of the line. A new public-private partnership is being set up to run the train and tracks together. But we have no idea yet how it will work, who will pay for things, or when passengers might feel the benefit. This video can not be played It has been announced that 4,000 miles of railway line and 2,000 stations will close. But Labour has called the ideas ""un-funded proposals"", with shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald describing the plans as ""unambitious"". ""The Tories' record is of delayed, downgraded and cancelled investment, huge disparities in regional transport spending and soaring fares that are pricing passengers off the railway,"" he said. Mick Cash, general secretary of the RMT union, said it was a ""scandal"" that the plans did not consider publicly-owned railways. He said: ""The planned breaking up of Great Western and GTR is a massive admission of failure by the government but still they rule out the highly popular option of public ownership."" Mick Whelan, general secretary of the train drivers' union Aslef, said the union would be ""pleased to see the lines cut by Beeching restored"". However, he said Mr Grayling's new plans would not boost jobs and housing, asking: ""Where is the bold strategic vision for rail - and integrated transport links - in this country?"" Councils and business have also been asked to submit proposals for new lines. However, the government has no plans to make new money available to fund any such suggestions, the BBC's transport correspondent Richard Westcott said. Richard Beeching's brief as chairman of the British Transport Commission was simple: ""Make the railways pay."" British Rail was losing Â£140m a year when Dr Beeching took over the commission. His solution, announced on 27 March 1963, was equally straightforward - massive cuts. The Conservative government welcomed the report, but thousands of people - many in remote rural areas - were horrified they would lose their local branch lines. Opposition from the pressure groups failed and during the 1960s ""Beeching's Axe"" fell on 2,128 stations and more than 67,000 British Rail jobs.

"Ticket websites may be 'breaking law'After a year long investigation, the competition watchdog says some websites are failing to be clear.13h13 hours agoBusinessComments","Bands like the Arctic Monkeys have called for reform of the industry Secondary ticketing websites may be breaking the law, by failing to tell consumers about restrictions on the tickets they're buying. After a year-long investigation, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) found widespread concerns about such websites. It said some of them had taken action to improve, but others had not. The CMA has not named the websites involved, but it is threatening to do so if they don't comply. It may also take action in the courts. Secondary ticketing websites are designed to re-sell tickets to concerts, shows and events where the original buyer can no longer attend. The four largest sites, Get Me In, Viagogo, StubHub and Seatwave were all investigated as part of the enquiry. All four agreed to makesome changesin March 2015, before the CMA investigation began. Get Me In and Seatwave said they had complied with the law since November 2016. StubHub said it was working to ensure that consumers have access to a ""safe, secure and transparent"" ticket resale service. ""Our investigation has identified concerns that the law protecting consumers is being broken,"" said Andrea Coscelli, the chief executive of the CMA. ""Thousands of people use these sites and they have a right to know if there is a risk that they will be turned away at the door, who they've bought their ticket from or exactly what seat at the venue they're getting for their money."" The CMA says it must be made clear to consumers: whether there are restrictions on using a re-sold ticket which could stop someone getting into an event whom they are buying from. In some cases the seller could be a business, not an individual exactly where in the venue they will be sitting The news was welcomed by the FanFair Alliance, a group that campaigns against online ticket touts. ""It is has taken far too long to get here, but a Sword of Damocles now hangs over the entire secondary market,"" said a FanFair Alliance spokesperson. ""If they fail to deliver root-and-branch reforms, we expect the largest resale platforms to face significant consequences."" The CMA has also found some additional concerns, such as ""pressure selling"". In some cases websites are making false claims about the popularity of tickets, putting pressure on consumers to buy quickly. In other cases consumers can have difficulty getting their money back, despite guarantees on the website. The CMA also highlighted instances of speculative selling - where businesses advertise tickets they do not yet own - and cases where secondary sites are being used as primary sellers. Ticketmaster, which owns Get Me In and Seatwave, said it welcomed the CMA's initiative. ""We have been working closely with the CMA to ensure that we are compliant with consumer law, offering unparalleled transparency to fans when purchasing tickets,"" a spokesperson said. Several high-profile bands, including the Arctic Monkeys and One Direction, have called for tighter enforcement action on such sites. Under the Consumer Rights Act, offending sites face fines of up to Â£5,000.
