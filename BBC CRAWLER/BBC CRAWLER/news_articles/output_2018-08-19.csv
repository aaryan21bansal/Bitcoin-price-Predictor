Kerala flood rescue steps up as rains ease,"This video can not be played Soldiers winch small children to safety in Kerala's floods (Footage credit: Indian Air Force) Rescue efforts are being stepped up in the flood-hit Indian state of Kerala, where monsoon rains have eased for now. The India Meteorological Department has removed a red weather alert from all districts, though some areas are still under water. India's air force and navy helicopters are airlifting stranded people from rooftops, and dropping food supplies to those they cannot yet reach. More than 350 people have died in the floods. Thousands remain marooned. Officials said rescue teams are focused on the riverside town of Chengannur, where as many as 5,000 are feared to be trapped. A local politician, Saji Cherian, broke down in tears on TV on Friday describing the crisis there. ""Please give us a helicopter. I am begging you. Please help me, people in my place will die. Please help us. There is no other solution, people have to be airlifted,"" he said. On Sunday, the state's chief minister Pinarayi Vijayan vowed ""to save even the last person stranded"". Flood victims wait for rescue next to a makeshift raft Many of the stranded have spent days without food or drinking water Hundreds of government boats have been deployed across Kerala to aid the rescue. The BBC's Yogita Limaye, in Kerala, says the coastal state's many fishermen are providing valuable support, using their own boats to help the relief mission. As of Saturday, mobile operators are offering free data and text messages for people in Kerala to help those in distress. Entire villages have been lost to landslides, and soldiers are now clearing the debris and building temporary bridges to help restore transport links. Torrents of water have rushed through towns and villages More than 200,000 families have taken refuge in relief camps, according to an official at the Kerala State Disaster Management office. Authorities are concerned that they could now be hit by an outbreak of water-borne disease, or other contagious sickness. Three people with chickenpox have reportedly been isolated at a camp in the town of Aluva.

'Crisis' prison taken over by government,"This video can not be played Birmingham Prison has seen a number of problems in recent years Birmingham Prison is being taken over by the government from the private firm G4S, after inspectors said it had fallen into a ""state of crisis"". Chief Inspector of Prisons Peter Clarke described it as the worst prison he had ever been to. Inspectors found blood, vomit and rat droppings on the floor, sleeping staff, cockroaches and an overpowering smell of drugs. Extra staff are being brought in and the jail's capacity cut by 300. G4S said it welcomed the development as an opportunity to ""urgently address"" the problems. Mr Clarke wrote to Justice Secretary David Gauke detailing ""appalling"" failings at the jail. In the letter, he raises concerns over prisoner deaths, referring to three ""recent"" fatalities, suspected of being linked to synthetic cannabis substances, along with three self-inflected deaths in 18 months. This video can not be played Wendy says her husband, a former inmate at Birmingham Prison, was frightened of dying there Mr Clarke told BBC Radio 4's Today ""surely somebody must have been asleep at the wheel"". ""Squalor, filth, the air hanging heavy with the smell of drugs, a dilapidated physical environment, a sense of great instability of feeling that of any time violence could break out. ""This is the only jail, and I've visited many jails now, where I personally was forced to leave a wing because of the effect the drugs were having on me,"" he said. It is believed to be the first time the government has taken over a privately-run UK prison in such a way, midway through a contract, since the first one opened in 1992. Shadow justice secretary, Labour's Richard Burgon, said such privatisation should end. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

There were 1,147 assaults, including fights, recorded at Birmingham in 2017. This was the highest figure for any prison in England and Wales that year, or on record under modern reporting standards. It represented a fivefold increase since 2012, the first full year that it was run by G4S. This video can not be played Chief inspector of prisons describes the appalling conditions in Birmingham Prison More than a third of the assaults in 2017 were against staff. G4S was awarded a 15-year contract in 2011 to operate Birmingham Prison. Mr Clarke said there had been an ""abject failure"" of contract management and delivery. In his correspondence, he pointed to a ""dramatic deterioration"" in conditions following ariot in 2016and described a lack of order, with those perpetrating violence able to act with ""near impunity"". Groups of staff had locked themselves in their own offices. In his letter, Mr Clarke said: ""It was often difficult to find officers, although we did find some asleep during prisoner lock-up periods."" He said ""ineffective frontline management and leadership"" were at the heart of the prison's problems. He wrote: ""The inertia that seems to have gripped both those monitoring the contract and delivering it on the ground has led to one of Britain's leading jails slipping into a state of crisis that is remarkable even by the low standards we have seen all too frequently in recent years."" In 2016 more than 600 prisoners were involved in a riot at the jail Of the 16 privately run jails in the UK, G4S has contracts to operate five of them, including Birmingham. Ministers believe the others the company runs - Altcourse, Oakwood, Parc and Rye Hill - are performing well. But in 2016 the company was forced to transfer the management of Medway Secure Training Centre to the government, after BBC secret filming showedstaff allegedly mistreating children held there. Further concerns about the companyemerged last year after another undercover investigation into the G4S-run Brook House immigration removal centre, near Gatwick Airport. Life on the inside at 'hell hole' prison I'll quit if jails don't improve - minister Riot prison 'overcrowded and in crisis' An official report into the 2016 Birmingham jail riot has concluded the disturbance ""should have been prevented"". The report, released following a Freedom of Information request, said that the protest by prisoners was unplanned and was due to a number of factors including a loss of control on the prison wings, staff worn down by chronic staffing shortages, high levels of sickness and poor deployment of staff by managers. The disturbance to which prison officers from other sites were called lasted 15 hours The justice secretary now has 28 days to develop an action plan for HMP Birmingham. Prisons Minister Rory Stewart said: ""What we have seen at Birmingham is unacceptable and it has become clear that drastic action is required to bring about the improvements we require."" A new governor and 30 extra staff are being brought in and the capacity of the jail will be cut to 900 prisoners. Under the new regime at Birmingham, Paul Newton, who has spent 30 years in the Prison Service and is currently governor at Swaleside jail in Kent, will take charge. Mr Stewart said while Birmingham faced its own ""particular set of challenges"", it must start to ""live up to the standards seen elsewhere"". ""We have good, privately-run prisons across the country,"" he said. Jerry Petherick, managing director of G4S Custody & Detention Services, said: ""HMP Birmingham is an inner-city remand prison which faces exceptional challenges, including increasingly high levels of prisoner violence towards staff and fellow prisoners. ""The wellbeing and safety of prisoners and prison staff is our key priority and we welcome the six-month step-in and the opportunity to work with the Ministry of Justice to urgently address the issues faced at the prison."" The prison will be returned to G4S when sufficient progress has been made. Andrea Albutt, president of the Prison Governors Association, said: ""We need to stop overcrowding, we need to define what is the purpose of prison and then fund it adequately.""

Mum and daughter hurt in hammer attack,"The women were apparently targeted at random A mother and daughter are in a critical condition after a ""horrific"" hammer attack in south-east London. Scotland Yard said the women, aged 64 and 30, suffered injuries ""consistent with a violent assault"" at Adderley Gardens, Eltham, at about 12:10 BST. Joe Xuereb, 27, who lives locally, was arrested on suspicion of attempted murder in Sidcup on Sunday evening. The women, who did not know Mr Xuereb, are being treated at hospitals in south London. A hammer believed to have been used in the attack was recovered from the scene, police said. Neighbour Bob Gover, 69, called an ambulance for the two women. The retired TV engineer said: ""I heard a bit of a commotion, I looked outside and there was about half a dozen people out there. ""I went out there and I saw blood on the face of one of them and I knew something had happened so I ran inside and phoned for an ambulance. ""They were both covered in blood.""

Genoa bridge death toll rises to 43,"Although all those missing are now accounted for, the search is continuing Rescue workers in Italy have found the bodies of three more people in the wreckage of Genoa's collapsed motorway bridge, bringing the death toll to 43. Three members of the same family were recovered from a crushed car on Sunday. They were the last people reported missing from Tuesday's tragedy. A 200m (656ft) section of the Morandi bridge suddenly fell 45m, along with dozens of vehicles in busy traffic. The collapse has led to a fierce debate about Italy's infrastructure. The company that operated the bridge has set up a fund for victims' families. The government has set up a commission to examine the causes of the disaster. Bridge collapse: What we know so far Who were the victims? 'Miracle escape' stories emerge in Genoa On Saturday Italian President Sergio Mattarella and PM Giuseppe Conte led a state funeral for 18 of the victims in Genoa. This video can not be played The families of 18 of the victims gathered to mourn at a state funeral Some families stayed away from the ceremony, opting for private funerals, with some expressing anger at the government. One grieving mother told Italian media she held the state responsible, adding ""the parade of politicians has been shameful"". Another told Italian newspaper Il Messaggero: ""We do not want farcical ceremonies. ""Our children are not a tool for public parades... it is among those who loved them that they will receive a farewell."" Other families said they simply preferred to grieve in private. Giovanni Castelluci, the boss of operating company Autostrade per l'Italia, said millions of euros for victims' families would be available from Monday. He also said the firm would provide funding to help relocate hundreds of people who had to be moved out of their homes after the bridge collapsed. He said that reports carried out ahead of the disaster had described the bridge as being in good condition, but a full inquiry was ""the first priority"". Shares in Autostrade's parent company Atlantia plummeted in the aftermath of the disaster. The BBC's James Reynolds in Genoa says Italy's populist government is also keen to show it is taking action. Mr Conte confirmed on Friday that legal proceedings were under way to strip Autostrade of its contracts. Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte (fourth from R) visited the scene of the disaster on Tuesday Mr Conte has said that in future the government would compel companies that were granted concessions for Italy's infrastructure to invest more profits in maintenance and safety. The bridge is a main road in and out of Genoa, linking it to the A10 motorway and the road to France. Shortly before noon on Tuesday, the section collapsed amid extremely heavy rainfall. The cause is still unclear. The bridge was having work done to shore up its foundations at the time. Mourners attend Genoa bridge state funeral.

Third of fruit and veg 'too ugly to sell',"More than a third of farmed fruit and vegetables never reaches supermarket shelves because it is misshapen or the wrong size, according to new research. A University of Edinburgh study found more than 50 million tonnes of fruit and vegetables grown across Europe were discarded each year. This was in part because they did not meet consumers' expectations of how they should look. The study was published in the Journal of Cleaner Production. It examined food loss and waste within the European Economic Area and examined how much food was discarded each year before it reached the point of being sold. The researchers attributed losses to strict government regulations, supermarkets' high standards as well as customer expectations of how produce should look. They also found that farmers contracted to supermarkets typically grew more food than they were obliged to supply, to allow for a proportion that would not be deemed fit to sell. The researchers suggested that greater awareness among consumers, and a movement towards shopping sustainably, could encourage the sale of more ugly vegetables. Stephen Porter, of the University of Edinburgh's School of GeoSciences, said: ""Encouraging people to be less picky about how their fruit and vegetables look could go a long way to cutting waste, reducing the impact of food production on the climate, and easing the food supply chain."" In recent times, UK supermarkets have been making more spacefor increasing amounts of less-than-perfect produce. Last year, Sainsbury started a campaign to encourage use of blemished bananas, while Morrisons introduced a new ""wonky"" range that included avocados. Others, including Waitrose, Tesco and Asda, also branched out into selling misshapen fresh items.

Scot placed on FBI's 'most wanted' list,"A Scot accused of running a precious metals fraud scheme in the US has been placed on the FBI's ""most wanted"" list. Glasgow-born James Ward, 65, is alleged to have offered investors bogus deals involving precious metals such as gold, silver and platinum. The FBI allege he received about $400,000 (Â£314,000) from at least 12 investors between September 2007 and March 2010. He went on the run after being charged in Florida with wire fraud in 2012. The FBI states on its website,external: ""Ward allegedly operated an entity called Kastle & Hawk, Inc., which solicited investors to buy precious metals such as gold, silver, and platinum on a leveraged basis. ""Instead of investing the approximately $400,000 Ward received from at least 12 investors, Ward allegedly used the money for his own personal use and benefit. ""No precious metals were ever acquired for investors."" The FBI lists Mr Ward's occupation as ""securities broker"". It also describes him as blond but ""may change his hair colour frequently"". The agency added that Mr Ward, who has previously lived in Miami Beach, may travel to the United Kingdom, Canada and Mexico.

Pogba criticises Man Utd attitude,"Brighton have now beaten Manchester United in three successive home league games Manchester United did not show the right attitude in their surprise Premier League defeat at Brighton, says captain Paul Pogba. The Seagulls, who beat Jose Mourinho's side at the Amex Stadium in May to retain their top-flight status, stunned their visitors by scoring three goals in the first half. Glenn Murray flicked in the opener before Shane Duffy stroked home two minutes later. Romelu Lukaku halved the deficit 11 minutes before the break, rising unmarked to nod in Luke Shaw's ball, but Pascal Gross converted a penalty after a foul by Eric Bailly. Pogba also scored from the spot - deep in second-half stoppage time - but it was not enough to deny Brighton a famous win. ""The attitude that we had was not like we wanted to beat them. They had more anger than us and that showed on the pitch,"" Pogba told Sky Sports. ""I put myself first. My attitude wasn't right enough. We'll keep trying and keep pushing and obviously it's a lesson for us."" This video can not be played Man Utd punished for incredible mistakes - Mourinho Mourinho said he would not blame individuals, despite admitting his side made ""incredible mistakes"". The Portuguese has previously singled out players for criticism if he felt they performed below expectations but said his side were not good enough as a collective against Brighton. ""We were punished by the mistakes we made,"" he said. ""For me that's the story of the game. ""We made incredible mistakes in some crucial moments. Mistakes that killed us."" Mourinho had a frustrating summer in the transfer market Mourinho warned in the summer that his sidefaced ""a difficult season"",externalif they did not strengthen before the transfer window closed. He had highlighted his team's defence as an area that needed bolstering, but deadline day passed without any new arrivals. Mourinho's concerns were laid bare here, with his defence caught out on a number of occasions by Brighton's quick movement. Bailly, in particular, struggled. Aside from giving away the penalty he also miscontrolled a pass in the second half that momentarily put March through before the Ivorian was able to recover. Bailly and centre-back partner Victor Lindelof - both Mourinho signings - have now been a part of a defence that has conceded four goals in the first two games of the season. It took United nine to let in that many last season. This video can not be played A victory Brighton very much deserved - Hughton Brighton's home form played a huge part in their survival last season, with 29 of their 40 points secured at the Amex Stadium. Once again, it looks like a trip to the south coast will be a difficult one for their Premier League rivals. United may have been well below par but that should not take away from what was a controlled and confident display by the Seagulls against a side that finished second last season. They took the game to their opponents from the outset, March working the defence with an early cross, and even the loss of influential defender Lewis Dunk did not disrupt them as Anthony Knockaert got in behind before putting his shot just wide. Brighton did not have a shot after the break, but they did not need to as they changed tack from attack to containment. In the end it was a comfortable afternoon for Chris Hughton's side. ""I thought we were very good. It was a victory we deserved,"" said Hughton. ""There's not a player that didn't play well. To get that result with the quality they have you have to put in a good performance."" Martial managed just one shot, which was blocked, and two crosses before he was substituted Alexis Sanchez was a surprise absentee from United's starting XI, with Mourinho confirming before kick-off that the forward was injured. That meant Anthony Martial, who has been linked with a move, was handed the chance to impress. Mourinho was critical of Martial for his performance here in May, and another ineffective display will surely not have impressed his manager. Martial lasted until the hour mark before he was substituted with neither he nor Mourinho appearing to acknowledge each other as he went down the tunnel. Solly March was everywhere for Brighton - particularly in the first half - and provided a brilliant cross for Glenn Murray's opener Since taking charge of United at the start of the 2016-17 season, the only opponent Mourinho has lost against more often than Brighton (two) is his former club Chelsea (four). Brighton have lost just one of their past eight home games in the Premier League (W5 D2 L1), with the two most recent both being wins against United (1-0 in 2017-18 and 3-1 in 2018-19). United lost their first away game of a Premier League campaign for the first time since 2012-13, when they were beaten 1-0 by Everton. Twenty three of Murray's 24 goals in the Premier League have been scored from inside the box, including 100% of those scored for Brighton in the competition (13/13). Gross has scored eight goals in the Premier League, with all eight at home. Only two players have netted more goals exclusively at home in the competition's history - Georginio Wijnaldum (18) and Clive Wilson (nine). In competitive games since the start of the 2018 World Cup, David de Gea has conceded 10 goals from the past 14 shots on target he has faced. Lukaku has scored against 18 of the current 20 Premier League teams, with Cardiff and Wolves the only teams he is yet to find the net against. Pogba ended on the losing side in a Premier League game he scored in for the first time - prior to today, United had won each of the previous 11 games he had netted in, which was a joint-record in the competition (with Ryan Babel for Liverpool). This was only the 10th time in Premier League history that United conceded three first-half goals in a game, and the first time since October 2015 against Arsenal.

"'Truth isn't truth,' says Rudy Giuliani","President Donald Trump's lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, has raised eyebrows by claiming that ""truth isn't truth"" during a television interview. Mr Giuliani was arguing that Mr Trump should not testify to the Russia probe, as he might be ""trapped into perjury"". ""Truth is truth"", NBC host Chuck Todd countered,external. Mr Giuliani denied this was the case, and said two rival versions of events were in contention. His reply seemed to echo controversial claims from Trump aides about facts. In January last year Kellyanne Conway told Todd's programme, Meet the Press, that the White House was entitled to present ""alternative facts"" - to which Todd retorted: ""Alternative facts are not facts. They're falsehoods."" From 'alternative facts' to rewriting history Alternative facts and qualified truths This video can not be played Donald Trump: 'What you're seeing and what you're reading is not what's happening' The exchange on Meet the Press on Sunday began with Mr Todd asking Mr Giuliani whether the Trump team was stalling about a possible testimony at the inquiry led by Special Counsel Robert Mueller into alleged meddling by Russia in the 2016 US election. Mr Giuliani said: ""I'm not going to be rushed into having him testify so he can be trapped into perjury."" He added: ""When you tell me that he should testify because he's going to tell the truth and he shouldn't worry, well that's so silly because it's somebody's version of the truth. Not the truth."" Todd responded: ""Truth is truth."" Mr Giuliani said: ""Truth isn't truth."" The interviewer put his hand on his forehead and said: ""This is going to become a bad meme!"" Who's who in Trump-Russia drama? All you need to know about Trump Russia story Mr Giuliani then made his main point - that accusations of obstruction of justice against the president hinge on a conversation he had with then FBI director James Comey in February 2017, and that Mr Trump's account of that conversation differs radically from Mr Comey's. ""If you're just a genius, tell me what the truth is!"" Mr Giuliani tells Todd. ""We have a credibility gap between the two of them. You've got to select between the two of them."" Trumps critics were prompt to seize on the exchange. Preet Bharara, a Democrat who was fired as federal prosecutor by the Trump administration, suggested ""truth isn't truth"" would not sound convincing in a trial. Allow Twitter content?

This is not the first time that Mr Giuliani, a former New York City mayor, has spoken of irreconcilable accounts of the same event. He told the Washington Post in May that Mr Mueller and his team ""may have a different version of the truth than we do."" In the interview, Mr Giuliani characterised the Russia inquiry as ""wild, crazy, unorthodox"". The president denies any collusion, and has repeatedly called the Mueller probe ""a witch hunt"".

UK investigates WW2 shipwreck looting claims,"The wreck of the Royal Navy battlecruiser HMS Repulse was reported to have been damaged or destroyed by thieves The UK will investigate allegations that British World War Two wrecks in Asia have been targeted by scavengers, the defence secretary says. Gavin Williamson said he was ""very concerned"" to hear claims that four shipwrecks off the Malaysian and Indonesian coasts had been looted. The Mail on Sunday said,externalHMS Tien Kwang, HMS Kuala, HMS Banka and SS Loch Ranza were targeted for their metal. They are thought to be the graves of Royal Navy sailors and civilians. It comes after six wrecks, including Royal Navy battleship HMS Prince of Wales and battlecruiser HMS Repulse, were reported to have been damaged or destroyed by thieves. The UK government ""absolutely condemns"" the unauthorised disturbance of any wreck containing human remains, Mr Williamson said. ""I am very concerned to hear any allegations of incidents of Royal Navy wrecks being plundered in the Far East,"" he said. ""We will work closely with the Indonesian and Malaysian governments to investigate these claims."" How could a shipwreck disappear?

Submarine chaser HMS Tien Kwang and auxiliary patrol vessel HMS Kuala were carrying hundreds of evacuees when they were attacked by Japanese bombers near the Indonesian Riau Islands in February 1942. That same month the cargo ship, the SS Loch Ranza, exploded in a Japanese air raid off the Riau Islands, killing seven men. HMS Banka, a minesweeper, sank after hitting a mine off the coast of Malaysia in December 1941, killing its crew of four British officers and 34 Malay sailors. Defence Secretary Gavin Williamson said he was ""very concerned"" to hear the claims The HMS Prince of Wales, where Churchill and Roosevelt signed the Atlantic Charter, which defined the Allied aims for the world after the war, and HMS Repulse both sank off the Malaysian coast, on 10 December 1941 and are the last resting places of more than 830 Royal Navy sailors.

New Brexit vote campaign gets ÃÂ£1m donation,"Julian Dunkerton says Brexit would have prevented Superdry from becoming a success One of the co-founders of the fashion label Superdry has donated Â£1m to the campaign for another EU referendum. Multi-millionaire Julian Dunkerton said he was backing the People's Vote campaign because ""we have a genuine chance to turn this around"". The People's Vote, a cross-party group including some MPs, want a public vote on the final Brexit deal. The government has ruled out another referendum after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March next year. Brexit: All you need to know Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Gary Lineker backs Brexit vote campaign Mr Dunkerton said he believes the brand he co-launched ""would never have become the global success that it did"" if Brexit had happened 20 years earlier. His donation, the largest received by the People's Vote, will go towards funding opinion polls. He added: ""I will be paying for one of the most detailed polling exercises ever undertaken by a campaign so that more and more people have the confidence to demand the democratic right for their voice to be heard."" However, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen -  a leading Brexit backer - said the People's Vote campaign was not about democracy. He told the BBC: ""Actually what their declared intent is is to overturn the democratic decision of 2016 to leave the EU."" This video can not be played Nigel Farage: ""Brexit plan a complete betrayal"" The former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, said that he doubted another public vote would reverse the referendum result. He told his LBC radio show he ""had a hunch"" that if the public got the chance to vote again ""then our politicians might just be in for the shock of their lives"". His comments come a day after after he announcedhe would return to the campaign trailand offer his ""total support"" to pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave. The People's Vote campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a referendum on the deal Prime Minister Theresa May strikes with Brussels, which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October. They have organised a number of events over the summer to step up pressure on MPs. Hundreds of people attended a rally in Edinburgh's Festival Square on Saturday in support of the campaign. Meanwhile, a Standard Chartered bank executive says tough demands by EU regulators could seemore jobs in the industry being moved overseas from the UK than currently thought. Standard Chartered is to spend about Â£15m turning its Frankfurt office into a European base due to Brexit. Europe and Americas boss Tracy Clarke says the impact on banks with large EU services may be ""significant"". On Thursday the government is set to publish the first in a series of technical notices designedto prepare the UK for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said securing a deal was still ""the most likely outcome"" - but added making alternative arrangements was the ""responsible"" thing to do. Between late August and the end of September, government departments are expected to publish around 70 technical notices.

UK woman rescued after 10 hours at sea,"This video can not be played 'I am very lucky to be alive' A British woman has survived after falling from a cruise ship off the coast of Croatia, the country's coastguard has said. Officials said the 46-year-old was rescued 10 hours after falling into the Adriatic Sea - 60 miles offshore - at around midnight on Saturday. The woman, named as Kay Longstaff, was taken to hospital in the town of Pula. She said she was sitting at the back of the deck before falling overboard and was ""very lucky to be alive"". Speaking to Croatian news channel HRT after stepping off the coastguard patrol boat the Cavtat, she added: ""I was in the water for 10 hours, so these wonderful guys rescued me."" She was then taken to hospital in an ambulance. The rescue vessel's captain, Lovro Oreskovic, said Ms Longstaff was ""exhausted"" when she was found on Sunday, adding: ""We were extremely happy for saving a human life."" Ms Longstaff was helped onto the Cavtat coastguard patrol boat One of the Croatian Coast Guard crew members dived in the sea to haul her out According tothe Sun,external, Ms Longstaff told one rescuer it had helped that she was fit from doing yoga and that she sang to stop her feeling cold overnight. David Radas, from the Croatian Ministry of Maritime Affairs, said rescuers were able to work out the exact moment Ms Longstaff fell in the water by checking CCTV from the 965ft long (291m) cruise ship. ""Because they knew the time, they were able to know the exact position of the ship,"" he told the paper. Mr Radas told the BBC Ms Longstaff was hypothermic, but overall in ""good physical shape"" when she was found. He said the circumstances around how she fell from the Norwegian Star ship were being investigated. The search was launched at around 6:30 local time after her fall at just before midnight The Croatian Coast Guard said a ship and an aircraft launched a search at around 06:30 local time on Sunday. The ship's crew spotted Ms Longstaff in the sea - around one mile from where she fell - at 09:40 and one of the crew dived in the sea to haul her out before taking her to shore. The Norwegian Star was delayed getting to Venice on Sunday, having also been part of the search operation in the early morning. ""The ship only told us a passenger fell overboard and we spent a few hours searching for her,"" passenger Bethany Joyce told the BBC. The 21-year-old from Long Island, New York is currently in Venice with her family, after missing their flight to Toronto on Sunday. She said disembarkation was ""a mess"", adding: ""(We) understand it was very hectic for them but we think it could have been handled much better."" The 46-year-old says she was sitting on the back of the deck of the Norwegian Star before falling Part of the cruise ship has been cordoned off A statement from Norwegian Cruise Line confirmed that a guest had gone overboard while the ship was on its way from Vargarola to Venice. It said: ""We are pleased to advise that the guest was found alive, is currently in stable condition, and has been taken ashore in Croatia for further treatment. ""We are very happy that the individual, who is a UK resident, is now safe and will soon be reunited with friends and family."" The Foreign Office confirmed it had been notified of the incident. This video can not be played Watch BBC reporter Natalie Crockett try out the RNLI floating technique Professor Mike Tipton, an expert on surviving extreme environments, says the woman in this case had a ""perfect"" survival situation with warm, calm water. ""The water temperature would have been about 28-29C which is a little bit warmer than a swimming pool,"" he says, meaning she would not have have suffered cold water shock. And the fact she ""wasn't being battered by waves"" meant she could float, swim and stay near to the spot where she fell in to maximise her chance of being rescued. Other factors which have an impact on your chance of survival: If you are female, you will typically have a higher percentage of body fat which helps with floating and keeping warm Conserving energy by floating on your back rather than swimming, according to the RNLI A calm, positive mental attitude, Prof Tipton says, can help someone endure a long period of survival Read more How to survive for 10 hours in the water New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

New Brexit vote campaign gets Â£1m donation,"Julian Dunkerton says Brexit would have prevented Superdry from becoming a success One of the co-founders of the fashion label Superdry has donated Â£1m to the campaign for another EU referendum. Multi-millionaire Julian Dunkerton said he was backing the People's Vote campaign because ""we have a genuine chance to turn this around"". The People's Vote, a cross-party group including some MPs, want a public vote on the final Brexit deal. The government has ruled out another referendum after Britain voted to leave the EU in June 2016. The UK is on course to leave the EU on 29 March next year. Brexit: All you need to know Have voters changed their minds about Brexit? Gary Lineker backs Brexit vote campaign Mr Dunkerton said he believes the brand he co-launched ""would never have become the global success that it did"" if Brexit had happened 20 years earlier. His donation, the largest received by the People's Vote, will go towards funding opinion polls. He added: ""I will be paying for one of the most detailed polling exercises ever undertaken by a campaign so that more and more people have the confidence to demand the democratic right for their voice to be heard."" However, Conservative MP Andrew Bridgen -  a leading Brexit backer - said the People's Vote campaign was not about democracy. He told the BBC: ""Actually what their declared intent is is to overturn the democratic decision of 2016 to leave the EU."" This video can not be played Nigel Farage: ""Brexit plan a complete betrayal"" The former UKIP leader, Nigel Farage, said that he doubted another public vote would reverse the referendum result. He told his LBC radio show he ""had a hunch"" that if the public got the chance to vote again ""then our politicians might just be in for the shock of their lives"". His comments come a day after after he announcedhe would return to the campaign trailand offer his ""total support"" to pro-Brexit group Leave Means Leave. The People's Vote campaign is hoping to get enough MPs, including the Labour leadership, to back a referendum on the deal Prime Minister Theresa May strikes with Brussels, which is due to be put to a vote in Parliament in October. They have organised a number of events over the summer to step up pressure on MPs. Hundreds of people attended a rally in Edinburgh's Festival Square on Saturday in support of the campaign. Meanwhile, a Standard Chartered bank executive says tough demands by EU regulators could seemore jobs in the industry being moved overseas from the UK than currently thought. Standard Chartered is to spend about Â£15m turning its Frankfurt office into a European base due to Brexit. Europe and Americas boss Tracy Clarke says the impact on banks with large EU services may be ""significant"". On Thursday the government is set to publish the first in a series of technical notices designedto prepare the UK for the possibility of a no-deal Brexit. Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab said securing a deal was still ""the most likely outcome"" - but added making alternative arrangements was the ""responsible"" thing to do. Between late August and the end of September, government departments are expected to publish around 70 technical notices.

British woman rescued after 10 hours at sea,"This video can not be played 'I am very lucky to be alive' A British woman has survived after falling from a cruise ship off the coast of Croatia, the country's coastguard has said. Officials said the 46-year-old was rescued 10 hours after falling into the Adriatic Sea - 60 miles offshore - at around midnight on Saturday. The woman, named as Kay Longstaff, was taken to hospital in the town of Pula. She said she was sitting at the back of the deck before falling overboard and was ""very lucky to be alive"". Speaking to Croatian news channel HRT after stepping off the coastguard patrol boat the Cavtat, she added: ""I was in the water for 10 hours, so these wonderful guys rescued me."" She was then taken to hospital in an ambulance. The rescue vessel's captain, Lovro Oreskovic, said Ms Longstaff was ""exhausted"" when she was found on Sunday, adding: ""We were extremely happy for saving a human life."" Ms Longstaff was helped onto the Cavtat coastguard patrol boat One of the Croatian Coast Guard crew members dived in the sea to haul her out According tothe Sun,external, Ms Longstaff told one rescuer it had helped that she was fit from doing yoga and that she sang to stop her feeling cold overnight. David Radas, from the Croatian Ministry of Maritime Affairs, said rescuers were able to work out the exact moment Ms Longstaff fell in the water by checking CCTV from the 965ft long (291m) cruise ship. ""Because they knew the time, they were able to know the exact position of the ship,"" he told the paper. Mr Radas told the BBC Ms Longstaff was hypothermic, but overall in ""good physical shape"" when she was found. He said the circumstances around how she fell from the Norwegian Star ship were being investigated. The search was launched at around 6:30 local time after her fall at just before midnight The Croatian Coast Guard said a ship and an aircraft launched a search at around 06:30 local time on Sunday. The ship's crew spotted Ms Longstaff in the sea - around one mile from where she fell - at 09:40 and one of the crew dived in the sea to haul her out before taking her to shore. The Norwegian Star was delayed getting to Venice on Sunday, having also been part of the search operation in the early morning. ""The ship only told us a passenger fell overboard and we spent a few hours searching for her,"" passenger Bethany Joyce told the BBC. The 21-year-old from Long Island, New York is currently in Venice with her family, after missing their flight to Toronto on Sunday. She said disembarkation was ""a mess"", adding: ""(We) understand it was very hectic for them but we think it could have been handled much better."" The 46-year-old says she was sitting on the back of the deck of the Norwegian Star before falling Part of the cruise ship has been cordoned off A statement from Norwegian Cruise Line confirmed that a guest had gone overboard while the ship was on its way from Vargarola to Venice. It said: ""We are pleased to advise that the guest was found alive, is currently in stable condition, and has been taken ashore in Croatia for further treatment. ""We are very happy that the individual, who is a UK resident, is now safe and will soon be reunited with friends and family."" The Foreign Office confirmed it had been notified of the incident. This video can not be played Watch BBC reporter Natalie Crockett try out the RNLI floating technique Professor Mike Tipton, an expert on surviving extreme environments, says the woman in this case had a ""perfect"" survival situation with warm, calm water. ""The water temperature would have been about 28-29C which is a little bit warmer than a swimming pool,"" he says, meaning she would not have have suffered cold water shock. And the fact she ""wasn't being battered by waves"" meant she could float, swim and stay near to the spot where she fell in to maximise her chance of being rescued. Other factors which have an impact on your chance of survival: If you are female, you will typically have a higher percentage of body fat which helps with floating and keeping warm Conserving energy by floating on your back rather than swimming, according to the RNLI A calm, positive mental attitude, Prof Tipton says, can help someone endure a long period of survival Read more How to survive for 10 hours in the water New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

White House lawyer co-operating with probe,"Don McGahn had answered the questions ""fulsomely and honestly"", his lawyer said The top lawyer in the White House is ""co-operating extensively"" with the Russia inquiry into election meddling, the New York Times reports. Donald McGahn has spent 30 hours sharing detailed accounts of episodes at the heart of the probe, it says. President Donald Trump later said he had authorised Mr McGahn's co-operation with special counsel Robert Mueller. Mr Mueller is investigating possible collusion between Russia and Mr Trump's team in the 2016 US election. The president denies any collusion, and has repeatedly called the Mueller probe ""a witch hunt"". Russia also denies claims it interfered in the polls two years ago, which saw Donald Trump defeat Democratic rival Hillary Clinton. Who's who in Trump-Russia drama? All you need to know about Trump Russia story Citing a dozen current and former White House officials, the paper says White House counsel Donald McGahn gave at least three voluntary interviews to investigators totalling 30 hours over a nine-month period. During this time, he gave ""a clear view of the president's most intimate moments with his lawyer"", sharing information the paper says investigators would not have previously known about. It said he had recounted Mr Trump's comments and actions ""during the firing of the FBI director James Comey, and Mr Trump's obsession with putting a loyalist in charge of the inquiry, including his repeated urging of Attorney General Jeff Sessions to claim oversight of it"". As well as collusion, the special counsel is scrutinising whether there were any attempts by the president to obstruct justice. Just last month,Mr Trump demanded Mr Sessions fire Robert Muellerand end the probe ""right now"". A source close to the probe told Reuters they did not believe Mr McGahn had provided any incriminating information. After the report was released, President Trump confirmed in a tweet that he had allowed Mr McGahn and other White House staff ""to fully co-operate with the special counsel"". Allow Twitter content?

Mr McGahn's own lawyer on Saturday said his client had ""answered the Special Counsel team's questions fulsomely and honestly"". The New York Times said in its report that it was rare for a lawyer to be so open with investigators, but he may have been motivated out of fear of prosecution over White House decisions that might have been construed as obstructing justice. President Trump launched a fresh attack on the newspaper on Sunday, describing its report as ""a fake piece"" for implying Mr McGahn had incriminating information to share. Allow Twitter content?

Special counsel Robert Mueller is investigating whether President Trump's campaign team colluded with Russia to influence the outcome of the presidential election. What is Robert Mueller investigating? In 2016, US intelligence agencies concluded that Russia had used a state-authorised campaign of cyber attacks and fake news stories planted on social media in an attempt to turn the election against Hillary Clinton. Thirty-two people have now been indicted, including four members of Mr Trump's campaign team and 25 Russians. The president's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, is the first person to go on trial as a result of Mr Mueller's investigation. However, the charges are not related to the US election but instead to tax evasion and money-laundering stemming from his political consultancy work in Ukraine.

Children of smokers 'risk adult disease',"Non-smoking adults have a higher risk of dying from serious lung disease if they grew up with parents who smoked, according to US research. The researchers said childhood passive smoking was ""likely to add seven deaths to every 100,000 non-smoking adults dying annually"". The study of 70,900 non-smoking men and women was led by the American Cancer Society. Experts said the best way to protect children was to quit smoking. If participants lived with a smoker during adulthood, there were other health implications, the study found. Smoke exposure of 10 or more hours every week increased their risk of death from ischemic heart disease by 27%, stroke by 23% and chronic obstructive lung disease by 42% compared to those who lived with non-smokers. The study was published in theAmerican Journal of Preventive Medicine,external. Participants were questioned about their exposure to smoking throughout their lives, and then their health was tracked over the next 22 years. Hazel Cheeseman, of campaign group Action on Smoking and Health, said: ""This latest study adds to the compelling case to take smoke outside to protect children from harm. ""The best way to do this is for parents to quit."" She referred to data on NHS Stop Smoking Services in England urging improved funding in this area. No safe level of smoking, study finds Vaping â good, bad or not clear- - BBC News Pets 'at risk from passive smoking' Dr Nick Hopkinson, medical adviser to the British Lung Foundation, agreed, saying: ""Passive smoking has a lasting impact well beyond childhood. ""Unfortunately, stop smoking services in the UK are being cut. We need to make sure that everyone, especially parents of young children and pregnant women who smoke, get the help they need to quit."" Children whose parents smoke are known to be at risk of asthma and poor lung development. This study shows that the effects of childhood smoke exposure persist into adulthood, resulting in chronic obstructive lung disease. While the researchers focused on mortality risks, they emphasised that childhood second-hand smoking may also increase chronic illness and healthcare dependency in later life. Dr Ryan Diver, one of the report's authors, said: ""This is the first study to identify an association between childhood exposure to second-hand smoke and death from chronic obstructive lung disease in middle age and beyond. ""Our findings provide further evidence for reducing second-hand smoke exposure throughout life,"" he added.

'Hero' paraglider killed in mid-air crash,"Innes Powell was previously hailed a hero for risking his life to save another paraglider A ""hero"" paraglider has died after a mid-air collision with another pilot in Macedonia. Innes Powell, 54, crashed into Ukrainian Igor Volov, 56, ahead of the final race of the British Open in Krusevo on Friday. The British instructor, from Tavistock in Devon, was well-known in the industry and had decades of experience in competitive flying. He died in hospital, while Mr Volov died at the scene. Tributes were paid to Mr Powell by the Isle of Wight Hang Gliding and Paragliding Club, where he trained. Its committee chairman said it sent ""sincere and deep condolences"" to his family. Mr Powell had previously been hailed a hero for risking his life to save another paraglider when she crashed into a cliff ledge. The rescue featured in the 2008 Discovery Channel series, True Heroes. On Friday, Mr Powell was travelling through a thermal air column when he swung into Mr Volov, according to Cross Country magazine. They managed to separate but were propelled into contact again ""much harder"", a pilot told the publication. Mr Powell did not open his reserve parachute and landed on a path below. The competition had been on its final day and was halted after the crash. Guy Massey, 62, said his friend was ""an adventurer who always wanted to be better and learn more"". ""He was always happy to help a novice and impart his knowledge,"" he added. Barrie James, 82, from Torquay, Devon, was taught to paraglide by Mr Powell when he was in his 70s. ""He was a very, very thorough, sound instructor,"" he said. ""Very, very safety conscious and a likeable person."" A statement on the British Paragliding Competitions website said: ""Our deep condolences go to the families and friends of the two pilots."" The prosecutor's office in Macedonia said it had ordered video and data from the paragliders' tracker systems be downloaded.

Egypt tightens control over internet use,"President Sisi's supporters say he has brought stability while critics say he has stifled democracy Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has signed a new law that tightens controls over the internet. The legislation on ""cybercrime"" means websites can be blocked in Egypt if deemed to constitute a threat to national security or the economy. Anyone found guilty of running, or just visiting, such sites could face prison or a fine. Authorities say the new measures are needed to tackle instability and terrorism. But human rights groups accuse the government of trying to crush all political dissent in the country. The Cairo-based Association of Freedom of Thought and Expression said more than 500 websites had already been blocked in Egypt prior to the new law being signed. Sisi sworn in for second term with vow to fight terrorism Egypt detainees subjected to 'assembly line' of torture Paying the price for seeking freedom in Egypt Last month another bill was passed by parliament, yet to be approved by President Sisi, that would allow any social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers to be placed under supervision. Correspondents says that with street protests in Egypt all but banned, the internet has been one of the last forums left for Egyptians to express dissent. Human Rights Watch issued a warning last month,externalthat Egyptian authorities were increasingly using counterterrorism and state-of-emergency laws and courts to unjustly prosecute journalists, activists, and critics for peaceful criticism. Those recently arrested include the well-known blogger and rights defender Wael Abbas; Amal Fathy, a political activist and the wife of the head of the Egyptian Commission for Rights and Freedoms; and the comic Shady Abu Zaid.

Not only Ghana, but the whole world."" Kofi Annan described his greatest achievement as the Millennium Development Goals, which - for the first time - set global targets on issues such as poverty and child mortality. The drive is widely regarded as a success. However, Annan was not immune from criticism. Some blamed him for the UN's failure to halt the genocide in Rwanda in the 1990s when he was head of the organisation's peacekeeping operations. He later clashed with America and the UK over the Iraq war after 2003, calling the US-led invasion illegal. But despite their past differences, former US President George W Bush was among those paying homage to Annan on Saturday, calling him ""a tireless leader of the United Nations"" whose ""voice of experience will be missed around the world"".

"Egypt tightens control over internet useNew laws mean websites can be blocked if deemed a security threat, but critics say they crush dissent.Middle East","President Sisi's supporters say he has brought stability while critics say he has stifled democracy Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi has signed a new law that tightens controls over the internet. The legislation on ""cybercrime"" means websites can be blocked in Egypt if deemed to constitute a threat to national security or the economy. Anyone found guilty of running, or just visiting, such sites could face prison or a fine. Authorities say the new measures are needed to tackle instability and terrorism. But human rights groups accuse the government of trying to crush all political dissent in the country. The Cairo-based Association of Freedom of Thought and Expression said more than 500 websites had already been blocked in Egypt prior to the new law being signed. Sisi sworn in for second term with vow to fight terrorism Egypt detainees subjected to 'assembly line' of torture Paying the price for seeking freedom in Egypt Last month another bill was passed by parliament, yet to be approved by President Sisi, that would allow any social media accounts with more than 5,000 followers to be placed under supervision. Correspondents says that with street protests in Egypt all but banned, the internet has been one of the last forums left for Egyptians to express dissent. Human Rights Watch issued a warning last month,externalthat Egyptian authorities were increasingly using counterterrorism and state-of-emergency laws and courts to unjustly prosecute journalists, activists, and critics for peaceful criticism.

Ecuador slams door on Venezuelans,"This video can not be played Venezuelan migrants stuck at Ecuador border Ecuador has brought in new rules to stop Venezuelan migrants entering the country without a passport, leaving many stranded in neighbouring Colombia. Thousands of Venezuelans fleeing their country's economic and political crisis have been crossing into Ecuador from Colombia using only identity cards. Most are heading south to join family members in Peru and Chile. Colombia has protested against the move, saying vulnerable people will be trapped on its side of the border. In a separate incident, residents of a Brazilian town attacked a Venezuelan migrant camp on Saturday and drove the occupants back across the border. Venezuela has suffered for years from high inflation and the chronic shortage of food and medicines. More than a million Venezuelan migrants have entered Colombia in the past 15 months, according to official estimates, and more than 4,000 have been arriving at Ecuador's border every day. Venezuela crisis: How did we get here? Venezuela deploys soldiers to markets Venezuela's leader NicolÃ¡s Maduro divides opinion Many migrants, who have been walking or hitching rides for weeks and are exhausted by the time they reach the frontier, only carry ID cards. Early on Saturday, about 300 Venezuelans were lined up at the Rumichaca border crossing outside the Colombian city of Ipiales, and many said they had no passports to gain entry to Ecuador. Gabriel Malavolta, a 50-year-old mechanic, left Venezuela three days ago aiming to make the overland route to Lima, Peru, through Ecuador. He has a passport but his fiancee, Yenny, had only an ID card. ""I don't know what we're going to do, but we can't go back. I'm not sending my fiancee to go back and go hungry,"" he told Reuters news agency at a Red Cross tent. ""You've no idea what it's like [in Venezuela]. Whole families eat from the trash."" There are long queues of Venezuelans migrants at the border crossing near Ipiales Christian Kruger Sarmiento, director of the Migration Colombia agency, told the BBC Ecuador's move would only create more problems. ""Demanding a passport is not going to stop migration because this population is not leaving the country for pleasure but out of necessity,"" he said. ""The first thing that will happen... is that it will see an increase in undocumented migration. That brings a lot of problems with it."" With the flow of Venezuelan migrants causing tensions across the region, Peru's government has announced that passport requirements for Venezuelans will begin on 25 August. In February,Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos announced a tightening of border controls, resulting in thousands of Venezuelans rushing to crossing points. Brazil, which neighbours Venezuela, has also expressed concerns.It temporarily closed the border earlier this month. Violence has flared in the border state of Roraima where thousands of Venezuelans live in precarious accommodation. By Katy Watson, BBC South America correspondent Tensions on Brazil's border with Venezuela have been rising steadily in recent months. When I spoke to Roraima governor Suely Campos earlier this year, she said: ""We're on the brink of a social and economic crisis,"" and suggested then that a temporary closure of the border would help address the problem. Venezuelans felt it to. I visited the very same camp that was destroyed by local residents this weekend. There, young mother Nicole told me she'd come to Brazil for a better future for her and her baby daughter, but was questioning whether what she had done was a good idea. Nicole said she was worried about the number of Venezuelans coming over the border and she expected tensions to get worse. She was right - and with Venezuela's economy declining every day, that's not going to change any time soon. In the border town of Pacaraima on Saturday, several migrant encampments were attacked by angry residents. Brazilian police tried to restore control after residents near Pacaraima attacked Venezuelan migrant camps The attacks followed a protest in the town after a local restaurant owner was allegedly robbed and beaten up by Venezuelans. Brazil has sent 60 soldiers to the border town after gangs of men with sticks and stones set fire to tents and other items belonging to the Venezuelans. Crisis-hit Venezuelans leave for Brazil Brazil briefly shuts border to migrants According to reports, hundreds of Venezuelans fled back across the border, setting fires as they left. On the Venezuelan side of the border, meanwhile, there were reports that Brazilian cars had been attacked. Venezuela is suffering from the highest inflation in the world, with severe shortages of basic food items and medicines. Many people there report going hungry as they struggle to feed themselves, and have decided to leave the country in search of better economic conditions. This video can not be played The search for food in Venezuela The country is also in the midst of a political crisis, with Venezuela's opposition blaming the policies of the ruling Socialist Party on the struggling oil-rich economy. Last year scores of protesters were killed in clashes during months of anti-government protests. Despite opposition efforts to remove President NicolÃ¡s Maduro from office, he was re-elected in May's poll. An apparent assassination attempt on Mr Maduro earlier this month has raised tensions in the country even further.

How smallpox claimed its final victim,"Janet Parker worked as a photographer at Birmingham Medical School Warning - this story contains graphic images. In the summer of 1978, the last known case of smallpox was reported, claiming the life of 40-year-old medical photographer Janet Parker. But how did the disease, thought to have been eradicated across the world, come to be in Britain's second city? It was Friday 11 August when Janet Parker first began to feel unwell. Within days, Mrs Parker, who worked in the anatomy department at Birmingham Medical School, had developed unsightly red spots on her back, limbs and face. When the doctor was called, she was told she had chickenpox. But Mrs Parker's mother, Hilda Witcomb, was sceptical. She had nursed her daughter through the virus as a child, and the large blistering pustules now appearing on her body were markedly different. With no signs of improvement, a hospital appointment was arranged and the 40-year-old was admitted to the Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital in Solihull on 20 August. Pupils in England being vaccinated against smallpox in 1962 By now Mrs Parker was so weak she could not stand unaided. ""I do remember thinking she was very poorly, she had a very dramatic rash,"" said Prof Deborah Symmons, the first member of medical staff to see Mrs Parker when she was admitted. ""It was widely thought the last [smallpox] case had occurred."" As Prof Symmons examined Mrs Parker, it was only then the dreaded word ""variola"" - the scientific name for the disease - made it on to her medical notes for the first time, and soon the doctors' worst fears were confirmed. Smallpox,the last natural case of which anywhere in the world had been reported in Somalia in 1977,external, was back - in Birmingham. An electron micrograph of the smallpox virus An ancient disease in existence for thousands of years, smallpox was feared throughout the world. Killing a third of those it infected, in the 20th Century alonean estimated 300 million people died from the disease. Those who were infected but survived were often left badly scarred. A global vaccination programme, led by the World Health Organization (WHO), was carried out to wipe out the disease and by the 1970s cases were rare. And in 1978 the body was just about to declare it eradicated on a worldwide level. The last place anybody expected it to break out was in the UK, which had not seen an identified case of the disease for five years before Mrs Parker. The impact of its return was felt on a global scale. Prof Alasdair Geddes worked as a consultant in infectious disease at East Birmingham Hospital ""It was huge. Smallpox was about to be declared eradicated, people knew that was about to happen,"" said Prof Alasdair Geddes, who was a consultant in infectious disease at East Birmingham Hospital at the time of the outbreak. ""It was a feared disease; it wasn't just a panic in Birmingham, there was panic in the government and the WHO of it just reappearing."" On hearing of the Birmingham case, the WHO wasn't taking any chances. The organisation - and the media - descended on the city. ""Very very quickly, national and then international press appeared"" and it became a ""major worldwide issue"", said Prof Geddes. ""There was of course a heavy presence from the WHO. They were obviously very concerned. ""The incubation period for smallpox is quite long, it's about 12 days, so we had really about a fortnight's anxiety to whether there were going to be any more cases."" Large red spots appeared on Janet Parker's limbs, back and face As the medical teams jumped into action, those closest to Mrs Parker were among the first to be vaccinated and quarantined. Her husband, Joseph, and parents Hilda and Frederick Witcomb, were questioned about their recent movements, for fear the disease could spread further. All those who had come into contact with Mrs Parker were treated similarly - from the man who came to fix the bedpan washer, ambulance staff, the hospital chaplain and the GPs who had seen her out in the community. By 28 August, just two weeks after Mrs Parker had first shown symptoms of the disease, more than 500 people had been vaccinated. But one question on everyone's mind remained: how had she been infected in the first place? Prof Henry Bedson, who headed the smallpox laboratory at the medical school, was left ""distraught"" by the outbreak Prof Henry Bedson headed the smallpox laboratory at Birmingham Medical School - where Mrs Parker worked - one of only a handful commissioned by the WHO to research the disease. Prof Bedson joined Prof Geddes on the night Mrs Parker was diagnosed with the disease and helped examine her test samples. ""I said 'can you see anything Henry?', and he never answered,"" said Prof Geddes. ""So I gently moved his head aside so I could look down the microscope and there were brick-shaped particles that are characteristics of the smallpox virus. ""He was horrified, because there was little doubt that in some way the smallpox virus had escaped from his laboratory and had infected Mrs Parker."" ""I think as soon as he saw it he knew somehow it had come from his lab. He knew what would follow,"" Prof Symmons said. A global vaccination programme had been led by the World Health Organization (WHO) ""Given the circumstances, where else could it have come from? One theory is that it got in the venting, but if that was the way, why only her?"" The spotlight fell on Prof Bedson, says Prof Mark Pallen, author of The Last Days of Smallpox: Tragedy in Birmingham. And the 49-year-old professor, a recognised international expert on the disease, was left ""distraught"" by the outbreak. ""There was a media scrum, people were camped outside Bedson's house. He was working to rid the world of smallpox, he's a hero,"" Prof Pallen says. As the days went on and Mrs Parker remained in isolation, her condition deteriorated. She was left almost blind in both eyes from the sores and doctors believed she had gone into renal failure. A smallpox victim with a heavily pockmarked face and arms As the disease took hold, Mrs Parker developed pneumonia and stopped responding to people verbally. As she lay in her hospital bed, on 5 September her father Frederick, 77, died from an apparent cardiac arrest while in quarantine, thought to have been brought on by the stress of his daughter's illness. However, no post-mortem examination was ever carried out due to the risk the smallpox infection posed. 'Our baby dream feels further away' 'I couldn't shake the image of a murdered child' A national history of immigration panic With the outbreak claiming its first victim, a day later Prof Bedson went out into his shed at his home in the Birmingham suburb of Harborne and killed himself. He left a note, which read: ""I am sorry to have misplaced the trust which so many of my friends and colleagues have placed in me and my work."" Five days later, at 03:50 on 11 September, Mrs Parker died. Janet Parker was put in isolation and later died at the Catherine-de-Barnes Isolation Hospital The disease had claimed its final victim. While Mrs Parker's mother developed ""a very mild attack of smallpox"" according to Prof Geddes, she was discharged free from infection on 22 September. She had missed the funerals of both her husband and daughter. Birmingham was declared free of the disease on 16 October 1978, but the question as to exactly how Mrs Parker contracted smallpox has never been answered fully. In October 1979, three judges at Birmingham Magistrates' Court dismissed the prosecution's evidence that the University of Birmingham had contravened the Health and Safety at Work Act. In the eyes of the law, Prof Bedson had been exonerated. In 1980 a government-commissioned paper, the Shooter Report, found there was ""no doubt"" that Mrs Parker had been infected at the laboratory. The report said the transfer of the virus must have occurred by one of three routes - on an air current, by personal contact or by contact with contaminated equipment or apparatus. However, the theory that it was spread in the air duct ""was not really believed by anyone in the know"", Prof Pallen says. ""Why did she die, why did she get it so badly?"" Prof Symmons still wonders, but she adds: ""If we couldn't find out what happened 40 years ago, it won't suddenly become clear now."" As time moved on ""everything went back to normal"", adds Prof Symmons. To date, there have been no further outbreaks of the disease. An undated illustration depicting English physician Edward Jenner's first smallpox vaccination, performed in 1796 In 1980, two years after Mrs Parker's death, smallpox was officially declared to have been eradicated. The disease had been defeated by medical science. It was the first infectious disease to have been fought on a global scale. The feat was an extraordinary achievement accomplished due to countries collaborating across the world. As Prof Lawrence Young from Warwick Medical School said: ""This was a disease that had desperate effects on individuals, because it marred you for life, it caused disfigurement, so getting over the disease and being able to eradicate it was an enormous achievement."" Edward Jenner introduced the vaccine for the smallpox virus in 1796 Edward Jenner was an English scientist who lived in the 18th Century. He introduced the first vaccine, which was for the smallpox virus. In 1796 Jenner noticed that milkmaids who had caught the cowpox virus did not normally then catch smallpox. Cowpox was very similar to smallpox but less contagious. He collected pus from the cowpox blisters on a milkmaid's hands and purposely infected a small boy. The boy was taken ill for a short while, but was then resistant to any subsequent infections of the cowpox and smallpox viruses. He tested this by infecting the boy with smallpox and no illness occurred. According to the World Health Organization,Jenner's was the first successful vaccine to be developed,external.

Should rock stacking be banned?,"Making a pretty pile of rocks on a beach seems like a nice way to spend a sunny afternoon. But there is some backlash against the art of stone stacking. Humans have been making their mark through rock cairns and monuments for centuries. Now critics say building new ones spoils pristine environments and could be a threat to wildlife. Supporters say the health benefits far outweigh any damage. John Hourston, founder of the Blue Planet Society, believes it's a worrying trend. ""People are doing it with no education of the environment so they don't know what site they're in - whether the site has any wildlife significance or historic significance,"" he says.

""Add to that the historic significance of cairns in Scotland, used for landmarks and to show safe ways. You're now confusing that with personal statements that really mean nothing.""

Skaill beach near Skara Brae in Orkney has dozens of rock stacks James Craig Page is a stone-stacking artist and also organises the European stone-stacking championships in Dunbar. The event attracts competitors from across the UK. For James, the benefits to mental health far outweigh any harm that is being done to the environment. ""We've done workshops with schools and have found that children who have trouble focusing in the classroom absolutely take to the stone balancing,"" he says. James Craig Page believes in the meditative qualities of balancing stones ""A lot of parents and teachers alike have said they are absolutely flabbergasted at these children spending more than 30 seconds focused on anything."" John Hourston thinks the key message is that people should be aware of the impact they're having. ""The first rule of the environment is leave no trace,"" he said.

Children of smokers 'risk adult disease'A study shows higher risk of fatal lung disease in adults exposed to cigarette smoke in childhood.Health,"Non-smoking adults have a higher risk of dying from serious lung disease if they grew up with parents who smoked, according to US research. The researchers said childhood passive smoking was ""likely to add seven deaths to every 100,000 non-smoking adults dying annually"". The study of 70,900 non-smoking men and women was led by the American Cancer Society. Experts said the best way to protect children was to quit smoking. If participants lived with a smoker during adulthood, there were other health implications, the study found. Smoke exposure of 10 or more hours every week increased their risk of death from ischemic heart disease by 27%, stroke by 23% and chronic obstructive lung disease by 42% compared to those who lived with non-smokers. The study was published in theAmerican Journal of Preventive Medicine,external. Participants were questioned about their exposure to smoking throughout their lives, and then their health was tracked over the next 22 years. Hazel Cheeseman, of campaign group Action on Smoking and Health, said: ""This latest study adds to the compelling case to take smoke outside to protect children from harm. ""The best way to do this is for parents to quit."" She referred to data on NHS Stop Smoking Services in England urging improved funding in this area. No safe level of smoking, study finds Vaping â good, bad or not clear- - BBC News Pets 'at risk from passive smoking' Dr Nick Hopkinson, medical adviser to the British Lung Foundation, agreed, saying: ""Passive smoking has a lasting impact well beyond childhood. ""Unfortunately, stop smoking services in the UK are being cut. We need to make sure that everyone, especially parents of young children and pregnant women who smoke, get the help they need to quit."" Children whose parents smoke are known to be at risk of asthma and poor lung development. This study shows that the effects of childhood smoke exposure persist into adulthood, resulting in chronic obstructive lung disease. While the researchers focused on mortality risks, they emphasised that childhood second-hand smoking may also increase chronic illness and healthcare dependency in later life. Dr Ryan Diver, one of the report's authors, said: ""This is the first study to identify an association between childhood exposure to second-hand smoke and death from chronic obstructive lung disease in middle age and beyond. ""Our findings provide further evidence for reducing second-hand smoke exposure throughout life,"" he added.
