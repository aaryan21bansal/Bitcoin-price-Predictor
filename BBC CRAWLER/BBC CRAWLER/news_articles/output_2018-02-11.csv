Plane crashes after Moscow take-off,"This video can not be played Wreckage was strewn across a wide area A Russian airliner has crashed after leaving Moscow's Domodedovo airport, killing all 65 passengers and six crew on board. The Saratov Airlines jet vanished minutes after take-off and crashed near the village of Argunovo, about 80km (50 miles) south-east of Moscow. The cause of crash is unclear. Investigators and emergency crews are working at the snow-covered site. The Antonov An-148 was en route to the city of Orsk in the Ural mountains. Pieces of wreckage and bodies were found spread over a large area. One of the flight recorders has been recovered, officials say. The Flightradar24 website shows the flight path President Vladimir Putin has expressed his condolences to the victims' families and announced an inquiry into the cause of the crash. This video can not be played BBC Russian's Sergei Goryashko: ""It's really very difficult... The road is blocked."" This is the first commercial passenger jet crash for more than a year -2017 was the safest year on record for air travel. The plane took off at 14:27 (11:27 GMT) on Sunday. Contact was lost four minutes later. Flight-tracking site Flightradar24 said it then descended at the rate of 1,000m (3,300ft) per minute. Eyewitnesses told Russian media that the jet was on fire as it plummeted. Investigators said the causes they were considering included weather conditions, human error and technical failure - but they did not mention the possibility of terrorism. The official list of passengers and crew has been published,external(in Russian) by the emergencies ministry. A child and two teenagers were among the passengers,external, all but three of whom were from the Orenburg region where Orsk is located, city mayor Andrei Odintsov told Tass news agency.

Three Britons die in Grand Canyon crash,"Becky Dobson and her boyfriend Stuart Hill died in the crash A couple are among three British tourists killed in a helicopter crash in the Grand Canyon. Becky Dobson, 27, Stuart Hill, 30, and his brother Jason Hill, 32, died in Saturday's crash, Hualapai Police said. Three other Britons and the pilot were injured on the tour of the canyon but they were not rescued until some eight hours later on Sunday morning. Ms Dobson's father, Peter Dobson, told the Press Association his daughter was ""full of life"" and ""always happy"". The group were away celebrating Stuart's 30th birthday, Mr Dobson said. He added the couple were ""really happy together"" and ""just enjoyed being with each other"". ""The whole thing is just terrible."" Friends pay tribute to victims Britons Ellie Milward, 29, Jonathan Udall, 32, and Jennifer Barham, 39, were injured in the crash, along with pilot Scott Booth, 42, police said. Jonathan Udall and his wife Ellie Milward, both on left, were injured in the crash Witnesses told local reporters they had seen survivors running away from the crash site and shouting. It is not clear what caused the crash and witnesses say rescue efforts have been hampered by high winds. The helicopter crashed on Saturday evening and survivors were not rescued until the early hours of Sunday morning. The youngest of the victims, Ms Dobson, worked as a veterinary receptionist for Vets 4 Pets in Worthing, West Sussex. In her profile on the practice's website, she described her love for animals, as well as her dream of becoming a veterinary nurse. ""I also love to travel the world and explore what is out there beyond good old Worthing,"" she said. The practice paid tribute to Ms Dobson, saying her colleagues were ""devastated"" by her loss. Jason Hill worked as a corporate lawyer for Shoosmiths LLP in its Milton Keynes office. The firm's chief executive, Claire Rowe, said he was well respected and loved by all those who worked with him. ""He was hardworking, full of energy and enjoyable to work with, and we are greatly saddened by the news of his death and that of his brother Stuart,"" she added. Gabby Hart, a local news reporter for the station KSNV, said it had taken more than eight hours for the survivors to be removed from the site because of the terrain and high winds. She told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""We are told by witnesses and also by rescuers that people were trying to help once they saw this accident happen, they couldn't get down to the helicopter quick enough. ""They [the survivors] had to receive care there on site until emergency crews were able to remove them from the scene."" The chief of the local Hualapai Police, Francis Bradley, called the incident ""very tragic"" and described the terrain as ""extremely rugged"". He added rescue efforts had been hampered by severe weather conditions and gusts of up to 50mph. The helicopter came down, during a tour of the canyon, on Saturday evening In a statement, Brenda Halvorson, the chief executive of the helicopter company involved - Papillon Airways - said the company extended its heartfelt sympathy to the families of the dead and injured. On its website, Papillon calls itself ""the world's largest aerial sightseeing company"" and says it flies more than 600,000 people a year. The Grand Canyon, which is more than 1.6km (one mile) deep, is one of the most visited tourist attractions in the US. A UK Foreign Office spokesperson said: ""We are providing support to the families of six British visitors involved in a helicopter accident at the Grand Canyon on 10 February, and we are in close contact with the US emergency services.""

Suu Kyi 'doesn't grasp Rohingya horror',"This video can not be played Boris Johnson urges leadership from Aung San Suu Kyi over Rohingya crisis UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says he doubts Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi ""understands the full horror"" of the Rohingya refugee crisis. ""I don't think she's been up in a helicopter to see what we have seen,"" Mr Johnson told the BBC after talks in the capital Nay Pyi Daw. He urged Ms Suu Kyi to work with UN agencies to help the refugees return. Violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state has caused about 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh since last August. Asked by the BBC's Reeta Chakrabarti if he believed the authorities in Myanmar - also known as Burma - were in a state of denial about the crisis, Mr Johnson replied: ""I have to say that, talking to politicians in the capital, listening to Daw Suu [Aung San Suu Kyi] I don't think it has come through to her the full extent of the horror that has happened, the sheer devastation."" He added: ""I have seen nothing like it in my lifetime. Hundreds of villages torched. It is absolutely devastating and I think that what is needed now is some leadership, working with the UN agencies to get these people back home."" Venezuelans rush to Colombian border Elon Musk: The man who put his car in space Are these the worst examples of business jargon? On Saturday, Mr Johnson met members of the Bangladeshi government and visited refugee camps on the border. He said he had told Ms Suu Kyi of ""the terrible conditions"" of the refugees ""and my deep concern about their future"". ""I underlined the importance of the Burmese authorities carrying out a full and independent investigation into the violence in Rakhine, and to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson meets Aung San Suu Kyi for Rohingya talks Mr Johnson said he had also stressed the need to make Rakhine state ""a safe place for the Rohingya refugees to return to, free from fear, and in the knowledge that their basic rights will be respected"". Mr Johnson said the UK would continue to use its global influence ""to find a way to provide a better future for the Rohingya community"". Myanmar's foreign ministry said the pair had ""discussed in an open and friendly manner the latest developments in Rakhine State, including planning for the reception of returnees who fled"".

The United Nations has described the exodus of Rohingya people from Rakhine state, and the military offensive that sparked it, as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". Bangladesh has agreed a timeframe with Myanmar for repatriating Rohingya people. But aid agencies have expressed concern over the projected figures for the transfer - Myanmar has agreed to accept 1,500 Rohingya each week; Bangladesh says it aims to return everyone within two years. And the refugees are worried about the conditions and their rights upon their return. Britain is one of the biggest direct donors of aid for the humanitarian effort to help the refugees.

"MPs could block May's Brexit - SoubryTory rebel joins forces with Labour's Chuka Umunna to warn Theresa May against seeking a ""hard Brexit"".9h9 hours agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Anna Soubry and Chuka Umunna say MPs could block a hard Brexit Pro-European Conservative MPs could join forces with Labour to block the kind of Brexit Theresa May wants, a Tory rebel has warned the PM. Anna Soubry claimed there would be a Commons majority against leaving the single market and customs union. Labour's Chuka Umunna, appearing alongside Ms Soubry on the Andrew Marr show, agreed with her comments. MPs have been promised a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of Brexit before it happens in March next year. PM and ministers to set out 'road to Brexit' Brexit: All you need to know ""If this government doesn't get this right,"" said Ms Soubry, ""the majority of members of parliament, putting their constituents first, will find themselves unable to vote for a withdrawal agreement."" Theresa May is set to deliver a major speech within the next three weeks outlining the future relationship Britain wants to have with the EU. The prime minister has ruled out continued membership of the single market and customs union. But Ms Soubry, one of 11 pro-European Conservative MPs who defeated the government in December on the right to get a vote on any final Brexit deal, said the PM's stance was a ""huge mistake"". ""Not only is it bad for our economy but it also fundamentally undermines the [Northern Ireland] peace process that was achieved and this is really important,"" she told Andrew Marr. She said she wanted the UK to remain in the European Free Trade Area, like Norway, which would allow access to the single market without being a member of the EU. Asked by Andrew Marr if they believed they had a majority in the House of Commons to defeat ""the kind of Brexit the prime minister wants"", Ms Soubry said: ""If she's not careful, yes."" Mr Umunna said: ""There is no majority in the House of Commons for us simply to jump off a cliff."" When Andrew Marr suggested to Ms Soubry that she was politically closer to Mr Umunna than she was to leading Brexiteer and Conservative colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, she said: ""I'm not denying that."" Asked if she thought Brexit would definitely happen, Ms Soubry said: ""I genuinely don't know what is going to happen."" Responding to whether it might be stopped, she said: ""Well I'll tell you who might stop it, and that's the people of this country. ""We won't stop it. It is the people. We gave the people a referendum to start this process."" Mr Umunna said he also backed another referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal - something his party leader Jeremy Corbyn has appeared to rule out. He claimed the Labour leader - who last monthrejected calls to attend a cross-party summit,externalon avoiding a ""hard Brexit"" - was ""open minded"" about staying in the single market. ""I cannot conceive of circumstances where Labour MPs are marshalled to go through the lobby and vote against us staying in the customs union and the single market, with the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove,"" said Mr Umunna. Both MPs insisted they were acting in the ""national interest,"" which they said transcended party politics. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said another Brexit referendum would cause divisions and a ""better route"" would be to have a general election. ""Better we have a general election. On the issue, and all the other issues, because you then have a wider debate as well,"" he told told ITV's Peston On Sunday. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who is campaigning for another referendum, said: ""It is good to see cross-party cooperation between Tory and Labour rebels."" He said he was ""optimistic that the rebellions in both Tory and Labour parties will spread in coming weeks"", and that his party was working with them in the House of Lords.

'Why black people like me are refusing to be sub-plots',"The much-anticipated film version of Black Panther, one of the only black Marvel superheroes, is about to be released. It's a moment of special significance for black comic fans, who have only rarely seen a hero on the page who looks like them, and almost never on screen. Here, British graphic illustrator Jacob V Joyce explains the importance of the groundbreaking character. Like many children, my imagination came alive through the adventures of cartoon heroes and villains. I learned to read by closely examining the illustrated escapades of Spider-Man, Batman and any other comic book stories I could get my hands on. Yet, as a black child, these characters looked nothing like me. So I took matters into my own hands. At the age of eight I began drawing black and brown versions of these heroes. By creating my own characters and my own mini-comics, I fashioned a world that I could imagine myself existing in. Jacob's early cartoons For my 11th birthday I begged my mum for a laminator. You might think this was a curious gift for a child, but I was overjoyed. I started to coat the army of small cut-out paper characters I had drawn in protective plastic, and turned them into two-dimensional action figures. I wanted to protect these small fantastical representations of myself, which seemed to be missing from the world around me. Black Panther, and the handful of other comic book characters of African and Caribbean descent, did not appear on my radar until I was a teenager. By then, my desire for black narratives had led me to look beyond the mainstream comics and their Hollywood depictions. The character is a sight to behold. Clad in distinctive bullet-proof black armour, usually capeless but with a full facemask, Black Panther - or T'Challa - is the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. A true warrior, he's a master tactician with genius intellect, rigorous martial arts skills and superhuman strength. You can imagine, as a teenage comic book fan unable to find any black figures that were more than side-kicks, the thrill I felt when I first came across him. But if T'Challa was something to be excited by, his kingdom was a wonder beyond my wildest dreams. Wakanda, an advanced technological nation, is untouched by colonialism. In some versions, the country is hidden behind a giant wall, undetected by maps. With flying cars and futuristic skyscrapers, its technological sophistication makes it impenetrable. The country's wealth comes from mining a metal called Vibranium - used to make Captain America's shield. For me, this fictitious land represented a Pan-African dream, free from the painful history of slavery. It is the story of an African nation that has evaded colonial plunder and managed to focus all of its resources on its own development and technological advancement. This rewriting or reclamation of black history is an extension of Afrofuturism - a cultural philosophy pioneered by  jazz legend Sun Ra and countless artists and musicians since. To avoid detection, Wakanda appears an impoverished nation to the outside world Fast-forward 20 years to today, and the mainstream world of comic book superheroes and their blockbuster movie adaptations has not changed much. Aside from a handful of characters, like my personal favourite, Storm from X-Men, it's rare to see black superheroes take centre-stage on screen - they usually act as devices to propel the story of the white protagonist further, with little-to-no speaking lines. What's even worse is watching black superheroes being introduced for a brief moment only to be the first to die. I know many Marvel fans are still mad about Darwin, an African-American mutant whose body can adapt to survive anything, being killed off within minutes of his introduction in the 2011 movie X-Men First Class. Black Panther made an appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016) It may seem petty to grieve over fictional characters, but when you have been waiting for two decades to see black superheroes in action, it can be hard to remain patient. Black Panther offers us an opportunity to imagine a different kind of hero. The Black Panther was created in July 1966, two months before the founding of the Black Panther Party. The X-Men mutant Storm is the love interest to Black Panther in the Marvel Comics. However, this angle will not be explored in the 2018 film because image rights of each character is held by different studios. Women in Wakanda have powerful positions in the Kingdom. The Dora Milaje are the all-female personal bodyguards of the Black Panther. Two of these warriors, in later editions of the comic, were applauded by the LGBTQI community for being in an openly lesbian relationship. A new Black Panther series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016 and continues to be published with Coates as the head writer. For black comic book geeks like myself, and for thousands of black and brown action movie fans across the world, the imminent release of the Black Panther movie represents a shift in focus that has been a long time coming. The film, which stars Chadwick Boseman and Lupita Nyong'o, is still to hit theatres but advanced ticket sales are outpacing every other superhero film to date. Here in the UK every black person I know is either excited about or at the very least aware that the Black Panther is coming. Memes are circulating about the outfits people are planning to wear to the cinema and regardless of whether it fulfils our expectations, it is an important historical moment for us. The original 1966 Fantastic Four cover in which Black Panther makes his debut Speaking to the website Mother Jones, the film's co-writer Joe Robert Cole explained the importance of bringing the story to the screen: ""Black Panther is a historic opportunity to be a part of something important and special, particularly at a time when African-Americans are affirming their identities while dealing with vilification and dehumanisation. ""The image of a black hero on this scale is just really exciting,"" he adds. Joe Sinnott (right) and his son Mark Ironically, Black Panther started life as a subplot in the Fantastic Four series - and none of its creators were black. Writer-editor Stan Lee and writer-artist Jack Kirby introduced the character in April 1966. Joe Sinnott was an inker on Fantastic Four at the time - he knew he was working on something special when bringing Wakanda to life. ""What a beautiful nation - the landscape, creatures, jungle, the people. One of the world's most technically advanced nations. It had it all,"" he says. The Dora Milaje, the female warriors of Wakanda, ""move as one"" when they fight Despite rumours to the contrary, Black Panther wasn't inspired by, or named after, the Black Panther movement that came in 1966. The comic predated the political group. There was even a brief period when Marvel changed the character's name to Black Leopard, but once it became evident that fans were not associating the character with the political movement, they reverted to the original name. Sinnott wasn't really aware of the popularity of the Black Panther in 1966. ""At that time there weren't comic conventions to attend so I personally didn't hear from the fans as you would today."" But, he adds, ""I would think that the letters to the editor must have been overwhelmingly supportive."" The issue sold well and by the 1970s Black Panther was a protagonist in his own comic book. The film's costume designer Ruth E Carter cites African tribes' clothing as an influence A new Black Panther series written by the award-winning journalist Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016. Coates portrays him as a conflicted king attempting to balance the traditions of his culture with his people's demands for democracy. I've asked myself whether the film's release truly signals a new frontier for black superheroes in cinema. For years Hollywood has worked of the assumption that black-led films wouldn't translate to ticket sales. This was disproved when Jordan Peele's 2017 spine-chilling horror movie Get Out grossed over Â£180 million ($255 million) globally. The myth that films with black leads only appeal to niche markets no longer holds true. On Marvel's Netflix channel, a black superhero called Luke Cage has been given a series of his own. Rivals DC Comics have also just released a Netflix series called Black Lightning, with an almost all black cast. These may be small steps, and a long time coming, but things are moving in the right direction. I'd like to think that the visibility of this story will inspire a new generation of activists, artists and communities to keep building the worlds they want to see. And maybe black children won't need to ask their mothers for laminators in order to create a world where they can be heroes.

Six Nations: Scotland beat France,"2018 Six Nations Scotland (14) 32 Tries:Maitland, JonesCons:Laidlaw 2Pens:Laidlaw 6 France (20) 26 Tries:Thomas 2Cons:Machenaud 2Pens:Machenaud 2, Serin 2 Scotland put defeat by Wales behind them to overcome France at Murrayfield and revive their Six Nations campaign. The first of two Teddy Thomas tries put France into an early 10-0 lead before Sean Maitland crossed for Scotland. Thomas gathered a lucky bounce to score again but the hosts replied via Huw Jones' try, only for Maxime Machenaud's second penalty to put France 20-14 up. Greig Laidlaw kicked six penalties, to two from Baptiste Serin, to steer the Scots home in a tense second half. Scotland will next face reigning champions England at Murrayfield on Saturday, 24 February (16:45 KO), while France host Italy on Friday, 23 February (20:00 KO). The fashion in which Scotland were swatted away by Wales on the opening day caused a hasty reassessment in some quarters of what Gregor Townsend's men could realistically achieve in this championship, having been tipped by some as potential dark horses for the title. France were nursing wounds of their own, having been denied victory against Ireland in Paris by a dramatic Johnny Sexton drop-goal in the last play of the game. Thomas' stunning try looked to have given France victory in that match before Sexton's late heroics, and with less than three minutes on the clock in Edinburgh, the winger ripped the Scotland defence to shreds. Collecting a pass five metres inside the Scottish half wide on the right, Thomas brushed off a weak Finn Russell tackle, skipped around Peter Horne and sprinted away from Stuart Hogg to coast over. Machenaud's conversion and subsequent penalty saw the nervous Murrayfield crowd looking at a scoreboard showing their team 10-0 down after 10 minutes. The Scotland response was, however, not long in coming. A clever kick from Hogg forced an attacking line-out deep in French territory and after controlled phase play - something they struggled badly with last weekend - the Scots picked their moment to go wide, Russell timing the scoring pass to Maitland to perfection. Scotland's attacking style drew many plaudits in the autumn, and while Wales showed last weekend that they do not have a monopoly on ambitious rugby, France seemed intent on ramming it down their throats. After pulling the hosts from side to side, the ball was shipped to Thomas. The Racing 92 flier chipped ahead and as a cruel bounce took the ball away from the covering Laidlaw, Thomas gathered to re-establish the 10-point lead. Teddy Thomas' first-half brace took his try tally to eight in 10 Tests The next score was going to be crucial to Scottish confidence - on the field and in the stands - and the stadium erupted when Jones cut a gorgeous short line to take Laidlaw's pass, slice through the France defence and go in under the posts. Another Machenaud penalty gave the French a 20-14 half-time lead, but it was the Scots that began the second period on the front foot. Impressive recalled lock Grant Gilchrist blasted through a couple of tackles to get the French retreating and when they infringed on the floor, Laidlaw kicked Scotland back within three. Serin, on for Machenaud at scrum-half, and Laidlaw traded penalties as the initiative swung one way and then another, with referee John Lacey's whistle checking the momentum of both sides. Serin struck again from the tee, but Laidlaw hit back once more, and going into the final quarter it seemed the team who could conjure a try would go on and win the game. It was not to be though, with Townsend's side instead being content instead to accept the penalty points that the greater authority in their play presented. Laidlaw popped over his fourth penalty to level things up at 26-26 before Townsend sprung a surprise by removing captain John Barclay and Russell - guilty of a couple of basic errors - to make way for David Denton and Ali Price, with Laidlaw moving to fly-half. The home side were in the ascendency, their replacements bringing the intended energy to their play, and with 10 minutes remaining Laidlaw's fifth penalty gave them the lead for the first time. Another, with four minutes left, gave the former captain a 22-point haul from a flawless eight shots at goal, and Murrayfield was soon erupting in relief and celebration. This video can not be played Six Nations: Gregor Townsend praises Scotland's 'direct' play after France win Scotland boss Gregor Townsend:""I'm happier than last week, that's for sure! The effort it takes to win a Test match is huge, and when you have to do it being behind for most of the game, that shows the character of the squad and the togetherness. We were a bit more direct, and we got our rewards. ""It was mentioned during the week [moving Laidlaw to fly-half], and we ran a couple of plays this morning. It was seeing how Greig was, and it looked like he could last the 80, but Ali Price brings so much from the bench [at scrum-half]. ""He really upped the pace and Greig's kicking was pretty good, so bringing Ali onto the ball was pretty positive to the team."" Injured Wales flanker Sam Warburton on BBC One:""With Wales we have always said, coming to Murrayfield, we cannot give away penalties in our half if Greig Laidlaw is playing - more often than not he is going to convert them. ""Scotland were quite direct, they made France tackle and that makes teams tired. You crash at the 60-minute mark and I think the first half took its toll on the French. Penalties win matches, Greig kicked six in a row, and every time they went forward, France gave one away."" Former Scotland scrum-half Andy Nicol on BBC One:""Six Nations rugby is about winning. You do not get points for style, for scoring great tries and playing with flair. It is about winning rugby games and Scotland had to do that today."" Former France flanker Olivier Magne on BBC One:""I am very disappointed. I was very excited by the first half and thought France could maintain the speed and tempo like that during the second half.  But our Top 14 doesn't prepare us to play like that for 80 minutes - we can play 40 minutes at a good level but the second half was too difficult for us.""

'Why black people like me are refusing to be sub-plots'A comic book fan explains why Black Panther is such a groundbreaking character.,"The much-anticipated film version of Black Panther, one of the only black Marvel superheroes, is about to be released. It's a moment of special significance for black comic fans, who have only rarely seen a hero on the page who looks like them, and almost never on screen. Here, British graphic illustrator Jacob V Joyce explains the importance of the groundbreaking character. Like many children, my imagination came alive through the adventures of cartoon heroes and villains. I learned to read by closely examining the illustrated escapades of Spider-Man, Batman and any other comic book stories I could get my hands on. Yet, as a black child, these characters looked nothing like me. So I took matters into my own hands. At the age of eight I began drawing black and brown versions of these heroes. By creating my own characters and my own mini-comics, I fashioned a world that I could imagine myself existing in. Jacob's early cartoons For my 11th birthday I begged my mum for a laminator. You might think this was a curious gift for a child, but I was overjoyed. I started to coat the army of small cut-out paper characters I had drawn in protective plastic, and turned them into two-dimensional action figures. I wanted to protect these small fantastical representations of myself, which seemed to be missing from the world around me. Black Panther, and the handful of other comic book characters of African and Caribbean descent, did not appear on my radar until I was a teenager. By then, my desire for black narratives had led me to look beyond the mainstream comics and their Hollywood depictions. The character is a sight to behold. Clad in distinctive bullet-proof black armour, usually capeless but with a full facemask, Black Panther - or T'Challa - is the king and protector of the fictional African nation of Wakanda. A true warrior, he's a master tactician with genius intellect, rigorous martial arts skills and superhuman strength. You can imagine, as a teenage comic book fan unable to find any black figures that were more than side-kicks, the thrill I felt when I first came across him. But if T'Challa was something to be excited by, his kingdom was a wonder beyond my wildest dreams. Wakanda, an advanced technological nation, is untouched by colonialism. In some versions, the country is hidden behind a giant wall, undetected by maps. With flying cars and futuristic skyscrapers, its technological sophistication makes it impenetrable. The country's wealth comes from mining a metal called Vibranium - used to make Captain America's shield. For me, this fictitious land represented a Pan-African dream, free from the painful history of slavery. It is the story of an African nation that has evaded colonial plunder and managed to focus all of its resources on its own development and technological advancement. This rewriting or reclamation of black history is an extension of Afrofuturism - a cultural philosophy pioneered by  jazz legend Sun Ra and countless artists and musicians since. To avoid detection, Wakanda appears an impoverished nation to the outside world Fast-forward 20 years to today, and the mainstream world of comic book superheroes and their blockbuster movie adaptations has not changed much. Aside from a handful of characters, like my personal favourite, Storm from X-Men, it's rare to see black superheroes take centre-stage on screen - they usually act as devices to propel the story of the white protagonist further, with little-to-no speaking lines. What's even worse is watching black superheroes being introduced for a brief moment only to be the first to die. I know many Marvel fans are still mad about Darwin, an African-American mutant whose body can adapt to survive anything, being killed off within minutes of his introduction in the 2011 movie X-Men First Class. Black Panther made an appearance in Captain America: Civil War (2016) It may seem petty to grieve over fictional characters, but when you have been waiting for two decades to see black superheroes in action, it can be hard to remain patient. Black Panther offers us an opportunity to imagine a different kind of hero. The Black Panther was created in July 1966, two months before the founding of the Black Panther Party. The X-Men mutant Storm is the love interest to Black Panther in the Marvel Comics. However, this angle will not be explored in the 2018 film because image rights of each character is held by different studios. Women in Wakanda have powerful positions in the Kingdom. The Dora Milaje are the all-female personal bodyguards of the Black Panther. Two of these warriors, in later editions of the comic, were applauded by the LGBTQI community for being in an openly lesbian relationship. A new Black Panther series written by Ta-Nehisi Coates and drawn by Brian Stelfreeze was launched in 2016 and continues to be published with Coates as the head writer. For black comic book geeks like myself, and for thousands of black and brown action movie fans across the world, the imminent release of the Black Panther movie represents a shift in focus that has been a long time coming. The film, which stars Chadwick Boseman and Lupita Nyong'o, is still to hit theatres but advanced ticket sales are outpacing every other superhero film to date. Here in the UK every black person I know is either excited about or at the very least aware that the Black Panther is coming. Memes are circulating about the outfits people are planning to wear to the cinema and regardless of whether it fulfils our expectations, it is an important historical moment for us. The original 1966 Fantastic Four cover in which Black Panther makes his debut Speaking to the website Mother Jones, the film's co-writer Joe Robert Cole explained the importance of bringing the story to the screen: ""Black Panther is a historic opportunity to be a part of something important and special, particularly at a time when African-Americans are affirming their identities while dealing with vilification and dehumanisation.

Digital cash hack hits government websitesA security expert says thousands of sites used visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency.1m2 minutes agoTechnology,"The Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) took down its website after a warning that hackers were taking control of visitors' computers to mine cryptocurrency. Security researcher Scott Helme said more than 4,000 websites, including many government ones, were affected. He said the affected code had now been disabled and visitors were no longer at risk. The ICO said: ""We are aware of the issue and are working to resolve it."" Mr Helme said he was alerted by a friend who had received a malware warning when he visited the ICO website. He traced the problem to a website plug-in called Browsealoud, used to help blind and partially sighted people access the web. Texthelp, the company which makes the plug-in, confirmed that the product was affected for four hours by malicious code designed to generate cryptocurrency. The cryptocurrency involved was Monero - a rival to Bitcoin that is designed to make transactions in it ""untraceable"" back to the senders and recipients involved. The plug-in had been tampered with to add a program, Coinhive, which ""mines"" for Monero by running processor-intensive calculations on visitors' computers. Once the plug-in was infected, it affected thousands of other websites in addition to the ICO's, which used it. Generating crypto-currencies involves lots of computer hardware By Rory Cellan-Jones, BBC technology correspondent The surge in value of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies hasn't escaped the attention of hackers looking to make a quick buck. Mining, the process where new digital coins are created by solving complex mathematical problems, uses increasing amounts of computer processing power and that means big electricity bills. All the better then if you can get other people's computers to do the job. The hackers do this by inserting software into websites which then means that, unbeknown to them, visitors' computers are put to work mining cryptocurrencies. It seems that the Information Commissioner's site along with others run by the government were infected by crypto-mining code injected into some accessibility software they all use. This kind of attack is becoming increasingly common and while it appears not to cause data loss or damage to systems, it does mean computers can run much more slowly. What is Bitcoin? Bitcoin boom prompts mining malware growth Starbucks wi-fi made computers mine cash Mr Helme said: ""It's a very lucrative proposal. They infect one website and it infects close to 5,000. ""This was a very serious breach. They could have extracted personal data, stolen information or installed malware. It was only limited by the hackers' imaginations."" As well as the ICO website, the hacked script was found running on the site of the Student Loans Company, Barnsley Hospital and other websites in the UK and worldwide. Martin McKay, chief technical officer of TextHelp, said: ""In light of other recent cyber-attacks all over the world, we have been preparing for such an incident for the last year and our data security action plan was actioned straight away."" The company is commissioning a security review by an independent consultancy following the attack, he said. Because the malware only runs while someone is actively visiting an infected site, there is no further risk to users' computers, Mr Helme added. A National Cyber Security Centre spokesman said: ""NCSC technical experts are examining data involving incidents of malware being used to illegally mine cryptocurrency. ""The affected service has been taken offline, largely mitigating the issue. Government websites continue to operate securely. ""At this stage there is nothing to suggest that members of the public are at risk.""

Energy firms could get welfare dataDetails of customers on some benefits could be handed to energy firms so they can give them special rates.10h10 hours agoBusiness,"People on state benefits could have their names passed to energy firms so they can give them special rates. The plan, under consideration by the government, is intended as a new approach to help people who are struggling to pay their energy bills. It would allow power companies to transfer customers to a special tariff set by the regulator, Ofgem. Energy Secretary Greg Clark said the proposal would help vulnerable consumers. 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Drought-hit Cape Town rejoices at rain Anime fans 'sobbing' at Olympic ice skating The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said data-sharing would take place under strictly controlled conditions and only with customers' consent. It added that energy firms would not be given specific details of any benefits, only whether the customers were eligible for the special tariff. BEIS said it would open consultation on the proposals on Monday, as it would require a change in the law to allow the necessary data-sharing. The tariff in question is known as the safeguard tariff cap and was introduced in April last year. It already covers five million people, mainly those on pre-payment meters. Under the plans, customers receiving specific state benefits would be identified and automatically moved to the safeguard tariff. Mr Clark said: ""The effects of energy price rises are often felt most by those on the lowest incomes, as they are usually on the highest standard variable tariffs. ""These people are at risk of being plunged further into fuel poverty if they are left at the mercy of a broken energy market.

Johnson presses Suu Kyi on Rohingya plight,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson urges leadership from Aung San Suu Kyi over Rohingya crisis UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says he doubts Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi ""understands the full horror"" of the Rohingya refugee crisis. ""I don't think she's been up in a helicopter to see what we have seen,"" Mr Johnson told the BBC after talks in the capital Nay Pyi Daw. He urged Ms Suu Kyi to work with UN agencies to help the refugees return. Violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state has caused about 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh since last August. Asked by the BBC's Reeta Chakrabarti if he believed the authorities in Myanmar - also known as Burma - were in a state of denial about the crisis, Mr Johnson replied: ""I have to say that, talking to politicians in the capital, listening to Daw Suu [Aung San Suu Kyi] I don't think it has come through to her the full extent of the horror that has happened, the sheer devastation."" He added: ""I have seen nothing like it in my lifetime. Hundreds of villages torched. It is absolutely devastating and I think that what is needed now is some leadership, working with the UN agencies to get these people back home."" Venezuelans rush to Colombian border Elon Musk: The man who put his car in space Are these the worst examples of business jargon? On Saturday, Mr Johnson met members of the Bangladeshi government and visited refugee camps on the border. He said he had told Ms Suu Kyi of ""the terrible conditions"" of the refugees ""and my deep concern about their future"". ""I underlined the importance of the Burmese authorities carrying out a full and independent investigation into the violence in Rakhine, and to hold to account those responsible for human rights violations."" This video can not be played Boris Johnson meets Aung San Suu Kyi for Rohingya talks Mr Johnson said he had also stressed the need to make Rakhine state ""a safe place for the Rohingya refugees to return to, free from fear, and in the knowledge that their basic rights will be respected"". Mr Johnson said the UK would continue to use its global influence ""to find a way to provide a better future for the Rohingya community"". Myanmar's foreign ministry said the pair had ""discussed in an open and friendly manner the latest developments in Rakhine State, including planning for the reception of returnees who fled"". This video can not be played Myanmar must find a safe and dignified way for Rohingya Muslims to return, Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson has said. Rohingya need safe way back - Johnson Repatriation timeframe agreed Seeing through the official story in Myanmar What you need to know about the crisis After visiting the Cox's Bazar camp in Bangladesh, home to more than 500,000 refugees, Mr Johnson said the ""horrendous living conditions"" had strengthened his commitment to finding a solution. Boris Johnson visited Cox's Bazar refugee camp as part of the first official trip to Bangladesh by a foreign secretary in a decade After meeting Bangladeshi Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina and Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmud Ali, he said: ""I was really struck by how Bangladesh and the UK really share a common analysis of what needs to be done."" The United Nations has described the exodus of Rohingya people from Rakhine state, and the military offensive that sparked it, as a ""textbook example of ethnic cleansing"". Bangladesh has agreed a timeframe with Myanmar for repatriating Rohingya people. But aid agencies have expressed concern over the projected figures for the transfer - Myanmar has agreed to accept 1,500 Rohingya each week; Bangladesh says it aims to return everyone within two years. And the refugees are worried about the conditions and their rights upon their return. Britain is one of the biggest direct donors of aid for the humanitarian effort to help the refugees. The foreign secretary's trip to Bangladesh is the first such official visit in a decade. He will go on to Bangkok, Thailand, for talks with Prime Minister Prayut Chan-o-cha.

'Hundreds of deaths' may be linked to creams,"This video can not be played Test shows fire danger of paraffin-based creams Hundreds of fire deaths may be linked to the use of skin creams containing paraffin, a senior firefighter warns. If people use the creams regularly but do not often change clothes or bedding, paraffin residue can soak into the fabric and act as an accelerant when it comes into contact with a cigarette or a flame from a heater. A BBC investigation found most creams do not carry warnings despite the risk. The medicines regulator is conducting a safety review into the creams. Last March aBBC investigation discovered 37 deathswere linked to skin creams containing paraffin in England since 2010. It is believed there have been a further eight deaths since November 2016. But fire services are now warning the creams - used for conditions like eczema and psoriasis - may have played a role in many other deaths without investigators realising. Bitcoin arrests at Russian nuclear lab 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Drought-hit Cape Town rejoices at rain Firefighter Chris Bell, who is a watch commander with West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, says the actual number of deaths linked to the creams is likely to be much higher. ""Hundreds of thousands of people use them, we're not sure how many fire deaths might have occurred but it could be into the hundreds,"" he said. His concerns were echoed by Mark Hazelton, group manager for community safety at London Fire Brigade. He said many fire services do not have forensic investigation teams able to properly assess the role of paraffin cream in fires. Brian Bicat's daughter Kirsten says the family had no idea his clothing was a fire risk Brian Bicat, 82, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, died last September after being set on fire. It is believed cigarette embers sparked paraffin residue from his skin cream and set his clothes alight. His daughter Kirsten said her father's wife Kathleen returned from a walk to find him conscious but severely injured. ""The flat was full of smoke and there was a pile of smouldering clothes on the floor outside the bathroom burning a hole in the carpet,"" Kirsten said. ""My dad was sat on the bed with no clothes on, and covered in water and hair singed, looking sort of dazed and he said 'I seem to have set myself on fire'."" The grandfather of three, who used to run a jazz club, was airlifted to hospital suffering third degree burns across half his body and later died. Mr Bicat with his son Thomas Kirsten said the family had no idea his clothing had become a fire risk. ""One minute he was going to jazz club, going on holiday to the bird watching sanctuary, playing Scrabble and being larger than life like he was, then the next minute just completely gone. It's just so hard to get your head round,"" she said. ""The clothes that he wore were obviously saturated with the creams so he unwittingly turned himself into a firelighter and who knew that could happen?"" Last year the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) asked all manufacturers of skin creams that contain paraffin to carry a fire-risk warning. But a joint investigation between 5 live Investigates and Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire has discovered just seven of 38 products containing paraffin that are licensed in the UK have put warnings on their packaging. The MHRA said it was conducting a review around safety information concerning paraffin-based skin creams and was continuing to ""collaborate closely with partner organisations including both manufacturers and the fire service to further reduce the risks associated with paraffin-containing topical products"". John Smith, chief executive of The Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB), which represents manufacturers of branded over-the-counter medicines, said: ""We recognise that all emollient products need clear information on packaging that warns users about the potential risk if their clothing or bedding comes into contact with a naked flame."" He said PAGB was engaged closely with the ongoing MHRA review. ""Many manufacturers have already added warnings, and others are in the process of doing so,"" he added. 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 11 February at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

Six Nations: Scotland beat FranceScotland secure a 32-26 Six Nations victory over France at Murrayfield.,"2018 Six Nations Scotland (14) 32 Tries:Maitland, JonesCons:Laidlaw 2Pens:Laidlaw 6 France (20) 26 Tries:Thomas 2Cons:Machenaud 2Pens:Machenaud 2, Serin 2 Scotland put defeat by Wales behind them to overcome France at Murrayfield and revive their Six Nations campaign. The first of two Teddy Thomas tries put France into an early 10-0 lead before Sean Maitland crossed for Scotland. Thomas gathered a lucky bounce to score again but the hosts replied via Huw Jones' try, only for Maxime Machenaud's second penalty to put France 20-14 up. Greig Laidlaw kicked six penalties, to two from Baptiste Serin, to steer the Scots home in a tense second half. Scotland will next face reigning champions England at Murrayfield on Saturday, 24 February (16:45 KO), while France host Italy on Friday, 23 February (20:00 KO). The fashion in which Scotland were swatted away by Wales on the opening day caused a hasty reassessment in some quarters of what Gregor Townsend's men could realistically achieve in this championship, having been tipped by some as potential dark horses for the title. France were nursing wounds of their own, having been denied victory against Ireland in Paris by a dramatic Johnny Sexton drop-goal in the last play of the game. Thomas' stunning try looked to have given France victory in that match before Sexton's late heroics, and with less than three minutes on the clock in Edinburgh, the winger ripped the Scotland defence to shreds. Collecting a pass five metres inside the Scottish half wide on the right, Thomas brushed off a weak Finn Russell tackle, skipped around Peter Horne and sprinted away from Stuart Hogg to coast over. Machenaud's conversion and subsequent penalty saw the nervous Murrayfield crowd looking at a scoreboard showing their team 10-0 down after 10 minutes. The Scotland response was, however, not long in coming. A clever kick from Hogg forced an attacking line-out deep in French territory and after controlled phase play - something they struggled badly with last weekend - the Scots picked their moment to go wide, Russell timing the scoring pass to Maitland to perfection. Scotland's attacking style drew many plaudits in the autumn, and while Wales showed last weekend that they do not have a monopoly on ambitious rugby, France seemed intent on ramming it down their throats. After pulling the hosts from side to side, the ball was shipped to Thomas. The Racing 92 flier chipped ahead and as a cruel bounce took the ball away from the covering Laidlaw, Thomas gathered to re-establish the 10-point lead. Teddy Thomas' first-half brace took his try tally to eight in 10 Tests The next score was going to be crucial to Scottish confidence - on the field and in the stands - and the stadium erupted when Jones cut a gorgeous short line to take Laidlaw's pass, slice through the France defence and go in under the posts. Another Machenaud penalty gave the French a 20-14 half-time lead, but it was the Scots that began the second period on the front foot. Impressive recalled lock Grant Gilchrist blasted through a couple of tackles to get the French retreating and when they infringed on the floor, Laidlaw kicked Scotland back within three. Serin, on for Machenaud at scrum-half, and Laidlaw traded penalties as the initiative swung one way and then another, with referee John Lacey's whistle checking the momentum of both sides. Serin struck again from the tee, but Laidlaw hit back once more, and going into the final quarter it seemed the team who could conjure a try would go on and win the game. It was not to be though, with Townsend's side instead being content instead to accept the penalty points that the greater authority in their play presented. Laidlaw popped over his fourth penalty to level things up at 26-26 before Townsend sprung a surprise by removing captain John Barclay and Russell - guilty of a couple of basic errors - to make way for David Denton and Ali Price, with Laidlaw moving to fly-half. The home side were in the ascendency, their replacements bringing the intended energy to their play, and with 10 minutes remaining Laidlaw's fifth penalty gave them the lead for the first time. Another, with four minutes left, gave the former captain a 22-point haul from a flawless eight shots at goal, and Murrayfield was soon erupting in relief and celebration. This video can not be played Six Nations: Gregor Townsend praises Scotland's 'direct' play after France win Scotland boss Gregor Townsend:""I'm happier than last week, that's for sure! The effort it takes to win a Test match is huge, and when you have to do it being behind for most of the game, that shows the character of the squad and the togetherness. We were a bit more direct, and we got our rewards. ""It was mentioned during the week [moving Laidlaw to fly-half], and we ran a couple of plays this morning. It was seeing how Greig was, and it looked like he could last the 80, but Ali Price brings so much from the bench [at scrum-half]. ""He really upped the pace and Greig's kicking was pretty good, so bringing Ali onto the ball was pretty positive to the team."" Injured Wales flanker Sam Warburton on BBC One:""With Wales we have always said, coming to Murrayfield, we cannot give away penalties in our half if Greig Laidlaw is playing - more often than not he is going to convert them. ""Scotland were quite direct, they made France tackle and that makes teams tired. You crash at the 60-minute mark and I think the first half took its toll on the French. Penalties win matches, Greig kicked six in a row, and every time they went forward, France gave one away."" Former Scotland scrum-half Andy Nicol on BBC One:""Six Nations rugby is about winning. You do not get points for style, for scoring great tries and playing with flair. It is about winning rugby games and Scotland had to do that today."" Former France flanker Olivier Magne on BBC One:""I am very disappointed. I was very excited by the first half and thought France could maintain the speed and tempo like that during the second half.  But our Top 14 doesn't prepare us to play like that for 80 minutes - we can play 40 minutes at a good level but the second half was too difficult for us.""

Energy firms could get welfare data,"People on state benefits could have their names passed to energy firms so they can give them special rates. The plan, under consideration by the government, is intended as a new approach to help people who are struggling to pay their energy bills. It would allow power companies to transfer customers to a special tariff set by the regulator, Ofgem. Energy Secretary Greg Clark said the proposal would help vulnerable consumers. 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Drought-hit Cape Town rejoices at rain Anime fans 'sobbing' at Olympic ice skating The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said data-sharing would take place under strictly controlled conditions and only with customers' consent. It added that energy firms would not be given specific details of any benefits, only whether the customers were eligible for the special tariff. BEIS said it would open consultation on the proposals on Monday, as it would require a change in the law to allow the necessary data-sharing. The tariff in question is known as the safeguard tariff cap and was introduced in April last year. It already covers five million people, mainly those on pre-payment meters. Under the plans, customers receiving specific state benefits would be identified and automatically moved to the safeguard tariff. Mr Clark said: ""The effects of energy price rises are often felt most by those on the lowest incomes, as they are usually on the highest standard variable tariffs. ""These people are at risk of being plunged further into fuel poverty if they are left at the mercy of a broken energy market. ""Enabling energy suppliers to establish who should be on Ofgem's safeguard tariff cap will help these vulnerable consumers."" Last week, Ofgem saidthe savings for people on the safeguard tariff would be reduced from April,but added that it was not designed to be the cheapest tariff on the market.

"'Hundreds of deaths' may be linked to creamsSkin creams containing paraffin are a fire risk, but most products do not contain a warning.16h16 hours agoUK","This video can not be played Test shows fire danger of paraffin-based creams Hundreds of fire deaths may be linked to the use of skin creams containing paraffin, a senior firefighter warns. If people use the creams regularly but do not often change clothes or bedding, paraffin residue can soak into the fabric and act as an accelerant when it comes into contact with a cigarette or a flame from a heater. A BBC investigation found most creams do not carry warnings despite the risk. The medicines regulator is conducting a safety review into the creams. Last March aBBC investigation discovered 37 deathswere linked to skin creams containing paraffin in England since 2010. It is believed there have been a further eight deaths since November 2016. But fire services are now warning the creams - used for conditions like eczema and psoriasis - may have played a role in many other deaths without investigators realising. Bitcoin arrests at Russian nuclear lab 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Drought-hit Cape Town rejoices at rain Firefighter Chris Bell, who is a watch commander with West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, says the actual number of deaths linked to the creams is likely to be much higher. ""Hundreds of thousands of people use them, we're not sure how many fire deaths might have occurred but it could be into the hundreds,"" he said. His concerns were echoed by Mark Hazelton, group manager for community safety at London Fire Brigade. He said many fire services do not have forensic investigation teams able to properly assess the role of paraffin cream in fires. Brian Bicat's daughter Kirsten says the family had no idea his clothing was a fire risk Brian Bicat, 82, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, died last September after being set on fire. It is believed cigarette embers sparked paraffin residue from his skin cream and set his clothes alight. His daughter Kirsten said her father's wife Kathleen returned from a walk to find him conscious but severely injured. ""The flat was full of smoke and there was a pile of smouldering clothes on the floor outside the bathroom burning a hole in the carpet,"" Kirsten said. ""My dad was sat on the bed with no clothes on, and covered in water and hair singed, looking sort of dazed and he said 'I seem to have set myself on fire'."" The grandfather of three, who used to run a jazz club, was airlifted to hospital suffering third degree burns across half his body and later died. Mr Bicat with his son Thomas Kirsten said the family had no idea his clothing had become a fire risk. ""One minute he was going to jazz club, going on holiday to the bird watching sanctuary, playing Scrabble and being larger than life like he was, then the next minute just completely gone. It's just so hard to get your head round,"" she said. ""The clothes that he wore were obviously saturated with the creams so he unwittingly turned himself into a firelighter and who knew that could happen?"" Last year the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) asked all manufacturers of skin creams that contain paraffin to carry a fire-risk warning. But a joint investigation between 5 live Investigates and Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire has discovered just seven of 38 products containing paraffin that are licensed in the UK have put warnings on their packaging. The MHRA said it was conducting a review around safety information concerning paraffin-based skin creams and was continuing to ""collaborate closely with partner organisations including both manufacturers and the fire service to further reduce the risks associated with paraffin-containing topical products"". John Smith, chief executive of The Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB), which represents manufacturers of branded over-the-counter medicines, said: ""We recognise that all emollient products need clear information on packaging that warns users about the potential risk if their clothing or bedding comes into contact with a naked flame."" He said PAGB was engaged closely with the ongoing MHRA review. ""Many manufacturers have already added warnings, and others are in the process of doing so,"" he added. 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 11 February at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.

MPs could block May's Brexit - Soubry,"This video can not be played Anna Soubry and Chuka Umunna say MPs could block a hard Brexit Pro-European Conservative MPs could join forces with Labour to block the kind of Brexit Theresa May wants, a Tory rebel has warned the PM. Anna Soubry claimed there would be a Commons majority against leaving the single market and customs union. Labour's Chuka Umunna, appearing alongside Ms Soubry on the Andrew Marr show, agreed with her comments. MPs have been promised a ""meaningful vote"" on the terms of Brexit before it happens in March next year. PM and ministers to set out 'road to Brexit' Brexit: All you need to know ""If this government doesn't get this right,"" said Ms Soubry, ""the majority of members of parliament, putting their constituents first, will find themselves unable to vote for a withdrawal agreement."" Theresa May is set to deliver a major speech within the next three weeks outlining the future relationship Britain wants to have with the EU. The prime minister has ruled out continued membership of the single market and customs union. But Ms Soubry, one of 11 pro-European Conservative MPs who defeated the government in December on the right to get a vote on any final Brexit deal, said the PM's stance was a ""huge mistake"". ""Not only is it bad for our economy but it also fundamentally undermines the [Northern Ireland] peace process that was achieved and this is really important,"" she told Andrew Marr. She said she wanted the UK to remain in the European Free Trade Area, like Norway, which would allow access to the single market without being a member of the EU. Asked by Andrew Marr if they believed they had a majority in the House of Commons to defeat ""the kind of Brexit the prime minister wants"", Ms Soubry said: ""If she's not careful, yes."" Mr Umunna said: ""There is no majority in the House of Commons for us simply to jump off a cliff."" When Andrew Marr suggested to Ms Soubry that she was politically closer to Mr Umunna than she was to leading Brexiteer and Conservative colleague Jacob Rees-Mogg, she said: ""I'm not denying that."" Asked if she thought Brexit would definitely happen, Ms Soubry said: ""I genuinely don't know what is going to happen."" Responding to whether it might be stopped, she said: ""Well I'll tell you who might stop it, and that's the people of this country. ""We won't stop it. It is the people. We gave the people a referendum to start this process."" Mr Umunna said he also backed another referendum on the terms of the Brexit deal - something his party leader Jeremy Corbyn has appeared to rule out. He claimed the Labour leader - who last monthrejected calls to attend a cross-party summit,externalon avoiding a ""hard Brexit"" - was ""open minded"" about staying in the single market. ""I cannot conceive of circumstances where Labour MPs are marshalled to go through the lobby and vote against us staying in the customs union and the single market, with the likes of Jacob Rees-Mogg, Boris Johnson and Michael Gove,"" said Mr Umunna. Both MPs insisted they were acting in the ""national interest,"" which they said transcended party politics. Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell said another Brexit referendum would cause divisions and a ""better route"" would be to have a general election. ""Better we have a general election. On the issue, and all the other issues, because you then have a wider debate as well,"" he told told ITV's Peston On Sunday. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who is campaigning for another referendum, said: ""It is good to see cross-party cooperation between Tory and Labour rebels."" He said he was ""optimistic that the rebellions in both Tory and Labour parties will spread in coming weeks"", and that his party was working with them in the House of Lords.

UKIP leader Bolton: It's not all over,"This video can not be played UKIP leader Henry Bolton says he still has 'strong affections' for Jo Marney UKIP leader Henry Bolton is confident he will win the backing of his party in a vote of members next weekend, he told the BBC's Andrew Marr. Mr Bolton suggested he was still in a relationship with Jo Marney, whose racist texts about Meghan Markle sparked a no-confidence vote in him. ""There are strong affections there, yes,"" he told Andrew Marr. But he said the party had to reform under his leadership or continue to be on the sidelines in the Brexit debate. I'll drain the swamp in UKIP, says Bolton UKIP leader splits with partner after texts ""I am getting a huge amount of support from around the country because the membership know what's been going on within the party for a very long time and they know I am not responsible for that,"" he told Andrew Marr. ""They know that factionalisation needs to be dealt with if the party is going to professionalise and be effective."" Asked by Marr if his leadership was over, he said: ""No, I don't believe it is."" Mr Bolton, who became UKIP's fourth leader in 18 months in September, said the party could not afford another ""four or five-month"" leadership election. ""By then the party will have lost the opportunity to shape the future independence of this country, post-Brexit,"" he said. Mr Bolton faced a string of front bench resignations after the party's National Executive Committee passed a vote of no confidence in him last month. Senior UKIP figures said media coverage of Mr Bolton's personal life - and the way he had dealt with it - had made his position untenable. The row erupted after it emerged that Jo Marney had sent racist private messages on Facebook, including one saying Prince Harry's fiancee Meghan Markle would ""taint"" the Royal Family. At the time, Mr Bolton, who said the messages were sent before he met Ms Marney, described them as ""utterly indefensible"" and said he had ended the relationship. He told Andrew Marr the messages had been taken out of context, adding: ""In the days to come there will be more evidence presented as to how they were obtained,"" His future now depends on a vote of party members at an extraordinary general meeting next Saturday in Birmingham.

Energy firms could get welfare dataDetails of customers on some benefits could be handed to energy firms so they can give them special rates.2h2 hours agoBusiness,"People on state benefits could have their names passed to energy firms so they can give them special rates. The plan, under consideration by the government, is intended as a new approach to help people who are struggling to pay their energy bills. It would allow power companies to transfer customers to a special tariff set by the regulator, Ofgem. Energy Secretary Greg Clark said the proposal would help vulnerable consumers. 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Drought-hit Cape Town rejoices at rain Anime fans 'sobbing' at Olympic ice skating The Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) said data-sharing would take place under strictly controlled conditions and only with customers' consent. It added that energy firms would not be given specific details of any benefits, only whether the customers were eligible for the special tariff. BEIS said it would open consultation on the proposals on Monday, as it would require a change in the law to allow the necessary data-sharing. The tariff in question is known as the safeguard tariff cap and was introduced in April last year. It already covers five million people, mainly those on pre-payment meters. Under the plans, customers receiving specific state benefits would be identified and automatically moved to the safeguard tariff. Mr Clark said: ""The effects of energy price rises are often felt most by those on the lowest incomes, as they are usually on the highest standard variable tariffs. ""These people are at risk of being plunged further into fuel poverty if they are left at the mercy of a broken energy market. ""Enabling energy suppliers to establish who should be on Ofgem's safeguard tariff cap will help these vulnerable consumers."" Last week, Ofgem saidthe savings for people on the safeguard tariff would be reduced from April,but added that it was not designed to be the cheapest tariff on the market.

Grand Canyon helicopter crash kills three,"The accident happened at the West Rim of the Grand Canyon A tourist helicopter has crashed in the Grand Canyon in the US state of Arizona, killing three people and injuring four. The aircraft suffered ""substantial damage"", a spokesman for the Federal Aviation Administration said. It was in the Grand Canyon West area when it came down at around 17:20 local time (00:20 GMT) on Saturday. The helicopter was operated by tour company Papillon Airways.

'Space cigar' had violent history,"Artwork: The way 'Oumuamua tumbles suggests it was involved in a collision The space interloper 'Oumuamua is spinning chaotically and will carry on doing so for more than a billion years. That is the conclusion of new Belfast research that has examined in detail the light bouncing off the cigar-shaped asteroid from outside our Solar System. ""At some point or another it's been in a collision,"" says Dr Wes Fraser fromQueen's University,external. His team's latest study is featured in Sunday'sSky At Nightepisode on the BBC and published inNature Astronomy,external. It is yet another intriguing finding about this strange object that has fascinated scientists since its discovery back in October. 'Oumuamua comes from a different star system. Its path across the sky confirms it does not originate in our solar neighbourhood. Initially, it was thought the object could be a comet, but it displays none of the classic behaviour expected of these cosmic wanderers - such as a dusty, water-ice particle tail. 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Anime fans 'sobbing' at Olympic ice skating Are these the worst examples of business jargon? 'Oumuamua is in all likelihood an asteroid, albeit with a highly unusual shape. It has been described as resembling a cigar or cucumber, where the longest dimension is over 200m. The Queen's team wanted to establish the exact nature and rate of the object's rotation. To do this, the group studied variations in its brightness over time. This video can not be played Wes Fraser explains what is meant by tumbling with the aid of a ping-pong bat Almost immediately, Dr Fraser and colleagues could see that it was not spinning periodically like many small asteroids, but spinning chaotically - it was tumbling. In Sunday's Sky At Night programme on BBC Four, the Queen's researcher illustrates this with the aid of a tennis table bat. Throw it in the air one way and it will turn over evenly about a single axis; throw it up another way and it is possible to make the paddle turn over in an apparently haphazard way. ""It quickly starts to wobble around chaotically, and that's what we call tumbling,"" he tells presenter Chris Lintott. The most probable explanation is that 'Oumuamua has been hit by another object at some point in its history. The team can't say exactly when that happened but what they can say is that the tumbling will continue  for at least a billion years. ""The tumbling actually causes stresses and strains internal to the object, and that slowly but surely squeezes and pulls on the object just like tides on the Earth to remove energy from the spin,"" explains Dr Fraser. This dampening process takes a very, very long time. Dr Fraser says it is reasonable to assume the collision occurred in 'Oumuamua's own stellar system before it was then kicked out. ""It's hard to know if it was during planet formation or after the planet formation process,"" he tells Chris. ""Certainly, more collisions happen while planets are growing than afterwards, so thatâs a very good guess. But unfortunately we canât get a high-resolution image of this thing to see what kind of crater is on it that might be attributed to the collision that caused it to start tumbling."" Artwork: The LSST should become operational in the next few years The hunt is now on for more 'Oumuamua-like objects. Extrapolating from this one discovery, there ought to be some 10,000 of them passing through our Solar System inside the orbit of Neptune. The trouble is - being so small and dark, they are extremely hard to spot. There is though, a new observatory coming that may change this game completely. It is called theLarge Synoptic Survey Telescope,externaland it will come online in the next couple of years. With its 8.4m primary mirror and super-digital camera, it will image the entire viewable sky from its position in Chile every few nights. If anything is moving across the sky, it will be hard to escape the attention of the LSST. ""It is basically the perfect sort of tool to find objects like 'Oumuamua. We expect to find 100s of them with the LSST,"" Dr Fraser says. The Sky At Night programme,The Mystery of 'Oumuamua, is broadcast on BBC Four on Sunday at 22:00 GMT, after which it will be available on the iPlayer.

PM and ministers to set out 'road to Brexit'Boris Johnson is to begin a series of Brexit speeches that will culminate in an address by Theresa May.,"The PM has been under pressure from Brussels and her party to set out her vision for Britain after Brexit Theresa May will deliver a major speech within the next three weeks outlining the future relationship Britain wants to have with the EU. Before that, senior ministers are also due to give speeches in a campaign dubbed ""the road to Brexit"" by No 10. Security, the devolution of powers, workers' rights and trade are to be covered. The PM has been under pressure from Brussels and her party to set out her vision for Britain after Brexit. MPs could block May's Brexit - Soubry What is the Brexit transition phase? Brexit: All you need to know International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who was a leading Leave supporter, said: ""What the public want is, they want the vision and they want some meat on the bones."" Her comments came as Tory rebel Anna Soubry warned Mrs May pro-European Conservatives could join forces with Labour to prevent the UK from leaving the single market and customs union. Asked if there was a Commons majority to defeat ""the kind of Brexit the prime minister wants"", Ms Soubry told the BBC's Andrew Marr show: ""If she's not careful, yes."" David Davis and Boris Johnson will be heard from, but Philip Hammond and Amber Rudd will not Asked if she thought Brexit will definitely happen, Ms Soubry, who was appearing alongside pro-Europe Labour MP Chuka Umunna, said: ""I genuinely don't know what is going to happen."" Theresa May is set to make two key note addresses in the coming weeks, and arch Brexiteers Boris Johnson, David Davis and Liam Fox will also set out their agendas. Senior ministers are due to hold talks at the prime minister's country residence Chequers, and soon after that Mrs May is expected to set out her vision. The foreign secretary will begin the series of speeches on Wednesday and insiders say Boris Johnson will be seeking to unite Remainers and Leavers, the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson said. Brexit Secretary David Davis and International Trade Secretary Liam Fox will also be heard from, along with Cabinet Office minister David Lidington, who backed Remain in the referendum. But two prominent ministers who voted to remain - the chancellor and the home secretary - are not delivering speeches. No 10 said Philip Hammond spoke recently in Davos, while the prime minister herself will in effect cover Amber Rudd's brief when she gives a speech on security on Saturday. Mrs May will detail the ""security partnership"" the UK wants to maintain with the EU. Justice Secretary David Gauke rejected suggestions ministers who favoured a softer Brexit were being silenced. ""He (Philip Hammond) is not part of the set of speeches that have been outlined today, but that doesn't mean that the Chancellor is not expressing his views both internally in the cabinet conversations, but also externally. ""So I don't think there is anything in this, that this is somehow a kind of plot to gag a particular faction of ministers, I don't think that's a fair characterisation at all,"" he told ITV's Peston On Sunday.

This video can not be played Key points of Michel Barnier's news briefing He said ""substantial"" disagreements remained and he had ""some problems understanding the UK's position"". Penny Mordaunt hit back at Mr Barnier's comments, telling Andrew Marr: ""the other nations involved in this are very pragmatic and have not been impressed with some of the language that the (European) Commission has used"". Asked if it was a UK government ""red line"" to not have to grant full rights to EU migrants who come to Britain during a transition period, Ms Mordaunt said that was the government's position going into the next round of talks.

Israel warns Iran after strikes in Syria,"This video can not be played The story of the jet, why it was in  Syria, and how it was shot down Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says his country will defend itself ""against any attack"" after carrying out what appear to be its largest strikes on sites in Syria in decades. Israel launched raids against Iranian targets after saying it had intercepted an Iranian drone crossing the Syria-Israel border. Iran denies the allegation. During the offensive an Israeli F-16 fighter jet was shot down by Syria air defences, crashing in northern Israel. Its pilots ejected from the plane and were taken to hospital. It is believed to be the first time Israel has lost a jet in combat since 2006. Mr Netanyahu warned that Israel's policy to defend itself against ""any attempt to harm our sovereignty"" was ""absolutely clear"". ""Iran brazenly violated Israel's sovereignty,"" he said, adding: ""They dispatched an Iranian drone from Syrian territory into Israel... Israel holds Iran and its Syrian hosts responsible."" Remains of a missile were found near the site of the F-16 jet crash in northern Israel Mr Netanyahu said Israel would oppose any attempt by Iran to entrench itself militarily in Syria. But he also said during a meeting with military chiefs that ""Israel seeks peace"". In other reaction: The US state department said it supported Israel's right to defend itself, blaming Iran for the confrontation In a phone call with Mr Netanyahu, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed the need to avoid a ""dangerous escalation"". He has been supporting President Assad's government in Syria's civil war UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an immediate de-escalation in the actions that he said threaten a ""dangerous spill-over"" across Syria's borders Israeli soldiers are in the alert in the occupied Golan Heights Israel's military says one of its combat helicopters downed an Iranian drone infiltrating Israel on Saturday. It tweeted footage of the incident. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In response, Israel said it attacked Syrian and Iranian targets in Syria, during which an F-16 jet was fired upon, Israel says, causing it to crash. The two pilots were able to parachute to safety before it came down in an empty field near the town of Harduf in northern Israel. Israel says it then carried out a second wave of strikes on both Syrian and Iranian military targets. The Israeli military said it had inflicted huge damage on targets in Syria in the ""most significant attack"" of its kind against the country since the 1982 Lebanon war. Syria's state media say air defences opened fire in response to an Israeli attack on a military base, hitting more than one plane. Why is there a war in Syria? Israel 'strikes Damascus military complex' Iran is Israel's arch-enemy, and Iranian troops have been fighting rebel groups in Syria since 2011. These Hezbollah supporters in Lebanon celebrated the downing of the Israeli jet in front of UN troops Tehran has sent military advisers, volunteer militias and, reportedly, hundreds of fighters from its Quds Force, the overseas arm of the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC). It is also believed to have supplied thousands of tonnes of weaponry and munitions to help President Bashar al-Assad's forces and the pro-Iranian Hezbollah, which is fighting on Syria's side. Tehran has faced accusations that it is seeking to establish not just an arc of influence but a logistical land supply line from Iran through to Hezbollah in Lebanon.

Johnson meets Suu Kyi for Rohingya talks,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson urges leadership from Aung San Suu Kyi over Rohingya crisis UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson says he doubts Myanmar's de facto leader Aung San Suu Kyi ""understands the full horror"" of the Rohingya refugee crisis. ""I don't think she's been up in a helicopter to see what we have seen,"" Mr Johnson told the BBC after talks in the capital Nay Pyi Daw. He urged Ms Suu Kyi to work with UN agencies to help the refugees return. Violence in Myanmar's Rakhine state has caused about 700,000 Rohingya to flee to Bangladesh since last August.

When he was nominated for an award for The Theory of Everything, a 2014 film depicting the early life of physicist Stephen Hawking, Mr JÃ³hannsson said that it was a ""challenge to do justice to the scope of the film"". In an interview with the site Collider at the time, the composer said that he opted for ""pure orchestral expression"" for the film, adding that this was ""a new thing for me and something that I enjoyed"". On Saturday Mr JÃ³hannsson's manager, Tim Husom, said that he had ""lost my friend, who was one of the most talented musicians and intelligent people I knew"".

US denies rift with S Korea over North,"This video can not be played South Koreans protest against 'propaganda' and burn flag US Vice-President Mike Pence has said his country and South Korea are in complete agreement on the need to maintain pressure on North Korea. Speaking on his way home from the Winter Olympics in South Korea, Mr Pence said there was ""no daylight"" between the two allies on the issue. The Games has seen better ties between the two Koreas despite tensions over the North's nuclear programme. But the US has distanced itself from the North Korean overtures. On Saturday North Korean leader Kim Jong-un invited the South's President, Moon Jae-in, to Pyongyang for talks. North Korea's Kim Yo-jong was seated near Mike Pence at the opening ceremony of the Games It would be the first summit in more than a decade between Korean leaders. Mr Moon said the Koreas should ""make it happen"" and encouraged the North to return to negotiations with the US. However, his Prime Minister, Lee Nak-yeon, said on Sunday he hoped ""the right conditions"" would be created for the summit to be held, with support from the international community. He did not specify what conditions he had in mind. Pyongyang's nuclear programme is expected to hang over any attempts to bring the countries closer together. This video can not be played Kim Yo-jong presented President Moon Jae-in with a folder holding a handwritten note from her brother, the leader of North Korea The US administration has sought to maintain pressure on North Korea through sanctions and tough rhetoric from President Donald Trump. Speaking to reporters during a flight on Saturday, Mr Pence said: ""There is no daylight between the United States, the Republic of Korea and Japan on the need to continue to isolate North Korea economically and diplomatically until they abandon their nuclear and ballistic missile programme."" North v South: A history of sport, bombs and diplomacy North Korea's cheerleading charm offensive Pyeongchang Olympics: The background explained The handwritten invitation to President Moon was delivered by Mr Kim's influential sister, Kim Yo-jong, at a landmark meeting in the presidential palace in Seoul, as the Games opened on Saturday. Ms Kim and the North's ceremonial head of state Kim Yong-nam made up the most senior delegation from the North to visit the South since the Korean War in the 1950s. The invitation puts Mr Moon in a difficult position as he had promised to engage with the North, but his US ally is cautious of Seoul falling for North Korea's charm offensive. Despite the public shows of friendliness, experts have warned the underlying tensions have not gone away. At the opening ceremony for the Games, Mr Pence, Kim Yo-jong and Kim Yong-nam were seated in close proximity to each other. How potent are North Korea's threats? North Korea-US tension: Should you worry? Mr Pence stayed seated when South and North Korean athletes marched together under a unified flag, and also skipped a dinner with the North Korean delegation. In a tweet, he reasserted the sceptical view taken his administration regarding recent conciliatory gestures by North Korea. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Winter Olympics has thrust Kim Yo-jong into the spotlight. The highest-profile member of the North Korean delegation to the Games, she is the first immediate member of the North's ruling family to visit the South since the 1950-1953 Korean war. Ms Kim, who is though to be about 30 years old, was promoted to the powerful politburo last year. She is on a US sanctions list over alleged links to human rights abuses in North Korea.

"Israel warns Iran after strikes in SyriaIsraeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu warns of ""clear policy"" to hit Iranian and Syrian targets if needed.","This video can not be played The story of the jet, why it was in  Syria, and how it was shot down Israeli PM Benjamin Netanyahu says his country will defend itself ""against any attack"" after carrying out what appear to be its largest strikes on sites in Syria in decades. Israel launched raids against Iranian targets after saying it had intercepted an Iranian drone crossing the Syria-Israel border. Iran denies the allegation. During the offensive an Israeli F-16 fighter jet was shot down by Syria air defences, crashing in northern Israel. Its pilots ejected from the plane and were taken to hospital. It is believed to be the first time Israel has lost a jet in combat since 2006. Mr Netanyahu warned that Israel's policy to defend itself against ""any attempt to harm our sovereignty"" was ""absolutely clear"". ""Iran brazenly violated Israel's sovereignty,"" he said, adding: ""They dispatched an Iranian drone from Syrian territory into Israel... Israel holds Iran and its Syrian hosts responsible."" Remains of a missile were found near the site of the F-16 jet crash in northern Israel Mr Netanyahu said Israel would oppose any attempt by Iran to entrench itself militarily in Syria. But he also said during a meeting with military chiefs that ""Israel seeks peace"". In other reaction: The US state department said it supported Israel's right to defend itself, blaming Iran for the confrontation In a phone call with Mr Netanyahu, Russian President Vladimir Putin stressed the need to avoid a ""dangerous escalation"". He has been supporting President Assad's government in Syria's civil war UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has called for an immediate de-escalation in the actions that he said threaten a ""dangerous spill-over"" across Syria's borders Israeli soldiers are in the alert in the occupied Golan Heights Israel's military says one of its combat helicopters downed an Iranian drone infiltrating Israel on Saturday.

In response, Israel said it attacked Syrian and Iranian targets in Syria, during which an F-16 jet was fired upon, Israel says, causing it to crash. The two pilots were able to parachute to safety before it came down in an empty field near the town of Harduf in northern Israel. Israel says it then carried out a second wave of strikes on both Syrian and Iranian military targets. The Israeli military said it had inflicted huge damage on targets in Syria in the ""most significant attack"" of its kind against the country since the 1982 Lebanon war. Syria's state media say air defences opened fire in response to an Israeli attack on a military base, hitting more than one plane. Why is there a war in Syria?

Israel responds in force to jet downingThe loss of a warplane sparks what Israel says is its biggest attack on Syrian defences since 1982.,"This video can not be played An Israeli F-16 fighter jet crashed amid Syrian anti-aircraft fire Israel says it has inflicted huge damage on Syrian air defences after one of its fighter jets was brought down during a raid over Syria. The response was the ""most significant attack"" of its kind against Syria since the 1982 Lebanon war, said senior Israeli air force general Tomer Bar. The F-16 jet went down during a mission that followed an Iranian drone launch into Israeli territory, Israel says. The two pilots parachuted to safety before the crash in northern Israel. Israel says it responded with a second wave of strikes on both Syrian and Iranian military targets operating inside Syria. Israeli air strikes in Syria are not unusual, BBC Middle East correspondent Tom Bateman says, but the loss of an Israeli fighter jet marks a serious escalation. Israel 'strikes Damascus military complex' Why is there a war in Syria? Anti-aircraft fire smoke over the Syrian-Israeli border in the Golan Heights Later on Saturday, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu held a meeting with his military chiefs. He said Israel wanted peace but would defend itself ""against any attack against us or any attempt by Iran to establish itself against us in Syria"". In other developments: A Turkish helicopter was shot down as the country continued its offensive against Kurdish fighters in northern Syria. Two soldiers on board were killed, the Turkish military says UN Human Rights Commissioner Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein said the past week was one of the bloodiest in Syria since the conflict began in 2011 - with at least 277 civilian deaths reported Israel's military says one of its combat helicopters downed an Iranian drone infiltrating Israel.

Syria's state media say air defences opened fire in response to an Israeli attack on a military base,  hitting more than one plane. The damaged F-16 came down in an empty field near the town of Harduf in northern Israel. The fighter jet was carrying out strikes on Iranian targets in Syria, the Israelis say (file picture) It is unclear how exactly the plane was brought down. Gen Bar said it faced massive anti-aircraft fire, forcing the two pilots to eject. He said the crew did not report being hit before abandoning the aircraft. They were taken to hospital, one of them ""severely injured"", the Israeli military said. Israel launched a second wave of strikes in Syria. Eight of the Syrian targets belonged to the fourth Syrian division near Damascus, IDF spokesman Jonathan Conricus said. All the Israeli aircraft from this sortie returned safely. ""We are not looking to escalate the situation,"" he added. Syria and its ally Iran deny that the drone entered Israel. Russia expressed ""serious concern"" over the Israeli air strikes and called for all sides to show restraint. Iran is Israel's arch-enemy, and Iranian troops have been fighting rebel groups since 2011.

Tehran has faced accusations that it is seeking to establish not just an arc of influence but a logistical land supply line from Iran through to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Analysis by BBC's diplomatic correspondent Jonathan Marcus For years Israel has been striking at weapons stores and other facilities in Syria with a single goal - to disrupt and, as far as possible, to prevent advanced Iranian missiles being delivered to Hezbollah in Lebanon. Syria has often been the conduit for these shipments, but the changing balance of power there, with the survival of the regime of President Bashar al-Assad bolstered by Iranian help, has introduced a powerful new element - a direct Iranian role in the crisis. A more confident Iran is alleged by Israel to be setting up bases in Syria(whether for its own or its proxy Shia Muslim militia forces is unclear). But it is also alleged to be developing missile factories, both there and in Lebanon, to make the supply lines to Hezbollah less vulnerable. Israel's campaign to disrupt missile supplies is becoming ever more complex. And Iran risks becoming a direct actor in this conflict, ever closer to Israel's own borders.

'Hundreds of deaths' may be linked to cream,"This video can not be played Test shows fire danger of paraffin-based creams Hundreds of fire deaths may be linked to the use of skin creams containing paraffin, a senior firefighter warns. If people use the creams regularly but do not often change clothes or bedding, paraffin residue can soak into the fabric and act as an accelerant when it comes into contact with a cigarette or a flame from a heater. A BBC investigation found most creams do not carry warnings despite the risk. The medicines regulator is conducting a safety review into the creams. Last March aBBC investigation discovered 37 deathswere linked to skin creams containing paraffin in England since 2010. It is believed there have been a further eight deaths since November 2016. But fire services are now warning the creams - used for conditions like eczema and psoriasis - may have played a role in many other deaths without investigators realising. Bitcoin arrests at Russian nuclear lab 11 cities most likely to run out of drinking water Drought-hit Cape Town rejoices at rain Firefighter Chris Bell, who is a watch commander with West Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service, says the actual number of deaths linked to the creams is likely to be much higher. ""Hundreds of thousands of people use them, we're not sure how many fire deaths might have occurred but it could be into the hundreds,"" he said. His concerns were echoed by Mark Hazelton, group manager for community safety at London Fire Brigade. He said many fire services do not have forensic investigation teams able to properly assess the role of paraffin cream in fires. Brian Bicat's daughter Kirsten says the family had no idea his clothing was a fire risk Brian Bicat, 82, from Bradford, West Yorkshire, died last September after being set on fire. It is believed cigarette embers sparked paraffin residue from his skin cream and set his clothes alight. His daughter Kirsten said her father's wife Kathleen returned from a walk to find him conscious but severely injured. ""The flat was full of smoke and there was a pile of smouldering clothes on the floor outside the bathroom burning a hole in the carpet,"" Kirsten said. ""My dad was sat on the bed with no clothes on, and covered in water and hair singed, looking sort of dazed and he said 'I seem to have set myself on fire'."" The grandfather of three, who used to run a jazz club, was airlifted to hospital suffering third degree burns across half his body and later died. Mr Bicat with his son Thomas Kirsten said the family had no idea his clothing had become a fire risk. ""One minute he was going to jazz club, going on holiday to the bird watching sanctuary, playing Scrabble and being larger than life like he was, then the next minute just completely gone. It's just so hard to get your head round,"" she said. ""The clothes that he wore were obviously saturated with the creams so he unwittingly turned himself into a firelighter and who knew that could happen?"" Last year the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) asked all manufacturers of skin creams that contain paraffin to carry a fire-risk warning. But a joint investigation between 5 live Investigates and Inside Out Yorkshire and Lincolnshire has discovered just seven of 38 products containing paraffin that are licensed in the UK have put warnings on their packaging. The MHRA said it was conducting a review around safety information concerning paraffin-based skin creams and was continuing to ""collaborate closely with partner organisations including both manufacturers and the fire service to further reduce the risks associated with paraffin-containing topical products"". John Smith, chief executive of The Proprietary Association of Great Britain (PAGB), which represents manufacturers of branded over-the-counter medicines, said: ""We recognise that all emollient products need clear information on packaging that warns users about the potential risk if their clothing or bedding comes into contact with a naked flame."" He said PAGB was engaged closely with the ongoing MHRA review. ""Many manufacturers have already added warnings, and others are in the process of doing so,"" he added. 5 live Investigates is on BBC Radio 5 live, 11 February at 11:00 GMT - catch up onBBC iPlayer Radio.
