UK will not implement EU Article 13 copyright law,"Universities and Science Minister Chris Skidmore has said that the UK will not implement the EU Copyright Directive after the country leaves the EU. Severalcompanies have criticised the law,which would hold them accountable for not removing copyrighted content uploaded by users, if it is passed. EU member states have until 7 June 2021 to implement the new reforms, but the UK will have left the EU by then. The UK was among 19 nations that initially supported the law. That was in its final European Council vote in April 2019. Copyright is the legal right that allows an artist to protect how their original work is used. The EU Copyright Directive that covers how ""online content-sharing services"" should deal with copyright-protected content, such as television programmes and movies. It refers to services that primarily exist to give the public access to ""protected works or other protected subject-matter uploaded by its users"", such as Soundcloud, Dailymotion and YouTube. It was Article 13 which prompted fears over the future of memes and GIFs - stills, animated or short video clips that go viral - since they mainly rely on copyrighted scenes from TV and film. Critics claimed Article 13 would make it nearly impossible to upload even the tiniest part of a copyrighted work to Facebook, YouTube, or any other site. However, specific tweaks to the law in 2019 made memes safe ""for purposes of quotation, criticism, review, caricature, parody and pastiche"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson criticised the law in March, claiming that it was ""terrible for the internet"". Google had campaigned fiercely against the changes, arguing they would ""harm Europe's creative and digital industries"" and ""change the web as we know it"". Why Europe's original copyright plan was so controversial What is the controversial Article 13? YouTube boss Susan Wojcicki had also warned that users in the EU could be cut off from the video platform. Kathy Berry, a professional support lawyer at Linklaters, welcomed the government's stance on the law, claiming it will ""allow the UK to agree to more tech-friendly copyright provisions in free trade deals with other countries"". The law sparked suggestions from its biggest critics that it would end up ""killing memes and parodies,""despite it permitting the sharing of memes and GIFs. What is the controversial Article 13?

Climate activist hits out at 'racist' photo cropVanessa Nakate releases an emotional statement after being cut out of a photo with white activists.Africa,"Vanessa Nakate is a leading climate activist Ugandan climate activist Vanessa Nakate has accused the media of racism after she was cropped out of a photograph taken with her white peers in Davos.

"UK tracing 2,000 Wuhan visitors over coronavirus","A health team is available at Heathrow Airport for travellers from China Officials are attempting to trace as many as 2,000 visitors who have flown in to the UK from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where thenew strain of coronavirusfirst broke out. Tests on 14 people in the UK have come back negative, Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said. Prof Whitty said there is a ""fair chance"" Britain will see cases of the new virus, which has killed 26 people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the risk to the public ""remains low"". It came after Public Health England said that, while cases of the new virus in the UK are ""highly likely"", most of those affected abroad by the virus were making a good recovery. Globally,there are more than800 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 26 people in China. Mr Hancock chaired a meeting of the UK government's emergency committee, Cobra, to discuss the outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said there were still no confirmed cases in the country. Prof Whitty said further tests on a number of other patients are still being processed but that he did not want to provide exact numbers. ""This is a marathon not a sprint,"" he said, adding that clinicians are now implementing a system to deal with the new virus that can be scaled up if needed. Prof Whitty said attempts are being made to trace those who have arrived in the UK from Wuhan - the Chinese city where the virus first broke out - over the last 14 days. It is understood that the aim is to eliminate those who have flown on to other destinations and to check on the health of others in case they might have the coronavirus. It is believed that this could involve as many as 2,000 people. Wuhan woman who 'cheated' checks found in France China battles to prevent New Year virus spike Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Meanwhile the Chinese Ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, has said his country's government ""is very much determined to curb"" the virus. ""We think we can get it under control,"" he added ahead of a No 10 reception for the Chinese New Year. All the people who have been tested in the UK had visited Wuhan in the last two weeks. In Scotland, where five people were tested,an incident team has been set upto deal with the health threat. Four of the patients were believed to be Chinese, Downing Street said. Those tested in the UK includedone person in Wales,who was given the all clear last week, andone man in Belfast. One of those cleared was British artist Michael Hope, 45, whospent two days in quarantine this weekafter developing ""a nasty cough"" on returning to Newcastle from Wuhan. Prof Cosford told the BBC ""we will not be surprised"" if people return from China to the UK with the infection, which can cause lung problems such as pneumonia. ""I think it's highly likely that we will have cases in the UK - and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one."" There are no planes or trains in or out of Wuhan, where people are being treated He added: ""These are early days yet with this virus. The vast majority of people who are infected do seem to be getting better. ""The people who have done particularly badly, and sadly died, they seem to be people who have other conditions that might make them more likely to suffer badly with this virus."" The Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan and the UK is monitoring direct flights arriving from China as a precaution. Passengers are receiving leaflets and advice on what to do if they fall ill, and a health team is available at Heathrow Airport to check for symptoms. GPs have been told to isolate any patients showing symptoms and avoid physically examining them if they have recently travelled from Wuhan. Public Health England is advising anyone who has been to Wuhan within the past 14 days and has developed respiratory symptoms to phone NHS 111. Those symptoms include a cough, a sneeze, shortness of breath, or a fever. People who are concerned should phone ahead before going to any medical facility and mention their recent travel to the city. PHE also advises anyone travelling to China to maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene, and avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. The agency is currently not advising people to wear face masks. China has widened a lockdown in Hubei province - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. The travel restrictions will affect at least 20 million people across 10 cities. The lockdown comes on the eve of Lunar New Year - one of the most important dates in the Chinese calendar, when millions of people travel home. The virus has spread across China and to countries as far as Japan, Thailand and the US. This video can not be played What's life like in quarantined Wuhan? The World Health Organization has not classed the virus as an ""international emergency"", partly because of the low number of overseas cases, but said it ""may yet become one"". Peter Piot, professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said ""data to date suggests that this virus may have a lower mortality than Sars"", which killed hundreds in the early 2000s. Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The first human cases were identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. There have not been any other suspected human cases reported prior to this. Authorities have said it originated in a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". The market has been shut down since the beginning of the year. The incubation period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear after catching the infection) is days, rather than weeks. At the moment, there is no vaccine that can protect people against it, but researchers are looking to develop one. Your questions:You asked, we answered The story explained:How worried should we be?

Woman who posted 'Venables picture' avoids jail,"James Bulger was two when he was snatched and killed in 1993 A 53-year-old woman who posted a photo said to show one of James Bulger's killers on Facebook has avoided jail. Tina McGuire breached a worldwide ban on revealing Jon Venables's current identity by posting the picture. This was as well as a name Venables was said to be using and the prison where he was allegedly being held. McGuire, of Ammanford, Carmarthenshire, admitted contempt of court by breaching the 2001 injunction. She was sentenced to eight months in prison, suspended for 15 months, and was also ordered to pay legal fees of Â£3,000 at a High Court hearing in London on Thursday. The injunction bans the publication of anything purporting to reveal the identities, appearance or whereabouts of Venables and Robert Thompson. Bulger father loses killer ID challenge Bulger mum against killer's ID release They killed two-year-old James in February 1993 when they were aged 10, and have been living anonymously with new identities since being released from a life sentence. Lord Justice Davis, sitting with Mrs Justice May, said the case against McGuire was ""close to the line"" for an immediate prison sentence. But he added that in light of ""the early, frank admission, the remorse, the stated and evidenced determination not to infringe again and the psychiatric report"" the sentence could be suspended. Katherine Hardcastle, representing the Solicitor General, previously told the court the case was brought for a post made by McGuire on a personal Facebook page on 20 February 2018. Jon Venables was 10 when he and Robert Thompson killed James Bulger The post was shared 627 times. It was the second time she had attempted to post information purportedly about Venables, the court heard. The court was told that in November 2017 McGuire posted on Facebook a picture purporting to be of Venables as an adult with a caption which encouraged others to ""share this as much as possible as this photograph I posted this morning was removed"". That post was shared nearly 130,000 times, liked 2,800 times and received 3,400 comments, the court was told. Ms Hardcastle said the reference to another photograph being removed ""demonstrates that there were two posts on that day"", making the February 2018 post ""the third occasion on which she had purported to post a picture of Venables in three months"". She said the contempt proceedings were not brought in relation to that post because of legal issues with her first police interview, but said it provided ""essential context"" for the later post. Ms Hardcastle added it was ""notable"" the November 2017 post ""included a photograph of a different man to the February 20 post"", and that McGuire had admitted in interview at least ""one of those images must be wrong"". She said the posts posed a risk of ""serious harm"" to Venables as well as ""those mistakenly identified as Venables"". It was ""particularly troubling that two separate men seem to have been identified"" as Venables, Lord Justice Davis said. John Hipkin, representing McGuire, accepted ""this is an extremely serious matter"" but said there was ""a real prospect of rehabilitation"". He said McGuire had since withdrawn from all forms of social media.

Harry and Meghan's trademark bid challenged,"Plans by the Duke and Duchess of Sussex to trademark their Sussex Royal brand could face an official challenge. A ""notice of threatened opposition"" was filed with the Intellectual Property Office, giving the complainant a month to lodge a formal objection. That is now being rescinded, after an Australian doctor named in the filing said his details had been used without permission. But since then, three more notices have been filed. It is not yet clear on what basis the complainants might want to oppose the Sussex Royal trademark. Prince Harry and Meghan's foundation applied to trademark the term - used on their website and social media - in June last year. The application covered products such as clothing and stationery, as well as campaigning and charitable fundraising. Prince Charles visits grandmother's Jerusalem tomb How Harry and Meghan could make money Does a milk advert show Harry and Meghan's future? How much privacy can Harry and Meghan expect? Their plans attracted further attention after the couple announced their intention to ""step back"" from royal duties and become ""financially independent"". Records at the Intellectual Property Office (IPO), which governs trademarks in the UK, show that a notice of threatened opposition was filed on 21 January. The World Trademark Review website said it was filedin the name of a doctor living in Victoria, Australia,external. But the IPO said it was rescinding this notice after it had been ""advised by an individual that their personal details have been used without their permission to submit a 'Notice of threatened opposition' to the Sussex Royal trade mark"". Since the objection was first publicised, three similar notices also appear to have been filed on 24 January. The notices mean the ""opposition period"", during which detailed objections can be made, is extended to 20 March. Ben Evans, senior associate and chartered trademark attorney at Blake Morgan, said the IPO had considered the Sussexes' application for an unusually long time before publishing the trademark, perhaps because of rules over the term ""royal"". He said someone might formally oppose a trademark registration because they have a competing brand with which it might be confused, or because they object to the description - since the couple are no longer senior royals. But unlike a full objection, filing a notice of threatened objection requires no fee and no evidence, he said. ""You could just do it to be difficult,"" said Mr Evans. ""It looks like the IPO might be quite busy on this one."" It is not the first time the Sussexes have found themselves in a battle over their preferred brand. TheSussex Royal name on Instagram was originally taken by driving instructor Kevin Keiley, who lives in West Sussex and supports Reading FC - nicknamed the Royals. Instagram handed the name to the duke and duchess, leaving Mr Keiley as @_sussexroyal_ instead. How much privacy can Harry and Meghan expect? Does a milk advert show Harry and Meghan's future?

Unite union backs Long-Bailey for Labour leader,"Rebecca Long-Bailey has won the backing of the Unite trade union in her bid to succeed Jeremy Corbyn as Labour leader. The shadow business secretary now needs just one more union or affiliate group to endorse her to confirm her place on the members' ballot. Unite's general secretary, Len McCluskey, said Mrs Long-Bailey had the ""brains and the brilliance"" to take on PM Boris Johnson. The union will also back Richard Burgon for the vacant deputy leader post. Speaking after a meeting in London, Mr McCluskey said his union would make a ""substantial"" donation towards Mrs Long-Bailey's campaign. The union, which was Labour's biggest financial backer during last month's election, had been widely expected to back her pitch for the top job. Who will be Labour's next leader? WATCH: What matters to Labour members Which Labour contender is the most working-class? After receiving the nomination, Mrs Long-Bailey said she was ""honoured"" to receive the union's backing. ""I didn't see myself as the kind of person who could ever become an MP. It was Unite, my trade union, that supported me to realise my potential,"" she added. Mr McCluskey said Unite's executive committee had concluded Mrs Long-Bailey was ""best placed to take the fight to the Tory party"" on behalf of its members. This video can not be played Who decides on the next Labour leader? ""She is standing for unity, socialism and the determination to make Johnson's term in office short-lived,"" he added. He added that the union was confident that Mr Burgon would make a ""superb deputy"" for the party. In an apparent swipe at former deputy leader Tom Watson, he said Mr Burgon would display ""the qualities that have long been absent from that post,"" including ""pride in our values"" and ""loyalty to their leader"". Mr Watson was often at odds with the leadership during his time in the role, and faced an attempt to oust him at Labour's conference last year. To make the ballot, hopefuls need the support of three unions and affiliate groups representing 5% of the membership, or 33 local branches. Shadow brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer and Wigan MP Lisa Nandy have already secured this level of support ahead of the 14 February deadline. Having already been nominated by bakers' union BFAWU, Unite's support for Ms Long-Bailey means she needs just one more union or affiliate to join them. However the fourth leadership contender, shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry, is yet to receive any union or affiliate backing and has only secured endorsements from three local branches so far. Sir Keir has cancelled all campaign events this weekend after his mother-in-law was involved in a serious accident. She remains critically ill in hospital. He sent Labour's Chris Matheson to the Unite meeting in his place. Labour's general secretary, Jennie Formby, also confirmed the hustings due to take place in Leeds between the leadership candidates on Saturday would be cancelled, although the deputy leadership event would go ahead. She added: ""We have sent our very best wishes and solidarity to Keir and his family, and our hope that his mother-in-law recovers very soon."" This video can not be played Four candidates remain in the race for the Labour leadership Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner is the only candidate for the deputy leadership to have made it onto the ballot, with the support of Unison, the GMB, Usdaw and the NUM. As well as Mr Burgon, the others in the running are Scotland's only remaining Labour MP, Ian Murray, shadow equalities minister Dawn Butler, and Tooting MP Rosena Allin-Khan. The new leader and deputy will then be announced on 4 April.

'Porn block' companies seek Â£3m in damages,"Four companies that were developing age verification schemes for pornography websites are seeking damages after the government scrapped the idea. The plans would have forced adult websites to verify users' ages or face being blocked in the UK. Culture Secretary Baroness Morganscrapped the scheme in October 2019amid a wave of privacy concerns. AgeChecked, VeriMe, AVYourself and AVSecure are seeking over Â£3m in damages from the government. They have lodged a judicial review with the High Court to review the lawfulness of the decision to axe the scheme. The so-called ""porn block"" had been pitched as a way to stop children ""stumbling across"" pornography on the internet. Websites would be required to age-verify visitors. However, how they would do this was not explicitly explained in the proposal. At the time, children's charity the NSPCC welcomed the proposal. It said: ""Exposure to pornography can be damaging to young people's views about sex, body image and healthy relationships."" However, critics warned that many under-18s would have found it relatively easy to bypass the restrictions or seek out porn on platforms not covered by the plan, such as Reddit or Twitter. There were also privacy concerns, amid suggestions that websites might ask users to provide ID such as passports or driving licences, which could be exposed in a data breach. Chief executive and founder of AgeChecked, Alastair Graham, claimed those concerns were unfounded. ""The age verification sector developed technology to guarantee privacy and data security for consumers, abiding by a new standard created by the British Standards Institution,"" he told the BBC. ""AgeChecked provides anonymous age verification, and it does not retain any personal data."" Steve Winyard, chief marketing officer at AVSecure, claimed the government was concerned about negative media attention ahead of the general election in 2019. ""It doesn't take a rocket scientist to work out that [the porn plan] could have caused some consternation in the press."" Open Rights Group - a UK-based organisation that campaigns for digital rights - warned that a database of pornographic preferences would have put people's privacy at risk. Jim Killock, executive director of the Open Rights Group said the government did the ""responsible thing"" by abandoning the plans. ""The adult industry has a terrible record on data security. We're being asked to hope they don't repeat the many, many times they have lost personal data, with the result that blackmail scams and worse proliferate,"" he said. ""Age verification must not be pushed forward until there is compulsory privacy regulation put in place."" The companies developing the age-verification schemes were not subject to tight privacy regulations. Instead, the government had asked them to make ""voluntary"" privacy commitments.

How is China coping?,"Outbound trains in Wuhan have been stopped There have been widely-shared reports on social media and some state-run services that healthcare services in Wuhan - one of China's largest cities - areunder strain following the outbreak of coronavirus. Hu Xijin, the editor of state-run newspaper Global Times, said there had been a ""failure"" to contain the virus, and videos of patients queuing to get seen in hospitals. However, other Communist-party outlets have praised the response to the outbreak. Wuhan is a major transit hub with a population of about 11 million people, and has effectively been put on lockdown, along with other major cities in the region, in an unprecedented move to stop the spread of the virus. The city serves as the main economic hub for the wider province, Hubei, and has the most advanced healthcare facilities in the region. The metropolitan area has seven major hospitals - considered some of the best in China, with Tong Ji Hospital ranked third nationally - treating patients. It has seven more hospitals supporting the efforts, and 61 clinics around the city which are testing patients for symptoms of the virus. A local government report from 2014 included Wuhan among the top six cities for medical treatment in the country - although it ranks behind Beijing and Shanghai. In terms of capacity, the report said Wuhan had 6.51 hospital beds and 3.08 doctors per 1,000 people - this isn't a straightforward indication of healthcare capacity (more doctors doesn't always mean better healthcare), but it does rank Wuhan among the more developed places in the world. The UK and US have 2.8 and 2.6 doctors per 1,000 heads, respectively.  6.51Hospital beds per 1,000 people 3.08Doctors per 1,000 people So - is is this enough for a such a large city undergoing a mass shutdown? The lockdown in Wuhan has caused panic in the city - the World Health Organization (WHO) has said that containing a large city like this is ""new to science"". Allow Twitter content?

Hubei as a province has a lower number of doctors per 1,000 people, at 2.55 according to the latest government statistics. ""It's yet to be seen whether the costs associated with this kind of mass quarantine measure (not just financially, but with respect to personal liberty too) will translate into effective infection control,"" said Dr. Maia Majumder, an expert at Harvard Medical School in the US, who is tracking the virus. Hubei has declared a ""Grade 1 public health emergency"", the most severe level - that means the response is led centrally from Beijing by the State Council, the government's cabinet. A hospital under construction in Wuhan Beijing has tried to allay concerns by sending more healthcare professionals, and constructing two hospitals from scratch providing more than 2,000 extra beds. Reports from state-run media say there are 405 medical staff from Shanghai and 205 staff from Guangdong travelling to the region. They're also expanding existing capacity in other facilities. The government has also assigned 21 centres in Hubei province to help co-ordinate treatment, and train local health officials. Professor Shenglan Tang, an expert in global health at Duke University in the US, says there are concerns that rural areas will struggle to cope. ""I'm confident that the health centres in Wuhan will be able to handle the outbreak, but I am a bit worried about Hubei province - rural workers have gone back home from Wuhan to celebrate Chinese New Year, and in these areas the hospital capacity is weak,"" said Professor Tang. Despite resilient rhetoric from the government, people are expressing concern about the city's ability to cope with the outbreak. The BBC spoke to a number of people in the region who said that getting test results was taking longer than officials are claiming. We were told that in some cases medical staff lack equipment and doctors are overstretched. There are also claims that local government, which was apparently made aware of the outbreak in mid-December, ignored initial warning signs. We haven't been able to independently verify these claims. The government has called for people to report poor medical responses to an online ""inspection"" platform. The regional government has issued a statement appealing for donations to help with the response, including asking for facemasks.

Laurence Fox apologises to Sikhs over WW1 comments,"Laurence Fox has apologised for comments he made about the inclusion of a Sikh soldier in a World War One film. The actor had previously referred to ""the oddness in the casting"" of a Sikh soldier in Sir Sam Mendes' movie 1917. ""Fellow humans who are Sikhs, I am as moved by the sacrifices your relatives made as I am by the loss of all those who die in war, whatever creed or colour,""Fox tweeted,external. ""Please accept my apology for being clumsy in the way I expressed myself."" His original comments attracted widespread criticism and historians drew attention to the contribution of Sikhs in the British Army during World War One. About130,000 Sikh men took part in the war, making up 20% of the British Indian Army, according to the WW1 Sikh Memorial Fund. Allow Twitter content?

Cases of China virus 'highly likely' in UK,"A health team is available at Heathrow Airport for travellers from China Officials are attempting to trace as many as 2,000 visitors who have flown in to the UK from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where thenew strain of coronavirusfirst broke out. Tests on 14 people in the UK have come back negative, Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said. Prof Whitty said there is a ""fair chance"" Britain will see cases of the new virus, which has killed 26 people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the risk to the public ""remains low"". It came after Public Health England said that, while cases of the new virus in the UK are ""highly likely"", most of those affected abroad by the virus were making a good recovery. Globally,there are more than800 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 26 people in China. Mr Hancock chaired a meeting of the UK government's emergency committee, Cobra, to discuss the outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said there were still no confirmed cases in the country. Prof Whitty said further tests on a number of other patients are still being processed but that he did not want to provide exact numbers. ""This is a marathon not a sprint,"" he said, adding that clinicians are now implementing a system to deal with the new virus that can be scaled up if needed. Prof Whitty said attempts are being made to trace those who have arrived in the UK from Wuhan - the Chinese city where the virus first broke out - over the last 14 days. It is understood that the aim is to eliminate those who have flown on to other destinations and to check on the health of others in case they might have the coronavirus. It is believed that this could involve as many as 2,000 people. Wuhan woman who 'cheated' checks found in France China battles to prevent New Year virus spike Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Meanwhile the Chinese Ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, has said his country's government ""is very much determined to curb"" the virus. ""We think we can get it under control,"" he added ahead of a No 10 reception for the Chinese New Year. All the people who have been tested in the UK had visited Wuhan in the last two weeks. In Scotland, where five people were tested,an incident team has been set upto deal with the health threat. Four of the patients were believed to be Chinese, Downing Street said. Those tested in the UK includedone person in Wales,who was given the all clear last week, andone man in Belfast. One of those cleared was British artist Michael Hope, 45, whospent two days in quarantine this weekafter developing ""a nasty cough"" on returning to Newcastle from Wuhan. Prof Cosford told the BBC ""we will not be surprised"" if people return from China to the UK with the infection, which can cause lung problems such as pneumonia. ""I think it's highly likely that we will have cases in the UK - and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one."" There are no planes or trains in or out of Wuhan, where people are being treated He added: ""These are early days yet with this virus. The vast majority of people who are infected do seem to be getting better. ""The people who have done particularly badly, and sadly died, they seem to be people who have other conditions that might make them more likely to suffer badly with this virus."" The Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan and the UK is monitoring direct flights arriving from China as a precaution. Passengers are receiving leaflets and advice on what to do if they fall ill, and a health team is available at Heathrow Airport to check for symptoms. GPs have been told to isolate any patients showing symptoms and avoid physically examining them if they have recently travelled from Wuhan. Public Health England is advising anyone who has been to Wuhan within the past 14 days and has developed respiratory symptoms to phone NHS 111. Those symptoms include a cough, a sneeze, shortness of breath, or a fever. People who are concerned should phone ahead before going to any medical facility and mention their recent travel to the city. PHE also advises anyone travelling to China to maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene, and avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. The agency is currently not advising people to wear face masks. China has widened a lockdown in Hubei province - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. The travel restrictions will affect at least 20 million people across 10 cities. The lockdown comes on the eve of Lunar New Year - one of the most important dates in the Chinese calendar, when millions of people travel home. The virus has spread across China and to countries as far as Japan, Thailand and the US. This video can not be played What's life like in quarantined Wuhan? The World Health Organization has not classed the virus as an ""international emergency"", partly because of the low number of overseas cases, but said it ""may yet become one"". Peter Piot, professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said ""data to date suggests that this virus may have a lower mortality than Sars"", which killed hundreds in the early 2000s. Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The first human cases were identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. There have not been any other suspected human cases reported prior to this. Authorities have said it originated in a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". The market has been shut down since the beginning of the year. The incubation period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear after catching the infection) is days, rather than weeks. At the moment, there is no vaccine that can protect people against it, but researchers are looking to develop one. Your questions:You asked, we answered The story explained:How worried should we be?

Brexit: EU leaders sign UK withdrawal deal,"A historic moment for the EU: Signing off on the UK's exit The heads of the European Commission and Council - Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel - have signed the Withdrawal Agreement, ahead of the UK's exit from the EU on 31 January. The Queen approved it on Thursday, and next Wednesday the European Parliament is expected to vote for it too. The UK has agreed to abide by EU rules during a transition period until the end of the year. By 2021 the UK aims to have agreed a deal on future ties. Brexit ends 46 years in the EU club. After the document was signed in Brussels it was taken to Downing Street by EU and UK officials, for signing by UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, due later on Friday. The agreement will then travel back to Brussels, and a copy of it will remain in London. Next week's European Parliament vote is seen as all but a formality, after it was backed by the parliament's constitutional affairs committee on Thursday. What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Chancellor reassures firms on post-Brexit trade EU reveals clues ahead of post-Brexit talks with UK Mrs von der Leyen and other senior EU figures are sceptical about the UK government's plan to negotiate a comprehensive deal on future relations before the end of 2020.

Dunn family 'to continue fight' for extradition,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Harry Dunn's mother said the family's ""determination was stronger than ever"" to bring the woman charged with causing his death back the UK. The Dunn family met their MP Andrea Leadsom to discuss what the government would do following the US decision to refuse Anne Sacoolas' extradition. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash on his motorbike outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire in August. Charlotte Charles said: ""She has to come back, it's the right thing to do."" This video can not be played Charlotte Charles: ""She has to come back, it's the only right thing to do."" Speaking after meeting Mrs Leadsom in Towcester, Mrs Charles said: ""Our determination is probably stronger now than ever, if that's possible. ""We very much feel supported by her and the government."" Harry Dunn's father Tim Dunn described the meeting with Mrs Leadson as ""promising"". He said: ""I feel like she's behind us, I really do."" Tim Dunn spoke outside South Northamptonshire Council's office in Towcester Mrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer who worked at the base, left the country under diplomatic immunity following the crash. Extradition proceedings were launched earlier this month. The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeoturned down the extradition requestin an email to the UK Government on Thursday evening. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mrs Leadsom, who is also the Business Secretary, said ""it will take some time to consider what the government's next steps should be"" but it was ""determined to see justice done for Harry"". She said: ""There is no way that diplomatic immunity was to be used to leave a grieving family behind who are absolutely heartbroken."" US rejects Harry Dunn death extradition request Harry Dunn's friends protest outside RAF base US woman to be charged over Harry Dunn crash death The prime minister's spokesman earlier said the government would ""carefully consider"" what future action could be taken and was ""urgently considering"" options. He added the Crown Prosecution Service was considering the legal position. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had told the US Ambassador the government was ""disappointed"" about the decision and that the UK ""would have acted differently"" had the crash occurred in the US and involved a UK diplomat. ""We feel this amounts to a denial of justice and we believe Anne Sacoolas should return to the UK,"" he said.

Has China learned lessons?,"China was accused of covering-up the Sars epidemic In March 2003 it became clear a mysterious and previously unknown disease was starting to spread around the world. Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (Sars) went on to infect more than 8,000 people and kill almost 800. Many of those it infected, including doctors, went from having flu-like symptoms to severe pneumonia within days. The virus spread to 26 countries and China was criticised by the UN's global health body for concealing the scale of the outbreak. Now, 17 years later, the spread of a new deadly coronavirus is reviving memories of Sars and putting global scrutiny back on to the Chinese government. China has responded with tough measures, including effectively quarantining millions of residents in cities. But has its response gone far enough? And what lessons did it learn from the deadly Sars outbreak in 2003? Sars posed a huge challenge to China both as a public health crisis and a political one. The World Health Organization (WHO) was first alerted to reports of severe and unusual cases of pneumonia in the country's south in February 2003. Local officials said more than 300 people had become sick. Despite initial openness, other local government officials appeared to play down the risk or suggest the mystery threat was contained. Analysts who studied the Chinese response said the issue soon disappeared from the spotlight. Investigations later showed the first infections appeared in Guangdong Province in November 2002, but it took months for the scale of China's Sars crisis to be exposed. Physician Jiang Yanyong alerted the international media in April that the Chinese government was drastically understating the Sars threat. Dozens died in the Toronto area - with Canada becoming one of the worst- hit nations Advice was circulated to hospitals and the director of the Chinese Centre for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) even issued an unprecedented apology over the spread. ""Our medical departments and mass media suffered from poor co-ordination,"" Li Liming told a news conference. Combating Sars was complicated because of uncertainties about how it was spreading. The WHO issued its first global alert on 12 March 2003 after a patient hospitalised in Hanoi, Vietnam led to handfuls of medical staff becoming sick. Hong Kong's Department of Health also confirmed outbreaks of respiratory illness among its hospital workers. ""This was the first time a coronavirus had come to the attention as a pathogen that could spread around the world like this,"" Prof David Heymann, who led the WHO's infectious disease unit at the time of Sars, told the BBC. ""So in the beginning it wasn't known what it was and nobody really looked for coronaviruses such as they are doing now."" Prof Heymann told the BBC that Chinese authorities appeared to have been much more proactive with the new outbreak, including providing the WHO with information on a regular basis. This week, the WHO's director general praised China's response. The lack of transparency over Sars hurt China's standing on the international stage and caused its economic growth to slow. Health experts, including Prof Heymann, stress transparency as a key factor in preventing the spread of viruses, especially unknown ones. Once proper control measures and infection prevention were implemented, Sars was contained within months. This was aided by public health information being shared by the WHO and local governments wherever Sars was a concern. Hong Kong was one of the major hotspots for the virus. People there began to change their routines, with surgical masks becoming the norm in public. Surfaces in public areas with high risks of transmission, like lift buttons, were cleaned hourly and every day the local news carried updated tolls of those infected killed by the virus. Helier Cheung, a BBC journalist who grew up in Hong Kong, remembers she and classmates having their temperatures taken daily. Classes were suspended for several days - right in the run-up to exams - and television adverts reminded the public to wash their hands and bleach surfaces. The spread of Sars was traced to an infected doctor at Hong Kong's Metropole Hotel Her experience contrasts with that of another BBC employee who was working at a university in mainland China at the time of Sars. She remembers relying heavily on rumours and access to foreign news outlets when little official information was available. She also remembers misinformation spreading - with bowls of vinegar set on burners in classrooms in the mistaken belief they could disinfect the air. ""I do remember being worried, but very poorly informed,"" she said. Information and clarity were sparse even when students were quarantined and her campus later locked down. Hong Kong's Amoy Gardens became notorious when hundreds of residents became sick In recent days, Chinese officials have tried to show they are being much more open this time. President Xi Jinping described combating the virus as ""extremely critical"" and there have been public warnings against any attempts at cover-ups. ""Anyone who puts the face of politicians before the interests of the people will be the sinner of a millennium to the party and the people,"" a commentary on a Central Political and Legal Affairs Commission account said on Tuesday. ""Anyone who deliberately delays and hides the reporting of [virus] cases out of his or her own self-interest will be nailed on the pillar of shame for eternity."" However, the Chinese government has strengthened its control over the flow of information since the time of Sars. Some international scientists have estimated the true number of people impacted by the new coronavirus is far higher than has been publicly confirmed. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute in London, told the BBC he became aware of rumours circulating about a new virus in Wuhan several weeks ago - well before the first cases were confirmed on 31 December. Local officials may have been very nervous to be the ones to raise the alarm, he said. ""President Xi Jinping pays a lot more attention to the international image of China than his predecessors, and he has concentrated much more power than his predecessors,"" Mr Tsang said. ""Therefore anything that could potentially have a negative impact on the international image of China becomes sensitive."" Your questions:You asked, we answered The story explained:How worried should we be? Wuhan profiled:The city now in lockdown In detail:Follow all our coverage here Chinese social media is also highly regulated and the New York Times reported that the hashtag #WuhanSARS was blocked locally. Police even questioned eight people about spreading ""rumours"" of the virus online, according to reports. The Sars outbreak was a catalyst for change in China's medical system, with health spending rising afterwards. Health officials used to report infectious diseases by filling in cards by hand and then posting or faxing them to a central office. After Sars, the government created a centralised online system that links up clinics and hospitals across the country and lets them report cases in real time. The global epidemic was eventually contained within months ""China... has developed excellent disease surveillance systems since Sars, including real-time emergency department surveillance for severe acute respiratory infections, so this will help with rapid identification of new cases,"" Raina MacIntyre, head of the biosecurity research programme at Sydney's Kirby Institute, told Reuters. 'Increased likelihood' of new virus reaching UK ""Spreading at alarming rate"" - one doctor in Wuhan speaks Gabriel Leung, chair of public health at Hong Kong University, said the timescale of ""recognising, characterising, releasing and reporting information"" had been vastly improved from the time of the Sars outbreak. ""What did take months during the time of Sars is now compressed into a matter of weeks or days,"" he told a news conference earlier this week. But not all of the public health reforms suggested after Sars have been implemented. This video can not be played Fears over new coronavirus in China trigger face mask shortgae In 2006, Zhong Nanshan, the doctor who identified Sars and who is leading the Chinese government's efforts in Wuhan, said it was crucial to clean up China's wildlife markets, which were ""poorly managed and insanitary"" and ""a dangerous source of possible new infections"". But reports from Wuhan suggest inter-species transmission is also at the centre of the new outbreak. A market in Wuhan, which was shuttered the day after the first cases were confirmed, is thought to have sold animals including rats, live wolf pups and civets, the last of which have been linked with previous pandemics in the past. Typically, traditional use in local delicacies or medicines has hindered efforts to clean-up the animal trade. But with a market again identified as a source of an outbreak, even official media are mobilising appeals against the wildlife trade in response. Propaganda posts telling people #SupportBanningWildAnimalMarkets have been widely shared on Chinese social media. Whether the radical measures implemented by China, going beyond even WHO recommendations, are enough to avoid a repeat of Sars remains to be seen. Dr W Ian Lipkin, a US-based epidemiologist who worked on Sars, is among the experts who have cast doubt on whether the travel restrictions from cities, including Wuhan, will be enough to stop the global spread.

Cases of virus 'highly likely' in UK,"A health team is available at Heathrow Airport for travellers from China Officials are attempting to trace as many as 2,000 visitors who have flown in to the UK from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where thenew strain of coronavirusfirst broke out. Tests on 14 people in the UK have come back negative, Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said. Prof Whitty said there is a ""fair chance"" Britain will see cases of the new virus, which has killed 26 people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the risk to the public ""remains low"". It came after Public Health England said that, while cases of the new virus in the UK are ""highly likely"", most of those affected abroad by the virus were making a good recovery. Globally,there are more than800 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 26 people in China. Mr Hancock chaired a meeting of the UK government's emergency committee, Cobra, to discuss the outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said there were still no confirmed cases in the country. Prof Whitty said further tests on a number of other patients are still being processed but that he did not want to provide exact numbers. ""This is a marathon not a sprint,"" he said, adding that clinicians are now implementing a system to deal with the new virus that can be scaled up if needed. Prof Whitty said attempts are being made to trace those who have arrived in the UK from Wuhan - the Chinese city where the virus first broke out - over the last 14 days. It is understood that the aim is to eliminate those who have flown on to other destinations and to check on the health of others in case they might have the coronavirus. It is believed that this could involve as many as 2,000 people. Wuhan woman who 'cheated' checks found in France China battles to prevent New Year virus spike Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Meanwhile the Chinese Ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, has said his country's government ""is very much determined to curb"" the virus. ""We think we can get it under control,"" he added ahead of a No 10 reception for the Chinese New Year. All the people who have been tested in the UK had visited Wuhan in the last two weeks. In Scotland, where five people were tested,an incident team has been set upto deal with the health threat. Four of the patients were believed to be Chinese, Downing Street said. Those tested in the UK includedone person in Wales,who was given the all clear last week, andone man in Belfast. One of those cleared was British artist Michael Hope, 45, whospent two days in quarantine this weekafter developing ""a nasty cough"" on returning to Newcastle from Wuhan. Prof Cosford told the BBC ""we will not be surprised"" if people return from China to the UK with the infection, which can cause lung problems such as pneumonia. ""I think it's highly likely that we will have cases in the UK - and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one."" There are no planes or trains in or out of Wuhan, where people are being treated He added: ""These are early days yet with this virus. The vast majority of people who are infected do seem to be getting better. ""The people who have done particularly badly, and sadly died, they seem to be people who have other conditions that might make them more likely to suffer badly with this virus."" The Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan and the UK is monitoring direct flights arriving from China as a precaution. Passengers are receiving leaflets and advice on what to do if they fall ill, and a health team is available at Heathrow Airport to check for symptoms. GPs have been told to isolate any patients showing symptoms and avoid physically examining them if they have recently travelled from Wuhan. Public Health England is advising anyone who has been to Wuhan within the past 14 days and has developed respiratory symptoms to phone NHS 111. Those symptoms include a cough, a sneeze, shortness of breath, or a fever. People who are concerned should phone ahead before going to any medical facility and mention their recent travel to the city. PHE also advises anyone travelling to China to maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene, and avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. The agency is currently not advising people to wear face masks. China has widened a lockdown in Hubei province - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. The travel restrictions will affect at least 20 million people across 10 cities. The lockdown comes on the eve of Lunar New Year - one of the most important dates in the Chinese calendar, when millions of people travel home. The virus has spread across China and to countries as far as Japan, Thailand and the US. This video can not be played What's life like in quarantined Wuhan? The World Health Organization has not classed the virus as an ""international emergency"", partly because of the low number of overseas cases, but said it ""may yet become one"". Peter Piot, professor of global health and director of the London School of Hygiene & Tropical Medicine, said ""data to date suggests that this virus may have a lower mortality than Sars"", which killed hundreds in the early 2000s. Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold. This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus The first human cases were identified in the Chinese city of Wuhan in December 2019. There have not been any other suspected human cases reported prior to this. Authorities have said it originated in a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". The market has been shut down since the beginning of the year. The incubation period (how long it takes for symptoms to appear after catching the infection) is days, rather than weeks. At the moment, there is no vaccine that can protect people against it, but researchers are looking to develop one. Your questions:You asked, we answered The story explained:How worried should we be?

Harry Dunn death extradition refusal 'wrong',"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton Harry Dunn's mother said the family's ""determination was stronger than ever"" to bring the woman charged with causing his death back the UK. The Dunn family met their MP Andrea Leadsom to discuss what the government would do following the US decision to refuse Anne Sacoolas' extradition. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash on his motorbike outside RAF Croughton in Northamptonshire in August. Charlotte Charles said: ""She has to come back, it's the right thing to do."" This video can not be played Charlotte Charles: ""She has to come back, it's the only right thing to do."" Speaking after meeting Mrs Leadsom in Towcester, Mrs Charles said: ""Our determination is probably stronger now than ever, if that's possible. ""We very much feel supported by her and the government."" Harry Dunn's father Tim Dunn described the meeting with Mrs Leadson as ""promising"". He said: ""I feel like she's behind us, I really do."" Tim Dunn spoke outside South Northamptonshire Council's office in Towcester Mrs Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer who worked at the base, left the country under diplomatic immunity following the crash. Extradition proceedings were launched earlier this month. The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeoturned down the extradition requestin an email to the UK Government on Thursday evening. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mrs Leadsom, who is also the Business Secretary, said ""it will take some time to consider what the government's next steps should be"" but it was ""determined to see justice done for Harry"". She said: ""There is no way that diplomatic immunity was to be used to leave a grieving family behind who are absolutely heartbroken."" US rejects Harry Dunn death extradition request Harry Dunn's friends protest outside RAF base US woman to be charged over Harry Dunn crash death The prime minister's spokesman earlier said the government would ""carefully consider"" what future action could be taken and was ""urgently considering"" options. He added the Crown Prosecution Service was considering the legal position. Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he had told the US Ambassador the government was ""disappointed"" about the decision and that the UK ""would have acted differently"" had the crash occurred in the US and involved a UK diplomat.

Tesco to ditch plastic-wrap for multipack tins,"This video can not be played Tesco chief executive on getting rid of multi-wrap plastic use Tesco is removing plastic wrapping from its multipack tins in an effort to cut down on waste. The supermarket giant says it will remove 350 tonnes of plastic a year from the environment. Britain's biggest supermarket is working with the likes of Heinz and Green Giant to replace plastic-wrapped multipacks with multi-buy deals. Tesco said the move was the first of its kind by a major UK retailer. And environmental group Greenpeace welcomed the decision to get rid of what it called ""pointless plastic"". The changes start on 2 March when Tesco will stop ordering more plastic-wrapped multipacks. Some items will remain on the shelves as Tesco sells remaining stocks. Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing? The plastic packaging paradox More than 40% of Tesco customers buy tinned multipacks, with 183,000 sold across its stores every day. Multipacks of baked beans, tuna, tinned tomatoes and soup are among the most frequently-bought grocery items in the UK, it said. ""We are removing all unnecessary and non-recyclable plastic from Tesco,"" said Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis. Late last year Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose pledged to clear hard-to-recycle ""black plastics"" from shelves. ""While we know we have more to do, this initiative is good news for the environment,"" said Georgiana de Noronha, president of Kraft Heinz in Northern Europe. Supermarkets have come under fire from environmental campaigners for the increasing use of single-use plastic,which rose 2% in 2018to 903,000 tonnes, according to Greenpeace. ""It's great that Tesco are getting rid of multipack plastic packaging that's completely pointless and are also pressuring their branded suppliers like Heinz and Branston to do the same,"" said Fiona Nicholls, ocean plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK. She added: ""This is such an easy, common sense first step that all supermarkets should have done this long ago. We urge retailers to end the nonsense of double-plastic packaging on all products straight away, and be bolder by introducing reusable and refillable packaging."" The World Wide Fund for Nature also supported Tesco's move. ""We need to remove unnecessary single-use plastic wherever possible, to stop the contamination of the natural world,"" said Paula Chin, from the WWF. The top eight UK supermarkets produced 58.3 billion pieces of plastic packaging last year,according to a report last year by Greenpeace and the Environmental Investigation Agency,external. Tesco is not the only supermarket to look into scrapping plastic wrap around tinned goods. Waitrose has been trialling the removal of plastic wrap,externalon multipacks of some of its canned vegetables since last October, in a move it says will save 18 tonnes of plastic a year. Aldi is running a trial in 270 stores to replace the plastic wrapping on tuna multipack tins with a cardboard alternative. Sainsbury's says it has committed to halving the use of its plastic packaging by 2025. Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing?

'A fish jumped out the water and stabbed my neck',"Muhammad Idul was out fishing with a friend when a fish jumped out of the water An Indonesian teenager has described - for the first time - his terrifying swim to safety after a fish leapt out of the sea and speared him through the neck. Muhammad Idul revealed how the force of the needlefish impaling itself in his neck threw him from his boat and into the water, prompting a desperate swim to shore and a sprint to hospital some 90 minutes' drive away. The fact the 16-year-old is still alive, smiling and able to tell his tale is thanks to his quick-thinking friend, a bit of luck - and some very careful surgeons. The injury has turned Muhammad into a bit of a star, after pictures of the fish in his neck went viral and were shared around the globe. But, speaking exclusively to BBC Indonesian five days after the shocking accident, he says it was just meant to be a late-night fishing trip with a school friend, Sardi. ""Sardi's boat sailed off first, and I went later in another boat,"" he recalled. ""About 500 metres (a third of a mile) off the beach, Sardi turned on the flashlight. ""A needlefish suddenly jumped out of the water and stabbed my neck."" Muhammad fell off the boat into the dark water below. The fish's long, slender - and sharp - jaws pierced right through his neck, from just under his chin to the base of his skull. What's more, the fish was still thrashing, pushing the teenager around in the water as it tried to escape. Muhammad grabbed the fish and held it tight, hoping he could stop it making the injury worse. ""I asked Sardi to help - he stopped me from trying to remove the fish to prevent bleeding,"" he said. The boys somehow managed to swim back to the beach with Muhammad holding the 75cm-long fish clasped in his arms and still stuck in his neck. Muhammad's father Saharuddin rushed him to a hospital in Bau-bau, about an hour-and-a-half from their village in South Buton, South East Sulawesi. But while doctors there were able to cut the fish so just its head remained in his body, they could not remove the beak from Muhammad's neck because they did not have the right equipment. For that, they needed to travel further afield, to a provincial hospital in Makassar, the capital of South Sulawesi. Even at the bigger Wahidin Sudirohusodo Hospital, however, staff were stunned at what they had been presented with. Its director Khalid Saleh said it was the first case of its kind, and required five specialists to carefully remove what remained of the fish in an hour-long surgery. Five days later, Muhammad is keen to get home: his neck is bandaged, and it doesn't hurt any more. He still can't move it to the right, but he is smiling. He could have to wait a little longer, however. ""We're monitoring his condition. He might be discharged in a few days but he can't go back to his village yet because he needs more check-ups,"" Khalid Saleh explained. The incident has also not dampened Muhammad's love of fishing. ""I just need to be more careful next time. Needlefish can't tolerate light - that was why it jumped out of the water and stabbed me,"" he said.

"HS2 risks misjudged from the start, says watchdog","A proposed design for an HS2 train No-one took full account of how complex and risky the HS2 high-speed rail project was likely to be,the government spending watchdog has said,external. The Department for Transport (DfT) and HS2 Ltd did not allow for all uncertainties when estimating initial costs, the National Audit Office (NAO) said. In 2015, HS2 was due to cost Â£56bn. Earlier this week, however,a leaked government-commissioned reviewsuggested the total could reach Â£106bn. The findings of the independent review, conducted by former HS2 Ltd chair Doug Oakervee, have not yet been officially published. The government will use the report to inform its final decision on whether to give the go-ahead to the HS2 project, and has said a final decision on whether to continue with it will be made in February. In its progress update, the NAO said that the DfT and HS2 Ltd ""have not adequately managed risks to taxpayer money"". This led to the project being over budget and behind schedule, it added. ""Significant challenges to completing the programme and delivering value for taxpayers and shareholders remain,"" the NAO report said. The first phase of the project, between London and Birmingham, is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester expected to be completed by 2032-33. Despite concerns about the rail link, Europe's largest infrastructure project, work is not on hold and the project currently gets through about Â£250m a month. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: ""There are important lessons to be learned from HS2, not only for the Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd, but for other major infrastructure programmes. ""To ensure public trust, the Department and HS2 Ltd must be transparent and provide realistic assessments of costs and completion dates as the programme develops, recognising the many risks to the successful delivery of the railway that remain."" A DfT spokesperson said: ""The department has supported this review and is already acting on many of its recommendations. To ensure transparency around the project, we have worked closely with the NAO to provide information on the latest cost and schedule estimates for HS2. ""We recognise that there have been significant underestimations of both the cost and schedule of HS2 in the past, which is why we commissioned the Oakervee review to provide advice on whether and how to proceed with HS2."" Employers' organisation the CBI said that whatever the misgivings, the project should go ahead. Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief UK policy director, said: ""HS2 is an ambitious project and the National Audit Office's report usefully highlights the challenges of delivering large-scale infrastructure. But what is clear to the CBI, and business generally, is the colossal cost of not delivering HS2. ""If the government truly believes in levelling up the regions, especially the Midlands and the North, it should deliver HS2 in full. ""It is exactly the post-Brexit project the government should be championing."" This is a slap on the wrist for HS2 Ltd and the Department for Transport. When you consider the massive overspend on HS2, headlines about underestimating the scale of the project and not acknowledging associated risks are hardly surprising. As the government decides the fate of the project, there are a few interesting nuggets. The report paints a picture of a high speed line like no other in Europe. HS2 plans 18 trains per hour. Other lines in Europe typically run between two and six trains an hour. The incredibly high spec justifies the high price tag, supporters say. Critics say it's one reason why the project is flawed. The government's review of HS2 has looked at a series of options, like reducing the spec of HS2. But as this report acknowledges, civil servants have looked at ways of making the project more affordable before. In short, tinkering with aspects of this project, like reducing the very high speed of the trains, wouldn't save huge amounts of money. There is a stark contrast in its assessment of the two phases. Although it criticises the substantial overspend on phase one - London to Birmingham - the National Audit Office does now believe that the costings on that part of the project are ""robust"". Inevitably phase two - Birmingham to Manchester and Birmingham to Leeds - which is at a very early stage, is in a very different position. In fact phase two is at such an early stage that this report concludes that no assessment for the overall cost of HS2 can be made with any real certainty. We visited two vast construction sites at Curzon Street in Birmingham and in Solihull. When you see the scale and type of work underway, like moving a bridge over a motorway, then it is hard to imagine that the government will pull the plug on phase one. Given the scepticism of some figures within government and recent leaks in the media, the future of phase two is less certain.

US rejects Harry Dunn death extradition request,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash outside RAF Croughton The US has turned down an extradition request for a woman who is to be charged with causing the death of teenage motorcyclist Harry Dunn. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a crash in Northamptonshire in August which led to the suspect Anne Sacoolas, the wife of a US intelligence officer, leaving for the US under diplomatic immunity. Family spokesman Radd Seiger said they had taken the news ""in our stride"". The Home Office said the decision appeared ""to be a denial of justice"". Extradition proceedings were launched earlier this month. Speaking toBBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Seiger said the latest move had been ""factored it into our planning and strategy"". ""The reality is that this administration, which we say is behaving lawlessly and taking a wrecking ball to one of the greatest alliances in the world, they won't be around forever whereas that extradition request will be,"" he added. ""We will simply plot and plan for a reasonable administration to come in one day and to reverse this decision."" The US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo turned down the extradition request in an email to the UK Government on Thursday evening. Washington said granting the request would ""render the invocation of diplomatic immunity a practical nullity"". The family's constituency MP Andrea Leadsom is due to meet the US ambassador Woody Johnson in London later to discuss the case. Prime Minister Boris Johnson previously said the chance of Ms Sacoolas, who is to be charged with causing the death by dangerous driving, ever returning to the UK was very low. Anne Sacoolas pictured on her wedding day in 2003 Mr Seiger said ""no reason"" was given by Mr Pompeo in rejecting the extradition request. ""It's one of the darkest days in the history of this special relationship,"" he said. ""Boris Johnson wanted to be prime minister, he is now being tested severely. ""I expect him today to rise to that challenge and come and meet with me and the family and tell us what he's going to do about it."" Harry Dunn death extradition request made to US US woman to be charged over Harry Dunn crash death Harry Dunn's friends protest outside RAF base Mr Dunn died after his motorbike was in collision with a car owned by Mrs Sacoolas. The crash happened outside RAF Croughton where Mrs Sacoolas' husband Jonathan worked as an intelligence officer. The 42-year-old left the UK and returned to her native US, claiming diplomatic immunity. In a statement released on behalf of the suspect after she was charged in December, Mrs Sacoolas's lawyers said: ""Anne will not return voluntarily to the United Kingdom to face a potential jail sentence for what was a terrible but unintentional accident."" Harry Dunn's mother Charlotte Charles is expected to be react fully to the news on Friday The Home Office said it was ""disappointed in this decision which appears to be a denial of justice"". ""We are urgently considering our options,"" a spokeswoman added. A statement from the US State Department said: ""At the time the accident occurred, and for the duration of her stay in the UK, the US citizen driver in this case had immunity from criminal jurisdiction. ""If the United States were to grant the UK's extradition request, it would render the invocation of diplomatic immunity a practical nullity and would set an extraordinarily troubling precedent.""

Sonos boss apologises for software update plan,"The boss of Sonos apologised on Thursday for a decision to prevent older speakers from receiving software updates. In a statement, the company's chief executive Patrick Spence said the company would deliver updates to all products ""for as long as possible"". But the company did not retract its earlier decision. The plan has sparked outrage with customers since it was announced earlier this week. Some Sonos customers who spent thousands of pounds on their products voiced theiranger on social media. They attacked the company claiming it was trying to force them to invest in new products. In a letter posted on the company's website, Mr Spence said the company ""did not get [the announcement] right from the start."" ""Many of you have invested heavily in your Sonos systems, and we intend to honour that investment for as long as possible,"" wrote Mr Spence. Sonos said it will still offer fixes for bugs and security patches for older products. But the plan needed to be put in place because older hardware would not be able to support the new software. Owners who have systems that include both older and newer Sonos speakers will have to be set up two speaker groups to allow the correct updates to come through. Once a single speaker in a system can no longer receive new software it prevents the rest of the system from receiving updates. Without updates, these devices will eventually stop working. The change affects four models sold between 2006 and 2015, including the Play:5, Connect:Amp and Connect. Affected Sonos customers are being offered a 30% discount towards a new product if they recycle their old speakers.

'Increased' chance of virus in UK,"The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precautionary measure There is an ""increased likelihood"" of cases of the new coronavirus occurring in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Globally, there are more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 18 people in China. But there are no known cases in the UK, Mr Hancock said, which was ""well prepared"" to deal with an outbreak. Fourteen people in the UK have now been tested for the virus, Public Health England said. Five of them have tested negative for the virus, while nine are still awaiting results. Earlier, it emerged six people were being tested in hospitals in Scotland and Northern Ireland after showing symptoms. All the patients had been in Wuhan - the Chinese city where the new strain of the virus, which can cause lung disease such as pneumonia, first emerged - in the last 14 days. One man is being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast- he is thought to have been admitted with a high temperature. Add the Scottish government confirmed there werefive suspected cases in Scotland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the tests were ""purely precautionary"". It is likely to be several days before tests will confirm whether they have contracted coronavirus or not. China battles to prevent New Year virus spike How worried should we be? Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Wuhan - which has a population of 11 million people - has gone into lockdown, with authorities suspending planes and trains in and out of the city. The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precaution. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said that it was a ""rapidly developing situation and the number of deaths and the number of cases is likely to be higher than those that have been confirmed so far and I expect them to rise further"". He told MPs: ""The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from 'very low' to 'low' and has concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well prepared and well equipped to deal with them."" He added: ""The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus. ""The NHS is ready to respond appropriately to any cases that emerge."" This video can not be played British passenger Thomas Crosby describes journey from virus-hit Wuhan In response to the outbreak, the Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan. On Wednesday, Public Health England began carrying out enhanced monitoring of direct flights from China. Passengers are receiving advice on what to do if they fall ill, which Mr Hancock said was the most important part of the monitoring as it can take days after infection before a patient develops symptoms, so physical checks were considered less useful. He added: ""We are working closely with our counterparts in the devolved administrations and the public can be assured that the whole of the UK is always well prepared for these types of outbreaks. ""And we'll remain vigilant and keep our response under constant review in the light of emerging scientific evidence."" This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Authorities around the world have announced screening measures for passengers from China. Singapore, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam are the latest countries to have registered a confirmed case. Thailand has confirmed four cases of the virus - the most outside of China. The US, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have all reported one case each. The World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee is meeting on Thursday in Geneva to decide whether or not to declare a ""global emergency"". A global emergency is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound and has previously been used in response to swine flu, Zika virus and Ebola. All but one of the fatalities so far have been in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Most of the 17 victims were elderly and suffered from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's disease and diabetes. The lockdown comes as millions of Chinese people travel across the country for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold. Authorities have said it originated in a seafood market that ""conducted illegal transactions of wild animals"". The market has been shut down since the beginning of the year.

"HS2 risks not priced in at the start, say auditors","A proposed design for an HS2 train No-one took full account of how complex and risky the HS2 high-speed rail project was likely to be,the government spending watchdog has said,external. The Department for Transport (DfT) and HS2 Ltd did not allow for all uncertainties when estimating initial costs, the National Audit Office (NAO) said. In 2015, HS2 was due to cost Â£56bn. Earlier this week, however,a leaked government-commissioned reviewsuggested the total could reach Â£106bn. The findings of the independent review, conducted by former HS2 Ltd chair Doug Oakervee, have not yet been officially published. The government will use the report to inform its final decision on whether to give the go-ahead to the HS2 project, and has said a final decision on whether to continue with it will be made in February. In its progress update, the NAO said that the DfT and HS2 Ltd ""have not adequately managed risks to taxpayer money"". This led to the project being over budget and behind schedule, it added. ""Significant challenges to completing the programme and delivering value for taxpayers and shareholders remain,"" the NAO report said. The first phase of the project, between London and Birmingham, is due to open at the end of 2026, with the second phase to Leeds and Manchester expected to be completed by 2032-33. Despite concerns about the rail link, Europe's largest infrastructure project, work is not on hold and the project currently gets through about Â£250m a month. Gareth Davies, the head of the NAO, said: ""There are important lessons to be learned from HS2, not only for the Department for Transport and HS2 Ltd, but for other major infrastructure programmes. ""To ensure public trust, the Department and HS2 Ltd must be transparent and provide realistic assessments of costs and completion dates as the programme develops, recognising the many risks to the successful delivery of the railway that remain."" A DfT spokesperson said: ""The department has supported this review and is already acting on many of its recommendations. To ensure transparency around the project, we have worked closely with the NAO to provide information on the latest cost and schedule estimates for HS2. ""We recognise that there have been significant underestimations of both the cost and schedule of HS2 in the past, which is why we commissioned the Oakervee review to provide advice on whether and how to proceed with HS2."" Employers' organisation the CBI said that whatever the misgivings, the project should go ahead. Matthew Fell, the CBI's chief UK policy director, said: ""HS2 is an ambitious project and the National Audit Office's report usefully highlights the challenges of delivering large-scale infrastructure.

Tesco to ditch plastic-wrap for multipack tinsSupermarket giant says the change will remove 350 tonnes of plastic from the environment.Business,"This video can not be played Tesco chief executive on getting rid of multi-wrap plastic use Tesco is removing plastic wrapping from its multipack tins in an effort to cut down on waste. The supermarket giant says it will remove 350 tonnes of plastic a year from the environment. Britain's biggest supermarket is working with the likes of Heinz and Green Giant to replace plastic-wrapped multipacks with multi-buy deals. Tesco said the move was the first of its kind by a major UK retailer. And environmental group Greenpeace welcomed the decision to get rid of what it called ""pointless plastic"". The changes start on 2 March when Tesco will stop ordering more plastic-wrapped multipacks. Some items will remain on the shelves as Tesco sells remaining stocks. Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing? The plastic packaging paradox More than 40% of Tesco customers buy tinned multipacks, with 183,000 sold across its stores every day. Multipacks of baked beans, tuna, tinned tomatoes and soup are among the most frequently-bought grocery items in the UK, it said. ""We are removing all unnecessary and non-recyclable plastic from Tesco,"" said Tesco chief executive, Dave Lewis. Late last year Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda, Morrisons and Waitrose pledged to clear hard-to-recycle ""black plastics"" from shelves. ""While we know we have more to do, this initiative is good news for the environment,"" said Georgiana de Noronha, president of Kraft Heinz in Northern Europe. Supermarkets have come under fire from environmental campaigners for the increasing use of single-use plastic,which rose 2% in 2018to 903,000 tonnes, according to Greenpeace. ""It's great that Tesco are getting rid of multipack plastic packaging that's completely pointless and are also pressuring their branded suppliers like Heinz and Branston to do the same,"" said Fiona Nicholls, ocean plastics campaigner for Greenpeace UK. She added: ""This is such an easy, common sense first step that all supermarkets should have done this long ago. We urge retailers to end the nonsense of double-plastic packaging on all products straight away, and be bolder by introducing reusable and refillable packaging."" The World Wide Fund for Nature also supported Tesco's move. ""We need to remove unnecessary single-use plastic wherever possible, to stop the contamination of the natural world,"" said Paula Chin, from the WWF. The top eight UK supermarkets produced 58.3 billion pieces of plastic packaging last year,according to a report last year by Greenpeace and the Environmental Investigation Agency,external. Tesco is not the only supermarket to look into scrapping plastic wrap around tinned goods. Waitrose has been trialling the removal of plastic wrap,externalon multipacks of some of its canned vegetables since last October, in a move it says will save 18 tonnes of plastic a year. Aldi is running a trial in 270 stores to replace the plastic wrapping on tuna multipack tins with a cardboard alternative. Sainsbury's says it has committed to halving the use of its plastic packaging by 2025. Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing?

'Increased likelihood' of reaching UK,"The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precautionary measure There is an ""increased likelihood"" of cases of the new coronavirus occurring in the UK, Health Secretary Matt Hancock has said. Globally, there are more than 500 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 18 people in China. But there are no known cases in the UK, Mr Hancock said, which was ""well prepared"" to deal with an outbreak. Fourteen people in the UK have now been tested for the virus, Public Health England said. Five of them have tested negative for the virus, while nine are still awaiting results. Earlier, it emerged six people were being tested in hospitals in Scotland and Northern Ireland after showing symptoms. All the patients had been in Wuhan - the Chinese city where the new strain of the virus, which can cause lung disease such as pneumonia, first emerged - in the last 14 days. One man is being treated in the Royal Victoria Hospital in Belfast- he is thought to have been admitted with a high temperature. Add the Scottish government confirmed there werefive suspected cases in Scotland. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's spokesman said the tests were ""purely precautionary"". It is likely to be several days before tests will confirm whether they have contracted coronavirus or not. China battles to prevent New Year virus spike How worried should we be? Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Wuhan - which has a population of 11 million people - has gone into lockdown, with authorities suspending planes and trains in and out of the city. The UK is monitoring flights arriving from China as a precaution. In a statement to the House of Commons, Mr Hancock said that it was a ""rapidly developing situation and the number of deaths and the number of cases is likely to be higher than those that have been confirmed so far and I expect them to rise further"". He told MPs: ""The chief medical officer has revised the risk to the UK population from 'very low' to 'low' and has concluded that while there is an increased likelihood that cases may arise in this country, we are well prepared and well equipped to deal with them."" He added: ""The UK is one of the first countries to have developed a world-leading test for the new coronavirus. ""The NHS is ready to respond appropriately to any cases that emerge."" This video can not be played British passenger Thomas Crosby describes journey from virus-hit Wuhan In response to the outbreak, the Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan. On Wednesday, Public Health England began carrying out enhanced monitoring of direct flights from China. Passengers are receiving advice on what to do if they fall ill, which Mr Hancock said was the most important part of the monitoring as it can take days after infection before a patient develops symptoms, so physical checks were considered less useful. He added: ""We are working closely with our counterparts in the devolved administrations and the public can be assured that the whole of the UK is always well prepared for these types of outbreaks. ""And we'll remain vigilant and keep our response under constant review in the light of emerging scientific evidence."" This video can not be played The BBC's online health editor talks us through what we know about the virus Authorities around the world have announced screening measures for passengers from China. Singapore, Saudi Arabia and Vietnam are the latest countries to have registered a confirmed case. Thailand has confirmed four cases of the virus - the most outside of China. The US, Japan, Taiwan and South Korea have all reported one case each. The World Health Organization's (WHO) emergency committee is meeting on Thursday in Geneva to decide whether or not to declare a ""global emergency"". A global emergency is the highest level of alarm the WHO can sound and has previously been used in response to swine flu, Zika virus and Ebola. All but one of the fatalities so far have been in Hubei province, of which Wuhan is the capital. Most of the 17 victims were elderly and suffered from other chronic diseases including Parkinson's disease and diabetes. The lockdown comes as millions of Chinese people travel across the country for the upcoming Lunar New Year holiday. Currently known as 2019-nCoV, the virus is understood to be a new strain of coronavirus not previously identified in humans. The Sars (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome) virus that killed nearly 800 people globally in the early 2000s was also a coronavirus, as is the common cold.

Tests on 14 people in UK for coronavirus,"A health team is available at Heathrow Airport for travellers from China Officials are attempting to trace as many as 2,000 visitors who have flown in to the UK from the Chinese city of Wuhan, where thenew strain of coronavirusfirst broke out. Tests on 14 people in the UK have come back negative, Chief Medical Officer for England Chris Whitty said. Prof Whitty said there is a ""fair chance"" Britain will see cases of the new virus, which has killed 26 people. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the risk to the public ""remains low"". It came after Public Health England said that, while cases of the new virus in the UK are ""highly likely"", most of those affected abroad by the virus were making a good recovery. Globally,there are more than800 confirmed cases of the virus, which has killed 26 people in China. Mr Hancock chaired a meeting of the UK government's emergency committee, Cobra, to discuss the outbreak. A Downing Street spokesman said there were still no confirmed cases in the country. Prof Whitty said further tests on a number of other patients are still being processed but that he did not want to provide exact numbers. ""This is a marathon not a sprint,"" he said, adding that clinicians are now implementing a system to deal with the new virus that can be scaled up if needed. Prof Whitty said attempts are being made to trace those who have arrived in the UK from Wuhan - the Chinese city where the virus first broke out - over the last 14 days. It is understood that the aim is to eliminate those who have flown on to other destinations and to check on the health of others in case they might have the coronavirus. It is believed that this could involve as many as 2,000 people. Wuhan woman who 'cheated' checks found in France China battles to prevent New Year virus spike Can wearing masks stop the spread of viruses? Meanwhile the Chinese Ambassador to London, Liu Xiaoming, has said his country's government ""is very much determined to curb"" the virus. ""We think we can get it under control,"" he added ahead of a No 10 reception for the Chinese New Year. All the people who have been tested in the UK had visited Wuhan in the last two weeks. In Scotland, where five people were tested,an incident team has been set upto deal with the health threat. Four of the patients were believed to be Chinese, Downing Street said. Those tested in the UK includedone person in Wales,who was given the all clear last week, andone man in Belfast. One of those cleared was British artist Michael Hope, 45, whospent two days in quarantine this weekafter developing ""a nasty cough"" on returning to Newcastle from Wuhan. Prof Cosford told the BBC ""we will not be surprised"" if people return from China to the UK with the infection, which can cause lung problems such as pneumonia. ""I think it's highly likely that we will have cases in the UK - and of course every so often we do get new infections coming from the animal kingdom such as this one."" There are no planes or trains in or out of Wuhan, where people are being treated He added: ""These are early days yet with this virus. The vast majority of people who are infected do seem to be getting better. ""The people who have done particularly badly, and sadly died, they seem to be people who have other conditions that might make them more likely to suffer badly with this virus."" The Foreign Office has advised against all but essential travel to Wuhan and the UK is monitoring direct flights arriving from China as a precaution. Passengers are receiving leaflets and advice on what to do if they fall ill, and a health team is available at Heathrow Airport to check for symptoms. GPs have been told to isolate any patients showing symptoms and avoid physically examining them if they have recently travelled from Wuhan. Public Health England is advising anyone who has been to Wuhan within the past 14 days and has developed respiratory symptoms to phone NHS 111. Those symptoms include a cough, a sneeze, shortness of breath, or a fever. People who are concerned should phone ahead before going to any medical facility and mention their recent travel to the city. PHE also advises anyone travelling to China to maintain good hand, respiratory and personal hygiene, and avoid visiting animal and bird markets or people who are ill with respiratory symptoms. The agency is currently not advising people to wear face masks. China has widened a lockdown in Hubei province - the centre of the coronavirus outbreak. The travel restrictions will affect at least 20 million people across 10 cities.
