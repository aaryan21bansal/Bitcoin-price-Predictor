The 1975 bag top awards at the Brits,"This video can not be played Brit Awards 2019: the highlights The 1975 were the big winners at the Brits, taking home the awards for best British group and album of the year. The band said they were ""humbled"" to beat Anne-Marie, Arctic Monkeys and George Ezra to win the top prize. Singer Matty Healy also used the best group acceptance speech to address misogyny in the music industry. However, some viewers found out about the band's big night in advance, after a rogue TV advert announced their win ahead of the ceremony. It is unclear whether the band knew they had won in advance, and they did not acknowledge the mix-up during the awards show. Brit Awards 2019: The ceremony in pictures Brit Awards 2019: Full list of winners Beyonce and Jay-Z 'bow down' to Meghan Markle Other winners on the night included George Ezra and Jorja Smith, who won best male and female respectively. Ezra, who performed his number one single Shotgun at the event, said ""There's a not a day goes by where I don't count myself very lucky and this is the icing on the cake."" This video can not be played Brits 2019: On the red carpet Calvin Harris bagged his first two Brit awards - from a total of 16 career nominations - for music producer of the year and best single, for One Kiss with Dua Lipa. He said on stage at London's O2: ""I've been coming here for a few years and never had the opportunity to say anything. ""I want to thank anyone that's bought a tune, streamed a tune, come to a show, listened to the song by accident on the radio and gone 'what's this?'. ""It means a lot."" Dua Lipa and Calvin Harris took home the award for best single for One Kiss One Kiss, his collaboration with Dua Lipa, spent eight weeks at number one and was the best-selling single of 2018, with more than 1.5million combined sales, streams and downloads. The pair now have five Brit awards between them - Lipa won best female and British breakthrough act at last year's show. Pop star Anne-Marie was this year's Craig David: Leaving empty-handed after going into the ceremony with four nominations. The show was packed with performances from some of the biggest British artists, including The 1975, Jess Glynne and Jorja Smith. Hugh Jackman opened the show with the theme song to the hit film The Greatest Showman, with his performance featuring hundreds of dancers, acrobats and fire-breathing extras. Hugh Jackman performed a song from The Greatest Showman to open the awards The movie soundtrack, which was not nominated for any awards, was the UK's best-selling album of 2018. Little Mix won best video for Woman Like Me, which they performed on the night, and admitted they had ""absolutely no shame in asking fans to vote for it every day"". This year's international winners were noticeably absent, with best male and female winners Drake and Ariana Grande sending in pre-recorded acceptance speeches. Allow Twitter content?

The Carters - aka Beyonce and Jay Z - won international group, and restaged thefamous video for Ape****, which was shot in the Louvre, in their acceptance video. However, instead of posing in front of the Mona Lisa, the couple stood next to a portrait of the Duchess of Sussex. Pink accepted her award for outstanding contribution Pink took home the outstanding contribution to music award, before taking to the stage to perform a 10-minute medley of her greatest hits. After performing her new single, Walk Me Home, backstage, the star appeared in the roof of the O2 Arena, descending to the ground in a ring of fire, before playing Try in the middle of a screen of cascading water. Why Pink deserves her Brit award for outstanding achievement She said in her acceptance speech: ""To be considered in the same category as David Bowie and The Beatles and Sir Elton and Sir Paul and Fleetwood Mac is beyond anything I can comprehend. ""It's been an awesome journey from busking... to playing Wembley Stadium this summer. It's really exciting! ""Thank you for having me here. it's been an awesome 20 years. Here's to 20 more."" The 1975 emerged as the night's big winners, thanks to their their outrageous, ambitious and confessional third album A Brief Inquiry Into Online Relationships. Singer Matty Healy, who last year caused controversy by claiming misogyny ""no longer existed in rock and roll"", used the acceptance speech for best group to modify his comments. ""Male misogynist acts are examined for nuance and defended as traits of 'difficult' artists, [while] women and those who call them out are treated as hysterics who don't understand art,"" he said, quoting a 2015 article by The Guardian's Laura Snapes, which gained renewed attention afterallegations about US star Ryan Adamsemerged last week. The 1975 performing Sincerity is Scary Let's be honest, most of us have wondered whether award show winners get tipped off before the ceremony. Sometimes it seems painfully obvious: If you watched last week's Grammy Awards, you'll have seen Drake's name read out in the best rap song category - at which point a camera was conveniently positioned backstage to film the star, who had arrived, unannounced, to collect his award. Either the director was a clairvoyant, or someone had steamed open the envelope before the show. Tonight, digital channel UKTV Play confirmed what we've always suspected, by playing out a pre-taped advert for ""double Brit award winners"" The 1975, before the ceremony had even started. It's not clear whether the band had been made aware of what their marketing department knew -  but it shone an awkward spotlight on every tearful ""this is so unexpected"" speech we've seen this awards season. That embarrassing mix-up aside, this was one of the slickest, most engaging Brit Awards in recent memory. All the performances hit home, from George Ezra's warm-hearted rendition of Shotgun to Pink's death-defying greatest hits medley (notable as much for the songs it left out as the ones it included). The only real let-down was the lack of major global talent. Pink aside, all the international winners -  Ariana Grande, Drake and The Carters - were absent; their trophies handed out in a desultory video montage. Luckily for the Brits, this was more a case of bad luck than bad karma. Drake, who used his Grammy appearance to criticise the show's very existence, sent out positive vibes in his Brits' video message, wryly noting that, ""I very much look forward to attempting to win [best international male] many more times."" Maybe expanding the categories would help rectify the problem. The fact that there's still no award for best international album seems increasingly odd in a globalised streaming market. Change could easily be afoot. The Brits get a new chairman in 2020 and, with the Grammys still subject to an unofficial boycott by the likes of Kanye West and Childish Gambino, their first priority should be to lure that US talent to the UK.

Actor 'suspected of false attack report',"The actor is known for playing Jamal Lyon in Fox's drama Empire Chicago police say that US actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report. The Empire star had said he was subjected to a homophobic and racist physical attack by two men in January. Doubt was later cast on his account after US media reported that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack. Mr Smollett's lawyers said they would ""conduct a thorough investigation and mount an aggressive defence"". On Wednesday a police spokesman said felony criminal charges had been approved against the actor. Mr Smollett had been charged for ""disorderly conduct / filing a false police report"",the spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a tweet,external. ""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest."" Suspects held over attack on actor released Jussie Smollett performs after attack Lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, who are representing the actor, said in a statement: ""Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked."" They had previously said that Mr Smollett had ""been further victimised by claims... that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth."" Chicago police earlier released this CCTV image of two ""people of interest"" in the case Earlier on Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show the two brothers buying materials, including ski masks, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers. The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, left the US after the alleged attack and were arrested on their return last week. They were later released and are said to be co-operating with the investigation. One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire. Allow Twitter content?

Civilians evacuated from last IS enclave,"The UN had warned some 200 families were trapped Civilians have been evacuated from the last village in Syria still held by the Islamic State (IS) group. A convoy on Wednesday carried hundreds of men, women and children from Baghuz, near the Iraqi border. The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance have said they are waiting for their removal before launching an offensive against militants ""entrenched inside"". Those removed are being screened then taken to camps, the SDF say. An estimated 300 IS fighters are thought to be holed up inside a tiny pocket of land. There have been conflicting reports on how close the SDF is to ridding the enclave of IS. The US-led coalition fighting IS has said the ""most hardened"" fighters remain within Baghuz. The SDF has said the group are waiting for confirmation all civilians are out before storming Baghuz. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? Could a defeated IS rebound? How many IS foreign fighters are left? ""Our forces said from the start that they have two options: unconditional surrender or for the battle to continue until its end,"" SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali told the Reuters news agency. As many as 2,000 people may have left the enclave on Wednesday, Reuters reports. This video can not be played Is this the end for Islamic State? Another SDF spokesman, Adnan Afrin, told the AFP news agency that a number of IS fighters had been caught infiltrating the evacuations. ""Civilians and fighters from many nationalities have surrendered,"" he said, adding ""there was a group of IS fighters hidden among the civilians... but as far as we know, our colleagues have arrested them."" Some 20,000 are estimated to have fled the area in recent weeks, but in recent days departures had stalled. On Tuesday, the UN said that some 200 families were apparently being prevented from leaving by IS militants. Human rights chief Michelle Bachelet warned civilians within the area were trapped, subject to intense aerial bombardment from US-led coalition and allied Syrian forces alike. ""Civilians continue to be used as pawns by the various parties,"" Ms Bachelet said, calling for fighters to allow their safe passage. Shortly after, a convoy of about 50 lorries arrived on its outskirts to help get them out. On Wednesday at least 15 of those vehicles were reported as leaving by journalists at the scene. The thousands who have fled in recent weeks have been taken by the SDF to a makeshift camp for displaced people at al-Hol, in Hassakeh province. Among them are the wives and children of IS militants and many foreign nationals, including the British teenager Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she ran away from her home to join IS four years ago. Ms Begum, who has just given birth to a son, has said she wants to return to the UK. However,the government announced they have stripped her British citizenship- a decision her family have said they will try and contest. Separately, a woman who fled from Alabama to join the group has also been told she cannot return. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says Hoda Muthana, 24, has no ""legal basis"" to claim American citizenship or re-enter the country. Allow Twitter content?

The fall of Baghuz is significant - but experts have warned the group's ideological pull endures. At its height, five years ago, IS controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. It proclaimed the creation of a ""caliphate"", imposing its brutal rule on almost eight million people and generating billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. Even if fighters are defeated in Syria there are still significant numbers of IS-affiliated militants in pockets around the world. Experts warn that individuals inspired by the group will continue to carry out attacks despite the loss of their territory. Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

'Human cascade' on Hillsborough terrace,"Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans A Liverpool supporter pulled fans from a ""human cascade"" on the terrace at Hillsborough, he has told a court. Frederick Eccleston said the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace were ""ram-packed full of people"" while pens to the side were ""half-empty"". He told Preston Crown Court he recalled ""pulling people by their arms, their legs, their hair, their cheeks"". Former match commander David Duckenfield, 74, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans. Mr Eccleston said said he attended the FA Cup semi-final on April 15 1989 with his son and a family friend and watched the match from a corner overlooking the Leppings Lane end. The former nursing manager said that when the match was stopped he went on to the pitch to help and joined a police officer pulling fans from the central pens. He said: ""We both were pulling people out of that human cascade, it was like a waterfall with people tumbling on each other."" He told the court he had attended the stadium for Liverpool's 1988 semi-final, but on that occasion the tunnel to the central pens had been blocked off. ""There were a number of police officers and stewards standing together, they said 'no, this is full, these pens are full, you can't come down here', those were more or less their words,"" he told the court. The court also heard from former police constable Fiona Nicol, who was stationed on the perimeter track in front of the Leppings Lane terrace. Asked for her impression of former chief superintendent Mr Duckenfield, she said: ""I did believe him to be 'what he said went', and if he told us what was going to happen and that's how he wanted it to go, that's the way we were supposed to do it."" She told the court he had visited her and colleagues at Hammerton Road police station just weeks before the disaster and ""basically told us he was here to sort it out and make us toe the line"". The court heard that officers stationed in front of the terrace were told no-one was allowed access to the pitch perimeter track from the pens without consent of a senior officer, except to receive medical aid. But Ms Nicol said she opened the gate to pen three to allow fans to leave and enter a side pen after a man with a group of boy scouts asked if they could move. She said: ""I was frightened about opening the gate because I knew I wasn't meant to but I also could see these children were clearly upset and I thought I could walk with them back down to pen one and it wouldn't cause too much of a problem."" The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Earlier, former police inspector Robert McRobbie told the court he could recall no orders after Mr Duckenfield authorised a gate to be opened. Mr McRobbie, who was observing the operation in the ground's police control box, said Mr Duckenfield twice refused requests from an officer to open a gate to relieve a crush outside the ground before agreeing to a final ""frantic"" appeal. Part of the prosecution case against Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, is that he gave no thought to what would happen when people flooded through the gate and were drawn down a tunnel to pens that were already packed with spectators. He is on trial alongside Sheffield Wednesday's ex-club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, who denies a charge relating to the stadium's safety certificate and a health and safety charge. Under cross-examination by Mr Duckenfield's defence barrister, Ben Myers QC, Mr McRobbie agreed that in a statement he made in 2014 he said he was impressed with the standard of attention to detail from Mr Duckenfield when he briefed police at Hillsborough on the morning of the match. The trial continues. 'No discussion' over Hillsborough gate Officer 'feared fatal crush at turnstiles' Stadium gates opened after 'crush warning' Photographer 'told police to stop game' Hillsborough chief said 'gate was forced' Fan 'squeezed like toothpaste' in crush Duckenfield had 'little input' in plans Duckenfield 'wasn't experienced enough' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Bin collections disrupted across Halton as âworsening weatherâ continues Plans for new police station approved amid praise for design Police issue warning after Land Rover flips on its side Number of schools confirm closures due to snow and ice ALL Wirral train lines currently suspended due to bad weather Stars including Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench need help of Liverpool residents to speed up ban on trophy hunting imports in Parliament New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours': Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Alesha murder accused told 'pack of lies',"Alesha MacPhail was holidaying on the Isle of Bute where her body was found The 16-year-old boy accused of killing Alesha MacPhail told a ""pack of lies"", jurors have heard. Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC said there was a ""mountain of evidence"" against the boy, who denies abducting, raping and murdering Alesha last July on the Isle of Bute. In his closing speech at the High Court in Glasgow, Mr McSporran urged the jury to find the teenager guilty. The accused's QC, Brian McConnachie, said the boy should be acquitted. Mr McSporran told jurors that they had listened to ""one of the worst cases"" a jury has had to hear. He said the case would provoke ""revulsion"", but said these emotions could ""play no part in the process"". He said the court was dealing with an ""extraordinarily important matter"". During the trial, the court heard Alesha suffered 117 injuries and that she had been ""brutalised"". Her naked remains were discovered in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydro Hotel on Bute on 2 July. Mr McSporran said the case had involved ""deeply disturbing and distressing"" evidence as well as ""dreadful"" photos. The advocate depute said: ""Something terrible was done to that girl."" The teenager has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by Ms McLachlan, 18, who is the girlfriend of the victim's father. The court previously heard the accused claim he had sex with Ms McLachlan, who then planted his DNA - from a used condom - at the scene. The boy claimed that he later told police of going for cannabis that morning, so no-one would know about him and Ms McLachlan being together. But, Mr McSporran said: ""He spun a yarn, a pack of lies. He has also told a pack of lies in the witness box."" The boy had also claimed that Ms McLachlan may have been ""fantasizing"" about harming Alesha. Toni McLachlan denied accusations that she killed Alesha MacPhail The advocate depute said no-one else had come up with that suggestion. He added: ""He introduced that into evidence. It was his comment, his word."" The advocate depute claimed that what the boy had suggested was ""preposterous"". In her evidence, Toni McLachlan denied any part in the murder, insisting she ""loved"" Alesha. Mr McSporran told the jury the boy had ""more than enough time"" that morning to carry out the crime. He concluded by asking jurors to find the boy guilty and said there was a ""mountain of evidence"" against the teenager. In the closing speech for the defence, Mr McConnachie said: ""There will be people sitting out there who would return a verdict of guilty after reading the indictment, just by the nature of the charge - but that would be wrong."" The QC added it was not a case of the teenager versus Toni McLachlan. He said: ""This is not a whodunnit."" Mr McConnachie suggested that, if guilty, the boy had gone into the MacPhail family home at night, where there were four adults. ""He then chances upon the room where Alesha is and opens a squeaky door to gain entry, goes in and, whatever condition Alesha is in, he picks her up and took her out. ""A girl, according to Toni McLachlan, who would scream if a stranger came into the room."" The QC also accused the prosecution of ""trying too hard to make something out of nothing"". As the defence closed its case, a friend of Ms McLachlan said she had told her that Alesha was ""in a better place"". Lindsay Calderwood said the comment was made in the days after the child was found dead. The jury also heard from a neighbour who claimed Alesha's father had attacked his partner. Avril Lax said the abuse happened over a three-month period in the flat Robert MacPhail, 26, shared with his parents. She told the court she also raised her concerns with Robert's parents, Calum MacPhail and Angela King. The court previously heard that Robert MacPhail was on bail for a domestic charge. But in evidence Ms McLachlan said the matter concerned a heated argument the couple had after a funeral and did not turn physical. The trial continues. Boy, 16, denies killing six-year-old girl DNA found on Alesha 'matched accused' Alesha trial told of DNA Google search Alesha accused had 'fantasy' killing chat Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuries Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

Karl Lagerfeld's cat could be his heir,"Lagerfeld poses next to a painting of Choupette It has emerged that the late fashion designer Karl Lagerfeld has left some of his $200m (Â£153m) fortune to his cat. The German designer, who was the creative director for Chanel and Fendi, died in Paris on Tuesday. The designer became a devoted cat owner and lavished attention on his pet after Choupette was given to him in 2012. Lagerfeld told French magazine Numero last year,externalthat he had named the birman cat as one of the heirs of his estate. In the interview, he said Choupette was in his will, ""among others"".  But he added: ""Don't worry, there is enough for everyone."" Models of Lagerfeld holding Choupette were displayed at the opening of the first Karl Lagerfeld concept store in Germany Choupette already has a substantial fortune to her name, having earned $3m (Â£2.3m) doing adverts for a German car firm and a Japanese cosmetics brand with Lagerfeld. In a separate interview with Numero,external, Lagerfeld revealed he employed two maids to look after the pampered animal who, he said, has ""four different dishes prepared for her"" each day ""served in fabulous bowls"". He also made Choupette a social media sensation, with her own Twitter and Instagram accounts that have a combined following of about 200,000. A tribute to the designer was posted on the cat's Twitter account on Tuesday. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

She is also the hero of a book, Choupette: The Private Life of a High-Flying Fashion Cat, for which she was photographed in the arms of supermodel Linda Evangelista and snuggling with the model and actress Laetitia Casta. The book includes recipes for her favourite meals prepared by some of the best restaurants in Paris. One typically lavish meal is a mixture of king crab, smoked salmon and caviar. Choupette's help was sometimes sought by those trying to persuade Lagerfeld to adopt their ideas. French actress and animal rights activist Brigitte Bardot wrote her a letter in 2015 asking her to ""purr in the ear"" of her owner so he would ""stop using fur in his collections"". Chanel duly became the first major fashion house to go fur-free. Lagerfeld is not the only celebrity to want to make provision for their animals' welfare in their will.

Family syndicate wins 175m euro jackpot,"Staff at Reilly's Daybreak in Naul, where the winning ticket was sold, celebrated the family's big win A family syndicate from Dublin has come forward to claim Tuesday's EuroMillions jackpot, worth more than 175m euros (Â£152m). It is the biggest jackpot claimed by an Irish ticket holder in its history. The syndicate is from Naul in north County Dublin, close to the border with County Meath. A spokesperson for the winners, who is married to one of the syndicate members, said the family is ""very close"". ""This is unbelievable - it will take us some time to get our heads around this win and to organise ourselves,"" he said. ""This is a dream come true. ""We don't want this to change our lives. ""What is so exciting is that we will be able to share this money with children, grandchildren and extended family members."" One of the syndicate members realised their good fortune when she checked the winning ticket after Tuesday night's draw. She said: ""I heard on the RTÃ news that there was a win in Ireland and I caught the last three numbers. ""I checked the rest of the numbers online. ""I was numb! It took a bit of convincing everybody that we had won."" The family member put the winning ticket in an Argos catalogue and put it under her mattress for safe keeping. ""I didn't sleep a wink all night,"" she added. On Wednesday, the family deposited the winning ticket for safe keeping with the National Lottery and arrangements are now being made for the prize claim to be paid out in the next few weeks. The ticket was bought at Reilly's Daybreak in Naul. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I don't know how the people felt who won it but I was in total shock, just total shock,"" he told BBC News NI. Mr Reilly said the win had whipped up excitement in Naul. ""I've never seen a buzz or anything like this. ""The whole village - a small village in a rural county - it's just buzzing, it's just amazing,"" he said. National Lottery spokeswoman Miriam Donohoe told the BBC the win ""will be a huge shock to the ticket holder"". She said it was the 14th EuroMillions win in Ireland. The previous biggest Irish winner was Dolores McNamara from Limerick, who won â¬115m (Â£100m) in 2005. Dermot Griffin, the CEO of the National Lottery, said that it has been ""an incredibly lucky period for players on the island of Ireland"". In Januarya couple from Northern Ireland won a EuroMillions Â£115m jackpot. Frances and Patrick Connolly, who live in Moira, County Down, matched the winning numbers in the New Year's Day draw. It was the fourth biggest UK EuroMillions win and the biggest in Northern Ireland. The jackpot has been rolling over since the start of January this year, and will see the winner pick up a cheque for â¬175,475,380.

Sainsbury's-Asda merger in jeopardy,"Sainsbury's shares have dived 15% after the UK's competition watchdog cast doubt on its plan to buy Asda. Customers could see higher prices and less choice if the two grocers combined, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said. It said it could block the deal or force the sale of a large number of stores or even one of the brand names. However, it also said it was ""likely to be difficult"" for the chains to ""address the concerns"". Sainsbury's boss said the findings were ""outrageous"". In its provisional report on the proposed merger, the CMA also said the merger could lead to a ""poorer shopping experience"". Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group, said  it had found ""very significant competition concerns in a number of areas - they are to do with grocery shopping in supermarkets, grocery shopping online and the companies' petrol stations"". ""However, if one recognises that the competition concerns are quite broadly based... putting together a package of measures which addresses those concerns is likely to be complex and quite challenging,"" he said. Asda sales slow amid 'challenging' trade Supermarket mega-merger faces crunch decision Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts Business Live: Sainsbury's-Asda reaction But Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe described the CMA's analysis as ""fundamentally flawed"" and said the firm would be making ""very strong representations"" to it about its ""inaccuracy and lack of objectivity"". ""They have fundamentally moved the goalposts, changed the shape of the ball and chosen a different playing field,"" he told the BBC. ""This is totally outrageous."" Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter Supermarket bosses know that British competition regulators have always had a strong interest in the grocery market. There has been a string of inquiries over the last two decades, both into individual deals and the bigger question of how well the market serves consumer interests. So Sainsbury's board members would have been nervous when they proposed a takeover of Asda last year - but they did at least have the encouragement that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)  had approved a tie-up between Tesco and Booker just a few months earlier. Unfortunately for them, the light at the end of the tunnel turned out to be an oncoming train. The regulator has crushed Sainsbury's plans. There is no veto, but the strong language used, and the breadth of the problems found, suggest there is no way back. The firms will have a chance to respond to the CMA's provisional findings, before it publishes its final decision on 30 April. The watchdog said it had identified two potential remedies to the loss of competition: either blocking the merger entirely or forcing the sale of ""assets and operations"", including stores or even the Sainsbury's or Asda brands. However, it added that it ""currently considers that there is a significant risk that a divestiture will not be effective in this particular case"". The two chains would need to sell ""sufficient assets and operations to enable any purchaser to compete effectively as a national in-store grocery retailer"". It added that it may not be possible to achieve an effective solution to the loss of competition ""without also divesting one or other of the Asda or Sainsbury's brands, in addition to physical assets and operations"". The deal would create the UK's biggest supermarket chain,a business accounting for Â£1 in every Â£3 spent on groceries, with a 31.4% market share and 2,800 stores. The CMA's Mr McIntosh said: ""We have provisionally found that, should the two merge, shoppers could face higher prices, reduced quality and choice, and a poorer overall shopping experience across the UK. ""We also have concerns that prices could rise at a large number of their petrol stations."" However, in a joint statement, Sainsbury's and Asda said combining the two chains would create ""significant cost savings, which would allow us to lower prices"". ""Despite the savings being independently reviewed by two separate industry specialists, the CMA has chosen to discount them as benefits."" Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf said the CMA had ""basically kicked the Sainsbury-Asda merger into touch"". ""While the regulator left the door open for the supermarkets to sell off assets to complete the deal, it's clearly not keen on that solution. Sainsbury's and Asda would also have to find a suitable buyer for the assets on sale, one who is big enough to provide proper competition in the eyes of the regulator, he added. Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director for GlobalData, said the CMA's provisional findings had ""devastated any prospect of the merger going ahead"". ""The CMA has raised concerns about the tie-up in just about every conceivable way - on national and local grounds, on store and online competition concerns and on major stores, convenience stores and petrol stations.""

"'Human cascade' on Hillsborough terraceA Liverpool fan tells a court he pulled people from a ""human cascade"" in ""ram-packed"" central pens.","Match commander David Duckenfield denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans A Liverpool supporter pulled fans from a ""human cascade"" on the terrace at Hillsborough, he has told a court. Frederick Eccleston said the central pens of the Leppings Lane terrace were ""ram-packed full of people"" while pens to the side were ""half-empty"". He told Preston Crown Court he recalled ""pulling people by their arms, their legs, their hair, their cheeks"". Former match commander David Duckenfield, 74, denies the gross negligence manslaughter of 95 fans. Mr Eccleston said said he attended the FA Cup semi-final on April 15 1989 with his son and a family friend and watched the match from a corner overlooking the Leppings Lane end. The former nursing manager said that when the match was stopped he went on to the pitch to help and joined a police officer pulling fans from the central pens. He said: ""We both were pulling people out of that human cascade, it was like a waterfall with people tumbling on each other."" He told the court he had attended the stadium for Liverpool's 1988 semi-final, but on that occasion the tunnel to the central pens had been blocked off. ""There were a number of police officers and stewards standing together, they said 'no, this is full, these pens are full, you can't come down here', those were more or less their words,"" he told the court. The court also heard from former police constable Fiona Nicol, who was stationed on the perimeter track in front of the Leppings Lane terrace. Asked for her impression of former chief superintendent Mr Duckenfield, she said: ""I did believe him to be 'what he said went', and if he told us what was going to happen and that's how he wanted it to go, that's the way we were supposed to do it."" She told the court he had visited her and colleagues at Hammerton Road police station just weeks before the disaster and ""basically told us he was here to sort it out and make us toe the line"". The court heard that officers stationed in front of the terrace were told no-one was allowed access to the pitch perimeter track from the pens without consent of a senior officer, except to receive medical aid. But Ms Nicol said she opened the gate to pen three to allow fans to leave and enter a side pen after a man with a group of boy scouts asked if they could move. She said: ""I was frightened about opening the gate because I knew I wasn't meant to but I also could see these children were clearly upset and I thought I could walk with them back down to pen one and it wouldn't cause too much of a problem."" The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Earlier, former police inspector Robert McRobbie told the court he could recall no orders after Mr Duckenfield authorised a gate to be opened. Mr McRobbie, who was observing the operation in the ground's police control box, said Mr Duckenfield twice refused requests from an officer to open a gate to relieve a crush outside the ground before agreeing to a final ""frantic"" appeal. Part of the prosecution case against Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, is that he gave no thought to what would happen when people flooded through the gate and were drawn down a tunnel to pens that were already packed with spectators. He is on trial alongside Sheffield Wednesday's ex-club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, who denies a charge relating to the stadium's safety certificate and a health and safety charge. Under cross-examination by Mr Duckenfield's defence barrister, Ben Myers QC, Mr McRobbie agreed that in a statement he made in 2014 he said he was impressed with the standard of attention to detail from Mr Duckenfield when he briefed police at Hillsborough on the morning of the match. The trial continues. 'No discussion' over Hillsborough gate Officer 'feared fatal crush at turnstiles' Stadium gates opened after 'crush warning' Photographer 'told police to stop game' Hillsborough chief said 'gate was forced' Fan 'squeezed like toothpaste' in crush Duckenfield had 'little input' in plans Duckenfield 'wasn't experienced enough' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Bin collections disrupted across Halton as âworsening weatherâ continues Plans for new police station approved amid praise for design Police issue warning after Land Rover flips on its side Number of schools confirm closures due to snow and ice ALL Wirral train lines currently suspended due to bad weather Stars including Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench need help of Liverpool residents to speed up ban on trophy hunting imports in Parliament New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours': Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

The people who lost their lives in the Hillsborough disaster Earlier, former police inspector Robert McRobbie told the court he could recall no orders after Mr Duckenfield authorised a gate to be opened. Mr McRobbie, who was observing the operation in the ground's police control box, said Mr Duckenfield twice refused requests from an officer to open a gate to relieve a crush outside the ground before agreeing to a final ""frantic"" appeal. Part of the prosecution case against Mr Duckenfield, of Ferndown, Dorset, is that he gave no thought to what would happen when people flooded through the gate and were drawn down a tunnel to pens that were already packed with spectators. He is on trial alongside Sheffield Wednesday's ex-club secretary Graham Mackrell, 69, who denies a charge relating to the stadium's safety certificate and a health and safety charge. Under cross-examination by Mr Duckenfield's defence barrister, Ben Myers QC, Mr McRobbie agreed that in a statement he made in 2014 he said he was impressed with the standard of attention to detail from Mr Duckenfield when he briefed police at Hillsborough on the morning of the match. The trial continues. 'No discussion' over Hillsborough gate Officer 'feared fatal crush at turnstiles' Stadium gates opened after 'crush warning' Photographer 'told police to stop game' Hillsborough chief said 'gate was forced' Fan 'squeezed like toothpaste' in crush Duckenfield had 'little input' in plans Duckenfield 'wasn't experienced enough' HM Courts & Tribunals Service Bin collections disrupted across Halton as âworsening weatherâ continues Plans for new police station approved amid praise for design Police issue warning after Land Rover flips on its side Number of schools confirm closures due to snow and ice ALL Wirral train lines currently suspended due to bad weather Stars including Ricky Gervais and Dame Judi Dench need help of Liverpool residents to speed up ban on trophy hunting imports in Parliament New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours': Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Samsung reveals Galaxy Fold and S10 5G,"This video can not be played WATCH: First look at the Galaxy Fold and S10 models Samsung has unveiled a foldable smartphone - the Galaxy Fold - alongside a 5G Galaxy S10 handset and three other Galaxy S10 mobiles. The Fold will go on sale in just over two months time, earlier than many expected. The Galaxy S10 5G features the firm's biggest-ever non-folding phone display and promises faster data speeds when networks become available. The S10 line-up also includes the introduction of a lower-cost model. Samsung had previouslyacknowledged that the cost of its S9 range had contributedto ""lower-than-expected sales"". Samsung said the Galaxy Fold would open up to create a 7.3in (18.5cm) tablet-like display and would be able to run up to three apps at once. A demo showed off ""app continuity"" features by which the device transferred from one mode to another much more smoothly than had beenthe case with an earlier foldable phone - Royole's FlexPai. The Galaxy Fold offers three-app multitasking One example involved a Google Maps screen appearing on the Fold's smaller front display and then expanding to a larger view when the handset was opened following a one-second pause. Samsung added that Whatsapp, Facebook, YouTube and Microsoft Office would also be optimised to suit the new form-factor. It said that it had designed a new type of hidden hinge system that would withstand hundreds of thousands of folds and unfolds, and contained a battery on each side to extend its runtime.

In addition, the South Korean firm said the phone contained six cameras - three on the back, two on the inside and one on the front - to ensure it could take photos however it is held. A 4G version of the Galaxy Fold is set to go on sale on April 26 and will start at $1,980 (Â£1,515). A more expensive 5G edition was also promised. Samsung described it as being a ""luxury"" item. ""Fold is an experience that gives people who want a phone but also a larger screen with no compromise on the phone experience,"" commented Carolina Milanesi from the consultancy Creative Strategies. ""There's a lot of tech packed in there. And it makes sense to have kept it under $2,000 even if only for the psychological effect that has."" The phone comes in four colours But another market watcher still had doubts. ""In theory, foldables are hugely attractive: they pack a giant screen into a small design,"" commented Neil Mawston from the research firm Strategy Analytics. ""But in reality, consumers don't know exactly how they will work, and the applications for them are still fairly immature. ""You can look back at history at the dual-screen folder phones that ZTE and NEC and others release. They haven't sold particularly well mostly due to price and lack of distribution. ""So, there's good potential, but still a lot of uncertainty."" Samsung Galaxy Fold: The internet reacts Xiaomi reveals fold-in-three smartphone FlexPai: Hands on with the first bendy phone This video can not be played WATCH: Samsung shows off how its foldable phone works In the short demonstration we saw today, Samsung's use case of watching entertainment, playing games and app multi-tasking will make a lot of sense for a lot of people. This is a tremendously creative feat of engineering. Folding screens seem like a good idea. What won't work, however, is the price. I've been at many launch events like this, and normally the worst case scenario for the firms putting on the show is a lack of applause when the price is announced. Today we saw something worse - loud grumbles, even some laughter. $1,980? Simply too much. Also, I wonder about some other aspects of this phone we can't judge yet as we haven't had a chance to hold it. When Samsung's head of mobile placed it into his suit pocket on stage, it landed with all the grace of a cartoon anvil. So: possibly heavy, with two likely-hot batteries, and a huge price tag. Creative, sure? Practical? For me, Samsung has fallen short - but the effort should excite gadget fans who have been longing for something different for so long. I suspect this device will have people flocking to stores to see it up close, if not to actually purchase it. The S10 series is likely to remain Samsung's focus when it comes to sales for the foreseeable future. The S10 and S10+ will cost more than the phones they supersede - beginning at Â£799 and Â£899 respectively when they go on sale on 8 March. But the S10e means the Galaxy S range now starts at a lower price-point - Â£669 - albeit with lower specifications to match. The S10 5G is yet to be priced and only has a vague ""summer"" release planned. The S10 family comes in four different sizes, each with a choice of different storage ""Having a 5G variant is strategically important for Samsung as it gives them the jump on Apple and helps maintain the firm's brand strength and perceived technology leadership,"" commented Ben Wood, from the CCS Insight consultancy. ""It also gives the operators a tier-one brand for their 5G launches. ""But as far as consumers are concerned, unless you have a very good reason to buy a 5G phone this summer, one of the other three S10 handsets is probably a better investment, and will be viable for use for many years.""

The launch comes days before Mobile World Congress in Barcelona - a trade event where Samsung's rivals will unveil new handsets of their own. The overall smartphone market shrank in 2018, but Samsung's sales saw a particularly pronounced drop-off as Huawei and other Chinese manufacturers wooed away customers. All four versions of the S10 are distinguished from last year's models by embedding the front cameras within their displays. The phone's selfie camera is surrounded by its screen Samsung refers to this as being the Infinity O design, but it is more commonly referred to as the ""hole punch"". The move allows the phones to feature a thinner top bezel without having the kind of ""notch"" found on many rivals. It has, however, caused the firm to ditch the eye iris-scanner introduced in the S8. Samsung says a new ultrasonic fingerprint sensor placed under the screens of the three higher-end phones offers close to the same level of security, and is more convenient to use than a scanner formerly placed on phone backs. A graphic symbol tells users where they need to press to provide a fingerprint It is based ona technology unveiled by Qualcomm in 2015. All versions of the handset feature wireless charging and introduce the ability to wirelessly charge other compatible devices in turn. This mirrors a feature first offered byHuawei's Mate 20. Samsung demoed the facility at a dual London and San Francisco launch as a way to recharge a new pair of Bluetooth headphones without having to use a separate cable or power mat. The phone can be used to send power to the Galaxy Buds' charging case All four devices now feature a 10 megapixel selfie camera and introduce a 16MP ""ultra-wide"" rear version, which offers a slightly larger field-of-view than our eyes. The S10+ also has a second selfie camera to help it take depth readings. Other improvements include: the ability to detect 10 additional types of scene, so as to automatically adjust the colours and sharpness to suit the subject. These now include shoes, cats and clothing a ""super steady"" video mode that combines both digital and optical stabilisation to create the kind of smooth footage that would traditionally have required a gimbal or other add-on stabiliser an Instagram mode makes it easier to upload images to the social network directly from Samsung's camera app In addition, the S10+ and S10 5G now offer up to one terabyte of internal storage, which the firm says could appeal to those shooting lots of 4K video or storing many game files. The S10 phones can tell when they are taking photos of a shoe and will adjust the image to suit ""What's positive is that Samsung has moved away from software that nobody wants - like AR emojis and Samsung Cloud - and has gone back to its roots to deliver market-leading hardware,"" commented Ben Stanton, from market analysis firm Canalys. ""So for the premium part of the market, these are good phones. ""But my concern is that [they are still] not innovative enough to stop people from looking down to lower-price bands and being drawn into mid-range products from Chinese companies that are super-competitive.""

Galaxy S (2010): The original S-series handset was released days ahead of Apple's iPhone 4, and had a bigger 4in screen and microSD card slot in its favour. At that point, its main Android rival was the HTC Desire, and although Samsung's device was lighter, thinner, and had a more powerful graphics processor, some reviewerssaid it felt less ""premium,external"" in the hand than its competitor. Galaxy S2 (2011): The second-generation device saw its display grow to 4.3in, its rear camera increase in resolution to 8MP, and its processor move over to a dual-core design. It was praised for allowing owners to unlock it by pressing the home key, rather than having to press a button on top as before. And although some griped that it still felt plasticky, it sold in its millions - helping Samsung overtake Nokia as the world's bestselling mobile phone-maker. Galaxy S3 (2012): The third-generation model established a trend of including a bigger display but compensating for the growth by shrinking the size of the bezels. Its innovations included the ability to detect when the screen was being looked at, so as to avoid dimming the image. And it introduced S Voice, allowing users to command music to play and photos to be taken by speaking to it. Galaxy S4 (2013): Samsung added further touchless controls to the S4, letting owners scroll through text by making eye movements, and accept calls with a hand wave. A dual-camera feature also created photos that blended together the views from the front and rear lenses. Some critics found this all to be a bit gimmicky, and although the handset was a hit, there were reports that its sales fell short of Samsung's expectations. Galaxy S5 (2014): The S5 added a fingerprint scanner, which could be used to authenticate purchases via PayPal. It also introduced a black-and-white mode to help save battery life. But predictions that the firm would ditch Android for its in-house operating system Tizen proved to be inaccurate. Galaxy S6 (2015): The S-series split in two in 2015 with a premium-priced Edge version offering a screen that curved round one of its sides. A metal frame and glass back gave the handsets a more luxury feel, but they ditched water resistance and a microSD slot to make this possible. Galaxy S7 (2016): The seventh-generation phones looked pretty similar to their predecessors, but restored the ability to dunk them in water and slot in extra storage. Other improvements centred on the camera with better low-light and autofocus capabilities. Galaxy S8 (2017): The S8 and larger S8+ ditched the home button, took Samsung's logo off the front and added the virtual assistant Bixby. They also gained an iris scanner, which was billed as ""one of the safest ways"" to keep data private. After scandals involving exploding Note 7s and the arrest of the firm's vice-chairman, the launch helped return the firm to surer footing. Galaxy S9 (2018): The S9 and S9+ gained new camera features including a super-slow-motion video mode and a variable aperture - allowing owners to control how much light reached the sensor. AR emojis also allowed users to create animated cartoon characters that looked like them. But sales were lacklustre, and several months after it was unveiled Samsung acknowledged there had been ""resistance"" to its price.

Should Branson 'back off' from Venezuela?,"Richard Branson wants to raise $100m to buy aid for Venezuela To say Venezuela is in the middle of a political crisis would be an understatement. President NicolÃ¡s Maduro is locked in a power struggle with Juan GuaidÃ³, an opposition politician and the self-declared interim leader of the country. So what better way to make the situation less complicated than to add a spat between one of the world's richest people and the bass player from Pink Floyd? Yes... it's a pretty weird situation. Richard Branson, the British billionaire behind the Virgin group of companies, announced last week that he wanted to hold a concert to raise money for aid for Venezuela - inspired by similar benefits like Live Aid. The concert, Venezuela Aid Live, is happening on Friday in the Colombian border town of CÃºcuta, near a bridge that connects it to Venezuela (a bridge, incidentally, that President Maduro has blocked off with shipping containers to prevent US aid getting in). GuaidÃ³ sets up Venezuela aid confrontation Brazil joins Venezuela aid campaign Trump appeals to Venezuelan military Mr Branson says the concert will be free for people who can go in person, and live-streamed internationally for those who can't. The ultimate goal, Mr Branson says, is to raise tens of millions of dollars through donations, and to get aid through President Maduro's blockades - although how exactly he will do that remains unclear. ""Let the music inspire and mobilise you,"" he adds. ""United through music, we can make a huge difference and help bring an end to the needless suffering of millions."" In response, Pink Floyd co-founder and bassist Roger Waters released a video telling Mr Branson to ""back off"". In a two-minute video posted on Twitter, the musician says Mr Branson's ""Live-Aid-ish"" concert has ""nothing to do with humanitarian aid at all"". Allow Twitter content?

""It has to do with Richard Branson, and I'm not surprised by this, having bought the US saying: 'We have decided to take over Venezuela, for whatever our reasons may be,'"" Mr Waters says. ""But it has nothing to do with the needs of the Venezuelan people, it has nothing to do with democracy, it has nothing to do with freedom, and it has nothing to do with aid."" He adds that he has ""friends that are in Caracas"" who claim there is ""no civil war, no mayhem, no murder, no apparent dictatorship, no suppression of the press"". Mr Branson says it was a direct request from Mr GuaidÃ³ and opposition leader Leopoldo LÃ³pez. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a social media video posted last week, the billionaire says: ""Juan GuaidÃ³, who has been recognised as Venezuela's legitimate president by over 40 nations, and the EU, and Leopoldo LÃ³pez, an opposition leader currently under house arrest in Caracas, have asked us to help organise a beautiful concert, to help bring global attention to this unacceptable, and preventable, crisis."" Mr LÃ³pez has been under house arrest since 2014. The concert's organisers have released a list of 32 people they have invited to perform, which includes young Latin stars Rudy Mancuso, Juanes and Despacito singer Luis Fonsi, and Swedish DJ Alesso. A few celebrities have also confirmed on social media that they're taking part. Lele Pons, a Venezuelan-American singer and actress who was the most-looped individual on Vine before it shut down in 2016, and Venezuelan singer Danny Ocean have both released videos saying that they will perform.

According to Mr Branson, the goal is to raise $100m (Â£76.8m) in 60 days through donations on a website. An added goal, organisers say, is to ""reopen Venezuela's border so humanitarian aid can finally reach those who need it the most"". Which takes us neatly to our next point... This is a much trickier question - and the answer is: we don't know. For context: there is a bridge between CÃºcuta and Venezuela, with US military planes and lorries carrying tonnes of humanitarian aid parked on the Colombian side. So, the aid is there. Mr Maduro, however, has blocked the Venezuelan side with shipping containers. Lorries and planes carrying tonnes of humanitarian aid are being held at the border Mr Maduro says the aid is part of a plot by the US to invade the country, while his Vice President, Delcy Rodriguez, claims the US aid is contaminated with carcinogens to ""poison our populations"". The president has said that he's willing to take aid from his allies - Cuba and China, for example - but he has explicitly refused to accept anything from his opponents. Mr Branson, who explicitly blames Mr Maduro for the crisis, would most likely fall under this category. Mr GuaidÃ³ has said he plans to get aid into the country on 23 February, by urging Venezuelans to mobilise en masse and form ""caravans"" and a ""humanitarian avalanche"" at the borders. Even with this effort, it is uncertain whether or not aid will be allowed in. Please upgrade your browser to view this content. A spokesman for Mr Branson told BBC News that he was working with the Colombian entrepreneur Bruno Ocampo to organise the concert and sort out the logistics - while Mr Ocampo said their methods for getting aid over the border ""remain confidential, to prevent compromising our efforts"". He added: ""Our plans are well orchestrated and we will soon share more details."" This is where it all gets even stranger. As news of Mr Branson's concert came out, the embattled president responded by promising a concert of his own - dubbed ""Hands Off Venezuela"" - just 300 metres away, on the other side of Las Tienditas Bridge. The government hasn't announced an official line-up, but unconfirmed reports are claiming that about 150 artists will be taking part. Government supporters have been pictured erecting a stage on the other side of the bridge, just 300 metres away from Venezuela Aid Live This is the view of Mr Waters - and of humanitarian organisations like the United Nations and Red Cross. For example, United Nations spokesman Stephane Dujarric told reporters earlier this month that ""humanitarian action needs to be independent of political, military or other objectives"". He added: ""What is important is that humanitarian aid be depoliticised and that the needs of the people should lead in terms of when and how humanitarian aid is used."" Mr Waters referenced this when he told Mr Branson: ""Don't politicise aid. Leave the Venezuelan people alone to exercise their legal right to self-determination."" The bass player, however, waded into politically murky waters himself when he confidently proclaimed that there was ""no apparent dictatorship"" in Venezuela. A spokesperson for Mr Branson told BBC News that the primary aim of the concert was to ""raise awareness"" and to ""create a way for the global community to pledge their support"". They added: ""While the political context of the crisis is complex, this is purely a humanitarian effort that cannot replace the need for political and diplomatic solutions."" Live Aid was arguably the pinnacle of the benefit concert, eventually raising a reported $125m for victims of the famine in Ethiopia in 1985. In fact, it's so legendary that it was recreated in all its glory in the recent Freddie Mercury biopic Bohemian Rhapsody. And announcing that he was hosting Venezuela Aid Live, Mr Branson specifically says he was inspired by the Concert for Bangladesh in 1971, and by Live Aid, and how they both ""moved the world to action"". Richard Branson says he was partly inspired by Live Aid 1985 But behind the glamour of these concerts were troubling reports that the money raised hadn't quite ended up where it was supposed to. In the case of Concert for Bangladesh, the cash was tied up in a decade-long battle with tax officials in the US, while Live Aid was plagued by unconfirmed reports claiming the money it had raised was actually being used by Ethiopia's leader to amass weapons to crush opposition rebels. There have been similar concerns about subsequent benefit concerts. Huge, high-production gigs have often been followed up with questions about how the money was organised and distributed to the people that needed it. Benefits after the 2010 earthquake in Haiti, for example, are thought to have raised more than $9bn - but these fundraising efforts were latermarred by allegations of financial improprietyby musician Wyclef Jean's charity Yele Haiti. Years after the disaster, people in Haiti said their communities were far from being rebuilt. Venezuela Aid Live's organisers, however, tell BBC News that Live Aid and Concert for Bangladesh ""helped raise global awareness"" and ""mobilised unprecedented public support"". ""It is fair to say that in the decades since [these concerts], co-ordination in the humanitarian sector has improved enormously,"" they say, adding that the technology involved is better too. ""Based on the many lessons learned, the organising team is committed to an approach that is professional, unbureaucratic, efficient, transparent, and accountable."" All of the money raised will be transferred to the Colombian NGO Solidaridad Por Colombia, they add, which will hold it in a trust before working with aid experts to distribute it.

Lecturer's widow hits out at uni workloadDr Malcolm Anderson killed himself after complaining about mounting pressure at work.Wales,"This video can not be played Diane Anderson speaks out over the pressure her husband was under The widow of a university lecturer who killed himself has demanded action to tackle workload pressures to save other families having their ""dad taken away"". Diane Anderson said Cardiff University knew her husband Dr Malcolm Anderson was under significant pressure. Internal surveys, seen by BBC Wales, show a third of staff said they must work unreasonable hours to fulfil their job requirements. Cardiff University said they take the welfare of staff extremely seriously. Theinquest into Dr Anderson's deathheard he had left two notes before he fell from the university building in which he worked - one to his family and another referring to work pressures and long hours. He was 48 when he died. According to his wife, he was working evenings, weekends and holidays to keep on top of marking, preparing lectures, setting exam papers and answering emails. She said the university should have known he was struggling. 'Under pressure' lecturer fell to death Tributes to university lecturer who died ""He did tell them. In his appraisals he told them that his workload was massive and it was unmanageable but nothing ever changed,"" said Mrs Anderson. ""There was no account taken for it. And it was just more of the same."" Father-of-three Dr Anderson, an accountancy lecturer, died in February 2018 Annual work appraisals show Dr Anderson, who lived in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, raised concerns that he was unable to take annual leave due to his workload in 2015, 2016 and 2017. He was dealing with over 600 students and on the day he took his life, in February 2018, he was in the middle of marking 418 exam papers, and preparing for a day of lectures. His wife said he had also accepted an additional role within the Business School, fearing that turning it down could count against him in future. ""He didn't want to apply for that job because he knew he was really going to struggle and the stress involved. It was just too much,"" she said. Cardiff University said Dr Anderson was a ""committed, dedicated and well-liked"" member of staff More than 600 members of staff have signed an open letter to the university's vice-chancellor, executive board and council, urging them to safeguard others from pressures of excessive workloads. Among them was Prof Victoria Wass, one of Dr Anderson's colleagues at the Business School. She said the university's work allocation model - introduced in 2016 - should be replaced because it significantly underestimates the time it takes to do key tasks and ignores other duties altogether. ""Staff have no confidence in [the model] and no confidence in management who keep trying to implement it,"" she said. ""We ought to be acting on it. We ought not to be leaving staff thinking they are alone in being unable to manage their workload and that there's some particular weakness on their behalf that they can't do it. Because in the end that is what you are left feeling."" Prof Victoria Wass said the university's timetabling system ""obscures"" the increase in workload Cardiff University said it was reviewing the work allocation model. A spokesperson added: ""We are committed to working with all the members of the university community, including the recognised trade unions, to ensure the welfare of our staff. ""Over the last four years we have been seeking to establish a fair and transparent framework for allocating workloads."" Cardiff University hasannounced plans to cut 380 postsover the next five years to deal with a budget deficit of more than Â£20m. Prof Wass believes those financial pressures will hurt staff and students. ""There are no plans to cut back on students, the plan is to maintain or even increase student numbers but cut back on the staff. It's an impossible situation,"" she added. Lecturers strike over pension deadlock Lecturers 'anxious' over casual contracts The University and College Union in Wales said new demands such as online marking and National Student Surveys had increased workload pressures on staff in institutions across the country. It said: ""Employers can do so much, but the governments and their agencies must start to impact assess their requirements of the post-16 sector and the potential impact that a change in policy or practice will have on workload."" The university hopes to make many of the 380 job cuts through voluntary redundancies and recruitment controls The Welsh Government said it was due to make an announcement on supporting mental health and wellbeing at universities, colleges and students. It added: ""We believe in higher education as a common good.  Welsh universities' overall income levels have increased by over Â£200m since 2012, and we expect universities to provide the best possible student experience whilst also being active at community, national and international levels.""

Google admits error over hidden microphone,"The Nest Guard contained a microphone, but Google did not disclose that in the product's specifications Google has acknowledged that it made an error in not disclosing that one of its home alarm products contained a microphone. Product specifications for the Nest Guard,,externalavailable since 2017, had made no mention of the listening device. Butearlier this month, the firm said a software update,externalwould make Nest Guard voice-controlled. On Twitter, concerned Nest owners were told the microphone ""has not been used up to this pointâ. Business Insiderwas first to report the development.,external The Nest Guard is one component in the Nest Secure range of home security products. The system includes various sensors that can be monitored remotely by the user. Nest Guard is an all-in-one alarm, keypad, and motion sensor but, despite being announced well over a year ago, the word âmicrophoneâ was only added to the productâs specification this month. The change coincided with the announcement that it was now compatible with Google Assistant. The Nest Guard acts as a way to arm and disarm the firm's home security alarm system by use of a code or tap of a key fob In response to criticism, Google said on Tuesday: ""The on-device microphone was never intended to be a secret and should have been listed in the tech specs. That was an error on our part.â It added: âThe microphone has never been on and is only activated when users specifically enable the option. ""Security systems often use microphones to provide features that rely on sound sensing. We included the mic on the device so that we can potentially offer additional features to our users in the future, such as the ability to detect broken glass.â The firm's mea culpa has been accepted as genuine by many company watchers, but some say it still raises significant privacy concerns. ""This is the kind of thing that makes me paranoid of smart home devices,""commented Nick Heer,external, who writes the Pixel Envy blog. ""If I owned one of these things and found out that the world's biggest advertising company hid a microphone in my home for a year, I'd be livid."" UK-based privacy campaign group Big Brother Watch added: ""Many of our worries about smart home devices appear to be proving true... Google should be held to account for wrongly advertising this product."" Nest Guard went on sale in the US last year as part of Google's Secure alarm system. A European and Canadian release is also planned but has yet to occur. Nest, a company known for its smart thermostat, was acquired by Google in February 2014, for a reported $3.2bn (Â£2.5bn). The acknowledgment comes days afterSingapore Airlines faced criticism,externalfor installing cameras into the backs of some of its planes' seats as part of a new in-flight entertainment system. The company confirmed the cameras' existence on Sunday, butsaid they had been disabled,externaland added that it had no plans to use them. ____ Additional reporting by Leo Kelion Follow Dave Lee on Twitter@DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Family syndicate wins â¬175m jackpot,"Staff at Reilly's Daybreak in Naul, where the winning ticket was sold, celebrated the family's big win A family syndicate from Dublin has come forward to claim Tuesday's EuroMillions jackpot, worth more than 175m euros (Â£152m). It is the biggest jackpot claimed by an Irish ticket holder in its history. The syndicate is from Naul in north County Dublin, close to the border with County Meath. A spokesperson for the winners, who is married to one of the syndicate members, said the family is ""very close"". ""This is unbelievable - it will take us some time to get our heads around this win and to organise ourselves,"" he said. ""This is a dream come true. ""We don't want this to change our lives. ""What is so exciting is that we will be able to share this money with children, grandchildren and extended family members."" One of the syndicate members realised their good fortune when she checked the winning ticket after Tuesday night's draw. She said: ""I heard on the RTÃ news that there was a win in Ireland and I caught the last three numbers. ""I checked the rest of the numbers online. ""I was numb! It took a bit of convincing everybody that we had won."" The family member put the winning ticket in an Argos catalogue and put it under her mattress for safe keeping. ""I didn't sleep a wink all night,"" she added. On Wednesday, the family deposited the winning ticket for safe keeping with the National Lottery and arrangements are now being made for the prize claim to be paid out in the next few weeks.

Three Tory MPs join breakaway group,"This video can not be played Three Conservatives MPs resign to join Independent Group Three Tory MPs have resigned from the party to join an independent group, set up by former Labour MPs. Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen wrote a joint letter to Theresa May to confirm their departure. The three held a press conference, criticising the government for letting the ""hard-line anti-EU awkward squad"" take over the party. The PM said she was ""saddened"", but her party would ""always offer... decent, moderate and patriotic politics"". The pro-Remain trio will join the new Independent Group - made up of eight Labour MPs who resigned from their party over its handling of Brexit and anti-Semitism - saying it represented ""the centre ground of British politics"". LIVE: Reaction as Tory MPs split from party In full: Tory MPs' resignation letter Minor tremor or political earthquake? What does it feel like to quit a party? At a press conference on Wednesday, Ms Soubry criticised Theresa May for being ""in the grip"" of the Democratic Unionist Party and the pro-Leave European Research Group, and allowing Brexit to ""define and shape"" the Conservative Party. She said: ""The battle is over, the other side has won. ""The right wing, the hard-line anti-EU awkward squad that have destroyed every leader for the last 40 years are now running the Conservative Party from top to toe. They are the Conservative Party."" This video can not be played Anna Soubry: The ""hard-line anti-EU awkward squad"" is now running the Conservative Party Ms Wollaston said she felt ""great sadness"" at quitting the party, but said Mrs May ""simply hasn't delivered on the pledge she made on the steps of Downing Street to tackle the burning injustices in our society"". And Ms Allen highlighted her concerns around poverty, as well as Brexit, saying: ""I can no longer represent a government and a party who can't open its eyes to the suffering endured by the most vulnerable in society - suffering which we have deepened whilst having the power to fix."" Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group The three MPs said they will support the government on areas such as the economy, security and improvements to public services, and Ms Soubry defended the record of the coalition government - including the ""necessary"" austerity measures taken by chancellor George Osborne. But they felt ""honour bound to put our constituents' and country's interests first"" over Brexit. Watched by the eight other members of The Independent Group on the front row at the press conference, Ms Allen said she was ""excited"" about the future, adding: ""I want to be part of something better, a party that people vote for because they want to, not because they feel they have to."" This video can not be played Heidi Allen: ""We have deepened suffering, when it was within our power to fix it"" The departure of the three MPs - who all support the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum - has reduced the government's working majority to nine MPs, and Ms Allen claimed there were ""absolutely"" other colleagues ""keen"" to join the group. And the Independent Group now has more MPs in Parliament than the Democratic Unionist Party and equals the number of Liberal Democrats. Today's departures are evidence of how serious Conservative divisions have become. Right now, as with Labour, it's a splinter, not a split. But don't underestimate how hard a decision it is for any MP to abandon their tribe. These departures illustrate, therefore, a real problem for the governing party. Like Labour, the Tories have big questions they can't answer at the moment - profound quandaries that it's not clear their leaderships are ready, or perhaps even capable right now of meeting. Read more from Laura here. Mrs May said the UK's membership of the EU had been ""a source of disagreement both in our party and our country for a long time"", so ""ending that membership after four decades was never going to be easy"". But, she added: ""By delivering on our manifesto commitment and implementing the decision of the British people we are doing the right thing for our country."" This video can not be played Anna Soubry tells Newsnight's Kirsty Wark she was ""worried"" the prime minister had a problem with immigration. Former Prime Minister David Cameron said he respected the decision of the three MPs, but disagreed with them, calling for ""strong voices at every level of the party calling for modern, compassionate Conservatism."" Mr Cameron added: ""Our party has long been able to contain different views on Europe. Everyone must ensure that can continue to be the case."" A Labour spokesman criticised The Independent Group, saying they had formed ""what is effectively an establishment coalition based on the failed and rejected policies of the past"", such as austerity, corporate tax cuts and privatisation. But Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable said his party would ""hold out the hand of friendship"" to the group and said they already had ""a good working relationship"" with the MPs. The Conservative party's deputy chairman, Tory MP James Cleverly, told BBC Radio 5 Live that the resignations were ""very sad and disappointing"", which was echoed by Communities Secretary James Brokenshire. But he added that the focus ""has to remain on delivering Brexit"" and the Conservative party was ""a broad church and will remain so"". Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said it was a ""great shame to have lost the commitment and undeniable talent"" of the three MPs. Remain-backing Tory MP Nicky Morgan said the party ""should regret losing three such talented women from the Conservative Party"". Former Cabinet office minister, Damian Green, tweeted that he hoped the three MPs rejoined the party one day. Some Labour MPs have been criticising their former colleagues for joining forces with ex-Conservatives. Shadow education secretary Angela Rayner said it was ""a new low"" to see the MP of her home town, Ann Coffey, welcoming an MP responsible for government cuts, adding: ""I'm utterly disgusted."" Scottish Labour MP Danielle Rowley also questioned her former colleagues, tweeting: ""How people who once called themselves Labour can cosy up next to the likes of Soubry, smiling and laughing, is absolutely beyond me. ""I guess we now know how their policies and values differ from Labour."" The eight former Labour MPs who make up the rest of the Independent Group watch the trio's press conference Others have been criticising the group for not holding by-elections to win back their seats as independent MPs. Douglas Carswell, who resigned from the Conservatives to join UKIP in 2014, tweeted: ""When I changed parties it didn't occur to me to not hold a by election.  If my own electorate weren't supportive, what was the point?"" However, Ms Allen rejected calls for them to step down to contest by-elections, saying: ""This is what the big parties do. They want to crush the birth of democracy. They want to crush people like us trying to change things for this country. ""This is the game, of course, they will play but we are better than that, and we think our constituents and the country deserve better than that."" Allow Twitter content?

IS bride 'is not Bangladeshi citizen',"This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Shamima Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizen and there is ""no question"" of her being allowed into the country, Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has said. The UK has stripped the 19-year-old - who fled London to join the Islamic State group - of British citizenship. Such a move is only possible if an individual is eligible for citizenship elsewhere. It was thought Ms Begum had Bangladeshi citizenship through her mother. But the ministry of foreign affairs said the government was ""deeply concerned"" she had been ""erroneously identified"" as a Bangladeshi national. In a statement, it said Ms Begum had never applied for dual nationality with Bangladesh and had never visited the country. It added that the country had a ""zero tolerance"" approach to terrorism and violent extremism. I have one citizenship, says IS bride 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' IS teenager to lose UK citizenship Ms Begum was a schoolgirl when she left Bethnal Green in 2015, and was found in a Syrian refugee camp last week after reportedly leaving Baghuz - IS's last stronghold. She gave birth to a son at the weekend and now wants to return home. Ms Begum's mother is believed to be a Bangladeshi national, and lawyers have told the BBC that under Bangladesh law this means Ms Begum is automatically a citizen of the country as well. But Ms Begumtold the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommervillethat she only had ""one citizenship"" and it was wrong for the UK to revoke it without speaking to her first. ""I wasn't born in Bangladesh, I've never seen Bangladesh and I don't even speak Bengali properly, so how can they claim I have Bangladeshi citizenship,"" she said. While he said he would not comment on individual cases, Home Secretary Sajid Javid has suggested Ms Begum's baby could still be British. He told the Commons: ""Children should not suffer. So, if a parent does lose their British citizenship, it does not affect the rights of their child."" Mr Javid said the power to deprive a person of citizenship was only used ""in extreme circumstances"", for example, ""when someone turns their back on the fundamental values and supports terror"". Asked about the situation on ITV's Peston, the home secretary said he would not leave an individual ""stateless"". He said: ""I'm not going to talk about an individual, but I can be clear on the point that I would not take a decision - and I believe none of my predecessors ever have taken a decision - that at the point the decision is taken would leave that individual stateless."" But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused him of breaching the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that ""no-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of their nationality"". Shamima Begum left the UK with two school friends, Kadiza Sultana (l) and Amira Abase Ms Begum told the BBC: ""I was hoping Britain would understand I made a mistake, a very big mistake, because I was young and naive."" She said she changed her mind about IS after they imprisoned and tortured her Dutch husband - an armed jihadi. Escape was impossible, she claimed: ""They'd kill you if you tried."" The lawyer for Ms Begum's family,Tasnime Akunjee, said,externalthey were considering ""all legal avenues"" to contest the Home Office decision and that she had effectively been made stateless. Earlier, Ms Begumtold ITV News,externalthat she found the Home Office's decision ""heartbreaking"", but she may try for Dutch citizenship via her husband. Civilians evacuated from last IS enclave How many IS foreign fighters are left? He is a Dutch convert to Islam and is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters about two weeks ago. Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once controlled, but an estimated 300 militants are believed to be left in a tiny pocket of land near Syria's border with Iraq. Under the1981 British Nationality Act,external, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result. Ms Begum has the right to challenge the Home Office's decision either by tribunal or judicial review, said former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile, but would have to prove the home secretary had acted disproportionately. He said it was a ""complex issue"" which ""could run for a very long time through the courts"", and Ms Begum could stay where she is ""for maybe two years at least"". Lord Carlile said her baby may be entitled to British, Dutch and Bangladeshi nationality. By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Lawyers have told the BBC that under Bangladesh law, a UK national born to a Bangladeshi parent is automatically a Bangladeshi citizen - a dual national - but the Bangladeshi authorities assert that's not the case for Ms Begum. Under this ""blood line"" law, Bangladeshi nationality and citizenship lapse when a person reaches the age of 21, unless they make active efforts to retain it. So, it is Ms Begum's age, 19, that is likely - in part - to have given Home Office lawyers and the home secretary reassurance there was a legal basis for stripping her of her UK citizenship. In 2017, the government lost an appeal case brought by two British citizens of Bangladeshi origin who were stripped of their citizenship when they were abroad. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission ruled that E3 and N3 had not tried to retain their citizenship before they reached the age of 21, and so it had automatically lapsed. That meant that the decision to strip them of their UK citizenship had rendered them stateless. Ms Begum's case is different. Her Bangladeshi citizenship, if established, would remain intact until she reaches 21, even if she has never visited the country or made active efforts to retain her citizenship.

Could new group reshape political tribes?,"Anna Soubry resigned from the Conservatives on Wednesday to join The Independent Group Only a notion three days ago, The Independent Group now has more members than the DUP and the same number as the Lib Dems. The Tory trio's defection matters for three big reasons, way beyond the enormous personal decision taken by each individual. Three Tory MPs join breakaway group Who are the MPs resigning? In full: Tory MPs' resignation letter First, when a government has no majority on its own, even shy of a dozen MPs can wield political strength. The defections change not just the official arithmetic in Parliament, but its alchemy and atmosphere. While none of those who have made the jump are likely to back the prime minister's Brexit deal, they are a new block for the government, and the Labour front bench, to contend with - ultimately, whose votes are up for grabs, and whose numbers are likely to swell in the coming days. Second, today's departures are evidence of how serious Conservative divisions have become. Right now, as with Labour, it's a splinter, not a split. But don't underestimate how hard a decision it is for any MP to abandon their tribe. These departures illustrate, therefore, a real problem for the governing party. For a very long time, before the referendum even, a clash was apparent in the Conservative Party with those who wanted to accelerate, make real and more relevant David Cameron's so-called modernisation project. In other words, it was an effort to respond to the hopes and desires of floating voters in the middle, rather than the traditional Tory base, and to be more of a mirror of the country and how it was changing. Heidi Allen, Sarah Wollaston and Anna Soubry now all sit as independent MPs This was not just the well-heeled Notting Hill set musing about how best to hold onto power, but a very real question over how the party ought to evolve - what, and who, was it for? Those questions have, of course, been drowned out by the clamour over Brexit. The split in the Tory party over Europe is not a perfect reflection of that division, but it is certainly one of its contours. Fears over Brexit and the party drifting to the right - and away from relevance - are held far beyond today's ""three amigos"", but by dozens of MPs privately, including ministers in the government. If, as is likely, more MPs move across, those private pleas to stay in the centre ground have more weight. Like Labour, the Tories have big questions they can't answer at the moment - profound quandaries that it's not clear their leaderships are ready, or perhaps even capable right now of meeting. Lastly, today's departures mean there is now a group in Parliament who hope to escape the traditional party lines. Of course, there are huge hurdles to that. We know what they all don't like -  but we're not sure yet what they all do. It's not remotely clear that the group will actually become a political party. We can't know yet if they will ever be able to agree common cause to produce a whole manifesto, far less that they would become a big enough force to put forward multiple candidates in the hope of actually winning elections. But Brexit, which criss-crosses party lines in Parliament, has already shaken the stability of our two main Westminster parties, and it's always had the potential to reshape our political tribes. This group's potential is easy to dismiss, but unwise for the established parties to ignore.

IS 'traps 200 families' in bastion,"Some 20,000 people who have fled Baghuz in recent weeks have been taken to a camp The UN has expressed concern about the fate of some 200 families reportedly trapped in the last tiny area of Syria still held by the Islamic State group. Human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said they were apparently being prevented from leaving by IS militants. They were also being subjected to intense bombardment by US-led coalition and allied Syrian forces, she added. On Tuesday evening, dozens of lorries reportedly arrived on the outskirts of the IS enclave to evacuate civilians. Could a defeated IS rebound? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, cited its sources as saying wives and children of militants would be taken to an undisclosed location as part of a deal with the coalition. Earlier, it reported that a request by militants to be given safe passage to the opposition-held Syrian province of Idlib or neighbouring Iraq had been rejected by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance. IS militants are reportedly confined to tents pitched on top of a network of tunnels and caves SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali appeared to dismiss such an idea on Tuesday morning, insisting the militants had ""only two options - either they surrender or they will be killed in battle"". ""We are working on secluding and evacuating civilians and then we will attack. This could happen soon,"" Mr Bali was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? How many IS foreign fighters are left? Five years ago, IS controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. It proclaimed the creation of a ""caliphate"", imposing its brutal rule on almost eight million people and generating billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. Now, an estimated 300 militants and hundreds of civilians are surrounded inside about 0.5 sq km (0.2 square miles) of land in the Baghuz area, which is in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, near the border with Iraq. ""Civilians continue to be used as pawns by the various parties,"" Ms Bachelet said. ""I call on them to provide safe passage to those who wish to flee, while those wish to remain must also be protected as much as possible. ""They should not be sacrificed to ideology on the one hand, or military expediency on the other. If protecting civilian lives means taking a few more days to capture the last fraction of land controlled by [IS], then so be it."" US-backed SDF fighters launched an assault on Baghuz this month Although no-one has reportedly made it out of Baghuz in the past three days, some 20,000 civilians have been taken by the SDF to a makeshift camp for displaced people at al-Hol, in Hassakeh province, in recent weeks. Among them are the wives and children of IS militants and many foreign nationals, including the British teenager Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she ran away from her home to join IS four years ago. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said on Monday that at least 62 people had died on their way to al-Hol, two thirds of them children under the age of one. Exhaustion and malnutrition were the principal causes of the deaths. This video can not be played On Monday Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Ms Bachelet also said she was alarmed by an upsurge in attacks and civilian casualties in Idlib province, where a takeover by a jihadist group linked to al-Qaeda, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has jeopardised a truce brokered by Turkey and Russia in September. The Syrian government's bombardment of a demilitarised buffer zone, which runs along the frontline in Idlib and areas of northern Hama and western Aleppo provinces, started to escalate in December and has further intensified in recent days, according to the UN. Islamic State group: The full story At the same time, there has been an increase in fighting among rebel and jihadist factions, and also in the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in areas they control. On Monday, at least 16 civilians, including women and children, were reportedly killed by two bomb explosions in the Qusour district of Idlib city. The second blast appeared to have been designed to kill those, including medical workers, coming to the aid of victims of the first. Another nine civilians, including four women and two boys, were meanwhile reportedly killed by government strikes on Khan Sheikhoun on Friday and Saturday.

In full: Tory MPs' resignation letter,"MPs Anna Soubry, Sarah Wollaston and Heidi Allen have written to the prime minister to resign from the Conservative Party. Here is their letter. Dear Prime Minster It is with regret that we are writing to resign the Conservative whip and our membership of the Party. We voted for you as Leader and Prime Minister because we believed you were committed to a moderate, open-hearted Conservative Party in the One Nation tradition. A party of economic competence, representing the best of British business, delivering good jobs, opportunity and prosperity for all, funding world class public services and tackling inequalities. We had hoped you would also continue to modernise our party so that it could reach out and broaden its appeal to younger voters and to embrace and reflect the diversity of the communities we seek to represent. Sadly, the Conservative Party has increasingly abandoned these principles and values with a shift to the right of British Politics. We no longer feel we can remain in the Party of a Government whose policies and priorities are so firmly in the grip of the ERG and DUP. Brexit has re-defined the Conservative Party - undoing all the efforts to modernise it. There has been a dismal failure to stand up to the hard line ERG which operates openly as a party within a party, with its own leader, whip and policy. This shift to the right has been exacerbated by blatant entryism. Not only has this been tolerated, it has been actively welcomed in some quarters. A purple momentum is subsuming the Conservative Party, much as the hard left has been allowed to consume and terminally undermine the Labour Party. We have tried consistently and for some time to keep the Party close to the centre ground of British Politics. You assured us when you first sought the leadership that this was your intention. We haven't changed, the Conservative Party has and it no longer reflects the values and beliefs we share with millions of people throughout the United Kingdom. The final straw for us has been this Government's disastrous handling of Brexit. Following the EU referendum of 2016, no genuine effort was made to build a cross party, let alone a national consensus to deliver Brexit. Instead of seeking to heal the divisions or to tackle the underlying causes of Brexit, the priority was to draw up ""red lines"". The 48% were not only sidelined, they were alienated. We find it unconscionable that a Party once trusted on the economy, more than any other, is now recklessly marching the country to the cliff edge of no deal. No responsible government should knowingly and deliberately inflict the dire consequences of such a destructive exit on individuals, communities and businesses and put at risk the prospect of ending austerity. We also reject the false binary choice that you have presented to Parliament between a bad deal and no deal. Running down the clock to March 20 amounts to a policy of no deal and we are not prepared to wait until our toes are at the edge of the cliff. We can no longer act as bystanders. We intend to sit as independents alongside The Independent Group of MPs in the centre ground of British politics. There will be times when we will support the Government, for example, on measures to strengthen our economy, security and improve our public services. But we now feel honour bound to put our constituents' and country's interests first. We would like to thank all those who have supported us and worked alongside us within our constituencies over many years. We genuinely wish our many friends and colleagues within the Party well, indeed we know many of them share our concerns. We will continue to work constructively, locally and nationally, on behalf of our constituents. However, the country deserves better. We believe there is a failure of politics in general, not just in the Conservative Party but in both main parties as they move to the fringes, leaving millions of people with no representation. Our politics needs urgent and radical reform and we are determined to play our part.

Minor tremor or political earthquake?,"Are the tectonic plates of British politics moving with the formation of a new ""centrist"" group in Parliament - or are we experiencing a minor tremor? It's too soon to say - but that won't stop some MPs and commentators declaiming as though they were expert political seismologists. So let's stand back and examine the landscape. A split is quite an easy thing to understand. Three Tory MPs join breakaway group Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group But currently there are fissures that run all the way through British politics and which makes the future look far from stable. The addition of three Conservative MPs to the ranks of eight Labour defectors could, on the surface, look like the breaking of the British political mould. But let's examine the multiple fissures more closely. Momentum - the influential group of Labour left wingers - has denounced the nascent political grouping as neo-liberal Blairites and Tories. Yet not many ""Blairites"" or centrists have, as yet, signed up to this project. One reason is Brexit - the primary reason for the breakaway, according to defecting former Labour MP Chris Leslie. Senior members of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum - who most people would regard as ardent supporters of the last Labour government - pleaded for months with Chuka Umunna not to set up a breakaway group before Brexit had been settled one way or another. They did not want People's Vote to be seen as a de facto new party because they felt this might breed suspicion among left-wing Labour Party members who are far more pro-EU than their party leader. Leading lights in the People's Vote campaign wanted to detach these Labour members from Mr Corbyn, so that they could back a new referendum without feeling disloyal. But the defectors have gone over the top now - they have formed what looks like the beginning of a new party. They might have been able to take more ""centrists"" with them had they waited. But timing and tactics aren't the only divisions amongst the so-called ""centrists"" in Parliament. This is an over simplification but essentially the centrists split in to two groups. First, the defectors, along with those who are all but ready to defect or for whom it wouldn't take much to push over the brink that they have precariously occupied. And secondly, those who will ""stay and fight"". The success of the breakaway will - in part - depend on how many will move from group two to group one. Essentially, the current fissure is based on those for whom ""stop Corbyn"" is their overriding objective - and those whose fundamental deep seated raison d'etre is to Stop the Tories. And the sight today of former Labour MP Ann Coffey chatting away, in apparently chummy terms, to former Conservative Sarah Wollaston on the same Parliamentary bench will make it more difficult, not less, for the Independents to attract further Labour support. Having said that, I still expect to see a few more defectors - the Labour leadership expect a dozen in total to go. Incidentally, it may also limit the appeal to those Labour voters long uncomfortable with Mr Corbyn but who have felt they had nowhere else to go. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told me the story of when he canvassed a voter very disillusioned with his party on a number of issues including immigration. ""I was thinking of backing the BNP then I thought 'naw, that would just let the Tories in'"", said the voter. In some parts of the country a group which takes in former Labour and Conservative MPs could be seen as refreshing - but in others it will be toxic. The Conservative defections have also allowed abrasive left wingers to say they were right all along to paint Chuka Umunna and chums as ""red Tories"". There is a debate in Labour leadership circles about whether to call another confidence vote in the government, in the hope that the new group will vote with Theresa May and be depicted not so much as red Tories but actual Tories. One prominent ""centrist"" Labour MP told me privately he was pleased some of his colleagues had gone as he would no longer himself be ""tarred"" with the accusation that he would leave - or that his loyalty wasn't first and foremost to the party. But there are also divisions within the Left on how to handle this. Is it better to be conciliatory and try to address not just the defections but the causes of them? This is the approach favoured not only by Dave Prentis - the general secretary of Britain's largest union Unison - but privately by some much closer to Mr Corbyn. But others want to ""clean out the stables"" and step up the de-selection of the Corbyn critics who remain in the party. Some close to the leadership do not want this to happen - but admit that controlling some of the activists who have joined the party in recent times isn't an easy task. One left-wing insider told me that they had been genuinely shocked at some of the examples of anti-Semitism in the party but trying to convince some rank and file members that the allegations and investigations were not part of an anti-Corbyn plot was a forlorn task. So the number of future defectors may depend on how disciplined and measured the reaction is from the Labour leadership's supporters in local parties. Some MPs could yet feel ""forced out"". Where the Left is united is in calling for the defectors to stand down as MPs and fight by-elections. Many of those MPs have large majorities and, don't forget, many of them would - as we revealed at the last election - have barely mentioned the Labour leader in their 2017 campaign literature and instead punted the message that Theresa May needed reining in. And both Shirley Williams and Roy Jenkins scored spectacular (but short lived) by-election victories in the early days of the Social Democratic Party, which broke away from Labour in the early 1980s. So the Left may have to be careful what they wish for. A couple of members of the new Independent Group are said to be considering putting themselves in front of the electorate. But this is high risk. So far, we know more about what this new group is against than for. ( Indeed although they are currently all pro EU some of their potential future members are much more Eurosceptic.) And possibly for former Labour MPs the biggest risk in a by-election would not be defeat by their old party but so dividing the centre-left vote that a Conservative wins. That might do more to herd some potential defectors back in to their Labour fold. Any anti-Brexit former Tories would face a brutal campaign which would seek to rally pro-Brexit voters by portraying the defectors as part of a political establishment which would betray the verdict of the people. But perhaps the way the new Independent Group might change the political dynamic is this - their mere existence tells the leadership of the traditional parties that if they don't listen to the concerns of their parliamentarians they - and some their voters - really do have somewhere else to go. So they present a challenge to those at the top of the existing parties. How - and if - the leaderships of these parties change could determine whether the defections eventually register on the political Richter scale.

"I have one citizenship, says IS brideShamima Begum is thought to be of Bangladeshi heritage - but the country says she is not its concern.UK","This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Shamima Begum - the teenager who fled London to join Islamic State - has said she only has ""one citizenship"" and it was wrong for the UK to revoke it without speaking to her first. It is only possible to strip someone of their UK nationality if they are eligible for citizenship elsewhere. It is thought Ms Begum has Bangladeshi citizenship through her mother. But the Bangladesh foreign ministry said the matter had nothing to do with the country. The 19-year-old told BBC News she had hoped the UK would understand she made a ""very big mistake"" by joining IS. She was a schoolgirl when she left Bethnal Green in 2015, and was found in a Syrian refugee camp last week after reportedly leaving Baghuz - IS's last stronghold. She gave birth to a son at the weekend and now wants to return home. While he said he would not comment on individual cases, Home Secretary Sajid Javid has suggested Ms Begum's baby could still be British. He told the Commons ""Children should not suffer. So, if a parent does lose their British citizenship, it does not affect the rights of their child."" 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' IS teenager to lose UK citizenship Ms Begum's mother is believed to be a Bangladeshi national, and lawyers have told the BBC that under Bangledesh law this means Ms Begum is automatically a citizen of the country as well. But Ms Begum told the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville: ""I wasn't born in Bangladesh, I've never seen Bangladesh and I don't even speak Bengali properly, so how can they claim I have Bangladeshi citizenship. ""I have one citizenship... and if you take that away from me, I don't have anything. I don't think they are allowed to do that. ""This is a life changing decision and they haven't even spoke[n] to me."" She continued: ""I was hoping Britain would understand I made a mistake, a very big mistake, because I was young and naive."" She said she changed her mind about IS after they imprisoned and tortured her Dutch husband - an armed jihadi. Escape was impossible, she claimed: ""They'd kill you if you tried."" She added that she understood the anger about her wanting to come home. ""I understand why you don't want to be sympathetic because of everything IS did... and claiming it's all for the sake of Islam... it's really not,"" she said. Mr Javid said the power to deprive a person of citizenship was only used ""in extreme circumstances"", for example, ""when someone turns their back on the fundamental values and supports terror"". ""We must put the safety and security of our country first,"" he added. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused him of breaching the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that ""no-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of their nationality"". Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Earlier, Ms Begum, 19,told ITV News,externalthat she found the Home Office's decision ""heartbreaking"", but she may try for Dutch citizenship via her husband. He is a Dutch convert to Islam and is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters about two weeks ago. The lawyer for Ms Begum's family,Tasnime Akunjee, said,externalthey were considering ""all legal avenues"" to contest the Home Office decision. Hetold the Independent,externalthat the Bangladesh government ""does not know who she is"", adding: ""Our position is that to all practical purposes she has been made stateless."" Under the1981 British Nationality Act,external, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result. Ms Begum has the right to challenge the Home Office's decision either by tribunal or judicial review, said former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile, but would have to prove the home secretary had acted disproportionately. He said it was a ""complex issue"" which ""could run for a very long time through the courts"", and Ms Begum could stay where she is ""for maybe two years at least"". Lord Carlile said her baby may be entitled to British, Dutch and Bangladeshi nationality. By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Lawyers have told the BBC that under Bangladesh law, a UK national like Ms Begum who is born to a Bangladeshi parent is automatically a Bangladeshi citizen. That means that such a person would have dual nationality. The Bangladeshi authorities however assert Ms Begum is not a Bangledeshi citizen. Under this ""blood line"" law, Bangladeshi nationality and citizenship lapse when a person reaches the age of 21, unless they make active efforts to retain it. So, it is Ms Begum's age, 19, that is likely - in part - to have given Home Office lawyers and the home secretary reassurance there was a legal basis for stripping her of her UK citizenship. In 2017, the government lost an appeal case brought by two British citizens of Bangladeshi origin who were stripped of their citizenship when they were abroad. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission ruled that E3 and N3 had not tried to retain their citizenship before they reached the age of 21, and so it had automatically lapsed. That meant that the decision to strip them of their UK citizenship had rendered them stateless. Ms Begum's case is different. Her Bangladeshi citizenship, if established, would remain intact until she reaches 21, even if she has never visited the country or made active efforts to retain her citizenship. Former Conservative Home Secretary Ken Clarke said refusing Britons who joined IS the right to return would be a ""great boost for jihadism"" as the ""hundreds of foreign jihadis stuck in camps in northern Syria"" would be further radicalised. And MP Joanna Cherry, the SNP's spokeswoman for justice and home affairs,said,externalthe home secretary's actions were ""more about his leadership ambitions than security issues or due process"". After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? IS 'traps 200 families' in last bastion Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once controlled, but an estimated 300 militants are believed to be left in a 0.5 sq km area near Syria's border with Iraq. Mr Javid told MPs earlier this week that more than 100 dual nationals had already lost their UK citizenship after travelling in support of terrorist groups. Last year, two British men, accused of being members of an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles""were stripped of their citizenshipafter being captured in Syria. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK In aninterview with the BBCon Monday, Ms Begum said she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and now simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. She left the UK with two school friends, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase. Ms Sultana is thought to be dead, while the fate of Ms Abase is unknown.

"Derek Hatton suspended by LabourEx-Militant man was only readmitted to the party on Monday, more than 30 years after being expelled.UK Politics","Derek Hatton has been suspended by the Labour Party less than 48 hours after he was admitted back into the party. The ex-deputy leader of Liverpool council's membership was provisionally approved on Monday, more than 30 years after he was expelled from the party. But senior Labour figures have since complained about the move and comments the ex-Militant man made about Israel. In a tweet in 2012, he urged ""Jewish people with any sense of humanity"" to condemn Israel's ""ruthless murdering"". A Labour party source said the party was ""not aware of this material"" when it had provisionally approved Mr Hatton's application to rejoin the party. And ""once this was brought to our attention"", Mr Hatton's membership application had been suspended pending a final decision by the party's ruling body, the National Executive Committee. Mr Hatton was a key figure in Militant, a Trotskyite far-left group that ran Liverpool council in the early 1980s. Derek Hatton rejoins Labour after 34 years Who is Derek Hatton? He was expelled in 1985 after a high-profile battle with Labour's then leader, Neil Kinnock, who accused him and others of seeking to infiltrate and subvert the party. It emerged on Monday that his application to rejoin the Liverpool Wavertree branch of the Labour Party had been provisionally approved by a special panel of the party. But this drew fierce criticism from many leading figures in the party, coming on the same day as seven MPs quit the party in protest at what they said was a culture of anti-Semitism in the party. Earlier on Wednesday, shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner told MPs he had lodged a formal complaint about the 2012 tweet and believed action was being taken. ""It was a travesty for the news of his readmission to come to public attention on the day when some members of our party were forced out was appalling,"" he added. The party's deputy leader Tom Watson has also written to Labour's general secretary, Jennie Formby, questioning the decision to provisionally readmit Mr Hatton. Mr Hatton posted the 2012 message during ""Operation Pillar of Defence"" a week-long offensive by the Israel Defence Forces in Gaza. According to a UNHCR report, 174 Palestinians were killed during the operation, and hundreds were injured. At the time, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said ""of course Israel has the right to self-defence and attacks against Israel must end, but the international community would also expect Israel to show restraint"".

"Alesha murder accused told 'pack of lies'The prosecution said there was a ""mountain of evidence"" against the boy accused of murdering Alesha MacPhail.Glasgow & West Scotland","Alesha MacPhail was holidaying on the Isle of Bute where her body was found The 16-year-old boy accused of killing Alesha MacPhail told a ""pack of lies"", jurors have heard. Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC said there was a ""mountain of evidence"" against the boy, who denies abducting, raping and murdering Alesha last July on the Isle of Bute. In his closing speech at the High Court in Glasgow, Mr McSporran urged the jury to find the teenager guilty. The accused's QC, Brian McConnachie, said the boy should be acquitted. Mr McSporran told jurors that they had listened to ""one of the worst cases"" a jury has had to hear. He said the case would provoke ""revulsion"", but said these emotions could ""play no part in the process"". He said the court was dealing with an ""extraordinarily important matter"". During the trial, the court heard Alesha suffered 117 injuries and that she had been ""brutalised"". Her naked remains were discovered in the grounds of the former Kyles Hydro Hotel on Bute on 2 July. Mr McSporran said the case had involved ""deeply disturbing and distressing"" evidence as well as ""dreadful"" photos. The advocate depute said: ""Something terrible was done to that girl."" The teenager has lodged a special defence claiming the crime was committed by Ms McLachlan, 18, who is the girlfriend of the victim's father. The court previously heard the accused claim he had sex with Ms McLachlan, who then planted his DNA - from a used condom - at the scene. The boy claimed that he later told police of going for cannabis that morning, so no-one would know about him and Ms McLachlan being together. But, Mr McSporran said: ""He spun a yarn, a pack of lies. He has also told a pack of lies in the witness box."" The boy had also claimed that Ms McLachlan may have been ""fantasizing"" about harming Alesha. Toni McLachlan denied accusations that she killed Alesha MacPhail The advocate depute said no-one else had come up with that suggestion. He added: ""He introduced that into evidence. It was his comment, his word."" The advocate depute claimed that what the boy had suggested was ""preposterous"". In her evidence, Toni McLachlan denied any part in the murder, insisting she ""loved"" Alesha. Mr McSporran told the jury the boy had ""more than enough time"" that morning to carry out the crime. He concluded by asking jurors to find the boy guilty and said there was a ""mountain of evidence"" against the teenager. In the closing speech for the defence, Mr McConnachie said: ""There will be people sitting out there who would return a verdict of guilty after reading the indictment, just by the nature of the charge - but that would be wrong."" The QC added it was not a case of the teenager versus Toni McLachlan. He said: ""This is not a whodunnit."" Mr McConnachie suggested that, if guilty, the boy had gone into the MacPhail family home at night, where there were four adults. ""He then chances upon the room where Alesha is and opens a squeaky door to gain entry, goes in and, whatever condition Alesha is in, he picks her up and took her out. ""A girl, according to Toni McLachlan, who would scream if a stranger came into the room."" The QC also accused the prosecution of ""trying too hard to make something out of nothing"". As the defence closed its case, a friend of Ms McLachlan said she had told her that Alesha was ""in a better place"". Lindsay Calderwood said the comment was made in the days after the child was found dead. The jury also heard from a neighbour who claimed Alesha's father had attacked his partner. Avril Lax said the abuse happened over a three-month period in the flat Robert MacPhail, 26, shared with his parents. She told the court she also raised her concerns with Robert's parents, Calum MacPhail and Angela King. The court previously heard that Robert MacPhail was on bail for a domestic charge. But in evidence Ms McLachlan said the matter concerned a heated argument the couple had after a funeral and did not turn physical. The trial continues. Boy, 16, denies killing six-year-old girl DNA found on Alesha 'matched accused' Alesha trial told of DNA Google search Alesha accused had 'fantasy' killing chat Alesha, six, had 'catastrophic' injuries Woman denies killing six-year-old Alesha Alesha's father 'sold cannabis to accused' Boy accused of Alesha murder blames woman It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail. Ahead of their trial, the accused can lodge a special defence such as self-defence (they were defending themselves from attack), alibi (they were somewhere else when the crime was committed) and mental disorder (the accused is not responsible for their actions because they were suffering from a psychiatric condition). In this case, the accused has lodged a special defence of incrimination, which means he has claimed that someone else (Toni McLachlan) was responsible. However, the Crown must still prove the guilt of the accused beyond reasonable doubt. There is no onus on the accused to prove their special defence is true, and he or she can still be acquitted even if the jury does not believe their special defence.

Cardinals urge end of 'homosexual agenda'Two prominent cardinals call on bishops to end their silence over sexual abuse at the Church.Europe,"Pope Francis has convened an extraordinary summit to discuss the scandals Two prominent Roman Catholic Church cardinals have urged an end of what they call ""the plague of the homosexual agenda"", telling bishops to break their complicity over cases of sexual abuse. In an open letter, Cardinals Burke and BrandmÃ¼ller say the Church has wrongly blamed the abuse of power by clergy as the main cause of the scandals. Instead, they say the cases involve priests who have ""gone away from the truth of the Gospel"". They also openly criticise the Pope. Stories of sexual abuse of minors have emerged across the world and the Church has been accused of covering up crimes committed by priests. Their letter comes on the eve of an extraordinary summit of bishops,externalin Rome called by Pope Francis as an effort to deal with the scandals rocking the Church. Cardinals Raymond Burke, from the US, and Walter BrandmÃ¼ller, from Germany, reject that the cases of abuse are a result of ""clericalism"" - a group of men abusing their power, and protecting each other. The cardinals belong to the traditionalist wing of the Church, where many believe homosexuality is a root cause of the clerical abuse, and are both outspoken critics of Pope Francis. ""The plague of the homosexual agenda has been spread within the Church, promoted by organized networks and protected by a climate of complicity and a conspiracy of silence,"" they said. The Pope's biggest challenge Sex abuse and the Church ""Sexual abuse is blamed on clericalism. But the first and primary fault of the clergy does not rest in the abuse of power but in having gone away from the truth of the Gospel."" Cardinals BrandmÃ¼ller and Burke are outspoken critics of Pope Francis In the Catholic hierarchy, cardinals are second in importance only to the pontiff, and there are currently 223 of them. Cardinal Burke has links to former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, who will reportedly be in Rome during the summit. Cardinal Burke is president of the advisory board of the right-wing Dignitatis Humanae Institute,which is setting up a leadership course with Mr Bannon's help.,external Meanwhile, Cardinal BrandmÃ¼ller caused controversy last month whenhe blamed homosexuality for the cases of sexual abuse at the Church.,external The cardinals accuse the Pope of failing to answer questions related to whether the Church should allow divorced and remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion - they are currently barred. The issue, raised in 2016 by four cardinals including Burke and BrandmÃ¼ller, has caused controversy in the Church, prompting many clerics to question the Pope's leadership. The role of cardinals Profile: Pope Francis The mention of this point completely unrelated to Thursday's summit, and the challenge to the Pope's authority, shows that clerics who are unhappy with Pope Francis are growing more confident, observers say. Conservative Catholics say they are trying to uphold the Church's teachings and moralsand accuse the Pope of diluting their faith. The summit is to be attended by the heads of all national bishops' conferences from more than 130 countries, who will discuss the most pressing crisis facing the modern Church. Cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations Priest guilty of child abuse offences Pope Francis is under pressure over the sexual abuse cases This is the beginning of an attempt to address a sickness that has been poisoning the Church since at least the 1980s, leaving its moral authority in tatters, BBC religion editor Martin Bashir says. Pope Francis must also confront the assumptions, attitudes and practices that have allowed a culture of abuse to flourish, and the extent of this challenge may prove overwhelming, our correspondent adds. The Pope called for ""decisive action"" when he was elected in 2013, but critics say he has not done enough to hold to account bishops who allegedly covered up abuse.

Minor tremor or political earthquake?Can a Tory/Labour centrist group change the political landscape and how will their former parties react?,"Are the tectonic plates of British politics moving with the formation of a new ""centrist"" group in Parliament - or are we experiencing a minor tremor? It's too soon to say - but that won't stop some MPs and commentators declaiming as though they were expert political seismologists. So let's stand back and examine the landscape. A split is quite an easy thing to understand. Three Tory MPs join breakaway group Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group But currently there are fissures that run all the way through British politics and which makes the future look far from stable. The addition of three Conservative MPs to the ranks of eight Labour defectors could, on the surface, look like the breaking of the British political mould. But let's examine the multiple fissures more closely. Momentum - the influential group of Labour left wingers - has denounced the nascent political grouping as neo-liberal Blairites and Tories. Yet not many ""Blairites"" or centrists have, as yet, signed up to this project. One reason is Brexit - the primary reason for the breakaway, according to defecting former Labour MP Chris Leslie. Senior members of the People's Vote campaign for another EU referendum - who most people would regard as ardent supporters of the last Labour government - pleaded for months with Chuka Umunna not to set up a breakaway group before Brexit had been settled one way or another. They did not want People's Vote to be seen as a de facto new party because they felt this might breed suspicion among left-wing Labour Party members who are far more pro-EU than their party leader. Leading lights in the People's Vote campaign wanted to detach these Labour members from Mr Corbyn, so that they could back a new referendum without feeling disloyal. But the defectors have gone over the top now - they have formed what looks like the beginning of a new party. They might have been able to take more ""centrists"" with them had they waited. But timing and tactics aren't the only divisions amongst the so-called ""centrists"" in Parliament. This is an over simplification but essentially the centrists split in to two groups. First, the defectors, along with those who are all but ready to defect or for whom it wouldn't take much to push over the brink that they have precariously occupied. And secondly, those who will ""stay and fight"". The success of the breakaway will - in part - depend on how many will move from group two to group one. Essentially, the current fissure is based on those for whom ""stop Corbyn"" is their overriding objective - and those whose fundamental deep seated raison d'etre is to Stop the Tories. And the sight today of former Labour MP Ann Coffey chatting away, in apparently chummy terms, to former Conservative Sarah Wollaston on the same Parliamentary bench will make it more difficult, not less, for the Independents to attract further Labour support. Having said that, I still expect to see a few more defectors - the Labour leadership expect a dozen in total to go. Incidentally, it may also limit the appeal to those Labour voters long uncomfortable with Mr Corbyn but who have felt they had nowhere else to go. Former Scottish Labour leader Jim Murphy told me the story of when he canvassed a voter very disillusioned with his party on a number of issues including immigration. ""I was thinking of backing the BNP then I thought 'naw, that would just let the Tories in'"", said the voter. In some parts of the country a group which takes in former Labour and Conservative MPs could be seen as refreshing - but in others it will be toxic. The Conservative defections have also allowed abrasive left wingers to say they were right all along to paint Chuka Umunna and chums as ""red Tories"". There is a debate in Labour leadership circles about whether to call another confidence vote in the government, in the hope that the new group will vote with Theresa May and be depicted not so much as red Tories but actual Tories. One prominent ""centrist"" Labour MP told me privately he was pleased some of his colleagues had gone as he would no longer himself be ""tarred"" with the accusation that he would leave - or that his loyalty wasn't first and foremost to the party. But there are also divisions within the Left on how to handle this. Is it better to be conciliatory and try to address not just the defections but the causes of them? This is the approach favoured not only by Dave Prentis - the general secretary of Britain's largest union Unison - but privately by some much closer to Mr Corbyn. But others want to ""clean out the stables"" and step up the de-selection of the Corbyn critics who remain in the party. Some close to the leadership do not want this to happen - but admit that controlling some of the activists who have joined the party in recent times isn't an easy task. One left-wing insider told me that they had been genuinely shocked at some of the examples of anti-Semitism in the party but trying to convince some rank and file members that the allegations and investigations were not part of an anti-Corbyn plot was a forlorn task. So the number of future defectors may depend on how disciplined and measured the reaction is from the Labour leadership's supporters in local parties. Some MPs could yet feel ""forced out"". Where the Left is united is in calling for the defectors to stand down as MPs and fight by-elections. Many of those MPs have large majorities and, don't forget, many of them would - as we revealed at the last election - have barely mentioned the Labour leader in their 2017 campaign literature and instead punted the message that Theresa May needed reining in. And both Shirley Williams and Roy Jenkins scored spectacular (but short lived) by-election victories in the early days of the Social Democratic Party, which broke away from Labour in the early 1980s. So the Left may have to be careful what they wish for. A couple of members of the new Independent Group are said to be considering putting themselves in front of the electorate. But this is high risk. So far, we know more about what this new group is against than for. ( Indeed although they are currently all pro EU some of their potential future members are much more Eurosceptic.) And possibly for former Labour MPs the biggest risk in a by-election would not be defeat by their old party but so dividing the centre-left vote that a Conservative wins. That might do more to herd some potential defectors back in to their Labour fold. Any anti-Brexit former Tories would face a brutal campaign which would seek to rally pro-Brexit voters by portraying the defectors as part of a political establishment which would betray the verdict of the people. But perhaps the way the new Independent Group might change the political dynamic is this - their mere existence tells the leadership of the traditional parties that if they don't listen to the concerns of their parliamentarians they - and some their voters - really do have somewhere else to go. So they present a challenge to those at the top of the existing parties. How - and if - the leaderships of these parties change could determine whether the defections eventually register on the political Richter scale.

Gender pay gap grows at hundreds of firms,"Four in 10 private companies that have published their latest gender pay gap are reporting wider gaps than they did last year, according to BBC analysis. The BBC looked at a company's median pay gap - that is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. This is different to unequal pay - paying women less than men for the same work - which is illegal. Big firms with a wider pay gap include Kwik Fit, Npower and Virgin Atlantic. Only about 10% of employers have reported their latest figures so far, ahead of the 4 April deadline for the private sector. Of those 1,146 companies, the hourly median gender pay gap reported is 8.4% - a slight improvement from 9.7% last year. Of the companies that had reported by the morning of 19 February: 74% report a pay gap which favours men 14% have a pay gap favouring women 12% report no pay gap. ""Closing the gender pay gap is not a quick fix, and employers may take time to see their gap close as they implement long term action plans,"" the Government Equalities Office said in a statement. Want to find out the gender pay gap where you work? Try the calculator below. All British companies with 250 or more employees have to report their gender pay gaps. Last year 78% disclosed that they paid men more than they paid women. Type in a company name below  ...for every £10 the average man earns... ...the average woman takes home [[PercOfMen]]    Number of companies by pay gap   If you cannot see the calculator, please click here,external By law, companies, charities and public sector departments of 250 employees or more must publish their gender pay gap figures. The first set were based on a snapshot taken in April 2017, and the most recent data relates to April 2018. Public sector firms must report by 30 March, and charitable and private firms by 4 April. The BBC's analysis refers purely to private sector firms which had gender pay gap data and a consistent registration at Companies House for April 2017 and April 2018. According to the available data, the gender pay gap at energy giant Npower has grown from 13% to 18% since it last reported. It partially attributed this to more female than male employees opting for a salary sacrifice benefits scheme. The gap at car mechanics chain Kwik Fit grew from a negative gender pay gap - when women get paid more - of minus 15.2% to a positive one of 14%. A company spokeswoman said the industry had been ""historically more appealing to men"", although it was trying to recruit more women. ""Last year most of our female employees were in our upper quartile of salary bands, however over the course of the last 12 months a number of these senior employees have left the company, a shift which has skewed our figures."" The gap at airline and tour operator Virgin Atlantic also widened, from 28.4% to 31%. A spokeswoman said the firm was focused on achieving diversity ""for all roles - including engineering and pilot roles"". For some firms exact comparable figures are unavailable, but their pay gaps remain glaringly large. The average gender pay gap at RBS was 36.8%, according to the most recent data - one of the biggest gaps reported by a firm with 5,000 employees or more. The bank has pledged to significantly increase the number of women in senior roles and has recently appointed a female chief financial officer. The pay gap at Lloyds Banking Group, which has also pledged to appoint more women to senior roles, was flat at 32.8%. London Heathrow Airport was among the firms that improved, posting a gender pay gap of 0.6% compared with 6.5% a year earlier. The company said it welcomed the reporting measures. ""It's no one's fault - it's not a blame game. This is a chance to recruit excellent talent,"" said Elizabeth Hegarty, Heathrow's director of customer relations and service. Shining a spotlight on pay discrepancies was meant to spur action. So the news that the gap is getting bigger in almost two out of five companies that have so far reported may bring dismay. But this highlights that there's no quick fix. A large gap points to (typically) women being clustered in more junior roles. Progressing them through the ranks could take years. Actually, if a firms' plan includes recruiting more female employees at entry level, that can initially widen a pay gap. Research for the Government Equalities Office,externalalso queries how meaningful many companies' plans to close the pay gap are. Campaigners say concrete initiatives and cultural change are needed. The pay gap really opens up when women become mothers. Yet the Equalities and Human Rights Commissionfound that a third of employers assume mothers are less interested in career progression,external. We don't know exactly what's going on. Firms aren't obliged to explain - nor are they penalised for a lack of improvement. The government says it will wait five years before reviewing the legislation. The early signs are that gender pay reporting may have helped some - but others may be forgiven for feeling short-changed by the process. The Equality and Human Rights Commission (EHRC) - which enforces the gender pay gap rules - said that forcing companies to report their pay gaps was not enough to eliminate pay disparities. ""We believe that it should be mandatory for employers to publish, alongside their pay gap data, action plans with specific targets and deadlines,"" said chief executive Rebecca Hilsenrath. Sam Smethers, head of gender equality campaign group the Fawcett Society, said she was not surprised that some companies' figures had got worse. ""This is a long term issue and and we need companies to put long-term plans in place. ""The key thing is are they committed to it? Do they have a three to five year strategy that they can implement?"" Median pay gap The median pay gap is the difference in pay between the middle-ranking woman and the middle-ranking man. If you line up all the men and women working at a company in two separate lines in order of salary, the median pay gap will be the difference in salary between the woman in the middle of her line and the man in the middle of his. Mean pay gap The mean pay gap is the difference between a company's total wage spend-per-woman and its total spend-per-man. The number is calculated by taking the total wage bill for each and dividing it by the number of men and women employed by the organisation. Pay gap v equal pay The gender pay gap is not the same as unequal pay. Unequal pay is giving women less than men for the same work. That has been against the law since the Equal Pay Act was introduced in 1970. A company's gender pay gap can also be caused by other things, for example fewer women in senior or highly-paid roles or more women in part-time jobs. The individual company data reflects the information submitted by companies to the Government Equalities Office as of 15:45 on Tuesday 19 February. The data submitted each year is based on figures drawn from a specific date - called the 'snapshot date' - the previous year. 5 April is the snapshot date for businesses and charities. 31 March is the snapshot date for public sector organisations. All gender pay gap figures in this article reflect the hourly median pay gap for all employees.

Lecturer's widow hits out at uni workload,"This video can not be played Diane Anderson speaks out over the pressure her husband was under The widow of a university lecturer who killed himself has demanded action to tackle workload pressures to save other families having their ""dad taken away"". Diane Anderson said Cardiff University knew her husband Dr Malcolm Anderson was under significant pressure. Internal surveys, seen by BBC Wales, show a third of staff said they must work unreasonable hours to fulfil their job requirements. Cardiff University said they take the welfare of staff extremely seriously. Theinquest into Dr Anderson's deathheard he had left two notes before he fell from the university building in which he worked - one to his family and another referring to work pressures and long hours. He was 48 when he died. According to his wife, he was working evenings, weekends and holidays to keep on top of marking, preparing lectures, setting exam papers and answering emails. She said the university should have known he was struggling. 'Under pressure' lecturer fell to death Tributes to university lecturer who died ""He did tell them. In his appraisals he told them that his workload was massive and it was unmanageable but nothing ever changed,"" said Mrs Anderson. ""There was no account taken for it. And it was just more of the same."" Father-of-three Dr Anderson, an accountancy lecturer, died in February 2018 Annual work appraisals show Dr Anderson, who lived in Weston-super-Mare in Somerset, raised concerns that he was unable to take annual leave due to his workload in 2015, 2016 and 2017. He was dealing with over 600 students and on the day he took his life, in February 2018, he was in the middle of marking 418 exam papers, and preparing for a day of lectures. His wife said he had also accepted an additional role within the Business School, fearing that turning it down could count against him in future. ""He didn't want to apply for that job because he knew he was really going to struggle and the stress involved. It was just too much,"" she said. Cardiff University said Dr Anderson was a ""committed, dedicated and well-liked"" member of staff More than 600 members of staff have signed an open letter to the university's vice-chancellor, executive board and council, urging them to safeguard others from pressures of excessive workloads. Among them was Prof Victoria Wass, one of Dr Anderson's colleagues at the Business School. She said the university's work allocation model - introduced in 2016 - should be replaced because it significantly underestimates the time it takes to do key tasks and ignores other duties altogether. ""Staff have no confidence in [the model] and no confidence in management who keep trying to implement it,"" she said. ""We ought to be acting on it. We ought not to be leaving staff thinking they are alone in being unable to manage their workload and that there's some particular weakness on their behalf that they can't do it. Because in the end that is what you are left feeling."" Prof Victoria Wass said the university's timetabling system ""obscures"" the increase in workload Cardiff University said it was reviewing the work allocation model. A spokesperson added: ""We are committed to working with all the members of the university community, including the recognised trade unions, to ensure the welfare of our staff. ""Over the last four years we have been seeking to establish a fair and transparent framework for allocating workloads."" Cardiff University hasannounced plans to cut 380 postsover the next five years to deal with a budget deficit of more than Â£20m. Prof Wass believes those financial pressures will hurt staff and students. ""There are no plans to cut back on students, the plan is to maintain or even increase student numbers but cut back on the staff. It's an impossible situation,"" she added. Lecturers strike over pension deadlock Lecturers 'anxious' over casual contracts The University and College Union in Wales said new demands such as online marking and National Student Surveys had increased workload pressures on staff in institutions across the country. It said: ""Employers can do so much, but the governments and their agencies must start to impact assess their requirements of the post-16 sector and the potential impact that a change in policy or practice will have on workload."" The university hopes to make many of the 380 job cuts through voluntary redundancies and recruitment controls The Welsh Government said it was due to make an announcement on supporting mental health and wellbeing at universities, colleges and students. It added: ""We believe in higher education as a common good.  Welsh universities' overall income levels have increased by over Â£200m since 2012, and we expect universities to provide the best possible student experience whilst also being active at community, national and international levels.""

Just Eat to ban worst food hygiene offenders,"Food ordering app Just Eat is to remove all restaurants with a hygiene rating of zero from their platform. Any new outlet attempting to join Just Eat will also have to be rated at least ""generally satisfactory"" - a three on the five point scale - for hygiene. It comes after aBBC investigation foundhalf of outlets rated zero by the Food Standards Agency in Manchester, Bristol and London appeared on the app. Just Eat said restaurants rated zero would be removed by 1 May. In England, Wales, and Northern Ireland ahygiene rating,externalof zero means ""urgent improvement is required"". In October, the BBC found one takeaway with a zero rating, featured on Just Eat, had mouse droppings on washing up gloves and dead mice in a pool of grease in the kitchen. Environmental Health took this picture of dead mice at a takeaway in Walthamstow, east London which features on Just Eat Just Eat says it will be investing Â£1m to raise food hygiene and safety standards, and will help any restaurant on its platform with a rating of zero, one or two to improve. It will fund a one-to-one visit from an expert food safety practitioner, help to draw up an action plan, and offer guidance on how to request a re-inspection. The company says outlets that fail to make changes and are still rated zero by 1 May will be kicked off. ""We know that running a small, independent business is not without its challenges, and food hygiene and safety is a vital area that restaurants need to get right,"" said managing director Graham Corfield. The company added that ""the vast majority"" of takeaway restaurants have a good hygiene rating score. Local authorities are responsible for inspecting restaurants and takeaways. In England, Wales and Northern Ireland outlets are givena rating,externalranging from zero, for ""in need of urgent improvement"", to five, for ""food hygiene is very good"". In Scotlandthere are just three ratings,external- Pass, Improvement Required and Exempt Premises (which are given to premises such as newsagents or chemists that are checked but are not predominantly food businesses). Just Eat will also offer help to those who need improvement in Scotland. Restaurants in Wales and Northern Ireland must display their rating prominently. In England, many outlets choose to do so, particularly if it shows a high score for hygiene, but it is not mandatory. Just Eat announced in December that it would start to include the official FSA food hygiene rating of each restaurant more prominently on its website and app - something it is now doing in Northern Ireland. Until it's rolled out across the UK though, most users must leave the app and look up the rating on the FSA website. This video can not be played An investigation by the BBC last year found Just Eat were listing outlets rated zero by the FSA Heather Hancock, chairman of the FSA, welcomed Just Eat's investment. She said: ""The company influences thousands of food businesses and reaches millions of customers.

Eighth MP quits Labour,"Ms Ryan was chair of the Labour Friends of Israel group Joan Ryan has become the eighth Labour MP to quit the party in the past 48 hours, citing its tolerance of a ""culture of anti-Jewish racism"". The Enfield North MP said she was ""horrified, appalled and angered"" by Labour's failure to tackle anti-Semitism, saying its leadership allowed ""Jews to be abused with impunity"". Ms Ryan said she did not believe Jeremy Corbyn was fit to lead the country. Seven other MPs quit on Monday to form the Independent Group in Parliament. There is mounting speculation that a number of Conservative MPs disillusioned with the government's policy on Brexit could join forces with them. One source has told the BBC's assistant political editor, Norman Smith, to ""be on standby mode"". BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said Conservative whips were reporting three MPs - Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry - had gone ""very, very silent"". We'll listen to critics, vows McDonnell Labour MP sorry for Israeli breakaway claim Who are the Labour MPs resigning? While the Independent Group are not confirming anything, he said he had been told by one member that Wednesday would be a ""very busy day"". Announcing her decision on Twitter,external, Ms Ryan said she would continue to represent the north London seat in Parliament. On Tuesday, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she would not trigger a by-election in her constituency, as she won her seat in 2017 ""in spite of [Mr Corbyn], not because of him"". ""I didn't win my seat on his coat tails,"" she added. Ms Ryan, who served as a minister under Tony Blair, follows Chuka Umunna, Mike Gapes, Luciana Berger, Ann Coffey, Angela Smith, Gavin Shuker and Chris Leslie in quitting the party. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I regret that seven MPs decided they would no longer remain part of the Labour Party"" In her resignation statement, she said Mr Corbyn and the ""Stalinist clique which surrounds him"" was not providing real opposition at a moment of crisis for the country. Instead, she said the leadership was focused on ""purging their perceived ideological enemies within and obsessing over issues of little interest to British people"". Corbyn critics lose no-confidence votes Ms Ryan, chair of the Friends of Israel group, repeated Ms Berger's claim that the party had become ""institutionally anti-Semitic"", suggesting that under Mr Corbyn's leadership Israel had been ""singled out for demonisation and de-legitimisation"". ""The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn has become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism. The problem simply did not exist in the party before his election as leader. ""No previous Labour leader would have allowed this huge shame to befall the party. I have been horrified, appalled and angered to see the Labour leader's dereliction of duty in the face of this evil."" Ms Ryan lost a non-binding confidence vote of her party members in September which she blamed on ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and the assorted hard left"". Conservative MP Phillip Lee told BBC Radio Berkshire he had considered leaving his party. He said: ""I do feel like my party is drifting from beneath me. There is this danger of some form of 'Ukip-lite' party developingâ¦ and I don't remember a vote of the parliamentary party to become the Brexit Party. ""So yes, I'd be lyingâ¦if I hadn't considered all these things. But my own firm belief isâ¦the Conservative Party has always been a broad church. I'm going to stand and fight until it ceases to be so."" Members of the Independent Group, who have cited what they say is a culture of bullying in the party and Labour's stance on Brexit for quitting, welcomed Ms Ryan's decision to join them. Mr Shuker, the MP for Luton South, tweeted that the group was ""building something powerful together"". The seven have said their grouping could be the basis for a new political party and have urged like-minded MPs from other parties to join them. Mr Corbyn has said he wants to ""take MPs with him"" but insisted that the direction he has taken the party in since 2015 is hugely popular within the country. Chris Williamson, the MP for Derby North, said he was ""not entirely surprised"" by Ms Ryan's exit. ""She was probably facing a de-selection in any event,"" he told BBC's Newsnight. He said he had never known Labour to be ""more united"" than it was now and it was ""regrettable that a minority of MPs"" were out of step with the popular mood in the country. The embryonic Independent Group of MPs has no leader but has set out its principles Labour has suggested MPs who change political allegiance have a duty to seek a fresh mandate from their constituents. The party is considering giving voters the power to force MPs who switch parties between general elections to face by-elections by strengthening the existing recall laws. In a statement released before the news of Ms Ryan's exit, shadow Cabinet minister Jon Trickett said voters should not have to wait years to hold to account MPs who they believe are not ""properly representing their interests"".

That's where we're leaving our coverage of the Commons. The Commons returns at 9:30am tomorrow for environment questions, and later in the day they'll be holding a debate on potential future free trade agreements. Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Former Labour MP Ivan Lewis says the ""current Labour leadership have always believed that the creation of Israel was a catastrophe"". He says this is in contravention of their belief that all minorities around the world have the right to self-determination. He says the only time the Labour leadership does not believe a minority group should have self-determination is on Israel. He asks how Labour can ""tackle the cancer of anti-Semitism"" with the current leadership in charge. ""If all of this has happened in the party, imagine what would happen in the country, if the right honourable gentleman ever became prime minister"", he asks. Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Luciana Berger, who now sits as part of the Independent Group after quitting the Labour Party on Monday, says she has been subjected to ""thousands of messages of anti-Semitic abuse and hate"". She says she has seen ""obfuscation, smears, inaction and denial"" from the Labour Party on tackling the problem. She says she has arrived at the ""sickening
conclusion"" that the Labour Party is ""institutionally
antisemitic, in its processes, its attitudes and behaviour"". She says Labour members are seeing a ""reminder of the rules"" as a punishment, rather than true sanctions. ""This is a shameful record,"" she says, from a party seeking ""the highest office in the land"". Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Percy says he shares the ""growing concern and alarm"" at the ""rise of anti-Semitism in our own country"". The statistics on anti-Semitism should ""shame all of us"", he says. ""There is a growing movement on the far-right"" who hold the ""most anti-Semitic views in our society"", he tells MPs. ""UKIP have now become a far-right party"" which is embracing a ""fascist agenda"", he adds. Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Labour's Margaret Hodge says that it ""beggars belief"" that on the day Luciana Berger left the Labour Party, Derek Hatton was readmitted. She calls him ""bigoted"". ""I never ever thought my Jewish identity would be central to my political work,"" she states, describing herself as ""secular"". ""Stamping out anti-Semitism matters, we must never shirk our responsibility,"" she adds. ""Figures have reached an all-time high"" in anti-Semitic abuse, she says. ""Legitimate criticism of foreign government should never morph into racist abuse against all Jews."" Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Conservative Theresa Villiers says that she feels she has to ""speak out about the current situation"". She says a ""considerable number"" of Jewish families in her constituency are considering leaving the UK if Labour were to win a general election. ""Much more effective action is needed"" by the leadership of the Labour Party, she states. She says that Mr Corbyn has shared platforms with anti-Semites. She states that while these are ""past episodes"", the current response to anti-Semitism in the Labour Party ""continues to be inadequate"". ""Enough is enough,"" she finishes. Allow Twitter content?

Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Stewart M McDonald says that Scotland is one of the few countries which has never had an anti-Semitic law on the statute book. He says he is pleased that the Scottish government has accepted the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism. He says that this does not mean everything is ""rosy north of the border"". He states that on an article about anti-Semitism in Scotland recently, reported by The Herald, the comments below the article were ""full of conspiracy theories"". Theresa May challenges Jeremy Corbyn over his attitude to a ""once proud Labour Party"". Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Luciana Berger watched from her new position in the Commons Continuing, Barry Gardiner also says that Luciana Berger, one of the eight Labour MPs who quit the party this week, has suffered ""disgraceful treatment"". ""I regret deeply that she has left our party, I regret most of all the anti-Semitic abuse which made her feel it was necessary to do so,"" he adds. He describes her as a ""kind and loving person"" who has been ""bullied by anti-Semites to a point that most of us would not have had the strength to bear"". ""I wish she'd stayed, and helped us defeat the evil in our party,"" he says, but adds that whichever party she represents, she should have the ""unqualified solidarity"" of MPs. Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Neil Coyle asks Barry Gardiner asks what ""message it sends to the Jewish community"" tore-admitthe former Liverpool City Council leader Derek Hatton. Derek Hatton, he says, has posted tweets which ""seemed to imply that every Jew [...] is responsible for the actions of the Israeli government"". In reply, Barry Gardiner says he has seen the tweets and has written to Labour's general secretary and lodged a formal complaint about them. ""I understand that action has since been taken,"" he adds. For the news of his readmission to emerge on the day that seven MPs resigned from the party, he says, was ""appalling"". Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner says the Labour Party has put fighting racism and prejudice ""at the core of who we are"". But he asks: ""How can it be that we are struggling so badly to eradicate anti-Semitism from our own membership?"" The Labour Party, he says, has not had ""adequate procedures in place"" to act swiftly against ""that small minority of members"" who have sometimes expressed anti-Semitic views. ""I want on behalf of my party to publicly apologise to the Jewish community, that we have let you down,"" he says. ""We will not stop working until we once again become a safe and welcoming home for people from the Jewish community, as from every other,"" he adds. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he is sad that three ""incredibly talented"" MPs have quit the party and expressed his hope that they will be ""welcomed back"" one day. Speaking during a visit to Berlin, Mr Hunt said the way to persuade them to return was by showing that the Brexit that would be delivered ""in accordance with [the] referendum result is
not the Brexit of their worst fears"". To that end, it is was vital the UK maintained an an ""open and outward"" relationship with Europe after leaving the EU and not ""pulling up the drawbridge"" or resorting to a ""Little England"" mentality.

That's where we're leaving our coverage of the Commons. The Commons returns at 9:30am tomorrow for environment questions, and later in the day they'll be holding a debate on potential future free trade agreements. Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Former Labour MP Ivan Lewis says the ""current Labour leadership have always believed that the creation of Israel was a catastrophe"". He says this is in contravention of their belief that all minorities around the world have the right to self-determination. He says the only time the Labour leadership does not believe a minority group should have self-determination is on Israel. He asks how Labour can ""tackle the cancer of anti-Semitism"" with the current leadership in charge. ""If all of this has happened in the party, imagine what would happen in the country, if the right honourable gentleman ever became prime minister"", he asks. Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Luciana Berger, who now sits as part of the Independent Group after quitting the Labour Party on Monday, says she has been subjected to ""thousands of messages of anti-Semitic abuse and hate"". She says she has seen ""obfuscation, smears, inaction and denial"" from the Labour Party on tackling the problem. She says she has arrived at the ""sickening
conclusion"" that the Labour Party is ""institutionally
antisemitic, in its processes, its attitudes and behaviour"". She says Labour members are seeing a ""reminder of the rules"" as a punishment, rather than true sanctions. ""This is a shameful record,"" she says, from a party seeking ""the highest office in the land"". Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Conservative Andrew Percy says he shares the ""growing concern and alarm"" at the ""rise of anti-Semitism in our own country"". The statistics on anti-Semitism should ""shame all of us"", he says. ""There is a growing movement on the far-right"" who hold the ""most anti-Semitic views in our society"", he tells MPs. ""UKIP have now become a far-right party"" which is embracing a ""fascist agenda"", he adds. Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Labour's Margaret Hodge says that it ""beggars belief"" that on the day Luciana Berger left the Labour Party, Derek Hatton was readmitted. She calls him ""bigoted"". ""I never ever thought my Jewish identity would be central to my political work,"" she states, describing herself as ""secular"". ""Stamping out anti-Semitism matters, we must never shirk our responsibility,"" she adds. ""Figures have reached an all-time high"" in anti-Semitic abuse, she says. ""Legitimate criticism of foreign government should never morph into racist abuse against all Jews."" Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Conservative Theresa Villiers says that she feels she has to ""speak out about the current situation"". She says a ""considerable number"" of Jewish families in her constituency are considering leaving the UK if Labour were to win a general election. ""Much more effective action is needed"" by the leadership of the Labour Party, she states. She says that Mr Corbyn has shared platforms with anti-Semites. She states that while these are ""past episodes"", the current response to anti-Semitism in the Labour Party ""continues to be inadequate"". ""Enough is enough,"" she finishes. Allow Twitter content?

Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament The SNP's Stewart M McDonald says that Scotland is one of the few countries which has never had an anti-Semitic law on the statute book. He says he is pleased that the Scottish government has accepted the full International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance definition of anti-Semitism. He says that this does not mean everything is ""rosy north of the border"". He states that on an article about anti-Semitism in Scotland recently, reported by The Herald, the comments below the article were ""full of conspiracy theories"". Theresa May challenges Jeremy Corbyn over his attitude to a ""once proud Labour Party"". Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Luciana Berger watched from her new position in the Commons Continuing, Barry Gardiner also says that Luciana Berger, one of the eight Labour MPs who quit the party this week, has suffered ""disgraceful treatment"". ""I regret deeply that she has left our party, I regret most of all the anti-Semitic abuse which made her feel it was necessary to do so,"" he adds. He describes her as a ""kind and loving person"" who has been ""bullied by anti-Semites to a point that most of us would not have had the strength to bear"". ""I wish she'd stayed, and helped us defeat the evil in our party,"" he says, but adds that whichever party she represents, she should have the ""unqualified solidarity"" of MPs. Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Labour MP Neil Coyle asks Barry Gardiner asks what ""message it sends to the Jewish community"" tore-admitthe former Liverpool City Council leader Derek Hatton. Derek Hatton, he says, has posted tweets which ""seemed to imply that every Jew [...] is responsible for the actions of the Israeli government"". In reply, Barry Gardiner says he has seen the tweets and has written to Labour's general secretary and lodged a formal complaint about them. ""I understand that action has since been taken,"" he adds. For the news of his readmission to emerge on the day that seven MPs resigned from the party, he says, was ""appalling"". Debate on anti-Semitism House of CommonsParliament Shadow international trade secretary Barry Gardiner says the Labour Party has put fighting racism and prejudice ""at the core of who we are"". But he asks: ""How can it be that we are struggling so badly to eradicate anti-Semitism from our own membership?"" The Labour Party, he says, has not had ""adequate procedures in place"" to act swiftly against ""that small minority of members"" who have sometimes expressed anti-Semitic views. ""I want on behalf of my party to publicly apologise to the Jewish community, that we have let you down,"" he says. ""We will not stop working until we once again become a safe and welcoming home for people from the Jewish community, as from every other,"" he adds. Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt has said he is sad that three ""incredibly talented"" MPs have quit the party and expressed his hope that they will be ""welcomed back"" one day. Speaking during a visit to Berlin, Mr Hunt said the way to persuade them to return was by showing that the Brexit that would be delivered ""in accordance with [the] referendum result is
not the Brexit of their worst fears"". To that end, it is was vital the UK maintained an an ""open and outward"" relationship with Europe after leaving the EU and not ""pulling up the drawbridge"" or resorting to a ""Little England"" mentality.

Navratilova transgender comments spark row,"Martina Navratilova has been a longstanding campaigner for gay rights A US-based organisation that campaigns for LGBT sportspeople has cut its links with tennis legend Martina Navratilova over comments she made about male-to-female transgender athletes. The 18-time Grand Slam champion wrote it was ""cheating"" to allow transgender women to compete in women's sport as they had unfair physical advantages. Athlete Ally said the remarks were transphobic,externaland perpetuated myths. It said it had sacked the star from its advisory board and as an ambassador. In an article for the British newspaper The Sunday Times, Navratilova wrote: ""A man can decide to be female, take hormones if required by whatever sporting organisation is concerned, win everything in sight and perhaps earn a small fortune, and then reverse his decision and go back to making babies if he so desires."" She added: ""It's insane and it's cheating. I am happy to address a transgender woman in whatever form she prefers, but I would not be happy to compete against her. It would not be fair."" Tennis's reluctant transgender pioneer How do trans people decide their name? The schools learning from transgender students Trans sportswomen quickly hit back. Rachel McKinnon, who last year became the first transgender woman to win a world track cycling title, called the comments ""disturbing, upsetting and deeply transphobic"". In its statement, Athlete Ally said Navratilova's comments were ""transphobic, based on a false understanding of science and data, and perpetuate dangerous myths that lead to the ongoing targeting of trans people through discriminatory laws, hateful stereotypes and disproportionate violence"". Martina Navratilova won 18 Grand Slam singles titles It added: ""This is not the first time we have approached Martina on this topic. In late December, she made deeply troubling comments across her social media channels about the ability for trans athletes to compete in sport. We reached out directly offering to be a resource as she sought further education, and we never heard back."" Athlete Ally said Navratilova joined as an ambassador and was honoured with an Action Award at the group's first annual gala in 2014. She has since taken part in advocacy campaigns including signing an open letter calling on the International Basketball Federation (Fiba) to overturn its ban on the hijab and an open letter speaking out against an anti-trans bill in Texas in 2017. The group said the former champion had not yet responded to its decision to drop her. Navratilova has been a longstanding campaigner for gay rights and suffered abuse when she came out as gay in the 1980s. Under guidelines introduced in 2016, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) allows athletes transitioning from female to male to participate without restrictions. Male to female competitors, however, are required to have kept their levels of testosterone - a hormone that increases muscle mass - below a certain level for at least 12 months.

Cardinals urge end of 'homosexual agenda',"Pope Francis has convened an extraordinary summit to discuss the scandals Two prominent Roman Catholic Church cardinals have urged an end of what they call ""the plague of the homosexual agenda"", telling bishops to break their complicity over cases of sexual abuse. In an open letter, Cardinals Burke and BrandmÃ¼ller say the Church has wrongly blamed the abuse of power by clergy as the main cause of the scandals. Instead, they say the cases involve priests who have ""gone away from the truth of the Gospel"". They also openly criticise the Pope. Stories of sexual abuse of minors have emerged across the world and the Church has been accused of covering up crimes committed by priests. Their letter comes on the eve of an extraordinary summit of bishops,externalin Rome called by Pope Francis as an effort to deal with the scandals rocking the Church. Cardinals Raymond Burke, from the US, and Walter BrandmÃ¼ller, from Germany, reject that the cases of abuse are a result of ""clericalism"" - a group of men abusing their power, and protecting each other. The cardinals belong to the traditionalist wing of the Church, where many believe homosexuality is a root cause of the clerical abuse, and are both outspoken critics of Pope Francis. ""The plague of the homosexual agenda has been spread within the Church, promoted by organized networks and protected by a climate of complicity and a conspiracy of silence,"" they said. The Pope's biggest challenge Sex abuse and the Church ""Sexual abuse is blamed on clericalism. But the first and primary fault of the clergy does not rest in the abuse of power but in having gone away from the truth of the Gospel."" Cardinals BrandmÃ¼ller and Burke are outspoken critics of Pope Francis In the Catholic hierarchy, cardinals are second in importance only to the pontiff, and there are currently 223 of them. Cardinal Burke has links to former Trump White House adviser Steve Bannon, who will reportedly be in Rome during the summit. Cardinal Burke is president of the advisory board of the right-wing Dignitatis Humanae Institute,which is setting up a leadership course with Mr Bannon's help.,external Meanwhile, Cardinal BrandmÃ¼ller caused controversy last month whenhe blamed homosexuality for the cases of sexual abuse at the Church.,external The cardinals accuse the Pope of failing to answer questions related to whether the Church should allow divorced and remarried Catholics to receive Holy Communion - they are currently barred. The issue, raised in 2016 by four cardinals including Burke and BrandmÃ¼ller, has caused controversy in the Church, prompting many clerics to question the Pope's leadership. The role of cardinals Profile: Pope Francis The mention of this point completely unrelated to Thursday's summit, and the challenge to the Pope's authority, shows that clerics who are unhappy with Pope Francis are growing more confident, observers say. Conservative Catholics say they are trying to uphold the Church's teachings and moralsand accuse the Pope of diluting their faith. The summit is to be attended by the heads of all national bishops' conferences from more than 130 countries, who will discuss the most pressing crisis facing the modern Church. Cardinal defrocked over abuse allegations Priest guilty of child abuse offences Pope Francis is under pressure over the sexual abuse cases This is the beginning of an attempt to address a sickness that has been poisoning the Church since at least the 1980s, leaving its moral authority in tatters, BBC religion editor Martin Bashir says. Pope Francis must also confront the assumptions, attitudes and practices that have allowed a culture of abuse to flourish, and the extent of this challenge may prove overwhelming, our correspondent adds. The Pope called for ""decisive action"" when he was elected in 2013, but critics say he has not done enough to hold to account bishops who allegedly covered up abuse.

Burberry sorry for 'suicide' hoodie,"Burberry has apologised for featuring a hoodie with a noose around the neck at London Fashion Week. The fashion brand was criticised by one of its own models, Liz Kennedy, ina long post on Instagram,externalin which she said: ""Suicide is not fashion."" ""Let's not forget about the horrifying history of lynching either,"" she added. Burberry boss Marco Gobbetti said the brand was ""deeply sorry for the distress"" caused, adding: ""It was insensitive and we made a mistake."" The hoodie featured in a collection called Tempest which was on the runway at London Fashion Week on Sunday. The show featured ""rebellious youths"" scaling walls in one space and Burberry's creative director Riccardo Tisci dedicated it to ""the youth of today"". Model Liz, who had been part of the Burberry show but didn't wear the hoodie, said the design was ""not glamorous nor edgy"". Allow Instagram content?

She wrote on Instagram: ""How could anyone overlook this and think it would be okay to do this especially in a line dedicated to young girls and youth? ""The impressionable youth. Not to mention the rising suicide rates worldwide."" Liz said she felt ""extremely triggered"" after seeing the design and felt ""as though I was right back where I was when I was going through an experience with suicide in my family"". She told her Instagram followers she had tried to bring up the issue in the dressing room but was told to write a letter instead. The hoodie was one of several designs that feature in the Tempest collection Liz added: ""I had a brief conversation with someone but all that it entailed was 'It's fashion. Nobody cares about what's going on in your personal life so just keep it to yourself'. ""Well I'm sorry but this is an issue bigger than myself. The issue is not about me being upset, there is a bigger picture here of what fashion turns a blind eye to, or does to gain publicity. ""A look so ignorantly put together and a situation so poorly handled."" Burberry boss Marco Gobbetti said Liz's experience ""does not reflect who we are and our values"". ""We will reflect on this, learn from it and put in place all necessary actions to ensure it does not happen again.""

"Sex offender pupil allowed back to schoolThe victim says she is trying to ""pretend he's not there"", while her mother says she worries ""every single day"".Essex","Police statistics show a rise in reports of sexual assaults in schools in recent years A 15-year-old boy convicted of sexually assaulting a girl in a classroom has been allowed to stay at the same school as his victim. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault and put on the sex offenders register. The victim said: ""I have to just keep my head down, pretend he's not there, otherwise it makes me panic."" The school said it had followed all procedures correctly. The boy, who remained at school while awaiting prosecution, was tried at a youth court almost a year after the assault and given a restraining order, and told not to contact or approach his victim. The victim toldBBC Inside Out East: ""It was known that boy was very 'hands on' with girls. ""He started making comments about me, touching my legs and putting his hands on me. ""Then gradually he started putting his hands up my skirt, touching my chest and I kept telling him to stop. ""I wanted to leave but I felt like I couldn't do anything. I felt powerless, like I was stuck."" The victim's family, from Essex, believes he should not have been allowed to stay at the school. ""I think the day he was found guilty he should have been excluded,"" her mother said. ""He should not be allowed near my daughter or any woman right now. I worry every single day, even now. I don't feel the boy was adequately punished at all."" The NSPCC said calls to Childline about sex abuse by other children had increased Figures obtained by the BBC show at least 6,289 sexual assaults took place in and around schools between 2015 and 2017 - and there was a 60% rise across those three years. The data, which may include assaults on staff as well as pupils, was supplied by 26 of 45 police forces from England and Wales in a Freedom of Information request. Police Scotland did not give figures. Some forces said certain offences took place outside school, or on the bus on the way to school. Department for Education guidelines,externalset out how schools should deal with a report of sexual assault and what to do after a pupil is convicted, with responses on a ""case by case basis"". Anna Cole, inclusion specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said she suspected the rise was down to better reporting by individuals and schools. ""Schools know they can't take this lightly. It can't just be dismissed as 'banter' or a normal thing that happens anymore,"" she said. Dad meets baby hours before his death 'A garage full of men is intimidating' Radio host hit in face in 'racist attack' Children's charity the NSPCC said the number of its Childline counselling sessions for victims of sexual abuse carried out by other children increased by a third between 2016-17 and 2017-18. Almudena Lara, head of policy, said: ""We are alarmed at the number of sexual assaults that are taking place inside school gates, where parents rightly expect that their children are kept safe. ""Children must be supported to recognise what constitutes abuse and harassment, teachers must ensure that victims understand they are not to blame."" Out of the forces that responded to the BBC, Greater Manchester Police reported the highest number of recorded offences: 475 in three years to 2017 In 2015, North Wales Police recorded 24 cases but that rose to 110 in 2017 In Hertfordshire, numbers more than doubled from 38 recorded cases in 2015 to 89 in 2017 Essex Police saw reported cases go up from 73 to 130 between 2015 and 2017 Three forces - Dyfed-Powys, Suffolk and Cumbria - saw numbers go down between 2015 and 2017 The victim told the BBC the guilty verdict helped her to deal with the ordeal. ""It took a massive weight off my shoulders to be listened to,"" she said. ""For most part I felt I was going mad. [I was] told in court I was a liar, but to be believed was a relief."" But she said it had been incredibly hard to stay at school, knowing her convicted attacker had been allowed to continue there too. ""I thought I wasn't going to see him. They said I'm their main priority. "" You can see more on this story on Inside Out on BBC One in the East of England at 19:30 GMT on Wednesday 20 February, and afterwards on the iPlayer.

UK vulnerable to Chinese 'interference',"Huawei has said it is independent and gives nothing to Beijing, aside from taxes The UK is vulnerable to Chinese influence and interference, according to a defence and security think tank. A report from the Royal United Services Institute (Rusi) said it would be ""naive"" and ""irresponsible"" to allow Chinese tech giant Huawei to access the UK's telecommunications system. The UK is currently reviewingwhether to allow the company to build new 5G phone networks. A spokesperson for the Chinese embassy said the claims were ""scaremongering"". The report, written by Charles Parton, a former British diplomat who spent most of his 30 year career working on China, said that if Huawei was allowed to participate in the rollout of the new 5G mobile networks it could install a ""hidden backdoor"", giving the Chinese government access to the system. It also warned of the risk of interference in other areas including academia, politics and technology. Huawei UK cyber-security risk 'manageable' Should we worry about Huawei? Why has the UK not blocked Huawei? While there has been ""widespread debate"" about Chinese interference in countries such as the US and Australia, Mr Parton told the BBC that the UK's response had been characterised by ""silence"". ""We need it out in the open,"" he said. The report describes how the Chinese Communist Party has tried to place its people as advisers to Western politicians. It also highlights what it calls ""elite capture"" - the appointment of former politicians, civil servants and businessmen to lucrative jobs after they leave office in which they promote Chinese interests. Mr Parton admitted that distinguishing between legitimate and illegitimate interference was a challenge. ""It's a spectrum,"" he said. While Russia seeks simply to disrupt, China, he said, primarily seeks to maintain the legitimacy of Communist Party rule in the country and limit dissent against it, as well as build support for its policies overseas. ""In many fields of interference what lies behind it is Chinese funding and that creates dependencies and either the overt threat or perhaps even just the fear that funding would be jeopardised,"" Mr Parton said. He argued this can lead to self-censorship, for instance in academia. Theresa May held trade talks with Chinese President Xi Jinping on a visit to Beijing last year Prof Steve Tsang, director of the Soas China Institute at the University of London, told the BBC he was aware of cases of Chinese pressure on other UK universities. ""In one Russell Group University a pro-vice chancellor was spoken to by someone in the Chinese embassy and as a result he stood a speaker who was already invited down,"" Prof Tsang said. ""I am also aware of a vice-chancellor again under pressure from the Chinese embassy asking one of his senior academics not to make political comments on China at a specified period of time."" Prof Tsang said it was hard to know how widespread the problem is since academics are cautious about speaking out. Mr Parton argued there needs to be more transparency about Chinese influence and especially funding when it comes to universities, think tanks and public life. A spokeswoman for the Chinese embassy told the BBC the report's claims of interference were ""groundless"". She said that in recent years, the China-UK ""Golden Era"" had yielded fruitful results including more Chinese investment in the UK in the past five years than the previous 30. ""Staying open and inclusive is key to maintaining UK's global influence,"" the spokeswoman said. ""China is willing to work with an open UK to deliver more benefits to the peoples of both countries and of the whole world."" Former PM takes on UK-China investment role The US cannot crush us, says Huawei boss Why Huawei matters in five charts There has been a shift in recent years in the UK's posture towards China, according to former national security officials. Under the then-Prime Minister David Cameron - who now works part-time for a China investment fund -  and his Chancellor George Osborne, economics tended to trump security and values, whereas under Theresa May, the balance has shifted back towards security. China itself is also evolving under President Xi Jinping, with the potential for greater divergence over values. And under Donald Trump,the US-China disputehas raised the temperature, with Washington also putting pressure on allies over the role Huawei in their infrastructure. The imminent approach of Brexit potentially complicates the issue since it could lead to the UK looking towards China more for trade and investment. But Mr Parton argued there was no reason relations cannot still be strong if they are based on clarity of the boundaries of what constitutes unacceptable interference. ""We need to be mature about our relationship,"" Mr Parton said. ""In this whole Chinese Communist Party interference debate let's not lose sight of the fact that it is very much in our interest to build up good relations with China -  just realistic ones.""

Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group,"Ms Ryan was chair of the Labour Friends of Israel group Joan Ryan has become the eighth Labour MP to quit the party in the past 48 hours, citing its tolerance of a ""culture of anti-Jewish racism"". The Enfield North MP said she was ""horrified, appalled and angered"" by Labour's failure to tackle anti-Semitism, saying its leadership allowed ""Jews to be abused with impunity"". Ms Ryan said she did not believe Jeremy Corbyn was fit to lead the country. Seven other MPs quit on Monday to form the Independent Group in Parliament. There is mounting speculation that a number of Conservative MPs disillusioned with the government's policy on Brexit could join forces with them. One source has told the BBC's assistant political editor, Norman Smith, to ""be on standby mode"". BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said Conservative whips were reporting three MPs - Sarah Wollaston, Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry - had gone ""very, very silent"". We'll listen to critics, vows McDonnell Labour MP sorry for Israeli breakaway claim Who are the Labour MPs resigning? While the Independent Group are not confirming anything, he said he had been told by one member that Wednesday would be a ""very busy day"". Announcing her decision on Twitter,external, Ms Ryan said she would continue to represent the north London seat in Parliament. On Tuesday, she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that she would not trigger a by-election in her constituency, as she won her seat in 2017 ""in spite of [Mr Corbyn], not because of him"". ""I didn't win my seat on his coat tails,"" she added. Ms Ryan, who served as a minister under Tony Blair, follows Chuka Umunna, Mike Gapes, Luciana Berger, Ann Coffey, Angela Smith, Gavin Shuker and Chris Leslie in quitting the party. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn: ""I regret that seven MPs decided they would no longer remain part of the Labour Party"" In her resignation statement, she said Mr Corbyn and the ""Stalinist clique which surrounds him"" was not providing real opposition at a moment of crisis for the country. Instead, she said the leadership was focused on ""purging their perceived ideological enemies within and obsessing over issues of little interest to British people"". Corbyn critics lose no-confidence votes Ms Ryan, chair of the Friends of Israel group, repeated Ms Berger's claim that the party had become ""institutionally anti-Semitic"", suggesting that under Mr Corbyn's leadership Israel had been ""singled out for demonisation and de-legitimisation"". ""The Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn has become infected with the scourge of anti-Jewish racism. The problem simply did not exist in the party before his election as leader. ""No previous Labour leader would have allowed this huge shame to befall the party. I have been horrified, appalled and angered to see the Labour leader's dereliction of duty in the face of this evil."" Ms Ryan lost a non-binding confidence vote of her party members in September which she blamed on ""Trots, Stalinists, Communists and the assorted hard left"". Conservative MP Phillip Lee told BBC Radio Berkshire he had considered leaving his party. He said: ""I do feel like my party is drifting from beneath me. There is this danger of some form of 'Ukip-lite' party developingâ¦ and I don't remember a vote of the parliamentary party to become the Brexit Party. ""So yes, I'd be lyingâ¦if I hadn't considered all these things. But my own firm belief isâ¦the Conservative Party has always been a broad church. I'm going to stand and fight until it ceases to be so."" Members of the Independent Group, who have cited what they say is a culture of bullying in the party and Labour's stance on Brexit for quitting, welcomed Ms Ryan's decision to join them. Mr Shuker, the MP for Luton South, tweeted that the group was ""building something powerful together"". The seven have said their grouping could be the basis for a new political party and have urged like-minded MPs from other parties to join them. Mr Corbyn has said he wants to ""take MPs with him"" but insisted that the direction he has taken the party in since 2015 is hugely popular within the country. Chris Williamson, the MP for Derby North, said he was ""not entirely surprised"" by Ms Ryan's exit. ""She was probably facing a de-selection in any event,"" he told BBC's Newsnight. He said he had never known Labour to be ""more united"" than it was now and it was ""regrettable that a minority of MPs"" were out of step with the popular mood in the country. The embryonic Independent Group of MPs has no leader but has set out its principles Labour has suggested MPs who change political allegiance have a duty to seek a fresh mandate from their constituents. The party is considering giving voters the power to force MPs who switch parties between general elections to face by-elections by strengthening the existing recall laws. In a statement released before the news of Ms Ryan's exit, shadow Cabinet minister Jon Trickett said voters should not have to wait years to hold to account MPs who they believe are not ""properly representing their interests"".

Asda faces 'challenging' trade,"Supermarket chain Asda has reported a slowdown in sales growth amid another ""challenging year"" for retailers. In the final three months of 2018, like-for-like sales grew 1%, compared with a 2% rise in the previous quarter. Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said that Brexit uncertainties were ""playing on our customers' minds"". Asda and rival Sainsbury's are waiting for the preliminary results of a UK competition probe into their proposed merger. The UK's competition regulator is looking into whether the proposed merger would leave shoppers facing higher prices or less choice. Despite the slowdown, this was still the seventh consecutive quarter of sales growth for Asda, which has been outpacing its potential partner. In January,Sainsbury's reported a 1.1% fall in like-for-like salesfor the comparable period. Supermarket mega-merger faces key decision Mr Burnley said: ""The year ahead looks no less turbulent than the last. ""Whilst I am pleased with our performance in 2018, we must remain focused on ensuring the long-term sustainable success of Asda for our customers."" He said 2018 had been another ""challenging"" period in retail, but that there had been higher demand for the grocer's own-brand products in the fourth quarter. The owner of Asda, US retail giant Walmart, also reported fourth quarter results on Tuesday. It posted strong like-for-like sales growth of 4.2% after a boost in online sales and higher consumer spending in the US. Thomas Brereton, a retail analyst at GlobalData, described Asda's results as ""lacklustre"". Mr Brereton said that ""the overall feeling will be that Asda has been somewhat unsuccessful in truly exploiting its rebuilt image over the festive period"", after returning to Black Friday sales and cutting prices to stay competitive with discounters. But he added that the latest results would be ""unlikely to create waves at either Sainsbury's or Asda"" as they only cover 13 weeks of sales. ""Exactly how the two businesses will merge remains an unclear but intriguing issue, with both owning significant market share - not only across food but also GM [general merchandise] and clothing.""

Crunch decision for mega-merger,"A key decision that could reshape the UK's supermarket sector is due at the end of April, with Sainsbury's and Asda waiting to hear if their proposed merger can go ahead. But initial indications do not look good. The UK's competition watchdog has saidthe proposed tie-up could push up pricesand cut choice for customers. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was ""likely to be difficult"" for the chains to ""address the concerns"". The CMA also said the merger could lead to a ""poorer shopping experience"". Should the deal go through in spite of those concerns, the combined group would knock Tesco off its perch as the UK's biggest supermarket chain. Sainsbury's and Asda - which is owned by US retail giant Walmart - are the second and third largest supermarket chains in the UK. The UK's grocery market is fiercely competitive. Sainsbury's and Asda are looking to respond to pressure from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, to be more competitive against Tesco, and to be able to counter online threats such as the rise of food delivery apps and Amazon. Richard Lim, chief executive of research consultancy Retail Economics, says the ""biggest driver here is about scale"". For example, by combining their businesses, the firms can push for the lowest prices from suppliers. The idea is that if one supermarket is paying 10p for a tin of beans, while the other is paying 11p, both supermarkets would now be able to pay the lower price. Sainsbury's expects to make cost savings of Â£350m just from this kind of ""price harmonisation"", Mr Lim says. However, MPs have warned it would not be easy to get the big suppliers to agree to this, meaning thousands of small suppliers could get squeezed. Chief executive Mike Coupe has said Sainsbury's would seek to make the savings from large suppliers, which provide the majority of its goods, rather than squeezing small suppliers. The supermarkets have pledged that as a result of the merger, prices would drop ""by around 10% on many of the products customers buy regularly"". Mr Lim says that, assuming Brexit goes smoothly, Sainsbury's and Asda would be able to pass cost savings on to consumers. However, critics have pointed out that Sainsbury's has not laid out which products would see falls in price, over what time scale, and exactly where the savings are going to come from. The most detail Sainsbury's has given was when Mr Coupe told the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee: ""We will lower the prices of everyday items. It's 18 months in the future, it's a very competitive market. It is impossible to speculate exactly about what those items will be, but they will be the kinds of things that people buy week in, week out: tinned tomatoes, pasta."" Gary Carter of the GMB union says members are ""worried and stressed"" due to uncertainty about their positions. ""People don't know what the merger will bring,"" he says. ""We've had a lot of comments from people: 'Will I have a job?', 'Will I be made redundant?', 'If I have a new job, who will my new employer be?'"" Asda employees are also wondering whether they would get pay parity with Sainsbury's colleagues, who get higher wages, he says. Mr Lim thinks it's inevitable that there will be job losses as the two firms combine operations. ""In the end it's inevitable to have fewer people working in the combined unit,"" he says. ""The motivation [for the merger] is driving down costs."" A merger between Sainsbury's and Asda, who plan to keep their brands separate, could potentially create a retail giant with more than 2,800 shops in the UK. The CMAlaunched its investigation into the proposed deal in August 2018. If it decides the merger can go ahead, it is likely to say that the two retailers must sell a certain number of stores to competitors. But the number of stores they have to get rid of, and how profitable those stores are, will determine whether the deal will turn out to be viable. Estimates range from between 70 to 300 stores that would have to be offered for sale. As part of its investigation, the CMA is looking at how closely Sainsbury's and Asda would compete with each other in stores and online, and whether competition from other retailers would be stifled. The scope of the investigation,externalincludes groceries, fuel, toys, electrical goods and children's clothing, and it is also looking at the impact on supermarkets' power over suppliers. Now that the CMA has published its provisional findings, supermarkets and other interested parties will be able to comment before the final decision. Chief executive Mike Coupe has described the CMA's analysis as ""fundamentally flawed"" and said the firm will be making ""very strong representations"" to it about its ""inaccuracy and lack of objectivity"". The supermarkets could decide to appeal against the final decision, should it go against them.

"Sainsbury's-Asda merger in jeopardyA merger between Sainsbury's and Asda could push up prices and cut choice, warns the competition watchdog.BusinessComments","Sainsbury's shares have dived 15% after the UK's competition watchdog cast doubt on its plan to buy Asda. Customers could see higher prices and less choice if the two grocers combined, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said. It said it could block the deal or force the sale of a large number of stores or even one of the brand names. However, it also said it was ""likely to be difficult"" for the chains to ""address the concerns"". Sainsbury's boss said the findings were ""outrageous"". In its provisional report on the proposed merger, the CMA also said the merger could lead to a ""poorer shopping experience"". Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group, said  it had found ""very significant competition concerns in a number of areas - they are to do with grocery shopping in supermarkets, grocery shopping online and the companies' petrol stations"". ""However, if one recognises that the competition concerns are quite broadly based... putting together a package of measures which addresses those concerns is likely to be complex and quite challenging,"" he said. Asda sales slow amid 'challenging' trade Supermarket mega-merger faces crunch decision Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts Business Live: Sainsbury's-Asda reaction But Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe described the CMA's analysis as ""fundamentally flawed"" and said the firm would be making ""very strong representations"" to it about its ""inaccuracy and lack of objectivity"". ""They have fundamentally moved the goalposts, changed the shape of the ball and chosen a different playing field,"" he told the BBC. ""This is totally outrageous."" Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter Supermarket bosses know that British competition regulators have always had a strong interest in the grocery market. There has been a string of inquiries over the last two decades, both into individual deals and the bigger question of how well the market serves consumer interests. So Sainsbury's board members would have been nervous when they proposed a takeover of Asda last year - but they did at least have the encouragement that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)  had approved a tie-up between Tesco and Booker just a few months earlier. Unfortunately for them, the light at the end of the tunnel turned out to be an oncoming train. The regulator has crushed Sainsbury's plans. There is no veto, but the strong language used, and the breadth of the problems found, suggest there is no way back. The firms will have a chance to respond to the CMA's provisional findings, before it publishes its final decision on 30 April. The watchdog said it had identified two potential remedies to the loss of competition: either blocking the merger entirely or forcing the sale of ""assets and operations"", including stores or even the Sainsbury's or Asda brands. However, it added that it ""currently considers that there is a significant risk that a divestiture will not be effective in this particular case"". The two chains would need to sell ""sufficient assets and operations to enable any purchaser to compete effectively as a national in-store grocery retailer"". It added that it may not be possible to achieve an effective solution to the loss of competition ""without also divesting one or other of the Asda or Sainsbury's brands, in addition to physical assets and operations"". The deal would create the UK's biggest supermarket chain,a business accounting for Â£1 in every Â£3 spent on groceries, with a 31.4% market share and 2,800 stores. The CMA's Mr McIntosh said: ""We have provisionally found that, should the two merge, shoppers could face higher prices, reduced quality and choice, and a poorer overall shopping experience across the UK. ""We also have concerns that prices could rise at a large number of their petrol stations."" However, in a joint statement, Sainsbury's and Asda said combining the two chains would create ""significant cost savings, which would allow us to lower prices"". ""Despite the savings being independently reviewed by two separate industry specialists, the CMA has chosen to discount them as benefits."" Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf said the CMA had ""basically kicked the Sainsbury-Asda merger into touch"". ""While the regulator left the door open for the supermarkets to sell off assets to complete the deal, it's clearly not keen on that solution. Sainsbury's and Asda would also have to find a suitable buyer for the assets on sale, one who is big enough to provide proper competition in the eyes of the regulator, he added. Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director for GlobalData, said the CMA's provisional findings had ""devastated any prospect of the merger going ahead"". ""The CMA has raised concerns about the tie-up in just about every conceivable way - on national and local grounds, on store and online competition concerns and on major stores, convenience stores and petrol stations.""

"UK young 'more likely to die from asthma'The UK lags behind other wealthy nations across a number of health indicators, a report finds.HealthComments","Young people in the UK are more likely to die from asthma than those in other wealthy countries, a report has found. Death rates for asthma in 10 to 24-year-olds was highest in the UK among all 14 European nations included in an analysis of 19 high-income countries. The UK also had the highest obesity rates for 15 to 19-year-olds among the European nations. The government said it had ""world-leading plans"" to safeguard child health. Overall, the report found the UK to be lagging behind other nations across a number of health indicators. Is young people's mental health getting worse? Children 'should be weighed up to 18' One in four young women has mental illness The study, from the Nuffield Trust think tank and and the Association for Young People's Health, analysed 17 measures of health and wellbeing for 10 to 24-year-olds in countries that included Germany, France and Italy, as well as Japan, the US and Australia. It found that while young people in the UK are making some healthier choices, such as drinking less alcohol and smoking less, more are entering adulthood with long-term health conditions. Nearly one in five young people in the UK is estimated to be living with a longstanding health condition, such as type 2 diabetes, the report finds. In England, the figure has gone from 13.5% in 2008 to 18% in 2016. The UK was also found to be one of the worst countries for young people to suffer from years lost to ill-health and the burden of their diseases, with only Australia, the US and New Zealand being worse. Children and young people in the UK are also far more likely to be obese if they are poor, with the UK having some of the highest inequalities between the richest and poorest when it comes to the proportion that are obese, the study found. On poverty among older age groups, the report said: ""Despite living in the world's fifth largest economy, young people aged 20 to 24 in the UK are experiencing one of the highest rates of severe material deprivation among the countries in our international comparison. ""Reducing poverty among young people is key to improving their health outcomes in the UK."" The report finds young people are smoking less and drinking less alcohol Overall, the UK sits in the bottom third of countries in nine out of 17 indicators, and in the top third in three. In four of the 17 measures, trends have been getting worse, while in five areas previous improvements have stalled. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said the study suggested health services in the UK were ""getting something badly wrong"". He said: ""I worry this reflects a dangerous complacency. ""Young people in the UK are entering adulthood with more long-term health conditions and, as a result a poorer quality of life, storing up problems further down the line. ""If we don't take action now, the next generation will be entering adulthood sicker than the one before it."" Asthma UK said it was ""appalling"" that people were more likely to die from asthma in the UK than in other European countries. The charity said its research has previously found that millennials - typically those born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s - get the worse asthma care of any age group. Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at Asthma UK, said: ""We are now urging the NHS to move with the times and put technology at the heart of asthma management, helping to engage this tech-savvy generation."" Emma Rigby, chief executive at the Association for Young People's Health, said there needed to be a greater understanding of young people's health needs. Researchers analysed data from the mid-1990s to the last year for which data was comparable with other countries, 2016. The 19 countries were: The UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Japan, US, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We have world-leading plans in place to safeguard child health by combating obesity, improving mental health and vaccinating against some of the world's deadliest diseases. ""Prevention is at the heart of the NHS Long Term Plan, and as part of this we are increasing funding by an average 3.4% per year, meaning that by 2023-24 it will receive Â£20.5bn a year more than it currently does.""

""This is unbelievable - it will take us some time to get our heads around this win and to organise ourselves,"" he said. ""This is a dream come true. ""We don't want this to change our lives. ""What is so exciting is that we will be able to share this money with children, grandchildren and extended family members."" One of the syndicate members realised their good fortune when she checked the winning ticket after Tuesday night's draw. She said: ""I heard on the RTÃ news that there was a win in Ireland and I caught the last three numbers. ""I checked the rest of the numbers online. ""I was numb! It took a bit of convincing everybody that we had won."" The family member put the winning ticket in an Argos catalogue and put it under her mattress for safe keeping. ""I didn't sleep a wink all night,"" she added. On Wednesday, the family deposited the winning ticket for safe keeping with the National Lottery and arrangements are now being made for the prize claim to be paid out in the next few weeks. The ticket was bought at Reilly's Daybreak in Naul. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""I don't know how the people felt who won it but I was in total shock, just total shock,"" he told BBC News NI. Mr Reilly said the win had whipped up excitement in Naul. ""I've never seen a buzz or anything like this. ""The whole village - a small village in a rural county - it's just buzzing, it's just amazing,"" he said. National Lottery spokeswoman Miriam Donohoe told the BBC the win ""will be a huge shock to the ticket holder"". She said it was the 14th EuroMillions win in Ireland. The previous biggest Irish winner was Dolores McNamara from Limerick, who won â¬115m (Â£100m) in 2005. Dermot Griffin, the CEO of the National Lottery, said that it has been ""an incredibly lucky period for players on the island of Ireland"". In Januarya couple from Northern Ireland won a EuroMillions Â£115m jackpot. Frances and Patrick Connolly, who live in Moira, County Down, matched the winning numbers in the New Year's Day draw. It was the fourth biggest UK EuroMillions win and the biggest in Northern Ireland. The jackpot has been rolling over since the start of January this year, and will see the winner pick up a cheque for â¬175,475,380.

PM to hold more Brexit talks in Brussels,"Prime Minister Theresa May will return to Brussels later to continue Brexit talks with the European Union. She is trying to renegotiate the Irish backstop - the insurance policy to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border. Mrs May is expected to request legally-binding assurances that the backstop will not extend indefinitely. However, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said he does not expect a ""breakthrough"" in talks. The backstop policy is part of the withdrawal agreement Mrs May agreed with the EU, and became one of the main reasons her Brexit deal was voted down in Parliament in January. Critics fear it would leave the UK tied to a customs union with the EU indefinitely and see Northern Ireland treated differently. MPs gave their backing for Mrs May to renegotiate the policy in a vote earlier this month and said she was ""working hard to secure the legally binding changes"" that Parliament wants. But the EU has consistently refused to make changes. Tories 'manipulated by Brexit zealots' Sturgeon to urge EU citizens to stay Brexit: A really simple guide Chancellor Philip Hammond said on Tuesday evening the government accepted the EU will not agree to replace the backstop arrangements for the Irish border with technological alternatives in time for the scheduled date of Brexit on 29 March. The so-called ""Malthouse Compromise"" - proposed by Remainers and Leavers - included proposals to use technology and checks away from the border to ensure the backstop was never activated. But Mr Hammond said he hoped the technological solution would form part of negotiations over the following 21 months on the UK's future relationship with the EU. He added that legally-binding changes to ensure the backstop does not become permanent ""would deliver the core of a majority for a deal in the House of Commons"". Leading Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker insisted they were happy with this arrangement, saying the Malthouse proposals were ""alive and kicking"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Jeremy Corbyn also announced he would be going to Brussels to meet the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Thursday. The Labour leader said they would discuss his party's Brexit proposals - including a permanent customs union and a strong relationship with the single market - and that it was a ""necessity"" to take no deal off the table. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay updated the Cabinet on talks with Mr Barnier on Tuesday. The meeting, on the issue of the Irish backstop, was described as ""productive"" but Mr Barnier ""expressed concerns"". At the time, a European Commission spokesman said: ""The EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement. ""We cannot accept a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause - and further talks will be held this week to see whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council."" The PM has promised that if she is unable to negotiate an amended deal by 26 February then she'll return to Parliament and allow a further day of debate, with further chances for MPs to vote, the following day.

Asda sales slow amid 'challenging' trade,"Supermarket chain Asda has reported a slowdown in sales growth amid another ""challenging year"" for retailers. In the final three months of 2018, like-for-like sales grew 1%, compared with a 2% rise in the previous quarter. Asda chief executive Roger Burnley said that Brexit uncertainties were ""playing on our customers' minds"". Asda and rival Sainsbury's are waiting for the preliminary results of a UK competition probe into their proposed merger. The UK's competition regulator is looking into whether the proposed merger would leave shoppers facing higher prices or less choice. Despite the slowdown, this was still the seventh consecutive quarter of sales growth for Asda, which has been outpacing its potential partner. In January,Sainsbury's reported a 1.1% fall in like-for-like salesfor the comparable period. Supermarket mega-merger faces key decision Mr Burnley said: ""The year ahead looks no less turbulent than the last. ""Whilst I am pleased with our performance in 2018, we must remain focused on ensuring the long-term sustainable success of Asda for our customers."" He said 2018 had been another ""challenging"" period in retail, but that there had been higher demand for the grocer's own-brand products in the fourth quarter. The owner of Asda, US retail giant Walmart, also reported fourth quarter results on Tuesday. It posted strong like-for-like sales growth of 4.2% after a boost in online sales and higher consumer spending in the US. Thomas Brereton, a retail analyst at GlobalData, described Asda's results as ""lacklustre"". Mr Brereton said that ""the overall feeling will be that Asda has been somewhat unsuccessful in truly exploiting its rebuilt image over the festive period"", after returning to Black Friday sales and cutting prices to stay competitive with discounters. But he added that the latest results would be ""unlikely to create waves at either Sainsbury's or Asda"" as they only cover 13 weeks of sales. ""Exactly how the two businesses will merge remains an unclear but intriguing issue, with both owning significant market share - not only across food but also GM [general merchandise] and clothing.""

Supermarket mega-merger faces crunch decision,"A key decision that could reshape the UK's supermarket sector is due at the end of April, with Sainsbury's and Asda waiting to hear if their proposed merger can go ahead. But initial indications do not look good. The UK's competition watchdog has saidthe proposed tie-up could push up pricesand cut choice for customers. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said it was ""likely to be difficult"" for the chains to ""address the concerns"". The CMA also said the merger could lead to a ""poorer shopping experience"". Should the deal go through in spite of those concerns, the combined group would knock Tesco off its perch as the UK's biggest supermarket chain. Sainsbury's and Asda - which is owned by US retail giant Walmart - are the second and third largest supermarket chains in the UK. The UK's grocery market is fiercely competitive. Sainsbury's and Asda are looking to respond to pressure from discounters such as Aldi and Lidl, to be more competitive against Tesco, and to be able to counter online threats such as the rise of food delivery apps and Amazon. Richard Lim, chief executive of research consultancy Retail Economics, says the ""biggest driver here is about scale"". For example, by combining their businesses, the firms can push for the lowest prices from suppliers. The idea is that if one supermarket is paying 10p for a tin of beans, while the other is paying 11p, both supermarkets would now be able to pay the lower price. Sainsbury's expects to make cost savings of Â£350m just from this kind of ""price harmonisation"", Mr Lim says. However, MPs have warned it would not be easy to get the big suppliers to agree to this, meaning thousands of small suppliers could get squeezed. Chief executive Mike Coupe has said Sainsbury's would seek to make the savings from large suppliers, which provide the majority of its goods, rather than squeezing small suppliers. The supermarkets have pledged that as a result of the merger, prices would drop ""by around 10% on many of the products customers buy regularly"". Mr Lim says that, assuming Brexit goes smoothly, Sainsbury's and Asda would be able to pass cost savings on to consumers. However, critics have pointed out that Sainsbury's has not laid out which products would see falls in price, over what time scale, and exactly where the savings are going to come from. The most detail Sainsbury's has given was when Mr Coupe told the Environment Food and Rural Affairs Select Committee: ""We will lower the prices of everyday items. It's 18 months in the future, it's a very competitive market. It is impossible to speculate exactly about what those items will be, but they will be the kinds of things that people buy week in, week out: tinned tomatoes, pasta."" Gary Carter of the GMB union says members are ""worried and stressed"" due to uncertainty about their positions. ""People don't know what the merger will bring,"" he says. ""We've had a lot of comments from people: 'Will I have a job?', 'Will I be made redundant?', 'If I have a new job, who will my new employer be?'"" Asda employees are also wondering whether they would get pay parity with Sainsbury's colleagues, who get higher wages, he says. Mr Lim thinks it's inevitable that there will be job losses as the two firms combine operations. ""In the end it's inevitable to have fewer people working in the combined unit,"" he says. ""The motivation [for the merger] is driving down costs."" A merger between Sainsbury's and Asda, who plan to keep their brands separate, could potentially create a retail giant with more than 2,800 shops in the UK. The CMAlaunched its investigation into the proposed deal in August 2018. If it decides the merger can go ahead, it is likely to say that the two retailers must sell a certain number of stores to competitors. But the number of stores they have to get rid of, and how profitable those stores are, will determine whether the deal will turn out to be viable. Estimates range from between 70 to 300 stores that would have to be offered for sale. As part of its investigation, the CMA is looking at how closely Sainsbury's and Asda would compete with each other in stores and online, and whether competition from other retailers would be stifled. The scope of the investigation,externalincludes groceries, fuel, toys, electrical goods and children's clothing, and it is also looking at the impact on supermarkets' power over suppliers. Now that the CMA has published its provisional findings, supermarkets and other interested parties will be able to comment before the final decision. Chief executive Mike Coupe has described the CMA's analysis as ""fundamentally flawed"" and said the firm will be making ""very strong representations"" to it about its ""inaccuracy and lack of objectivity"". The supermarkets could decide to appeal against the final decision, should it go against them.

IS teenager's family consider legal action,"This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Shamima Begum - the teenager who fled London to join Islamic State - has said she only has ""one citizenship"" and it was wrong for the UK to revoke it without speaking to her first. It is only possible to strip someone of their UK nationality if they are eligible for citizenship elsewhere. It is thought Ms Begum has Bangladeshi citizenship through her mother. But the Bangladesh foreign ministry said the matter had nothing to do with the country. The 19-year-old told BBC News she had hoped the UK would understand she made a ""very big mistake"" by joining IS. She was a schoolgirl when she left Bethnal Green in 2015, and was found in a Syrian refugee camp last week after reportedly leaving Baghuz - IS's last stronghold. She gave birth to a son at the weekend and now wants to return home. While he said he would not comment on individual cases, Home Secretary Sajid Javid has suggested Ms Begum's baby could still be British. He told the Commons ""Children should not suffer. So, if a parent does lose their British citizenship, it does not affect the rights of their child."" 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' IS teenager to lose UK citizenship Ms Begum's mother is believed to be a Bangladeshi national, and lawyers have told the BBC that under Bangledesh law this means Ms Begum is automatically a citizen of the country as well. But Ms Begum told the BBC's Middle East correspondent Quentin Sommerville: ""I wasn't born in Bangladesh, I've never seen Bangladesh and I don't even speak Bengali properly, so how can they claim I have Bangladeshi citizenship. ""I have one citizenship... and if you take that away from me, I don't have anything. I don't think they are allowed to do that. ""This is a life changing decision and they haven't even spoke[n] to me."" She continued: ""I was hoping Britain would understand I made a mistake, a very big mistake, because I was young and naive."" She said she changed her mind about IS after they imprisoned and tortured her Dutch husband - an armed jihadi. Escape was impossible, she claimed: ""They'd kill you if you tried."" She added that she understood the anger about her wanting to come home. ""I understand why you don't want to be sympathetic because of everything IS did... and claiming it's all for the sake of Islam... it's really not,"" she said. Mr Javid said the power to deprive a person of citizenship was only used ""in extreme circumstances"", for example, ""when someone turns their back on the fundamental values and supports terror"". ""We must put the safety and security of our country first,"" he added. But shadow home secretary Diane Abbott accused him of breaching the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which states that ""no-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of their nationality"". Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Earlier, Ms Begum, 19,told ITV News,externalthat she found the Home Office's decision ""heartbreaking"", but she may try for Dutch citizenship via her husband. He is a Dutch convert to Islam and is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters about two weeks ago. The lawyer for Ms Begum's family,Tasnime Akunjee, said,externalthey were considering ""all legal avenues"" to contest the Home Office decision. Hetold the Independent,externalthat the Bangladesh government ""does not know who she is"", adding: ""Our position is that to all practical purposes she has been made stateless."" Under the1981 British Nationality Act,external, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result. Ms Begum has the right to challenge the Home Office's decision either by tribunal or judicial review, said former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation Lord Carlile, but would have to prove the home secretary had acted disproportionately. He said it was a ""complex issue"" which ""could run for a very long time through the courts"", and Ms Begum could stay where she is ""for maybe two years at least"". Lord Carlile said her baby may be entitled to British, Dutch and Bangladeshi nationality. By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Lawyers have told the BBC that under Bangladesh law, a UK national like Ms Begum who is born to a Bangladeshi parent is automatically a Bangladeshi citizen. That means that such a person would have dual nationality. The Bangladeshi authorities however assert Ms Begum is not a Bangledeshi citizen. Under this ""blood line"" law, Bangladeshi nationality and citizenship lapse when a person reaches the age of 21, unless they make active efforts to retain it. So, it is Ms Begum's age, 19, that is likely - in part - to have given Home Office lawyers and the home secretary reassurance there was a legal basis for stripping her of her UK citizenship. In 2017, the government lost an appeal case brought by two British citizens of Bangladeshi origin who were stripped of their citizenship when they were abroad. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission ruled that E3 and N3 had not tried to retain their citizenship before they reached the age of 21, and so it had automatically lapsed. That meant that the decision to strip them of their UK citizenship had rendered them stateless. Ms Begum's case is different. Her Bangladeshi citizenship, if established, would remain intact until she reaches 21, even if she has never visited the country or made active efforts to retain her citizenship. Former Conservative Home Secretary Ken Clarke said refusing Britons who joined IS the right to return would be a ""great boost for jihadism"" as the ""hundreds of foreign jihadis stuck in camps in northern Syria"" would be further radicalised. And MP Joanna Cherry, the SNP's spokeswoman for justice and home affairs,said,externalthe home secretary's actions were ""more about his leadership ambitions than security issues or due process"". After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? IS 'traps 200 families' in last bastion Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once controlled, but an estimated 300 militants are believed to be left in a 0.5 sq km area near Syria's border with Iraq. Mr Javid told MPs earlier this week that more than 100 dual nationals had already lost their UK citizenship after travelling in support of terrorist groups. Last year, two British men, accused of being members of an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles""were stripped of their citizenshipafter being captured in Syria. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK In aninterview with the BBCon Monday, Ms Begum said she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and now simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. She left the UK with two school friends, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase. Ms Sultana is thought to be dead, while the fate of Ms Abase is unknown.

UK young 'more likely to die from asthma',"Young people in the UK are more likely to die from asthma than those in other wealthy countries, a report has found. Death rates for asthma in 10 to 24-year-olds was highest in the UK among all 14 European nations included in an analysis of 19 high-income countries. The UK also had the highest obesity rates for 15 to 19-year-olds among the European nations. The government said it had ""world-leading plans"" to safeguard child health. Overall, the report found the UK to be lagging behind other nations across a number of health indicators. Is young people's mental health getting worse? Children 'should be weighed up to 18' One in four young women has mental illness The study, from the Nuffield Trust think tank and and the Association for Young People's Health, analysed 17 measures of health and wellbeing for 10 to 24-year-olds in countries that included Germany, France and Italy, as well as Japan, the US and Australia. It found that while young people in the UK are making some healthier choices, such as drinking less alcohol and smoking less, more are entering adulthood with long-term health conditions. Nearly one in five young people in the UK is estimated to be living with a longstanding health condition, such as type 2 diabetes, the report finds. In England, the figure has gone from 13.5% in 2008 to 18% in 2016. The UK was also found to be one of the worst countries for young people to suffer from years lost to ill-health and the burden of their diseases, with only Australia, the US and New Zealand being worse. Children and young people in the UK are also far more likely to be obese if they are poor, with the UK having some of the highest inequalities between the richest and poorest when it comes to the proportion that are obese, the study found. On poverty among older age groups, the report said: ""Despite living in the world's fifth largest economy, young people aged 20 to 24 in the UK are experiencing one of the highest rates of severe material deprivation among the countries in our international comparison. ""Reducing poverty among young people is key to improving their health outcomes in the UK."" The report finds young people are smoking less and drinking less alcohol Overall, the UK sits in the bottom third of countries in nine out of 17 indicators, and in the top third in three. In four of the 17 measures, trends have been getting worse, while in five areas previous improvements have stalled. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said the study suggested health services in the UK were ""getting something badly wrong"". He said: ""I worry this reflects a dangerous complacency. ""Young people in the UK are entering adulthood with more long-term health conditions and, as a result a poorer quality of life, storing up problems further down the line. ""If we don't take action now, the next generation will be entering adulthood sicker than the one before it."" Asthma UK said it was ""appalling"" that people were more likely to die from asthma in the UK than in other European countries. The charity said its research has previously found that millennials - typically those born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s - get the worse asthma care of any age group. Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at Asthma UK, said: ""We are now urging the NHS to move with the times and put technology at the heart of asthma management, helping to engage this tech-savvy generation."" Emma Rigby, chief executive at the Association for Young People's Health, said there needed to be a greater understanding of young people's health needs. Researchers analysed data from the mid-1990s to the last year for which data was comparable with other countries, 2016. The 19 countries were: The UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Japan, US, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We have world-leading plans in place to safeguard child health by combating obesity, improving mental health and vaccinating against some of the world's deadliest diseases. ""Prevention is at the heart of the NHS Long Term Plan, and as part of this we are increasing funding by an average 3.4% per year, meaning that by 2023-24 it will receive Â£20.5bn a year more than it currently does.""

"Breaking|Breaking newsSainsbury's-Asda merger in jeopardyA merger between Sainsbury's and Asda could be worse for shoppers, warns the competition watchdog.Business","Sainsbury's shares have dived 15% after the UK's competition watchdog cast doubt on its plan to buy Asda. Customers could see higher prices and less choice if the two grocers combined, the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) said. It said it could block the deal or force the sale of a large number of stores or even one of the brand names. However, it also said it was ""likely to be difficult"" for the chains to ""address the concerns"". Sainsbury's boss said the findings were ""outrageous"". In its provisional report on the proposed merger, the CMA also said the merger could lead to a ""poorer shopping experience"". Stuart McIntosh, chair of the CMA's independent inquiry group, said  it had found ""very significant competition concerns in a number of areas - they are to do with grocery shopping in supermarkets, grocery shopping online and the companies' petrol stations"". ""However, if one recognises that the competition concerns are quite broadly based... putting together a package of measures which addresses those concerns is likely to be complex and quite challenging,"" he said. Asda sales slow amid 'challenging' trade Supermarket mega-merger faces crunch decision Sainsbury's-Asda deal in nine charts Business Live: Sainsbury's-Asda reaction But Sainsbury's chief executive Mike Coupe described the CMA's analysis as ""fundamentally flawed"" and said the firm would be making ""very strong representations"" to it about its ""inaccuracy and lack of objectivity"". ""They have fundamentally moved the goalposts, changed the shape of the ball and chosen a different playing field,"" he told the BBC. ""This is totally outrageous."" Dominic O'Connell, Today business presenter Supermarket bosses know that British competition regulators have always had a strong interest in the grocery market. There has been a string of inquiries over the last two decades, both into individual deals and the bigger question of how well the market serves consumer interests. So Sainsbury's board members would have been nervous when they proposed a takeover of Asda last year - but they did at least have the encouragement that the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)  had approved a tie-up between Tesco and Booker just a few months earlier. Unfortunately for them, the light at the end of the tunnel turned out to be an oncoming train. The regulator has crushed Sainsbury's plans. There is no veto, but the strong language used, and the breadth of the problems found, suggest there is no way back. The firms will have a chance to respond to the CMA's provisional findings, before it publishes its final decision on 30 April. The watchdog said it had identified two potential remedies to the loss of competition: either blocking the merger entirely or forcing the sale of ""assets and operations"", including stores or even the Sainsbury's or Asda brands. However, it added that it ""currently considers that there is a significant risk that a divestiture will not be effective in this particular case"". The two chains would need to sell ""sufficient assets and operations to enable any purchaser to compete effectively as a national in-store grocery retailer"". It added that it may not be possible to achieve an effective solution to the loss of competition ""without also divesting one or other of the Asda or Sainsbury's brands, in addition to physical assets and operations"". The deal would create the UK's biggest supermarket chain,a business accounting for Â£1 in every Â£3 spent on groceries, with a 31.4% market share and 2,800 stores. The CMA's Mr McIntosh said: ""We have provisionally found that, should the two merge, shoppers could face higher prices, reduced quality and choice, and a poorer overall shopping experience across the UK. ""We also have concerns that prices could rise at a large number of their petrol stations."" However, in a joint statement, Sainsbury's and Asda said combining the two chains would create ""significant cost savings, which would allow us to lower prices"". ""Despite the savings being independently reviewed by two separate industry specialists, the CMA has chosen to discount them as benefits."" Hargreaves Lansdown senior analyst Laith Khalaf said the CMA had ""basically kicked the Sainsbury-Asda merger into touch"". ""While the regulator left the door open for the supermarkets to sell off assets to complete the deal, it's clearly not keen on that solution. Sainsbury's and Asda would also have to find a suitable buyer for the assets on sale, one who is big enough to provide proper competition in the eyes of the regulator, he added. Patrick O'Brien, UK retail research director for GlobalData, said the CMA's provisional findings had ""devastated any prospect of the merger going ahead"". ""The CMA has raised concerns about the tie-up in just about every conceivable way - on national and local grounds, on store and online competition concerns and on major stores, convenience stores and petrol stations.""

""What is so exciting is that we will be able to share this money with children, grandchildren and extended family members."" One of the syndicate members realised their good fortune when she checked the winning ticket after Tuesday night's draw. She said: ""I heard on the RTÃ news that there was a win in Ireland and I caught the last three numbers. ""I checked the rest of the numbers online. ""I was numb!

"Drone no-fly zone near airports extendedIt will be illegal to fly a drone within three miles of an airport, following drone disruption at Gatwick.Business","The no-fly zone for drones around airports is to be extended following the disruption at Gatwick in December, the government says. From 13 March it will be illegal to fly a drone within three miles of an airport, rather than the current 0.6-mile (1km) exclusion zone. The government also said it wants police to have new stop and search powers to tackle drone misuse. Gatwick was shut for more than a day after drone sightings near the runway. It caused chaos for travellers, affecting more than 1,000 flights and about 140,000 passengers. Gatwick drones were in critical areas Drone sighting disrupts Heathrow flights Since then airports have been trying to improve their procedures to detect drones, but they continue to see illegal flights near their perimeters. In Januarydepartures at Heathrow were temporarily stoppedafter a drone was reportedly sighted. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The law is clear that flying a drone near an airport is a serious criminal act. ""We're now going even further and extending the no-fly zone to help keep our airports secure and our skies safe. ""Anyone flying their drone within the vicinity of an airport should know they are not only acting irresponsibly, but criminally, and could face imprisonment."" There were sightings of drones at Gatwick in December It is already illegal to fly a drone above 400ft or within 1km of an airport boundary, and those who recklessly or negligently endanger an aircraft with a drone face up to five years in jail. The government said the new stop and search powers would apply to people suspected of using drones maliciously nears airports. The powers, to be included in the government's new Drones Bill, would also allow police to access electronic data stored on a drone. The Association of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (Arpas UK), which represents the drone industry, welcomed the wider no-fly zone but cautioned on the stop-and-search plans. ""Police will need to know exactly what the rules are and in exercising their powers do so in the right way,"" said Rupert Dent, an Arpas UK committee member. ""We are keen it doesn't prevent legitimate operators from operating drones in a legitimate fashion."" Following the Gatwick disruption, Sussex Police arrested a drone enthusiast and his partner who lived near the airport, but they were released without charge on 23 December, having been cleared of any involvement. In a statement Sussex Police said they had still not found the perpetrators, despite having 130 eyewitness accounts of illegal drone flights. ""We continue our criminal investigation, which is challenging in its scale and in the type and quality of evidence immediately available,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Despite a reward of Â£50,000 for public information leading police to the person or persons responsible, we have not received the critical information that we believed exists within the community.""

IS teenager to lose UK citizenship,"This video can not be played On Monday Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Shamima Begum, who joined the Islamic State group in Syria aged 15, is to lose her UK citizenship. Whitehall sources said it was possible to strip the 19-year-old of British nationality as she was eligible for citizenship of another country. Herfamily's lawyer, Tasnime Akunjee, said they were ""disappointed"",externalwith the decision and were considering ""all legal avenues"" to challenge it. Ms Begum, who left east London in 2015, had said she wanted to return home. She was found in a Syrian refugee camp last week after reportedly leaving Baghuz - IS's last stronghold - and gave birth to a son at the weekend. In aninterview with the BBC on Monday,Ms Begum said she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and now simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. ITV News obtained the letter,externalsent to Ms Begum's mother, asking her to inform her daughter of the decision. Under the1981 British Nationality Act,external, a person can be deprived of their citizenship if the home secretary is satisfied it would be ""conducive to the public good"" and they would not become stateless as a result. Ms Begum said she travelled to Syria with her sister's UK passport but it was taken from her when she crossed the border. 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? IS 'traps 200 families' in last bastion She is believed to be of Bangladeshi heritage but when asked by the BBC, she said did not have a Bangladesh passport and had never been to the country. On the question of Ms Begum's son, a child born to a British parent before they are deprived of their citizenship would still be considered British. While it would theoretically be possible for the UK to then remove citizenship from the child, officials would need to balance their rights against any potential threat they posed. Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 A Home Office spokesman said: ""In recent days the home secretary has clearly stated that his priority is the safety and security of Britain and the people who live here."" He said the department did not comment on individual cases but decisions to remove citizenship were ""based on all available evidence and not taken lightly"". Lord Carlile, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said that if Ms Begum's mother was a Bangladeshi national - as is believed to be the case - under Bangladesh law Ms Begum would be too. Dal Babu, a former Metropolitan Police chief superintendent and friend of Ms Begum's family, said they were ""very surprised"" by what seemed to be a ""kneejerk reaction"" by the Home Office. Stressing that Ms Begum had never been to Bangladesh, Mr Babu said: ""It seems to be a bizarre decision and I'm not entirely sure how that will stand up legally."" Conservative MP George Freeman said the move was a ""mistake"" that would set a ""dangerous precedent"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Liberal Democrats MP Ed Davey said Ms Begum should be allowed to return to the UK. He said: ""Membership of a terrorist group is a serious crime, as is encouraging or supporting terrorism, but Shamima Begum should face justice for those crimes in the UK."" A friend of Ms Begum's family, Dal Babu, said the Home Office's decision was ""bizarre"" Islamic State has lost most of the territory it once controlled, but between 1,000 and 1,500 militants are believed to be left in a 50 sq km (20 sq mile) near Syria's border with Iraq. Mr Javid told MPs earlier this week that more than 100 dual nationals had already lost their UK citizenship after travelling in support of terrorist groups. Last year, two British men, accused of being members of an IS cell dubbed ""The Beatles""were stripped of their citizenshipafter being captured in Syria. Ms Begum has said she does not regret travelling to Syria, however, she said she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She told the BBC she was ""shocked"" by the2017 Manchester Arena attack- which killed 22 people and was claimed by IS - but she also compared it to military assaults on IS strongholds, saying it was ""retaliation"". Robbie Potter was injured in the Manchester Arena attack Robbie Potter, who was seriously injured in the attack while he waited for his children in the foyer of Manchester Arena, said he felt ""angry"" and sickened by Ms Begum's comments. Ms Begum left the UK with two school friends, Kadiza Sultana and Amira Abase in February 2015. Ms Sultana is thought to have died when a house was blown up, and the fate of Ms Abase is unknown. Kadiza Sultana, Amira Abase and Shamima Begum (l-r) in photos issued by police after they left the UK Ms Begum gave birth to a baby boy last weekend, having previously lost two children. Her husband, a Dutch convert to Islam, is thought to have surrendered to a group of Syrian fighters about two weeks ago. Ms Begum has the right to appeal the Home Office's decision.

IS 'traps 200 families',"Some 20,000 people who have fled Baghuz in recent weeks have been taken to a camp The UN has expressed concern about the fate of some 200 families reportedly trapped in the last tiny area of Syria still held by the Islamic State group. Human rights chief Michelle Bachelet said they were apparently being prevented from leaving by IS militants. They were also being subjected to intense bombardment by US-led coalition and allied Syrian forces, she added. On Tuesday evening, dozens of lorries reportedly arrived on the outskirts of the IS enclave to evacuate civilians. Could a defeated IS rebound? The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, a UK-based monitoring group, cited its sources as saying wives and children of militants would be taken to an undisclosed location as part of a deal with the coalition. Earlier, it reported that a request by militants to be given safe passage to the opposition-held Syrian province of Idlib or neighbouring Iraq had been rejected by the US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) alliance. IS militants are reportedly confined to tents pitched on top of a network of tunnels and caves SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali appeared to dismiss such an idea on Tuesday morning, insisting the militants had ""only two options - either they surrender or they will be killed in battle"". ""We are working on secluding and evacuating civilians and then we will attack. This could happen soon,"" Mr Bali was quoted as saying by AFP news agency. After the caliphate: Has IS been defeated? How many IS foreign fighters are left? Five years ago, IS controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. It proclaimed the creation of a ""caliphate"", imposing its brutal rule on almost eight million people and generating billions of dollars from oil, extortion, robbery and kidnapping. Now, an estimated 300 militants and hundreds of civilians are surrounded inside about 0.5 sq km (0.2 square miles) of land in the Baghuz area, which is in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, near the border with Iraq. ""Civilians continue to be used as pawns by the various parties,"" Ms Bachelet said. ""I call on them to provide safe passage to those who wish to flee, while those wish to remain must also be protected as much as possible. ""They should not be sacrificed to ideology on the one hand, or military expediency on the other. If protecting civilian lives means taking a few more days to capture the last fraction of land controlled by [IS], then so be it."" US-backed SDF fighters launched an assault on Baghuz this month Although no-one has reportedly made it out of Baghuz in the past three days, some 20,000 civilians have been taken by the SDF to a makeshift camp for displaced people at al-Hol, in Hassakeh province, in recent weeks. Among them are the wives and children of IS militants and many foreign nationals, including the British teenager Shamima Begum, who was 15 when she ran away from her home to join IS four years ago. The International Rescue Committee (IRC) said on Monday that at least 62 people had died on their way to al-Hol, two thirds of them children under the age of one. Exhaustion and malnutrition were the principal causes of the deaths. This video can not be played On Monday Shamima Begum told the BBC she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" Ms Bachelet also said she was alarmed by an upsurge in attacks and civilian casualties in Idlib province, where a takeover by a jihadist group linked to al-Qaeda, Hayat Tahrir al-Sham, has jeopardised a truce brokered by Turkey and Russia in September. The Syrian government's bombardment of a demilitarised buffer zone, which runs along the frontline in Idlib and areas of northern Hama and western Aleppo provinces, started to escalate in December and has further intensified in recent days, according to the UN. Islamic State group: The full story At the same time, there has been an increase in fighting among rebel and jihadist factions, and also in the use of improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in areas they control. On Monday, at least 16 civilians, including women and children, were reportedly killed by two bomb explosions in the Qusour district of Idlib city. The second blast appeared to have been designed to kill those, including medical workers, coming to the aid of victims of the first. Another nine civilians, including four women and two boys, were meanwhile reportedly killed by government strikes on Khan Sheikhoun on Friday and Saturday.

PM to hold more Brexit talks in BrusselsTheresa May will meet Jean-Claude Juncker for further talks over her Brexit deal.UK PoliticsComments,"Prime Minister Theresa May will return to Brussels later to continue Brexit talks with the European Union. She is trying to renegotiate the Irish backstop - the insurance policy to prevent the return of customs checks on the Irish border. Mrs May is expected to request legally-binding assurances that the backstop will not extend indefinitely. However, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker has said he does not expect a ""breakthrough"" in talks. The backstop policy is part of the withdrawal agreement Mrs May agreed with the EU, and became one of the main reasons her Brexit deal was voted down in Parliament in January. Critics fear it would leave the UK tied to a customs union with the EU indefinitely and see Northern Ireland treated differently. MPs gave their backing for Mrs May to renegotiate the policy in a vote earlier this month and said she was ""working hard to secure the legally binding changes"" that Parliament wants. But the EU has consistently refused to make changes. Tories 'manipulated by Brexit zealots' Sturgeon to urge EU citizens to stay Brexit: A really simple guide Chancellor Philip Hammond said on Tuesday evening the government accepted the EU will not agree to replace the backstop arrangements for the Irish border with technological alternatives in time for the scheduled date of Brexit on 29 March. The so-called ""Malthouse Compromise"" - proposed by Remainers and Leavers - included proposals to use technology and checks away from the border to ensure the backstop was never activated. But Mr Hammond said he hoped the technological solution would form part of negotiations over the following 21 months on the UK's future relationship with the EU. He added that legally-binding changes to ensure the backstop does not become permanent ""would deliver the core of a majority for a deal in the House of Commons"". Leading Brexiteers Jacob Rees-Mogg and Steve Baker insisted they were happy with this arrangement, saying the Malthouse proposals were ""alive and kicking"". This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Jeremy Corbyn also announced he would be going to Brussels to meet the EU's chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, on Thursday. The Labour leader said they would discuss his party's Brexit proposals - including a permanent customs union and a strong relationship with the single market - and that it was a ""necessity"" to take no deal off the table. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay updated the Cabinet on talks with Mr Barnier on Tuesday. The meeting, on the issue of the Irish backstop, was described as ""productive"" but Mr Barnier ""expressed concerns"". At the time, a European Commission spokesman said: ""The EU27 will not reopen the withdrawal agreement. ""We cannot accept a time limit to the backstop or a unilateral exit clause - and further talks will be held this week to see whether a way through can be found that would gain the broadest possible support in the UK parliament and respect the guidelines agreed by the European Council."" The PM has promised that if she is unable to negotiate an amended deal by 26 February then she'll return to Parliament and allow a further day of debate, with further chances for MPs to vote, the following day.

Emoji plates to brighten up Queensland cars,"If a personalised number plate simply isn't enough to express your complex personality, worry not - soon you will be able to add an emoji to the mix. Ok, you'll have to move to Queensland, Australia - but once that's sorted, you can get your own little smiley starting next month. The emojis will cost you some extra of course, and are only for decoration. Oh, and only a few positive faces are allowed, so you'd better be a chirpy driver or else things won't match up. Your choice will be limited to laughing out loud, a winking face emoji, the cool sunglasses, the heart eyes, and the good old standard smiley face. Why emojis mean different things in different cultures Could an emoji save your life? The symbols won't be part of the sequence to identify your car, though; that will still be down to the letters and numbers on the plate. According to local media, the Royal Automobile Club of Queensland (RACQ) has no issue with the new scheme. Spokeswoman Rebecca Michael told 7News Brisbane it was no different from drivers putting the logo of their favourite sports team on a plate. ""For quite some time we've seen that you can support your favourite team or your favourite town with a symbol on your number plate. And using an emoji is no different,"" she said. Social media reactions to the new plates have ranged from enthusiasm to irony and disdain. While some can't wait to get one, others have branded the idea a bit tacky or vain. Disability-themed emojis approved for use And of course, some said they'd be keener if the full spectrum of emojis was available - everything from angry faces to... well, the cartoon poop.

Drone no-fly zone near airports extended,"The no-fly zone for drones around airports is to be extended following the disruption at Gatwick in December, the government says. From 13 March it will be illegal to fly a drone within three miles of an airport, rather than the current 0.6-mile (1km) exclusion zone. The government also said it wants police to have new stop and search powers to tackle drone misuse. Gatwick was shut for more than a day after drone sightings near the runway. It caused chaos for travellers, affecting more than 1,000 flights and about 140,000 passengers. Gatwick drones were in critical areas Drone sighting disrupts Heathrow flights Since then airports have been trying to improve their procedures to detect drones, but they continue to see illegal flights near their perimeters. In Januarydepartures at Heathrow were temporarily stoppedafter a drone was reportedly sighted. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""The law is clear that flying a drone near an airport is a serious criminal act. ""We're now going even further and extending the no-fly zone to help keep our airports secure and our skies safe. ""Anyone flying their drone within the vicinity of an airport should know they are not only acting irresponsibly, but criminally, and could face imprisonment."" There were sightings of drones at Gatwick in December It is already illegal to fly a drone above 400ft or within 1km of an airport boundary, and those who recklessly or negligently endanger an aircraft with a drone face up to five years in jail. The government said the new stop and search powers would apply to people suspected of using drones maliciously nears airports. The powers, to be included in the government's new Drones Bill, would also allow police to access electronic data stored on a drone. The Association of Remotely Piloted Aircraft Systems (Arpas UK), which represents the drone industry, welcomed the wider no-fly zone but cautioned on the stop-and-search plans. ""Police will need to know exactly what the rules are and in exercising their powers do so in the right way,"" said Rupert Dent, an Arpas UK committee member. ""We are keen it doesn't prevent legitimate operators from operating drones in a legitimate fashion."" Following the Gatwick disruption, Sussex Police arrested a drone enthusiast and his partner who lived near the airport, but they were released without charge on 23 December, having been cleared of any involvement. In a statement Sussex Police said they had still not found the perpetrators, despite having 130 eyewitness accounts of illegal drone flights. ""We continue our criminal investigation, which is challenging in its scale and in the type and quality of evidence immediately available,"" a spokeswoman said. ""Despite a reward of Â£50,000 for public information leading police to the person or persons responsible, we have not received the critical information that we believed exists within the community.""

Sex offender pupil allowed back to school,"Police statistics show a rise in reports of sexual assaults in schools in recent years A 15-year-old boy convicted of sexually assaulting a girl in a classroom has been allowed to stay at the same school as his victim. The teenager, who cannot be named for legal reasons, was found guilty of two counts of sexual assault and put on the sex offenders register. The victim said: ""I have to just keep my head down, pretend he's not there, otherwise it makes me panic."" The school said it had followed all procedures correctly. The boy, who remained at school while awaiting prosecution, was tried at a youth court almost a year after the assault and given a restraining order, and told not to contact or approach his victim. The victim toldBBC Inside Out East: ""It was known that boy was very 'hands on' with girls. ""He started making comments about me, touching my legs and putting his hands on me. ""Then gradually he started putting his hands up my skirt, touching my chest and I kept telling him to stop. ""I wanted to leave but I felt like I couldn't do anything. I felt powerless, like I was stuck."" The victim's family, from Essex, believes he should not have been allowed to stay at the school. ""I think the day he was found guilty he should have been excluded,"" her mother said. ""He should not be allowed near my daughter or any woman right now. I worry every single day, even now. I don't feel the boy was adequately punished at all."" The NSPCC said calls to Childline about sex abuse by other children had increased Figures obtained by the BBC show at least 6,289 sexual assaults took place in and around schools between 2015 and 2017 - and there was a 60% rise across those three years. The data, which may include assaults on staff as well as pupils, was supplied by 26 of 45 police forces from England and Wales in a Freedom of Information request. Police Scotland did not give figures. Some forces said certain offences took place outside school, or on the bus on the way to school. Department for Education guidelines,externalset out how schools should deal with a report of sexual assault and what to do after a pupil is convicted, with responses on a ""case by case basis"". Anna Cole, inclusion specialist at the Association of School and College Leaders, said she suspected the rise was down to better reporting by individuals and schools. ""Schools know they can't take this lightly. It can't just be dismissed as 'banter' or a normal thing that happens anymore,"" she said. Dad meets baby hours before his death 'A garage full of men is intimidating' Radio host hit in face in 'racist attack' Children's charity the NSPCC said the number of its Childline counselling sessions for victims of sexual abuse carried out by other children increased by a third between 2016-17 and 2017-18. Almudena Lara, head of policy, said: ""We are alarmed at the number of sexual assaults that are taking place inside school gates, where parents rightly expect that their children are kept safe. ""Children must be supported to recognise what constitutes abuse and harassment, teachers must ensure that victims understand they are not to blame."" Out of the forces that responded to the BBC, Greater Manchester Police reported the highest number of recorded offences: 475 in three years to 2017 In 2015, North Wales Police recorded 24 cases but that rose to 110 in 2017 In Hertfordshire, numbers more than doubled from 38 recorded cases in 2015 to 89 in 2017 Essex Police saw reported cases go up from 73 to 130 between 2015 and 2017 Three forces - Dyfed-Powys, Suffolk and Cumbria - saw numbers go down between 2015 and 2017 The victim told the BBC the guilty verdict helped her to deal with the ordeal. ""It took a massive weight off my shoulders to be listened to,"" she said. ""For most part I felt I was going mad. [I was] told in court I was a liar, but to be believed was a relief."" But she said it had been incredibly hard to stay at school, knowing her convicted attacker had been allowed to continue there too. ""I thought I wasn't going to see him. They said I'm their main priority. "" You can see more on this story on Inside Out on BBC One in the East of England at 19:30 GMT on Wednesday 20 February, and afterwards on the iPlayer.

France rallies after anti-Semitic attacks,"Around 70 protests took part around France, including in Paris' Place de la RÃ©publique Thousands of people have joined protests across France against a spate of anti-Semitic attacks. The demonstrators marched under the slogan ""That's Enough"" at the Place de la RÃ©publique in the capital Paris and other cities. Figures from across the political spectrum, including former Presidents FranÃ§ois Hollande and Nicolas Sarkozy, joined too. Just hours earlier Jewish graves at a cemetery were desecrated. In a tweet last week, Olivier Faure, first secretary of the Socialist Party, first called on people to gather in Paris for a protest on Tuesday. The event was later organised with the endorsement of more than 50 political parties, unions and associations. No official number has been reported, but similar demonstrations were reported in 60 cities including Marseille, Bordeaux and Nantes. ""I'm not sure that what's happened has surprised a lot of people,"" a protester in Paris, Frederic Aubert, said. ""I don't exactly know why they are angry at the Jews,"" said another, named Alain. In recent months, France has seen a series of high-profile anti-Semitic attacks. In the past week, vandals have defaced portraits of the late Holocaust survivor and French minister Simone Veil, scrawled the German word for ""Jews"" on a Parisian bakery and cut down a tree planted in memory of a Jewish youth tortured to death by an anti-Semitic gang. France has witnessed a spate of recent anti-Semitic attacks, prompting criticism at home and abroad. On Tuesday, French President Emmanuel Macron visited a Jewish cemetery in eastern France where nearly 100 graves were desecrated with Nazi symbols. ""Whoever did this is not worthy of the French republic and will be punished,"" Mr Macron said during the visit. In a video statement, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu condemned the ""shocking"" attack, calling anti-Semitism ""a plague that endangers everyone, not just us."" Anti-Semitism beneath the yellow vests? France warns of steep rise in anti-Semitism France has the biggest Jewish community in Europe, about 550,000 people. Statistics published last week showed a rise of 74% in the number of anti-Semitic attacks in France, from 311 in 2017 to 541 in 2018. This video can not be played French President Macron visits desecrated Jewish graves in February 2019 On Tuesday, Prime Minister Edouard Philippe told L'Express magazine that the government was considering a change in law to tackle hate speech on social media. During the interview, Mr Philippe said anti-Semitism was ""deeply rooted in French society."" Jewish groups have also been warning that a rising far right across Europe has been promoting anti-Semitism and hatred of other minorities. Crime data from Germany released last week revealed thatanti-Semitic offences had increased by 10% over the past year- including a 60% rise in physical attacks. Attacks have been blamed on both the far right and Islamists. But a 28-country survey by the European Commission, published last month, revealed a gap in perceptions between those in and out of the Jewish community. According to the report, 89% of Jewish people said anti-Semitism had ""significantly increased"" over the last five years. Only 36% of non-Jews believed the same.

Bayern frustrate Liverpool in first leg,"Liverpool had only two shots on target Liverpool's Champions League last-16 tie against Bayern Munich remains finely poised after a goalless draw in the first leg at Anfield. The hosts posed the greater threat but were either wasteful in front of goal or kept out by Bayern's well-marshalled defence. Sadio Mane missed a handful of first-half chances, most notably dragging a shot on the turn wide from inside the penalty area when unmarked. Joel Matip also failed to convert Roberto Firmino's cross from six yards. Matip almost handed Bayern an away goal early on when his misdirected clearance rebounded to safety off Liverpool goalkeeper Alisson. The German champions were excellent defensively in the second half, with Mane's 85th-minute header at the near post the closest Liverpool came to scoring. The second leg at the Allianz Arena will take place on 13 March. Why task in Munich suits Liverpool - analysis Not a dream result but a good one - Klopp Football Daily podcast - Liverpool v Bayern Munich verdict How you rated the players Mohamed Salah has scored one goal in his past four games in all competitions In Champions League history, 31 sides have drawn the first leg of a knockout match at home 0-0 but only 10 have progressed. Bayern have lost only two of their past 26 home Champions League games, but Liverpool know if they can score it will give them a huge advantage with away goals counting as double in the event of a draw. If Liverpool are knocked out, they will rue their misfiring performance at Anfield. Liverpool's 2018-19 Champions League away form Napoli Lost 1-0 Red Star Belgrade Lost 2-0 Paris St-Germain Lost 2-1 Other than Mane's late header, which was saved by Manuel Neuer, their only other shot on target came from Mohamed Salah in the first half when he failed to get enough on a brilliant ball over the top by Jordan Henderson to test the Bayern goalkeeper. There were moments when Liverpool's trademark one-touch attacking play was evident, but they also failed to make the most of promising opportunities. Credit must also go to Bayern. They curbed their own attacking instincts to produce a resolute defensive performance, with full-backs Joshua Kimmich and David Alaba and centre-backs Mats Hummels and Niklas Sule impressive. As shown in this graphic of their players' average position, Bayern defended deep to deny Liverpool's attacking three space Despite their problems in attack, Liverpool must be pleased that their makeshift defence kept Bayern's forwards quiet. The Reds were without Virgil van Dijk, who was suspended, and the injured Dejan Lovren and Joe Gomez, meaning midfielder Fabinho had to fill in at centre-back. There were shaky moments in possession, with Alisson and Andrew Robertson making sloppy touches early on, but Liverpool kept Bayern at arm's length and prevented their opponents from having a shot on target. Robert Lewandowski, the Champions League's top scorer this season, had 34 touches - the fewest of any player in the starting line-ups - including only three in the Liverpool penalty area. Midfielder Henderson was also excellent for Liverpool, consistently breaking up possession. Former Premier League striker Dion Dublin The bigger picture is that Liverpool are still in it. It's a good result at home - they haven't conceded and they've got every chance of going to Bayern and winning the game. I just believe they could have given themselves a better chance by creating more at Anfield. And I was hoping the fans would have been a bit louder - it was very quiet. The fans were a bit nervous. If you don't get a goal, you can't relax. Mats Hummels complete six clearances, more than any other player Liverpool boss Jurgen Klopp to BT Sport:""We made life more difficult with the last pass today - about 10 or 12 times a promising situation [fizzled out]. ""We can play better. We should play better. ""In the first half we had the bigger chances. I can't remember any chances for either side in the second half. ""It wasn't a Champions League night from that point of view. From a result point of view, it's OK. It's not a dream result but it's a good one."" Each of Bayern Munich's past three visits to Anfield in European competition have finished 0-0; it is only the second time Liverpool have played out three straight goalless draws in all competitions against the same team at Anfield after Tottenham from 1969-1971 (four straight 0-0s). This was Jurgen Klopp's 30th managerial meeting with Bayern in all competitions - more than any other opponent in his career - but the first to finish 0-0. Liverpool extended their unbeaten home run in all European competitions to 20 games (W14 D6); this was their 11th clean sheet in that run. Bayern are now unbeaten in nine successive away games in the Champions League (W6 D3). Liverpool have played out a goalless draw in the first leg of a Champions League knockout tie for only the second time, and the first since the 2004-05 semi-final against Chelsea. Bayern are one of only three sides who have not been beaten in this season's Champions League (P7 W4 D3 L0) along with Lyon and Barcelona. Liverpool's Alisson has kept eight clean sheets in 10 home Champions League appearances since the start of last season (5 for Roma, 3 for Liverpool), at least double the total of any other goalkeeper in that period. Bayern did not have a shot on target in a Champions League game for the first time since the semi-final first leg at Barcelona in 2015.

"UK young 'more likely to die from asthma'The UK lags behind other wealthy nations across a number of health indicators, a report finds.Health","Young people in the UK are more likely to die from asthma than those in other wealthy countries, a report has found. Death rates for asthma in 10 to 24-year-olds was highest in the UK among all 14 European nations included in an analysis of 19 high-income countries. The UK also had the highest obesity rates for 15 to 19-year-olds among the European nations. The government said it had ""world-leading plans"" to safeguard child health. Overall, the report found the UK to be lagging behind other nations across a number of health indicators. Is young people's mental health getting worse? Children 'should be weighed up to 18' One in four young women has mental illness The study, from the Nuffield Trust think tank and and the Association for Young People's Health, analysed 17 measures of health and wellbeing for 10 to 24-year-olds in countries that included Germany, France and Italy, as well as Japan, the US and Australia. It found that while young people in the UK are making some healthier choices, such as drinking less alcohol and smoking less, more are entering adulthood with long-term health conditions. Nearly one in five young people in the UK is estimated to be living with a longstanding health condition, such as type 2 diabetes, the report finds. In England, the figure has gone from 13.5% in 2008 to 18% in 2016. The UK was also found to be one of the worst countries for young people to suffer from years lost to ill-health and the burden of their diseases, with only Australia, the US and New Zealand being worse. Children and young people in the UK are also far more likely to be obese if they are poor, with the UK having some of the highest inequalities between the richest and poorest when it comes to the proportion that are obese, the study found. On poverty among older age groups, the report said: ""Despite living in the world's fifth largest economy, young people aged 20 to 24 in the UK are experiencing one of the highest rates of severe material deprivation among the countries in our international comparison. ""Reducing poverty among young people is key to improving their health outcomes in the UK."" The report finds young people are smoking less and drinking less alcohol Overall, the UK sits in the bottom third of countries in nine out of 17 indicators, and in the top third in three. In four of the 17 measures, trends have been getting worse, while in five areas previous improvements have stalled. Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust, said the study suggested health services in the UK were ""getting something badly wrong"". He said: ""I worry this reflects a dangerous complacency. ""Young people in the UK are entering adulthood with more long-term health conditions and, as a result a poorer quality of life, storing up problems further down the line. ""If we don't take action now, the next generation will be entering adulthood sicker than the one before it."" Asthma UK said it was ""appalling"" that people were more likely to die from asthma in the UK than in other European countries. The charity said its research has previously found that millennials - typically those born between the early 1980s and mid-1990s - get the worse asthma care of any age group. Dr Samantha Walker, director of research and policy at Asthma UK, said: ""We are now urging the NHS to move with the times and put technology at the heart of asthma management, helping to engage this tech-savvy generation."" Emma Rigby, chief executive at the Association for Young People's Health, said there needed to be a greater understanding of young people's health needs. Researchers analysed data from the mid-1990s to the last year for which data was comparable with other countries, 2016. The 19 countries were: The UK, the Netherlands, Denmark, France, Ireland, Portugal, Greece, Germany, Spain, Austria, Belgium, Finland, Italy, Sweden, Japan, US, New Zealand, Australia, and Canada. A Department of Health and Social Care spokeswoman said: ""We have world-leading plans in place to safeguard child health by combating obesity, improving mental health and vaccinating against some of the world's deadliest diseases. ""Prevention is at the heart of the NHS Long Term Plan, and as part of this we are increasing funding by an average 3.4% per year, meaning that by 2023-24 it will receive Â£20.5bn a year more than it currently does.""
