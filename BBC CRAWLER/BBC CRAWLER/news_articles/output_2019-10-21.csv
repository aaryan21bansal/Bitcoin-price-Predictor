NI abortion and same-sex marriage deadline passes,"Campaigners on both sides of the emotive debate were at Stormont on Monday Abortion has been decriminalised and same-sex marriage is to be legalised in Northern Ireland. Legislation making the changes - which waspassed by MPs at Westminster- came into force at midnight. The first same-sex weddings in Northern Ireland are set to take place in February 2020. The government has until the end of March to come up with regulations for the provision of abortion services. What Northern Ireland's abortion law changes mean How do the UK's abortion laws compare? The legislation took effect after the 21 October deadline passed without a devolved government being re-formed. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - and some politicians from other unionist parties - triggered a recall of the Northern Ireland Assembly in an attempt to block the lifting of a near-ban on terminations. The assembly at Stormont had not sat for more than 1,000 days after devolved government collapsed when power-sharing coalition partners the DUP and Sinn FÃ©in split in a bitter row. But the move failed because a new speaker could not be elected on a cross-community basis. Abortion law in Northern Ireland had been more restrictive than in England, Scotland and Wales Sinn FÃ©in, Alliance, the Green Party and People Before Profit did not attend the Stormont sitting, which Sinn FÃ©in described as a ""cynical political stunt"". Before now, abortion was only allowed in Northern Ireland if a woman's life was at risk or there was a danger of permanent and serious damage to her physical or mental health. Section 58,externalandSection 59,externalof the Offences Against the Person Act 1861 - which made abortion a criminal offence - have been repealed. NI parties fail in bid to stop abortion law change Reaction to failed bid to stop abortion law change TheNorthern Ireland (Executive Formation etc) Act 2019,externalhas also placed a duty on the government to implement the recommendations of a report by the United Nations Committee on the Elimination of Discrimination Against Women (CEDAW), published in 2018. The CEDAW report said abortion should be legalised where there is a threat to a pregnant woman's mental or physical health, without the conditionality of ""long-term or permanent"" effects. It recommended terminations should be permitted in cases of rape or incest. Charges can no longer be brought against those who have an abortion or against health workers who provide terminations The committee also said abortions should be allowed where there is ""severe fetal impairment"", but that provision should not ""perpetuate stereotypes"" towards disabled people. It added that social and financial support should be ensured for women who decided to carry such pregnancies to term. A further series of recommendations included providing access to ""high quality abortion and post-abortion care in all public health facilities"", and making ""age-appropriate, comprehensive and scientifically accurate education"" on ""sexual and reproductive health and rights"" a compulsory part of the curriculum. The government in London will decide on more detailed measures to fulfil the requirements of the legislation. Northern Ireland Secretary Julian Smith is mandated to put in place regulations by 31 March 2020. Thegovernment has issued guidance to medical professionalswhich covers the period from now until that date. Same-sex marriages have been allowed in England, Scotland and Wales since 2014, but Stormont did not legalise them. This video can not be played BBC News NI looks at the history of Northern Ireland's same-sex marriage debate The last of five votes on the issue in the devolved assembly - in November 2015 - resulted in anumerical majority in favour of same-sex marriage for the first time. But the DUP blocked a change in the law by using a veto known as the Petition of Concern. The new legislation says the Westminster government must bring in regulations to provide for same-sex marriage by 13 January 2020. Because couples have to indicate their intention to marry 28 days before doing so - the first gay weddings are expected to be held in the week of Valentine's Day. Northern Ireland's Catholic bishops said Monday was a tragic day for unborn children and a sad day for local democracy. They say they are also concerned at the redefinition of marriage and appealed to the political parties to re-double their efforts to restore the power-sharing executive. The new legislation has also had an impacton payments for those affected by the Troubles. The government is to bring in a payment scheme for those people injured during Northern Ireland's Troubles through no fault of their own. ""As the Northern Ireland Executive was not restored by 21 October 2019, the UK government will introduce a victims payments scheme by the end of May 2020,"" a government spokesperson said. ""We will consult widely on the details of a proposal in the coming weeks.""

What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill?,"The government'sWithdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB),external, which will take the UK out of the EU on 31 January, has passed all its stages in Parliament and been given Royal Assent. The WAB turns Boris Johnson's withdrawal agreement, which is a draft international treaty, into UK law and gives the government permission to ratify it. No new clauses or amendments were passed by MPs, who also rejected changes made in the House of Lords. What does the WAB actually cover? Among other things: It sets out exactly how the UK will make ""divorce bill"" payments to the EU for years to come It repeals the European Communities Act, which took the UK into the EU, but then reinstates it immediately until the end of 2020 when the transition period ends It contains language on how the new protocol on Ireland - setting up what amounts to a customs and regulatory border between Northern Ireland and Great Britain - will work in practice It sets out areas in which the European Court of Justice still plays a role in the UK, and makes the withdrawal agreement in some respects ""supreme"" over other areas of UK law One of those areas may be in the arbitration procedure for disputes about the withdrawal agreement. The bill introduces a duty for the government to report on this It prohibits any extension to the transition period beyond the end of 2020, even if a free trade deal isn't ready in time In the section on citizens' rights it sets up an independent monitoring authority (IMA) with which EU nationals in the UK can lodge any complaints about the way the government treats them In several policy areas, particularly in Northern Ireland, the bill gives ministers a lot of power to change the law (through secondary legislation) without MPs getting to vote It introduces a duty for the government to report on its use of the arbitration procedure for disputes about the withdrawal agreement A number of clauses in the previous version of the bill have been removed. They include: The possibility of an extension to the transition period and the procedures around that. The bill now prohibits ministers asking for an extension. Workers' rights protections - the government says these will now be part of a separate bill. Checks and balances that MPs were offered as an inducement to pass the old bill in October. For example, the requirement for the government's negotiating position on the future relationship with the EU to be approved by Parliament has gone. And the government's position no longer needs to be in line with the political declaration - the non-legally binding document that accompanied the withdrawal agreement and sets out aspirations for the future relationship. A clause on child refugees. The bill removes the requirement,introduced by Lord Dubs,to agree a deal that if an unaccompanied child claims international protection in the EU, they may come to the UK if they have relatives living in the country. The new bill only requires a government minister to make a statement setting out policy on the subject within two months. Between 2016 and 2018, 426 unaccompanied children came to the UKin this way,external. After the WAB becomes law, the withdrawal agreement also needs to be ratified by the European Parliament. What is the transition period? What is in Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? Then the stage will be set for Brexit on 31 January, when the post-Brexit transition period will begin. For 11 months, the UK will still follow all the EU's rules and regulations, it will remain in the single market and the customs union, and the free movement of people will continue. The challenge for the government will be to get all its new rules and policies in place by the end of this year. This article was originally published on 21 October and has been updated to reflect changes to the Withdrawal Agreement Bill and its passage towards becoming law.

Brexit: A big moment,"Here it is.,externalAnd here we go. The government has now published the pages and pages of new laws that need to be passed to make our departure from the EU happen. Forget the meaningful vote, to get Brexit done - as the prime minister never tires of saying - this whole bundle of legislation has to pass. The European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill is a document of 110 pages that details exactly how Parliament is expected to put the deal that the prime minister agreed with his counterparts around the continent into UK law. For Brexit watchers it is a big moment. Theresa May's government never got this far, stumbling too many times on getting Parliament to agree to the overall deal. Boris Johnson's government, having failed even to be able to ask MPs for a straightforward ""yes or no"" to the shape of the agreement, has now published the whole lot, which gives them both an opportunity, and two big problems. Government publishes Brexit bill MPs' vote on Brexit deal ruled out by Speaker Do voters support Boris Johnson's Brexit deal? First, the opportunity. Boris Johnson is closer to getting MPs to agree to leave the EU than Theresa May ever was. Ministers and Tory MPs dare to believe that they just about have the backing of enough on the green benches to pass the actual deal, to win the principle in Parliament that on the terms agreed in Brussels last week Brexit can happen. And they will, not surprisingly given Boris Johnson's repeated public commitment to stick to the Halloween deadline for departure, do as much as they possibly can to make it happen. They have failed though, twice now, to manage to hold a vote simply asking MPs for a straight yes or no to the overall shape of the agreement. So now, the government needs to try to persuade MPs to pass the whole lot - the complete bill. And that's where the government runs into problems. First off, scrutinising pages and pages of new laws. MPs like to take time to do that. And just as there is impatience among Brexiteers, there is rage tonight in the Commons at the pace at which the government is trying to get it through. Ministers have planned for sittings in the Commons until midnight; one minister suggesting earlier they could sit through the night if needs be over the next few days in order to stick to the prime minister's deadline. Speaker John Bercow told the government it could not hold a vote on its deal on Monday Don't forget it is not just Boris Johnson's self-imposed political deadline, 31 October is by law the current date when we are due to leave - unless and until the EU decides to grant an extension. (There's not that much doubt that the other 27 countries would grant an extension if the Brexit deal isn't done by then, but right now it is still an assumption, rather than something we can be completely sure of.) But to pass the whole bundle of new laws by then is much harder for the government to do than agreeing the concept of the deal. Problem one is the timetable. There is no question that the government wants to get the legislation extremely fast. MPs have been spitting chips in the Commons about the speed at which ministers are trying to move, as it gives them less time to look properly and understand what it all means. When the government needs to hold together a relatively fragile coalition of support without a majority, anything that makes MPs grumpy is a risk. You might wonder after three-and-a-half years what more MPs have to say about Brexit? In one sense that's quite understandable. As we read through the agreement in green and black, (not black and white this time), there is nothing at this stage that will come as an gigantic surprise. But there is no question that the agreement in its full version will give MPs who are cross or worried about certain aspects of the plan more evidence to complain. KEY POINTS: What's new in the deal? PEOPLE'S VIEW: Do voters support the deal? EXPLAINED: What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? IN GRAPHICS:  What happens now? Yet with any legislation, once it is written down with the full terms and conditions, it takes on a different level of being real. And without question, for a piece of new law that has such consequences, the timetable the government is trying to pursue is rapid and therefore controversial. Discussing hypotheticals about Brexit has gone on for a long, long time. Debating the realities of actual legislation is a different task. And before the proper debates can even get going tomorrow there will be a vote on the timetable that's needed if the government has a hope of sticking to the breakneck schedule. Lose that and the chances of meeting 31 October look slim indeed. And chatter tonight about using aggressive tactics to force it through could put the frighteners on some of the MPs who are wobbly about voting with the government at all. How might MPs vote on the Brexit deal? What were the Brexit sticking points? But one of the reason the government's rivals are so cross relates to the second problem for the government. The opposition parties and different tribes of MPs will use this week as a chance to get their way on Brexit. They don't have much time to work out the best way of making the changes they would like. But as they debate the new legislation line by line, they do have the opportunity to try to remove the bits they don't approve of and add ideas that they do. Stand by, therefore, for amendments from the different groups who are vying to change the course of what happens next. Whether it is another push for a second referendum, a move to a customs union, or a plan to make sure that MPs have a lock on leaving the transition period (the immediate period after Brexit, when the status quo more or less remains) to stay in the Brexit departure lounge until a free trade agreement has been concluded. It is not certain that the rival factions in Parliament have enough numbers to make any of those big changes happen, or to remove any unpopular parts of the deal. But it means the government will have to fight votes on issue after issue, debate after debate, with no guarantee of holding off their opponents. If, though, MPs change the agreement so much that it becomes unrecognisable to what was agreed with the 27 other member states, the prime minister is likely to pull the bill, give up on this part of the process, and try again to push for an election. One Cabinet minister told me there was just ""no way on earth"" the government could go back to the EU and ask for something radically different in the treaty that has just been agreed. There may be amendments that affect what the UK would do in future that ministers would be relatively relaxed about accepting. But anything that puts a stick in the spokes of getting this deal through this Parliament, don't be surprised if before too long, Parliament is not in a row about this deal, but in an argument about whether or not it is time for a general election. PS we are now trawling through the details of the actual bill. It's quite possible that by the morning some nasties may have emerged that have not been obvious in the first few hours of reading!

Government knew Harry Dunn suspect would leave UK,"Harry Dunn died in hospital after his motorbike was involved in a crash with a Volvo The US Embassy told the British government the suspect in a crash which killed Harry Dunn would be leaving the UK, the foreign secretary has said. Mr Dunn, 19, died after a collision outside RAF Croughton with a car owned by US citizen Anne Sacoolas. Dominic Raab told the Commons his department asked for her diplomatic immunity to be waived, but the request was refused by the US. Mr Dunn's family said the statement ""added insult to injury"". Their spokesman Radd Seiger said there was an ""unacceptable lack of information being provided to the family"". ""There is even more anger and frustration tonight than there was before this statement was made in the House of Commons,"" he said. ""The statement Dominic Raab gave tonight, he could have given to the family directly when they met with him two weeks ago."" Charlotte Charles and Tim Dunn met Donald Trump at the White House last week to discuss the case Mr Dunn died from his injuries when his motorbike and a car collided outside the RAF station in Northamptonshire on 27 August. Mr Raab said the US Embassy informed his office of the crash and said Mrs Sacoolas was ""covered by immunity"". The Foreign Office requested to waive her immunity ""to enable the police investigation to follow its proper course"", he told MPs. But Mr Raab said on 13 September his office was told by the US ""that they would not waive immunity and that the individual would be leaving the country imminently, unless the UK had strong objections"". He said his office ""duly and immediately objected in clear and strong terms"" but when they spoke to US officials on 16 September they were told Mrs Sacoolas had left the UK the day before. The foreign secretary said they immediately informed Northamptonshire Police but asked officers to delay telling Mr Dunn's family the suspect had left the country ""by a day or two"" to give them time to ""agree the next course of action"". However, the police force did not tell Mr Dunn's family that Mrs Sacoolas had gone back to the US until 26 September, Mr Raab said. Anne Sacoolas, pictured on her wedding day in 2003, left the UK after the crash Mrs Sacoolas' husband is reportedly stationed at the base as an intelligence officer. At the time of the crash she had diplomatic immunity, but both the British and US governments agree that by returning to the US she had forfeited that right. Dunn crash death suspect 'expected to be charged' US suspect 'disappointed' by Dunn family rejection Harry Dunn's parents reject 'bombshell' meeting Mr Raab said he had commissioned a review into immunity arrangements for US personnel and their families at the RAF Croughton annex in light of this case. ""As this case has demonstrated, I do not believe the current arrangements are right and the review will look at how we can make sure that the arrangements at Croughton cannot be used in this way again,"" he said. He said the case was ""now with Northamptonshire Police and Crown Prosecution Service and it is for them to consider the next steps as part of their criminal investigation"". Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab spoke in the Commons about the Harry Dunn case Mr Dunn's family were due to meet with the Chief Constable of Northamptonshire Police on Wednesday but were told he could not say anything more than offering his condolences. ""They feel completely abandoned by both [the police and the foreign office],"" Mr Seiger said. ""This is incredibly stressful and exhausting and gruelling. The family just want answers.""

Asda's contract changes are 'just not fair',"Cathy Murphy has worked at Asda for more than four decades. Cathy Murphy has worked for Asda for the last 44 years and says it has been an ""absolutely amazing employer"". However, recently the supermarket chain told Ms Murphy she will be fired unless she signs up to a new contract that will strip her of her long-service benefits, paid tea breaks and Bank Holidays off. She is one of thousands of employees who have been told to sign the new contract before 2 November or leave the business. But Ms Murphy describes it as ""just not fair"". The GMB union says up to 12,000 workers face a choice between signing the new contracts - which increase wages to Â£9 an hour but scrap many other perks - or being sacked in the run up to Christmas. But Asda told the BBC: ""This contract is an investment of more than Â£80m and increases real pay for over 100,000 colleagues."" Asda contract protesters deliver petition to HQ Asda offers pay rise for 'flexible' work Despite this, Ms Murphy worries for night shift staff who will have their pay cut, as well as people with caring responsibilities who may struggle with the new contracts. Ms Murphy works in the fruit and vegetable section at Asda's Parkhead Forge store in Glasgow. As a union representative, she has been aware of the contract changes since the spring. However, her colleagues at the store only found out through meetings with managers over the summer. Workers were given a document, which said they would have private meetings - or one-to-ones (121s) - with management. ""As part of the 121 process we hope that you agree to move to the new contract,"" Asda said in the document. ""If you still don't want to sign up to the new contract at your final 121 we will issue you notice to terminate your employment."" It said staff who had not signed the new contract would ""leave the business"" at the end of their notice period. Then, earlier this month, Asda bosses handed out a leaflet with tips on getting a new job. It suggested staff use their local job centre, get an email address and offered advice on CV writing. Ms Murphy called the leaflets ""condescending"". It is not the first time that Asda has tried to move staff onto flexible contracts. In 2017, the supermarket chainoffered workers a salary increasein exchange for voluntarily switching to a new contract that introduced unpaid breaks and a requirement to work over Bank Holidays. But over the summer, those changes were made compulsory. The GMB union has written to the supermarket chain, which is owned by US retail giant Walmart, asking it to delay the introduction of the new contracts. ""On November 2nd, we understand up to 12,000 of your loyal Asda workers will be given the sack - just before Christmas,"" it said in a letter sent over the weekend. ""That can not be right."" But Asda says the vast majority of staff have signed up to the new contract. ""We have been clear that we don't want any of our colleagues to leave us,"" a spokesman said, explaining that the changes would help the chain ""adapt to the demands of the highly competitive retail industry"". Ms Murphy thinks the chain will go through with its threat to fire the rest but she says it is unfair after giving more than four decades to the supermarket chain. ""I'm coming to the end of my working life,"" she says. ""And for this to happen [now], it's just not fair. ""It's not fair at all.""

"Man, 21, arrested over house party stabbings","The boys were stabbed at a house party in Archford Croft in Milton Keynes A man has been arrested on suspicion of murdering two teenagers who were stabbed to death at a house party. The boys, named locally as Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice, were attacked at the house in Milton Keynes at about midnight on Saturday. Thames Valley Police said the pair were stabbed as part of a ""targeted attack"". A 21-year-old man, from Milton Keynes, has been arrested on suspicion of two counts of murder and two counts of attempted murder. One of the boys died at the scene and the other in hospital. Another 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man were also hurt and were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. One has since been discharged. Thames Valley Police said there was an ""increased presence"" in the area Thames Valley Police previously said those responsible ""arrived at the party at the house in Archford Croft uninvited, wore face coverings and were armed with knives"". Det Ch Supt Ian Hunter described the attack as a ""dreadful incident"". ""We know that the party was a private birthday party, and although we believe that all of those involved were known to each other, we believe that those responsible arrived at the party uninvited, wore face coverings and they were armed with knives in what appears to be a targeted attack,"" he said. Det Ch Supt Hunter said the victims' families were being supported by specially trained officers and post-mortem examinations are due to take place on Tuesday. Forensic searches were still taking place on Monday Officers are expected to remain at the scene, which is in a cul-de-sac on a housing estate in the Emerson Valley area, for several days. Stains of what appeared to be blood could be seen on the front door of a house inside the police cordon. Two of Dom Ansah's cousins laid flowers at the cordon on Sunday afternoon.

Actors support Katie Jarvis after taking 'normal job',"This video can not be played Ex-EastEnders actress describes how she was made to feel during her job-shaming story Former EastEnders actress Katie Jarvis says she felt ""degraded"" and ""hurt"" after a newspaper splashed pictures of her working as a shop security guard. On Sunday, theDaily Star,externalrevealed the actress, who played Hayley Slater, was now working at a B&M store in Romford. It prompted an outpouring of empathy on social media, as many actors underlined the uncertain nature of the profession. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Show, Jarvis said the tone of the story was ""really quite nasty"". ""I woke up really embarrassed and made to feel quite ashamed, to be honest"" said the 28-year-old, who now works alongside her sister. ""See over my career I've done by best to try and stay away from social gatherings, get-togethers and celebrity things, to keep my private life as private as possible. ""So to wake up with my kids and see myself on the front of the pages just for simply having a job in between my acting, it really did hurt me."" She added: ""It took a day or so for me to actually let it all digest and realise I had nothing to be ashamed about."" Jarvis first made her name starring as Mia Williams in the 2009 British drama film Fish Tank, before heading to Albert Square for a year-long stint which ended in February 2019. The east Londoner explained she's worked in a range of jobs to support her acting career - including as a waitress and for a credit card company. She admitted she's been ""overwhelmed"" by the support she's received from her acting colleagues, like Kathy Burke, who comically re-interpreted the headline of the tabloid story - or non-story, as she saw it.

In a show of solidarity, other TV stars revealed they too supplement their acting careers with other types of employment. Tamzin Outhwaite posted,external: ""Yes, I am a landlady, a voice over artist, car boot salesperson, art dealer, up cyclist, interior designer, motivational speaker, and many other jobs... it's what artists do to earn a living. They work in between jobs."" ""It's called grafting!"" she added. ""Or not being afraid of hard work... or loving your family enough to drop your dream for a bit to earn a living so the family can live life. And there is no shame in wanting to work hard to make sure your offspring are cared for."" TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC she understands why actors are getting upset with the newspaper for splashing Jarvis's new non-acting job all over the front page in a ""humiliating"" manner. But, she says, the situation is ""more complicated"" than some soap stars are making out. ""I can see both sides of it really as it does feel quite cruel in the way that they did it, kicking her while she's down I suppose,"" says Bullimore. (L-R) Shane Richie as Alfie Moon, Jessie Wallace as Kat Moon and Katie Jarvis as Hayley Slater holding baby Cherry Slater in 2018 ""But with a tabloid hat on, you can totally see that it is the perfect story - she was in one of the biggest shows on TV, had a massive part in it and she was basically in every scene for a little while. ""Then she disappeared, slightly oddly, and now suddenly she's working at B&M. I think if she was working at Waitrose it would not be as good a story."" Charlie Condou, who played Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, called the Jarvis story ""shameful journalism,"" adding he'd done something similar himself. ""When I left Corrie I had a string of very nice TV and theatre jobs,""he tweeted,external. ""Then I didn't. ""So I got a job working in a restaurant to pay my bills and take care of my kids. That's what responsible adults do."" In one of her most memorable EastEnders scenes from last Christmas, Jarvis's character Hayley pushed Alfie Moon, played by Shane Ritchie, down the stairs in defence of her relative Kat Moon. Since leaving EastEnders, Jarvis has kept a relatively low profile. However, in March, she tweeted to say she was ""absolutely fine"" following reports she had been ""glassed"" on a night out. She's no longer on social media. Katie Jarvis: EastEnders actress says she is 'fine' after reported attack Bullimore believes ""it feels like a choice"", in this instance, for her to make the move away from the camera so soon, making the newspaper article all the more intriguing for readers. ""I can see why people would want to read it because they'll think 'surely you're really well paid if you're on EastEnders and you're living the life of an actress.' And she was in it so recently, so why would you need the money so quickly? ""That's not to say that I think it [the story] is fair, but I don't think it's necessarily any worse than the way that tabloids treat actors in general.""

In fact, award-winning director Ken Loach told the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz he actively shied away from casting big name Hollywood stars in his latest drama, Sorry We Missed You, in favour of actors who have had recent experience working in relevant industries. Zero-hour contracts can 'kill' - Ken Loach The film features actor/plumber and van driver Kris Hitchen and actress/teaching assistant and care worker Debbie Honeywood at the head of a Newcastle family, struggling to make ends meet on zero-hour contract jobs. ""Finding people to bring a story to life is the second-most important decision you ever make in filmmaking, second to the script - which is the most important,"" explained Loach. ""The camera can see who you are, maybe in ways you're not aware of - how you stand, how you use your hands, the quality of your skin depends on your diet. Every mannerism that you're not aware of. And you've also got to believe that people can do the job they say that they can do in the film and reach the character and absolutely have the capacity to draw the audience in. ""So the audience laughs with them and cries with them and is angry with them and identifies with them and has solidarity with them. And we were really lucky to find Chris and Debbie."" He added: ""They're both terrific, but they can act, make no mistake."" This video can not be played Director Ken Loach explains why he doesn't use Hollywood actors in his films. Elsewhere in the industry, former Hollyoaks and Holby City actorJeremy Edwardsfound work, like Jarvis, as a security guard, and as a gardener.

House party stabbings 'part of targeted attack',"The boys were stabbed at a house party in Archford Croft in Milton Keynes Two 17-year-old boys were stabbed to death at a house party as part of a ""targeted attack"", police believe. The boys, named locally as Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice, were attacked at the house in Milton Keynes at about midnight on Saturday. Thames Valley Police said those responsible ""arrived at the party uninvited, wore face coverings and were armed with knives"". No arrests have been made in the double murder inquiry. One of the boys died at the scene and the other in hospital. Another 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man were also hurt and were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. One has since been discharged. Thames Valley Police said there was an ""increased presence"" in the area Det Ch Supt Ian Hunter described the attack as a ""dreadful incident"". ""We know that the party was a private birthday party, and although we believe that all of those involved were known to each other, we believe that those responsible arrived at the party uninvited, wore face coverings and they were armed with knives in what appears to be a targeted attack,"" he said. Det Ch Supt Hunter said officers were ""working around the clock"" to trace the suspects. ""I have a clear message to those responsible. We are looking for you and I urge you to hand yourself into a police station as soon as possible,"" he said. He said the victims' families were being supported by specially trained officers and post-mortem examinations are due to take place on Tuesday. Forensic searches were still taking place on Monday Officers are expected to remain at the scene, which is in a cul-de-sac on a housing estate in the Emerson Valley area, for several days. Stains of what appeared to be blood could be seen on the front door of a house inside the police cordon. The two deaths have been labelled ""senseless"" by those paying tribute to the boys. Diane Ackah-Sanzah addressed Mr Ansah's family on Facebook and said: ""This is so senseless... I am truly heartbroken for you."" Wendy Ince said: ""Shocked to hear of the senseless loss of your boy... thinking of you at this awful time"", and Kevin Amoakuh said: ""So sad, so painful, so untimely."" Family members visited the scene on Sunday to leave flowers Two of Dom Ansah's cousins laid flowers at the cordon on Sunday afternoon. ""He's come here with his long-time best friend since childhood, comes to a party and both of their lives just got ripped away from them,"" said one, who did not give her name. ""He was just so respectful to like his family and friends. Many, many people's hearts are broken."" Det Ch Supt Hunter appealed for ""anybody who thinks that they have any information, no matter how insignificant you believe this to be, to come forward"".

MPs' vote on Brexit deal ruled out by Speaker,"This video can not be played Bercow: The motion will not be debated today The Commons Speaker has refused a government request to hold a ""yes"" or ""no"" vote on its Brexit deal. John Bercow said a motion on the deal had been brought before MPs on Saturday, and it would be ""repetitive and disorderly"" to debate it again. Saturday's sitting saw MPs vote to withhold approval of Boris Johnson's deal until it has been passed into law. The government said it was disappointed, but would go ahead with introducing the necessary legislation. The prime minister's official spokesman added: ""The Speaker has yet again denied us a chance to deliver on the will of British people."" The UK is due to leave the EU in 10 days, and while Mr Johnson and fellow EU leaders have agreed a new deal to allow that to happen, it cannot come into force until it is approved by both the UK and European parliaments. The government has presented the law which would implement the Brexit deal to the Commons, and it will begin its parliamentary journey on Tuesday. KEY POINTS: What's new in the deal? PEOPLE'S VIEW: Do voters support the deal? EXPLAINED: What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? IN GRAPHICS:  What happens now? The government wanted to hold a ""yes"" or ""no"" vote - a so-called ""meaningful vote"" - on its deal on Saturday, but MPs instead chose to back an amendment tabled by former Tory Sir Oliver Letwin, which said that could not happen until all necessary Brexit legislation was passed. That legislation, called the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB), has been introduced and will then have to go through full parliamentary scrutiny in both the Commons and the Lords - something which usually takes weeks rather than days. But Leader of the Commons Jacob Rees-Mogg announced plans to complete the Commons stages by the end of Thursday. He said the House would not sit on Friday. The BBC's political editor said the government hoped to push the WAB through by getting MPs to sit until midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday - an aggressive timetable they may well reject.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. MPs will vote on a so-called programme motion - which effectively approves or rejects that timetable - on Tuesday. Labour's shadow Commons leader Valerie Vaz told MPs: ""At every stage the government has been running scared of this House and democracy, and it's now attempting to force through a flawed Brexit deal which sells out people's jobs, rights and our communities."" The SNP's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, called on the government ""not to bulldoze"" the bill through Parliament and give time for ""full scrutiny"". BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the European Parliament would only vote on the Brexit deal when it had reached a stage where it could not be modified any further at Westminster. Officials believe that means it is virtually impossible for MEPs to approve it this week, but they are open to an extraordinary session of parliament next week, he added. I know reporters like me love prattling on about ""crunch points"". And I know there have been one or two instances of it being ""crunch point postponed"". But this really now is it for a government trying to deliver Boris Johnson's proposed Brexit deal by 31 October. The time frame is mega tight - passing a new law, through the Commons and Lords, by a week on Thursday. Some want to crack on with it, some want to tweak it and some want to wreck it. What happens in the next few days will determine whether the UK leaves the European Union a week on Thursday and in what way. And it is likely to shape when the next general election is. And, perhaps, who wins it. No 10 was pushing for a second shot at a meaningful vote on Monday, but Mr Bercow told the Commons he would not allow it, and had come to that decision on the basis of a parliamentary convention dating back to 1604. He cited Parliament's rulebook, Erskine May, which says a motion that is the same ""in substance"" as a previous one cannot be brought back during the course of a single parliamentary session. The Speaker also said the circumstances around the motion had not changed, so his ruling was ""necessary... to ensure the sensible use of the House's time and proper respect for the decisions that it takes"". This video can not be played Brexiteer MP calls Bercow ruling on deal vote ""most unusual"" But Tory MP and Brexiteer Sir Bernard Jenkin appeared to accused Mr Bercow of bias, saying it was ""remarkable"" how often the Speaker ""pleased one lot and not the other"". ""It is most unusual for a Speaker so often to prevent the government having a debate on the matters which the government wish put before the House,"" he added. Fellow Tory David TC Davies said: ""The only consistency one can find in your rulings is that they always seem to favour one side of the argument and never the government."" But Mr Bercow disagreed, adding: ""The consistent thread is I try to do what I think is right by the House of Commons."" The Letwin amendment also meant Mr Johnson was required to ask for an extension to the Brexit deadline, according to the terms of the Benn Act. The PM sent the necessary letter to the EU but did not sign it, and sent a second letter saying he thought a delay was a mistake. The deal ditches the backstop - the controversial ""insurance policy"" designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border. Instead it will, in effect, draw a new customs border in the Irish Sea, because goods which could then travel onwards to Ireland will have to pay a duty tax. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay told a Lords committee Northern Irish businesses would also have to complete export declarations to send any goods to the UK. The whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union, meaning it could strike trade deals with other countries in the future. But many MPs, including the prime minister's erstwhile allies the DUP, say treating Northern Ireland differently from the rest of the UK is unacceptable. The Treasury Committee has asked the government for an updated analysis of how the new deal may affect the UK economy. Responding on Monday, Chancellor Sajid Javid said the Treasury would ""provide analysis at appropriate points"", but it would depend on the next set of negotiations with the EU about the future relationship. He added: ""[But] trust in democracy, and bringing an end to the division that has characterised this debate over the past three years, is something that cannot be measured solely through spreadsheets or impact assessments, important though they are."" The committee's interim chairman, Labour's Catherine McKinnell, said ""the dearth of relevant economic analysis"" was ""deeply concerning"" and MPs were being expected to ""vote blindly"". The WAB will give legal effect to the withdrawal deal, as well as any agreed transition period, and fulfils requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. This video can not be played Clarke: UK needs ""the right withdrawal agreement"" It will also allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal. But MPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill. Labour's shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer has said his party will push for a UK-wide customs union with the EU and single market alignment, and back moves to try to put the deal to a referendum. But the PM's spokesman has reiterated the government's opposition to both proposals. If the government cannot get the bill through Parliament, the default legal position is for the UK to leave without a deal on 31 October, but that will change if the EU grants an extension. Monday-first reading- the bill will be introduced and its title read out, usually just a formality. Tuesday - second reading- MPs' first chance to debate the bill and vote for its continued passage. If passed at second reading, committee stage begins the same day. Wednesday and Thursday - committee stage- where detailed examination of the bill takes place and specific amendments - on a fresh referendum, for example - can be tabled and voted on. The bill then moves on toreport stage,which offers further opportunities for amendments before it moves tothird reading. This is MPs' final chance to debate the bill before voting on whether to approve it. If approved, it then moves to the Lords to begin a similar scrutiny process.

Forget the meaningful vote, to get Brexit done - as the prime minster never tires of saying - this whole bundle of legislation has to pass. The European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Bill is a document of 110 pages that details exactly how Parliament is expected to put the deal that the prime minister agreed with his counterparts around the continent into UK law. For Brexit watchers it is a big moment. Read more from the BBC's political editor. KEY POINTS: What's new in the deal? PEOPLE'S VIEW: Do voters support the deal? EXPLAINED: What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? IN GRAPHICS:  What happens now? The amendment worked alongside the so-called Benn Act, which required the PM to ask the EU for an extension to the Halloween deadline to prevent a no-deal Brexit. Mr Johnson wrote an unsigned letter making the request on Saturday evening, along with a signed letter saying why he did not agree with any further delays. But there has been no official word from the EU yet on whether they would grant a proposal or what length it would be. BBC Brussels correspondent Adam Fleming said the European Parliament would only vote on the Brexit deal when it had reached a stage where it could not be modified any further at Westminster. The government also tried to bring forward a ""yes"" or ""no"" vote on its Brexit deal on Monday, but Speaker John Bercow said it would be ""repetitive and disorderly"" to debate it again. Speaker John Bercow told the government they could not hold a vote on their deal The WAB will give legal effect to the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mr Johnson. His plan ditches the backstop - the controversial ""insurance policy"" designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border. Instead it essentially draws a new customs border in the Irish Sea, as goods which could travel onwards to Ireland will have to pay a duty tax. It also will see the whole of the UK leave the EU customs union, meaning it could strike trade deals with other countries in the future. The WAB will also turn any agreed transition period into law, fulfil requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit, and allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal. But MPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill. If the government cannot get the bill through Parliament, the default legal position is for the UK to leave without a deal on 31 October, but that will change if the EU grants an extension. I know reporters like me love prattling on about crunch points. And I know there have been one or two instances of it being crunch point postponed. But this really now is it for the government trying to deliver Boris Johnson's proposed Brexit deal by 31 October. The time frame is mega tight - passing a new law, through the Commons and Lords, by a week on Thursday. Some want to crack on with it, some want to tweak it and some want to wreck it. What happens in the next few days will determine whether the UK leaves the European Union a week on Thursday and in what way. And it is likely to shape when the next general election is. And, perhaps, who wins it. Mr Rees-Mogg announced the so-called ""programme motion"" - outlining the timetable for debating and passing the WAB - on Monday. He said if MPs backed it, it would allow the bill to be debated at second reading and committee stage on Tuesday, with further discussion on Wednesday, before concluding with a report stage and third reading on Thursday. Jacob Rees-Mogg presenting the programme motion to the Commons The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said the government hoped to push the WAB through by getting MPs to sit until midnight on Tuesday and Wednesday. But MPs will have to vote to agree to that timetable on Tuesday before the second reading, and the bill would also need to be approved by the Lords before becoming law. Allow Twitter content?

Labour's shadow Commons leader, Valerie Vaz, criticised the proposal, telling MPs: ""At every stage the government has been running scared of this House and democracy, and it's now attempting to force through a flawed Brexit deal which sells out people's jobs, rights and our communities."" The SNP's Pete Wishart also condemned a lack of economic impact assessments of the deal ahead of the attempt to pass the legislation. ""Three days to consider a bill [that] somebody suggested is 100 pages... how on earth are we going to have the chance to assess that properly?"" But Mr Rees-Mogg said other acts - including the Benn Act - had been brought and passed with short notice. ""A king emperor left in 24 hours, and we are removing an imperial yoke in over a week,"" he added. Do you have any questions about the Brexit bill and what happens next?

Actors support Katie Jarvis after taking 'normal job'Soap stars defend ex EastEnders actress Katie Jarvis after newspaper reveals her new shop job.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played Ex-EastEnders actress describes how she was made to feel during her job-shaming story Former EastEnders actress Katie Jarvis says she felt ""degraded"" and ""hurt"" after a newspaper splashed pictures of her working as a shop security guard. On Sunday, theDaily Star,externalrevealed the actress, who played Hayley Slater, was now working at a B&M store in Romford. It prompted an outpouring of empathy on social media, as many actors underlined the uncertain nature of the profession. Speaking to the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Show, Jarvis said the tone of the story was ""really quite nasty"". ""I woke up really embarrassed and made to feel quite ashamed, to be honest"" said the 28-year-old, who now works alongside her sister. ""See over my career I've done by best to try and stay away from social gatherings, get-togethers and celebrity things, to keep my private life as private as possible. ""So to wake up with my kids and see myself on the front of the pages just for simply having a job in between my acting, it really did hurt me."" She added: ""It took a day or so for me to actually let it all digest and realise I had nothing to be ashamed about."" Jarvis first made her name starring as Mia Williams in the 2009 British drama film Fish Tank, before heading to Albert Square for a year-long stint which ended in February 2019. The east Londoner explained she's worked in a range of jobs to support her acting career - including as a waitress and for a credit card company. She admitted she's been ""overwhelmed"" by the support she's received from her acting colleagues, like Kathy Burke, who comically re-interpreted the headline of the tabloid story - or non-story, as she saw it.

In a show of solidarity, other TV stars revealed they too supplement their acting careers with other types of employment. Tamzin Outhwaite posted,external: ""Yes, I am a landlady, a voice over artist, car boot salesperson, art dealer, up cyclist, interior designer, motivational speaker, and many other jobs... it's what artists do to earn a living. They work in between jobs."" ""It's called grafting!"" she added. ""Or not being afraid of hard work... or loving your family enough to drop your dream for a bit to earn a living so the family can live life. And there is no shame in wanting to work hard to make sure your offspring are cared for."" TV critic Emma Bullimore told the BBC she understands why actors are getting upset with the newspaper for splashing Jarvis's new non-acting job all over the front page in a ""humiliating"" manner. But, she says, the situation is ""more complicated"" than some soap stars are making out. ""I can see both sides of it really as it does feel quite cruel in the way that they did it, kicking her while she's down I suppose,"" says Bullimore. (L-R) Shane Richie as Alfie Moon, Jessie Wallace as Kat Moon and Katie Jarvis as Hayley Slater holding baby Cherry Slater in 2018 ""But with a tabloid hat on, you can totally see that it is the perfect story - she was in one of the biggest shows on TV, had a massive part in it and she was basically in every scene for a little while. ""Then she disappeared, slightly oddly, and now suddenly she's working at B&M. I think if she was working at Waitrose it would not be as good a story."" Charlie Condou, who played Marcus Dent in Coronation Street, called the Jarvis story ""shameful journalism,"" adding he'd done something similar himself. ""When I left Corrie I had a string of very nice TV and theatre jobs,""he tweeted,external. ""Then I didn't. ""So I got a job working in a restaurant to pay my bills and take care of my kids. That's what responsible adults do."" In one of her most memorable EastEnders scenes from last Christmas, Jarvis's character Hayley pushed Alfie Moon, played by Shane Ritchie, down the stairs in defence of her relative Kat Moon. Since leaving EastEnders, Jarvis has kept a relatively low profile. However, in March, she tweeted to say she was ""absolutely fine"" following reports she had been ""glassed"" on a night out. She's no longer on social media. Katie Jarvis: EastEnders actress says she is 'fine' after reported attack Bullimore believes ""it feels like a choice"", in this instance, for her to make the move away from the camera so soon, making the newspaper article all the more intriguing for readers. ""I can see why people would want to read it because they'll think 'surely you're really well paid if you're on EastEnders and you're living the life of an actress.' And she was in it so recently, so why would you need the money so quickly? ""That's not to say that I think it [the story] is fair, but I don't think it's necessarily any worse than the way that tabloids treat actors in general."" (L-R) Sorry We Missed You stars Debbie Honeywood, Katie Proctor, Rhys Stone, Kris Hitchen and Ken Loach at the Cannes Film Festival in May Jarvis is not the first and won't be the last actor to do a ""normal job"" before, during or after an acting career. In fact, award-winning director Ken Loach told the BBC's arts editor Will Gompertz he actively shied away from casting big name Hollywood stars in his latest drama, Sorry We Missed You, in favour of actors who have had recent experience working in relevant industries. Zero-hour contracts can 'kill' - Ken Loach The film features actor/plumber and van driver Kris Hitchen and actress/teaching assistant and care worker Debbie Honeywood at the head of a Newcastle family, struggling to make ends meet on zero-hour contract jobs. ""Finding people to bring a story to life is the second-most important decision you ever make in filmmaking, second to the script - which is the most important,"" explained Loach. ""The camera can see who you are, maybe in ways you're not aware of - how you stand, how you use your hands, the quality of your skin depends on your diet. Every mannerism that you're not aware of. And you've also got to believe that people can do the job they say that they can do in the film and reach the character and absolutely have the capacity to draw the audience in. ""So the audience laughs with them and cries with them and is angry with them and identifies with them and has solidarity with them. And we were really lucky to find Chris and Debbie."" He added: ""They're both terrific, but they can act, make no mistake."" This video can not be played Director Ken Loach explains why he doesn't use Hollywood actors in his films. Elsewhere in the industry, former Hollyoaks and Holby City actorJeremy Edwardsfound work, like Jarvis, as a security guard, and as a gardener. AsCelebs Now reported,external, in 2011, he noted: ""I don't know any actors who work consistently without other work. A lucky few, but not many, I had a good 10-year run!"" Gemma Merna, who played Carmen McQueen in Hollyoaks for eight years - winning best comedy performance at the 2007 British Soap Awards - now also works as a yoga instructor and personal trainer. Geoffrey Owens: 'Job-shamed' Cosby Show star lands TV role Meanwhile,Geoffrey Owens, who played Elvin in the Cosby Show between 1985 and 1992, thanked supporters last year after photos of him working as a cashier at US grocery Trader Joe'swere mocked online. Rap star and Cosby Show fan Nicki Minaj donated $25,000 (Â£22,433) to the ""legend"" after he was similarly job-shamed, however, Owens donated the amount to a fund helping actors in need.

Waitrose to stop putting plastic toys in crackers,"John Lewis said ""fill your own"" crackers now account for one in three packets sold Waitrose and John Lewis are to stop selling Christmas crackers containing plastic toys from 2020 as part of plans to cut down on single-use plastic. Instead crackers will be filled with toys made from recyclable materials and will not use plastic glitter. The company is one of a number of retailers pledging to cut the amount of plastic in its Christmas range. Friends of the Earth welcomed the move but said it was ""a shame"" it could not happen sooner. Julian Kirby, plastics campaigner for the charity, said: ""Getting rid of the plastic tat from Christmas crackers will go some way to cutting down on the pollution of the festive season, but we'd like to challenge all supermarkets to give us the gift of a Christmas completely free of unnecessary plastic."" Explaining the 2020 target, Dan Cooper, partner and head Christmas buyer at John Lewis, said: ""One of the challenges I face as a buyer is that we plan 18 months ahead so it takes time for changes to become a reality."" Louise Edge, head of Greenpeace UK's ocean plastics campaign, also called for more action from retailers, including offering reusable gift bags and boxes and selling Christmas cards loose, rather than wrapped in plastic. ""Single-use plastic should never be a Christmas tradition, so we welcome John Lewis and Waitrose getting rid of throwaway plastic toys from crackers,"" she said. ""However this should be just step one for retailers."" Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing? Plastic toys: Is it time we cut back? John Lewis is also selling ""fill your own"" Christmas crackers, which the company said now account for one in three packs sold. The company said it had also reduced the amount of plastic glitter on its own-brand range of Christmas wrapping paper, gift bags, advent calendars and crackers by two-thirds, as well as removing plastic wrapping from the majority of individual cards it sells. Last December, it announced plans to ban plastic glitter from these own-label products by Christmas 2020. Standard glitter is made from etched aluminium bonded to polyethylene terephthalate - a form of microplastic that can find its way into the oceans and harm animals. Tescohas switched to a plastic-free, biodegradable glitter on its Christmas range of trees, plants and flowers this year, as well as removing glitter from its own-brand wrapping paper, tags and single Christmas cards. Marks and Spencerhas removed glitter from its entire Christmas range this year, as part of a commitment to make all its cards and gift-wrapping products glitter-free by the end of 2020. Sainsbury'shas ditched all plastic packaging from its Christmas crackers this year. Asdaremoved plastic windows and film from more than 1.6m mince pies last Christmas, as part of a drive to reduce plastic from its own-brand packaging. Most wrapping paper contains plastic- instead you could use brown paper jazzed up with fabric ribbon, string or a potato print design Ditch plastic decorations like tinsel and glittery baubles and go for natural alternatives like sprigs of holly and mistletoe or hang edible biscuits to decorate your tree If you already have an artificial plastic tree,Friends of the Earth,externaladvises you keep using it to make it last as long as possible If you opt for a real tree it recommends one approved by the Soil Association or with an FSC logo to ensure it has been grown sustainably Alternatively you couldhire a treefor the festive season which can then be replanted E-cards, sent online, are a waste-free alternative to the traditional Christmas card Shop-bought advent calendars tend to be full of plastic packaging - try a fabric version which can be filled with treats of your choice Burger King ditches toy giveaways Plastic packaging: How are supermarkets doing?

Cost of living protests in Chile take deadly toll,"This video can not be played Protesters and security forces clashed for a third day in Santiago The number of people killed in violent protests against rising living costs in Chile has risen to 11, Santiago Governor Karla Rubilar said on Monday. At least five people died after looters torched a factory near the capital. The military and police used tear gas against protesters, and a curfew was imposed in major cities for a third night on Monday. A state of emergency already in place in Santiago is to be extended to cities in the country's north and south. The unrest, sparked by a now suspended metro fare hike, widened to reflect anger over living costs and inequality. Why protesters are on the streets worldwide Is inequality becoming worse in Chile? Ahead of major disruption expected on Monday, Chile's President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era said the country was ""at war"" with a violent enemy. But the head of national security, Gen Javier Iturriaga, played down such talk. After taking a helicopter flight over the city to assess the situation, he told journalists on Monday morning he was satisfied with the situation. ""To tell you the truth, I'm not at war with anyone,"" he said. ""I'm a happy man."" Firefighters say they found five bodies inside the garment factory burned by rioters in a suburb of Santiago. Three more people are also reported to have died on Sunday although no details have so far been given about the circumstances of their deaths. Earlier reports suggestedthree people had died in a supermarket fire in Santiago on Saturday, bringing the total of people killed since the protests started to 11. Santiago has been seething with unrest There had been 70 ""serious incidents of violence"", including 40 lootings of supermarkets and other businesses. Two people also suffered gunshot wounds after a clash with police, officials say. ""We're facing a real escalation that is undoubtedly organised to cause serious damage to our country and the lives of each of its citizens,"" Interior Minister AndrÃ©s Chadwick said. Some 10,500 police and soldiers have been deployed on the streets, he added, while officials report more than 1,400 arrests. In several cities on Sunday, protesters set more buses on fire, smashed up metro stations and clashed with riot police. A state of emergency will be applied to Antofagasta, ValparaÃ­so, Valdivia, ChillÃ¡n, Talca, Temuco and Punta Arenas, allowing authorities to restrict people's freedom of movement and their right to assembly. In pictures: Santiago in state of emergency Chile country profile In Santiago, almost all public transport was suspended and some flights at the international airport were cancelled or rescheduled because of insufficient crew. Hundreds of travellers have been affected by flight cancellations At least one line of the city's metro was expected to reopen on Monday after the entire system was closed on Friday because of damage. Mr PiÃ±era, a billionaire conservative, has been criticised for his response to the protests, the most severe crisis of his current term. In a TV speech, he said people who were causing fires, setting up barricades and looting were ""criminals"". Profile: Sebastian PiÃ±era ""We're very aware that [those behind the riots] have a degree of organization, logistics, typical of a criminal organization,"" he said. ""I call on all my compatriots to unite in this battle against violence and delinquency."" The protests were sparked by a now suspended metro fare hike Mr PiÃ±era - who took office in March 2018 after having served as president between 2010 and 2014 - has deployed soldiers and tanks for the first time since 1990, when Chile returned to democracy after the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile and now the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the violence in her home country. She said all deaths must be independently investigated amid ""disturbing allegations of excessive use of force by security and armed forces"" - but also lamented injuries suffered by security forces. ""The use of inflammatory rhetoric will only serve to further aggravate the situation, and risks generating widespread fear,"" she said. Analysis by Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼ter, BBC News Online Latin America editor ""We're at war against a powerful and implacable enemy who doesn't respect anything or anyone, and who's willing to use limitless violence and criminal acts."" That is how President PiÃ±era described the protests late on Sunday. While some of the footage of violent clashes between the security forces and protesters do resemble those coming out of a war zone, other reaction to Mr PiÃ±era's description has been scathing with opposition politicians calling it ""pathetic"" and ""irresponsible"". But more important is the effect those words have had on the protesters. If they already felt ignored by the government, President PiÃ±era labelling them as criminals in their eyes proves how little he cares about their concerns. With the protest movement gaining momentum while still lacking clear leaders and Mr PiÃ±era's language further stoking the flames, the chance of any meaningful dialogue seems to slip further away. The unrest has exposed divisions in the nation, one of the region's wealthiest but also one of its most unequal, and intensified calls for economic reforms. It followssimmering discontent in some of the country's universities and schools over lack of resources and underfunding. Protester Constanza Gonzalez told the BBC: ""This isn't about political parties. I think people are angry and this was a thing that had been coming for quite a long time."" Mr PiÃ±era suspended the rise in the Santiago metro fare on Saturday, saying he had listened ""with humility"" to ""the voice of my compatriots"". What's driving Chile's protests?

Top fund manager forced to resign,"One of the world's leading fund managers has been forced to resign after the BBC discovered he had broken investment rules. Mark Denning helped to manage more than $300bn (Â£229bn; â¬265bn)   of investors' money at Capital Group. BBC One's Panorama uncovered evidence that suggests he was secretly acquiring shares for his own benefit in some of the same companies as his funds. Mr Denning, who had worked at the firm for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing. The 62-year-old fund manager left his job five days after Panorama wrote to Capital Group about the findings of its investigation. Capital Group - which manages almost $2 trillion of assets - said Mr Denning was no longer with the firm. ""We have a Code of Ethics and personal investing disclosure requirements that hold our associates to the highest standards of conduct. When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action,"" it said. Fund managers are not supposed to invest in the same companies as their funds, because they could potentially profit at the expense of investors. This is because their size means the funds can drive up a company's share price when they invest. The fund manager could use this power to push up the share price in the companies where they have personal investments, rather than picking the companies that offer the best returns for investors. The Panorama investigation discovered that shares were bought on Mr Denning's instructions through a secretive fund based in Liechtenstein. It was called Morebath Fund Global Opportunities. Leaked documents show the Morebath fund had invested in a medical research company called Mesoblast, an Indian film company called Eros International and a gold mining company called Hummingbird Resources. Capital Group funds also invested in all three companies, and the investments in Mesoblast and Eros were made by funds that Mr Denning himself helped to manage. In the case of Hummingbird Resources, Mr Denning appeared to have another potential conflict of interest as the company was set up and run by his son-in-law. This video can not be played ""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, that does raise serious concerns."" An expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest. Michael Ruck, investigations partner at the law firm TLT, said: ""The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors. ""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions."" The stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust. It was set up and controlled by Mr Denning. Mr Denning's lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust. ""Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties."" Mr Denning's lawyers say he received bad advice. They also say the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator. However, Panorama has seen evidence that Mr Denning was behind the share purchases in the three companies and documents show the Morebath fund was regularly included in a summary of his personal assets. Mr Denning appears to have named the Liechtenstein-based fund after the village of Morebath in North Devon. He owns a nine bedroom house, Morebath Manor, and 21 acres of parkland in the village. The fund manager also owns luxury homes in Chelsea and the Bahamas. Mr Denning used to work for Capital Group in London and was approved by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority until 2018. However, four of the funds he managed were aimed at American investors and he had been working from the company's office in Los Angeles. Panorama also discovered that the Kinrara Trust owned Kinrara International - a company that profited from a controversial energy deal in Senegal. Kinrara International made $22m after the exploration rights to a huge gas field off the Senegalese coast were sold to BP. Experts have told Panorama that they believe Mr Denning should also have declared this - because Capital Group had investments in BP and another company involved in the deal called Kosmos Energy. Mr Denning's lawyers say he has never been a legal or beneficial owner of Kinrara International.

What is in Johnson's new deal?,"A revised Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU. What is in it? Most of the changes - to the deal agreed by Theresa May with EU in November 2018 - are to do with the status of the Irish border after Brexit. This issue has dominated talks for months. All sides want to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - with checks and infrastructure that could be targeted by paramilitary groups. Coming up with solutions to this - acceptable to all sides - has been very challenging. The new protocol,externalreplaces the controversial Irish backstop plan in Theresa May's deal. Much of the rest of that deal will remain. Here are some of the key new parts: The whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union. The customs union is an agreement between EU countries not to charge taxes called tariffs on things coming from other EU countries, and to charge the same tariffs as each other on things coming from outside the EU. Leaving the customs union means the UK will be able to strike trade deals with other countries in the future. Legally there will be a customs border between Northern Ireland (which stays in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (which stays in the EU), but in practice things won't be checked on that border. The actual checks will be on what is effectively a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, with goods being checked at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland. Taxes will only have to be paid on goods being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if those products are considered ""at risk"" of then being transported into the Republic of Ireland. A joint committee made up of UK and EU representatives will decide at a later date what goods are considered ""at risk"". If taxes are paid on ""at risk"" goods that do not end up being sent on from Northern Ireland into the EU, the UK would be responsible for whether to refund the money. Individual travellers won't have their baggage checked and taxes will not have to be paid by individuals sending goods to other people. Separately, there will be limits agreed by the joint committee on the amount of help the government can give to Northern Irish farmers. The figure will be based on the amount they currently receive from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Where have the UK and EU compromised? Brexit deal: What does it mean? Brexit: What happens now? Have UK voters changed their minds on Brexit? When it comes to the regulation of goods (that's the rules they have to follow on things like labelling and manufacturing processes) Northern Ireland would keep to EU rules rather than UK rules. That removes the need for checks on goods including food and agricultural produce at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it adds to the checks between the rest of the UK - which will not necessarily be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland. This will be done by UK officials at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland, but the EU will have the right to have its own officials present. It seems those EU officials may be able to overrule UK officials. The agreement states that EU representatives will be able to ask UK authorities to take certain steps in individual cases and they will have to do so. Because Northern Ireland will be set apart from the rest of the UK when it comes to customs and other EU rules, the deal gives its Assembly a vote on these new arrangements. But this vote would not happen until four years after the end of the transition period (the time after Brexit when everything stays the same to allow everyone to prepare for the changes while the UK's future relationship with the EU is discussed). The transition period is due to run until at least the end of 2020. So the four-year period would run until the end of 2024. If the Northern Ireland Assembly votes against the new arrangements, they would stop applying two years later, during which time the ""joint committee"" would make recommendations to the UK and EU on what to do about this. If there were to be no agreement during this two year period, some form of hard border could re-emerge in Ireland, but it's unlikely that would be allowed to happen. If the Assembly accepts the continuing provisions by a simple majority, they will then apply for another four years. If the deal has ""cross-community support"" then they will apply for eight years. The deal defines cross-community support as more than 50% of unionist and nationalist Assembly members voting in favour, or at least 40% of members from each designation if in total at least 60% of members have voted in favour. The UK government has said that if the Northern Ireland Assembly is still not sitting at that point,it will make alternative arrangements to make sure a vote can take place.,external The new agreement says thatEU law on value added tax,external(VAT - a tax added when you make purchases) will apply in Northern Ireland, but only on goods, not services. But it also allows Northern Ireland to have different VAT rates to the rest of the UK, which would not normally be allowed under EU law. For example, if the UK decided to reduce the VAT on household fuel to zero, Northern Ireland would still have to keep it at 5%, which is the EU minimum. It also means that Northern Ireland may get the same VAT rates on certain goods as the Republic of Ireland, to stop there being an unfair advantage on either side of the border. Much of Mrs May's original Brexit deal will remain as part of the overall agreement. Some of the key areas are: The transition - a period of time during which all of the current rules stay the same allowing the UK and the EU to negotiate their future relationship - is due to last until the end of December 2020. The UK will need to abide by EU rules and pay into the EU budget, but will lose membership of its institutions. The transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Freedom of movement rules will continue to apply during transition. This means that UK nationals will be able to live and work in EU countries (and EU nationals will be able to live and work in UK) during this period. Anyone who remains in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. (UPDATE: 13 December 2019 - This piece has been updated and reflects the delay of the Brexit date to the end of January 2020.) The UK will have to settle its financial obligations to the EU. There is no precise figure but the biggest part of this ""divorce bill"" will be the UK contributions to the EU budget until the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. When Brexit was delayed it meant that some of that money was paid as the UK's normal membership contributions, so less of it was part of the divorce bill. When the Brexit date was 31 October 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)estimated,externalthat the bill was about Â£32.8bn (down from Â£39bn). To reach an estimate of what the bill would be for departure on 31 January 2020, you could subtract the Â£1.62bn thatthe OBR said,externalwas left to pay in membership fees in 2019 and 14% of the Â£10.69bn for the whole of 2020 (it's more than one twelfth because the EU usually requests a higher proportion of the contributions earlier in the year). That gives a total of just under Â£30bn. The OBR expects that most of the money - about three-quarters of the total - would be paid by 2022, with some relatively small payments still being made in the 2060s. This is addressed in the political declaration.This text, which is not legally binding, has also been revised by UK/EU negotiators.,external It says that both sides will work towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and a high-level meeting will happen in June 2020 to see how that work is going. The text also contains a new paragraph on the so-called ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations in the future. The references to a ""level playing field"" were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement and put in the political declaration, which is not binding. It says that both sides will keep the same high standards on state aid, competition, social and employment standards, the environment, climate change, and ""relevant tax matters"".

Brexit: The next few days,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Tributes to victims of 'senseless' party killings,"The boys were stabbed at a house party in Archford Croft in Milton Keynes Two 17-year-old boys were stabbed to death at a house party as part of a ""targeted attack"", police believe. The boys, named locally as Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice, were attacked at the house in Milton Keynes at about midnight on Saturday. Thames Valley Police said those responsible ""arrived at the party uninvited, wore face coverings and were armed with knives"". No arrests have been made in the double murder inquiry. One of the boys died at the scene and the other in hospital. Another 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man were also hurt and were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries. One has since been discharged. Thames Valley Police said there was an ""increased presence"" in the area Det Ch Supt Ian Hunter described the attack as a ""dreadful incident"". ""We know that the party was a private birthday party, and although we believe that all of those involved were known to each other, we believe that those responsible arrived at the party uninvited, wore face coverings and they were armed with knives in what appears to be a targeted attack,"" he said. Det Ch Supt Hunter said officers were ""working around the clock"" to trace the suspects. ""I have a clear message to those responsible. We are looking for you and I urge you to hand yourself into a police station as soon as possible,"" he said. He said the victims' families were being supported by specially trained officers and post-mortem examinations are due to take place on Tuesday. Forensic searches were still taking place on Monday Officers are expected to remain at the scene, which is in a cul-de-sac on a housing estate in the Emerson Valley area, for several days. Stains of what appeared to be blood could be seen on the front door of a house inside the police cordon. The two deaths have been labelled ""senseless"" by those paying tribute to the boys. Diane Ackah-Sanzah addressed Mr Ansah's family on Facebook and said: ""This is so senseless... I am truly heartbroken for you."" Wendy Ince said: ""Shocked to hear of the senseless loss of your boy... thinking of you at this awful time"", and Kevin Amoakuh said: ""So sad, so painful, so untimely."" Family members visited the scene on Sunday to leave flowers Two of Dom Ansah's cousins laid flowers at the cordon on Sunday afternoon. ""He's come here with his long-time best friend since childhood, comes to a party and both of their lives just got ripped away from them,"" said one, who did not give her name. ""He was just so respectful to like his family and friends. Many, many people's hearts are broken."" Det Ch Supt Hunter appealed for ""anybody who thinks that they have any information, no matter how insignificant you believe this to be, to come forward"".

Fare reduction demand over Pacer trains from 1980sSenior politicians say rail firm Northern should reduce fares for passengers using Pacer trains.England,"Pacer trains have been described as ""buses on train wheels"" Politicians in northern England are demanding that passengers still having to use the heavily-criticised Pacer trains should be offered reduced fares. Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham, Sheffield City Region Mayor Dan Jarvis and Leeds City Council leader Judith Blake have told operator Northern that using the ageing units is unacceptable. Northern will meet with them to discuss ""what offer we can put to customers"". Pacers are 1980s-built rail-buses meant as a short-term alternative to trains. Northern had planned to withdraw them all by the end of this year. Managing director David Brown said it was ""very frustrating"" that a small number would have to be retained into 2020 as a result of delays in the construction and delivery of new trains from manufacturer CAF. Themuch-derided Pacerswere originally constructed from the body of a bus and were intended to have a maximum lifespan of 20 years. This video can not be played Pacer trains: What's the problem? They were a joint venture between British Rail and Leyland Motors. In a letter to Northern, Mr Burnham, Mr Jarvis and Ms Blake said it was ""unacceptable"" that Northern would still be using Pacers into 2020, and called for an urgent meeting. ""However, the alternative of withdrawing the Pacers without any alternative replacements would be an even worse outcome,"" they said. ""As we are forced into accepting the temporary retention of Pacers, we expect you to commit, as a matter of urgency, to appropriate financial compensation to the passengers affected."" They said fares should be reduced on all affected routes while the trains were being used. Commuters complained of the trains being hot, noisy and bumpy. Each Pacer is essentially a Leyland Motors bus mounted on train wheels Student Rimsha Sawant from Blackburn said she sighs when she sees her train is a Pacer. ""They need replacing because they are not good enough,"" she said. ""With all the technology we have we should at least have decent trains."" Commuter Sam Brown said in the summer the heat gets trapped inside ""leaving you a sweaty mess"". ""It's always a massive disappointment when you see a Pacer train waiting at the platform to take you. ""They are incredibly loud when revving up, making it impossible to have a conversation with friends, and you also feel the full force of any bumps on the track,"" she said. However, Sally Carter said she preferred them to more modern trains because of the seating arrangement and large windows. ""I'm rather fond of them and will be sad to see them go,"" she said. Rimsha Sawant commutes from Blackburn to Manchester Pacer trains have been regularly used on busy commuter routes, including those into Manchester, Leeds, Middlesbrough, Sheffield and York, as well as on the Merseyrail network. As of October 2018, almost one in four vehicles operated by Northern was a Pacer, according to the Department for Transport (DfT). Areport from DfT,externalsaid of the 875 vehicles in its fleet at that time, 158 were Class 142 Pacers, built between 1985 and 1987, while a further 56 were Class 144, built between 1986 and 1988. 'The trains that refuse to die' 'Museum piece' trains to stay until 2020 Northern launches new Â£500m train fleet By Danny Savage, BBC North of England correspondent Pacers are the laughing stock, rolling stock of the north. Introduced in the 1980s, they are rail-buses originally meant as a short-term solution to a shortage of trains. Supporters say they've helped keep certain routes open and used. Detractors say they highlight the North/South divide and are relics. Northern promised to withdraw Pacers by the end of this year. In February, the BBC reported concerns they were unlikely to meet that target but Northern strongly denied that was the case. They insisted they would be gone by the beginning of 2020. More recently, they have admitted some Pacer units will still be in operation into next year. Managing director Mr Brown added: ""Everyone wants to see Pacers go from the north of England. ""Nobody in Northern wants to retain the Pacers but it's something we've been forced into doing because our new trains, which are fantastic, are arriving slightly slower than we'd expect. ""It's a small number of trains for a small number of weeks on a small number of routes. We've taken the decision that this is far better than cancelling trains or running them without enough seats. ""We want to talk through how we're going to deal with the retention of those trains and what can we do for customers that will be forced to use them into the new year. ""Of course we're not ruling anything out in terms of what package we can put together for customers."" There were calls for Northern to be stripped of its franchise when""carnage"" followed the introduction of new timetablesin May 2018.

Scientists seek clues to 'birth of cancer',"British and American scientists are teaming up to search for the earliest signs of cancer in a bid to detect and treat the disease before it emerges. They plan to ""give birth"" to cancer in the lab to see exactly what it looks like ""on day one"". It is just one of the research priorities of the new International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection. Working together on early detection of cancer will mean patients benefitting more quickly, it says. Cancer Research UK has teamed up with the Universities of Cambridge, Manchester, University College London, and Stanford and Oregon in the US, to share ideas, technology and expertise in this area. Together, the scientists are aiming to develop less invasive tests, such as blood, breath and urine tests, for monitoring high-risk patients, improve imaging techniques for detecting cancer early and look for virtually undetectable signs of the disease. But they admit this is ""like looking for a needle in a haystack"" and could be 30 years off. ""The fundamental problem is that we never get to see a cancer being born in a human being,"" says Dr David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK. ""By the time it's found, it's already established."" A blood test for cancer has long been sought after by scientists Researchers from Manchester, for example, are growing human breast tissue in the lab with synthetic immune cells to see if they can spot the very earliest, subtle changes that could lead to cancer. Prof Rob Bristow said it was akin to a ""living tissue bank outside patients"". Yet there is always the danger of over-diagnosis, because not all early cell changes turn into cancers. So the cancer researchers say they must be more precise, also looking at the genes people are born with and the environment they grow up in, to work out an individual's unique personal risk of different cancers. Only then will they know when to intervene. To date, scientists say research on early detection has been small-scale and disconnected, lacking the power of trials in big populations of people. Dr Crosby said the collaboration would ""induce a sea-change in our health systems, shifting it from expensive firefighting of late-stage disease, to being able to intervene at its earliest point and deliver rapid, cost-effective treatment"". Figures show that 98% of breast cancer patients live for five years or more if the disease is diagnosed at stage 1 - the earliest stage- compared to just 26% at stage 4, the most advanced stage. But, at present, only around 44% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed at the earliest stage. Hyper-polarised MRI scans could be the future for diagnosing prostate cancer In the UK, screening programmes exist for breast, bowel and cervical cancers, when people reach a particular age. However, there are currently no reliable screening tools for other cancers, such as pancreas, liver, lung and prostate, which means survival rates are often much lower. Prof Mark Emberton, from UCL, said the growth of imaging, such as MRI, was a ""silent revolution"" which could replace needles, used in biopsies, in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. ""Imaging only sees the aggressive cells, it overlooks the stuff you don't want to find and addresses over-diagnosis,"" he said, but he warned it was expensive and took time, and was ""not ready for prime time yet"". More accurate hyper-polarised MRI scans and photo acoustics, where laser light is delivered to the tumour, creating sound waves which are analysed to produce images, are the next advances being tested in imaging. Scientists are searching for new ways of detecting prostate cancer Prof Emberton said the next goal was to see which cancers lent themselves to this type of imaging. At the University of Cambridge, Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald is developing an advanced endoscope to detect pre-cancerous lesions in the food pipe and colon. She said early detection hadn't been given the attention it deserved, and some tests for cancer could be very simple and inexpensive. Prof Fitzgerald said she looked forward to working with international colleagues to take ideas ""all the way from the bench to the bedside"". Cancer Research UK is investing Â£40m in the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection over the next five years, with $20m being contributed by Canary Center at Stanford University and the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute in Oregon.

Murray wins first title since surgery,"This video can not be played Andy Murray wins first ATP title since surgery Andy Murray broke down in tears after winning his first singles title since career-saving hip surgery by beating Stan Wawrinka at the European Open. The Briton, 32, launched a stunning comeback from a set and a break down to win 3-6 6-4 6-4 in Antwerp to take his first title for more than two years. Murray had surgery in January and was playing in just his seventh tournament since returning to singles. He described it as ""one of the biggest"" wins of his career. ""It means a lot,"" the three-time Grand Slam champion said. ""The last few years have been extremely difficult. ""I didn't expect to be in this position at all. I'm happy, very happy."" Fellow Grand Slam champion Wawrinka, who has also had a number of recent injury issues, said: ""To see you back at this level, it's amazing. ""We're all really happy. I'm sad I lost today but I'm really happy to see you back."" Reaction to Murray's victory Murray leads the head to head over Wawrinka 12-8 At the Australian Open in January atearful Murray said he feared his hip problem would force him to retireafter the tournament. But the Scot made apromising return to doubles action in Juneand then made hissingles comeback in Augustand in doing so became the first player to resume his career after a hip resurfacing operation. His comeback had been encouraging, reaching the quarter-finals of the China Open, but on Sunday in Belgium he produced his best performance yet against a fellow Grand Slam champion who was playing close to his best. Murray played well in the first set but was overcome by Wawrinka's scintillating hitting which continued into the second set when the Swiss hit four winners to win Murray's serve for a set and a break lead. Murray crucially saved two more break points soon after to stop himself falling two breaks behind and then won three games in a row before forcing the decider through his trademark athletic tennis. Both players looked nervous at the start of the third set with four consecutive breaks of serve but at 4-4 Murray saved two more critical break points, the second seen off with a big first serve. In the following game, Wawrinka surged ahead but at 40-15 he hit a volley to a Murray lob that looked to be going wide and then Murray hit a running passing shot winner to move to deuce. Shortly afterwards, on Murray's first match point, Wawrinka hit a forehand wide and, after the pair embraced at the net, Murray was visibly emotional as he waved to the crowd. Former British number one Greg Rusedski:""Andy Murray has won his first ATP singles title with a metal hip. Incredible effort. What a competitor to win from a set and a break down against Stan the man. Who would have believed it. Amazing."" Great Britain's Davis Cup captain Leon Smith:""An astonishing effort Andy Murray. So so proud of you!!!!"" BBC North America editor Jon Sopel:""Best news of the day. Who'd have thought it? Andy your spirit and your fight are remarkable. Skill has never been in doubt."" Former world number threeIvan Ljubicic:""Hip hip hurray Murray. Amazing stuff. Congrats to the whole team."" Jamie Delgado, Murray's coach:""Back in the winners circle again!!! Amazing Andy Murray and of course a big well done to all the team."" Murray's doubles partner at Queens, Feliciano Lopez: Russell Fuller, BBC tennis correspondent To win the match - from a set down, three games to one, and two further break points down - was remarkable. But to win the title nine months after an operation which was likely to end his career at the highest level is an astonishing feat. This was just Murray's 17th match back. Never mind the hip; stamina is usually a major issue after such a long absence from the tour. Not in Murray's case, it appears. Here he was completing, and winning, a fourth match in four days at the end of four weeks on the road. He will finish the year just outside the world's top 100 after an unimaginably successful and beneficial run of seven tournaments. Murray now returns home, where his wife is soon to give birth to their third child, and will then finish the season with his Great Britain team-mates at November's Davis Cup finals.

"Top fund manager forced to resignMark Denning, who managed billions of dollars of investors' money, broke investment rules, the BBC finds.","One of the world's leading fund managers has been forced to resign after the BBC discovered he had broken investment rules. Mark Denning helped to manage more than $300bn (Â£229bn; â¬265bn)   of investors' money at Capital Group. BBC One's Panorama uncovered evidence that suggests he was secretly acquiring shares for his own benefit in some of the same companies as his funds. Mr Denning, who had worked at the firm for 36 years, denies any wrongdoing. The 62-year-old fund manager left his job five days after Panorama wrote to Capital Group about the findings of its investigation. Capital Group - which manages almost $2 trillion of assets - said Mr Denning was no longer with the firm. ""We have a Code of Ethics and personal investing disclosure requirements that hold our associates to the highest standards of conduct. When we learned of this matter, we took immediate action,"" it said. Fund managers are not supposed to invest in the same companies as their funds, because they could potentially profit at the expense of investors. This is because their size means the funds can drive up a company's share price when they invest. The fund manager could use this power to push up the share price in the companies where they have personal investments, rather than picking the companies that offer the best returns for investors. The Panorama investigation discovered that shares were bought on Mr Denning's instructions through a secretive fund based in Liechtenstein. It was called Morebath Fund Global Opportunities. Leaked documents show the Morebath fund had invested in a medical research company called Mesoblast, an Indian film company called Eros International and a gold mining company called Hummingbird Resources. Capital Group funds also invested in all three companies, and the investments in Mesoblast and Eros were made by funds that Mr Denning himself helped to manage. In the case of Hummingbird Resources, Mr Denning appeared to have another potential conflict of interest as the company was set up and run by his son-in-law. This video can not be played ""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, that does raise serious concerns."" An expert on the financial rules told Panorama that the private purchases by Mr Denning could represent a serious conflict of interest. Michael Ruck, investigations partner at the law firm TLT, said: ""The whole point behind the regime, in relation to declaring conflicts of interest, is to protect investors. ""If there was an intention by the fund manager to financially benefit themselves, then that does raise serious concerns in relation to their actions."" The stakes in the three companies were ultimately held through an offshore entity called the Kinrara Trust. It was set up and controlled by Mr Denning. Mr Denning's lawyers deny that he owns the shares in the three companies because they say he is not a beneficiary of the Kinrara Trust. ""Our client did not declare his interest in the Kinrara Trust to his former employers because he had been irrevocably excluded as a beneficiary. He believed that he had complied with all of his relevant duties."" Mr Denning's lawyers say he received bad advice. They also say the Morebath fund had an independent asset manager and fund administrator. However, Panorama has seen evidence that Mr Denning was behind the share purchases in the three companies and documents show the Morebath fund was regularly included in a summary of his personal assets. Mr Denning appears to have named the Liechtenstein-based fund after the village of Morebath in North Devon. He owns a nine bedroom house, Morebath Manor, and 21 acres of parkland in the village. The fund manager also owns luxury homes in Chelsea and the Bahamas. Mr Denning used to work for Capital Group in London and was approved by the City watchdog, the Financial Conduct Authority until 2018. However, four of the funds he managed were aimed at American investors and he had been working from the company's office in Los Angeles. Panorama also discovered that the Kinrara Trust owned Kinrara International - a company that profited from a controversial energy deal in Senegal. Kinrara International made $22m after the exploration rights to a huge gas field off the Senegalese coast were sold to BP. Experts have told Panorama that they believe Mr Denning should also have declared this - because Capital Group had investments in BP and another company involved in the deal called Kosmos Energy. Mr Denning's lawyers say he has never been a legal or beneficial owner of Kinrara International.

Pollution 'triggers hundreds more heart attacks',"Higher air pollution in the UK trigger hundreds more heart attacks, strokes and acute asthma attacks each year, research suggests. A team at King's College London looked at data from London, Birmingham, Bristol, Derby, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Oxford and Southampton. They calculated days with above average pollution levels would see an extra 124 cardiac arrests over the year. NHS England boss Simon Stevens said it was evidence of ""a health emergency"". The figure is based on ambulance call data and does not count heart attacks suffered by patients already in hospital. It points to significant short-term health risks caused by air pollution, on top ofcontributing to almost 500,000 premature deathsin Europe every year. What does air pollution do to our bodies? UK faces European court over dirty air Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? On days with high pollution levels, across the nine cities in total, they calculated that there would be a total of 231 additional hospital admissions for stroke, with an extra 193 children and adults taken to hospital for asthma treatment. Dr Heather Walton, of King's College London's Environmental Research Group, said air pollution reduction policies concentrated in the main on effects connected to life expectancy. ""However, health studies show clear links with a much wider range of health effects,"" she added. The research suggests the problem is most acute in London In London, high-pollution days would see an extra 87 cardiac arrests per year, an extra 144 strokes, and 74 children and 33 adults ending up in hospital with asthma-related issues. In Birmingham the figure would be 12 more out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 27 additional admissions for stroke and 26 more for asthma. Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Oxford and Southampton would see between two and six more out-of-hospital heart attacks and up to 14 extra hospital admissions for both stroke and asthma. Only in Derby would there be no apparent increase. Among the long-term risks associated with high pollution levels are stunted lung growth and low birth weight. The King's College research also suggests cutting air pollution by a fifth would decrease incidents of lung cancer by between 5% and 7% across the nine cities surveyed. Mr Stevens said: ""It's clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency. ""Since these avoidable deaths are happening now - not in 2025 or 2050 - together we need to act now."" The figures were published ahead of Wednesday's International Clean Air Summit hosted by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and the UK100 network of local government leaders. UK100 director Polly Billington said: ""Local government needs additional powers and resources to address this public health crisis."" The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was ""taking urgent action to improve air quality and tackle pollution"" and that new legislation will ""increase local powers to address key sources of air pollution"". ""We are already working hard to reduce transport emissions and are investing Â£3.5 billion to clean up our air."" Researchers sometimes struggle to make their statistics human. This team worries that ""life years lost"" are too abstract. So they have looked at things that might hit closer to home like heart attacks or asthma attacks that hospitalise children. Using already published studies, they have worked out how many more of these events to expect on days with above-average pollution. The numbers might not knock your socks off: in London, for every 100 cardiac arrest ambulance callouts on low-pollution days, they would expect to see 102 on high-pollution days. But the numbers add up and reinforce the case for further reductions in air pollution. What does air pollution do to our bodies?

No 10 to push again for Brexit deal vote,"This video can not be played Brexit secretary says Letwin amendment 'moves the goal posts' MPs must be given ""a straight up-and-down vote"" on the PM's Brexit deal later, No 10 says, but it is not clear whether the Speaker will allow it. John Bercow is due to announce his decision at about 15:30 BST. The PM tried to bring his deal to the Commons for a vote on Saturday, but his strategy was dealt a blow when MPs backed moves to delay approval instead. The Speaker has previously ruled out repeatedly bringing back votes on the same matter more than once. BBC assistant political editor Norman Smith said Mr Bercow looked set to reject the PM's demand. Following Saturday's special sitting, and under the Benn Act, Boris Johnson was forced to send a letter asking the EU for an extension to the Brexit date beyond 31 October - although he did not sign it. Mr Johnson reached a new deal with the EU last week, but it needs to be approved by the UK Parliament - he wants MPs to say a clear ""yes"" or ""no"" to that on Monday afternoon. The legislation which would implement Brexit - called the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) - will also be introduced on Monday and must begin the process of parliamentary scrutiny. LIVE: Latest as PM pushes for Brexit deal vote Curtice: Do voters support PM's deal? What is the Withdrawal Agreement Bill? Labour's shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer has said his party will push for changes when the bill is brought to Parliament, for example, demanding a UK-wide customs union with the EU and single market alignment, and backing moves to put the deal to a referendum. The DUP has so far refused to support Mr Johnson's deal - and Labour has attempted to reach out to it - but the Northern Irish party's chief whip, Jim Shannon, told Sky News a customs union was ""something that we cannot support and will not support"". He said the party was meeting to discuss its strategy, but added: ""I believe that will be the stance we will have later on when we see the wording."" The prime minister's spokesman has reiterated the government's opposition to a customs union and another referendum, saying: ""Both of those have been voted on on a number of occasions in the House of Commons and neither have been successful."" IN BRIEF: How Parliament forced a delay EXPLAINED: How the delay request works ANALYSIS: What is in Boris Johnson's new deal? IN GRAPHICS: What happens now? IN FULL: Boris Johnson's Brexit delay letters The prime minister's deal ditches the backstop - the controversial ""insurance policy"" designed to prevent a return to physical checks on the Irish border. Instead it will, in effect, draw a new customs border in the Irish Sea, because goods which could then travel onwards to Ireland will have to pay a duty tax. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay told a Lords committee Northern Irish businesses would also have to complete export declarations to send any goods to the UK mainland. The EU is now considering how to respond to the UK's request for a delay, but BBC Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said it was ""virtually impossible"" for MEPs to approve the deal at the European Parliament session this week as they would not sign it off until all necessary steps had been taken in the UK Parliament. He said the Strasbourg parliament could hold a special session next week to approve the deal, but it was more likely they would do it at the next planned session on 13 November - meaning an extension would be needed. On Saturday, instead of answering the question, ""Do you support the deal or not?"" MPs effectively chose to change the question, backing the so-called Letwin amendment instead, which delays approval for the deal until the WAB is passed. Chief Secretary to the Treasury Rishi Sunak said he ""very much hoped"" the Speaker would allow the government a second chance to get MPs to give a straightforward ""yes"" or ""no"". ""What the Oliver Letwin amendment did is mean that Parliament hasn't given its explicit positive support for the deal,"" Mr Sunak told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""It was an observation on the deal happening and I think what people need is a substantive vote."" Brexitcast: Super(ish) Saturday... Brexit deal acceptable, says top Barclays banker Former Conservative minister, now independent MP, Justine Greening said the proper process through Parliament had to be followed in order for the WAB - a ""huge bill"" - to be given sufficient scrutiny. ""We all know that rushed law is bad law, this is the political rewiring of our country and it has to be done properly,"" she told the BBC. But Mr Sunak said: ""The substance of the withdrawal agreement has been public for a very long time, the bits that have changed - the backstop and the political declaration - were published last week. ""Parliament has shown time and time again... an ability to move very quickly when it wants to. We can sit late sit, at weekends. And that's of course what we should do."" A straight vote on the deal today seems unlikely because the government didn't pull the vote on Saturday - they walked away from it. So, theoretically, the Commons did give a view on the issue, and it can't be asked to give a different one today - let's see. The government is desperate to have a vote on the whole shebang as soon as possible to show momentum, before getting into days of scrutiny where MPs will try to make changes to the deal. That's not just because they are worried about losing more votes - this government has barely won any - but because if MPs make any major changes to the legislation, then it might mean PM has to go back to EU and ask for a different deal - you can imagine how much No 10 wants that. It also, of course, eats up time, making it harder and harder as the hours tick by for the government to be able to stick to the 31 October deadline - still not impossible, but looking increasingly unlikely. If the WAB ends up not getting through or being changed, there is very little chance the government will be able to avoid a delay, so the smart bet is that No 10 will just go back to pushing very hard for an election. Once a delay is agreed, it will be hard for opposition parties to block one - lots of individual MPs don't want it, but the government is prepared to hold a vote of no confidence in itself, or go for a simple majority vote if they can't get it through under the Fixed-term Parliaments Act's two-thirds bar. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal that will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. It has to secure the backing of a majority of MPs - and then of peers in the House of Lords. And a vote for the Brexit deal itself is no guarantee of a vote for the legislation required to implement it. This video can not be played Brexit: What actually happened on Saturday? The bill gives legal effect to the withdrawal deal, as well as any agreed transition period, and fulfils requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. It will also allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal. MPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill. If the government cannot get the bill through Parliament the default legal position is that the UK cannot ratify the deal, and so would leave on 31 October without a deal. However, that is dependent on no extension beyond that date having been already agreed with the EU. Passing the Letwin amendment meant the Benn Act was triggered because Parliament had not approved a deal - or approved no-deal - by the law's 19 October deadline. This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says he's confident the UK will leave the EU on 31 October That meant Mr Johnson had to send an extension request to Brussels, which he did, but left it unsigned - and accompanied it with a second, signed letter which said he believed a delay would be a mistake. On Sunday, ministers insisted the government believed it still had sufficient support in the Commons to pass the deal and remained committed to a 31 October departure. The Cabinet Office, meanwhile, has triggeredOperation Yellowhammer- its contingency plan to handle a no-deal Brexit - because it said there was no guarantee the EU would grant an extension. Scotland's highest court has delayed a decisionon whether the prime minister fully complied with the Benn Act. The Court of Session was originally asked earlier this month to consider using ""nobile officium"" powers to request a Brexit extension on the prime minister's behalf - but the judges delayed making a ruling until the political situation become clearer. The UK government argued it had fulfilled its legal obligations, but on Monday, Lord Carloway said the case should be continued until those obligations had been complied with in full.

In full: Boris Johnson's letters to the EU,"Boris Johnson has sent an unsigned request to the EU for a delay to Brexit - followed by a signed one arguing against it. The PMsent three letters in all- an unsigned photocopy of the request as outlined bythe Benn Act; an explanatory note from the UK's ambassador to the EU; and a personal, signed, letter saying why he does not want a delay. Dear Mr President, The UK Parliament has passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019. Its provisions now require Her Majesty's Government to seek an extension of the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty, currently due to expire at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 October 2019, until 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020. I am writing therefore to inform the European Council that the United Kingdom is seeking a further extension to the period provided under Article 50(3) of the Treaty on European Union, including as applied by Article 106a of the Euratom Treaty. The United Kingdom proposes that this period should end at 11 p.m. GMT on 31 January 2020. If the parties are able to ratify before this date, the Government proposes that the period should be terminated early. Yours sincerely, Prime Minister of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland Dear Secretary-General, As the United Kingdom Permanent Representative to the European Union, I invite your attention to the following matter. Attached is a letter sent as required by the terms of the European Union (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019. In terms of the next steps for parliamentary process, Her Majesty's Government will introduce the necessary legislation next week in order to proceed with ratification of the Withdrawal Agreement. I would be grateful for your acknowledgement of receipt of this letter. Sir Tim Barrow Saturday's Brexit vote: What happens now? Analysis: Another 'meaningful vote'? Kuenssberg: Stand by for ever more bruising Brexit battle Dear Donald, It was good to see you again at the European Council this week where we agreed the historic new deal to permit the orderly withdrawal of the United Kingdom from the European Union on October 31. I am deeply grateful to you, President Juncker and to all my fellow European leaders for the statesmanship and statecraft which enabled us to achieve this historic milestone. I should also register my appreciation for Michel Barnier and his team for their imagination and diplomacy as we concluded the negotiations. When I spoke in Parliament this morning, I noted the corrosive impact of the long delay in delivering the mandate of the British people from the 2016 referendum. I made clear that, while I believe passionately that both the UK and the EU will benefit from our decision to withdraw and develop a new relationship, that relationship will be founded on our deep respect and affection for our shared culture, civilisation, values and interests. We will remain the EU's closest partner and friend. The deal we approved at last week's European Council is a good deal for the whole of the UK and the whole of the EU. Regrettably, Parliament missed the opportunity to inject momentum into the ratification process for the new Withdrawal Agreement. The UK Parliament Representative will therefore submit the request mandated by the EU (Withdrawal) (No.2) Act 2019 later today. It is, of course, for the European Council to decide when to consider the request and whether to grant it. In view of the unique circumstances, while I regret causing my fellow leaders to devote more of their time and energy to a question I had hoped we had resolved last week, I recognise that you may need to convene a European Council. If it would be helpful to you, I would of course be happy to attend the start of any A50 Council so that I could answer properly any question on the position of HM Government and progress in the ratification process at that time. Meanwhile, although I would have preferred a different result today, the Government will press ahead with ratification and introduce the necessary legislation early next week. I remain confident that we will complete that process by 31 October. Indeed, many of those who voted against the Government today have indicated their support for the new deal and for ratifying it without delay. I know that I can count on your support and that of our fellow leaders to move the deal forward, and I very much hope therefore that on the EU side also, the process can be completed to allow the agreement to enter into force, as the European Council Conclusions mandated. While it is open to the European Council to accede to the request mandated by Parliament or to offer an alternative extension period, I have made clear since becoming Prime Minister, and made clear to Parliament again today, my view, and the Government's position, that a further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners, and the relationship between us. We must bring this process to a conclusion so that we can move to the next phase and build our new relationship on the foundations of our long history as neighbours and friends in this continent our peoples share. I am passionately committed to that endeavour. I am copying this letter to Presidents Juncker and Sassoli, and to members of the European Council.

What is in Boris Johnson's new Brexit deal?How would another Brexit delay work?EU papers' anguish at UK Brexit dramaA simple guide to Brexit,"A revised Brexit deal has been agreed by the UK and EU. What is in it? Most of the changes - to the deal agreed by Theresa May with EU in November 2018 - are to do with the status of the Irish border after Brexit. This issue has dominated talks for months. All sides want to avoid the return of a ""hard border"" between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit - with checks and infrastructure that could be targeted by paramilitary groups. Coming up with solutions to this - acceptable to all sides - has been very challenging. The new protocol,externalreplaces the controversial Irish backstop plan in Theresa May's deal. Much of the rest of that deal will remain. Here are some of the key new parts: The whole of the UK will leave the EU customs union. The customs union is an agreement between EU countries not to charge taxes called tariffs on things coming from other EU countries, and to charge the same tariffs as each other on things coming from outside the EU. Leaving the customs union means the UK will be able to strike trade deals with other countries in the future. Legally there will be a customs border between Northern Ireland (which stays in the UK) and the Republic of Ireland (which stays in the EU), but in practice things won't be checked on that border. The actual checks will be on what is effectively a customs border between Great Britain and the island of Ireland, with goods being checked at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland. Taxes will only have to be paid on goods being moved from Great Britain to Northern Ireland if those products are considered ""at risk"" of then being transported into the Republic of Ireland. A joint committee made up of UK and EU representatives will decide at a later date what goods are considered ""at risk"". If taxes are paid on ""at risk"" goods that do not end up being sent on from Northern Ireland into the EU, the UK would be responsible for whether to refund the money. Individual travellers won't have their baggage checked and taxes will not have to be paid by individuals sending goods to other people. Separately, there will be limits agreed by the joint committee on the amount of help the government can give to Northern Irish farmers. The figure will be based on the amount they currently receive from the EU's Common Agricultural Policy. Where have the UK and EU compromised? Brexit deal: What does it mean? Brexit: What happens now? Have UK voters changed their minds on Brexit? When it comes to the regulation of goods (that's the rules they have to follow on things like labelling and manufacturing processes) Northern Ireland would keep to EU rules rather than UK rules. That removes the need for checks on goods including food and agricultural produce at the border between Ireland and Northern Ireland, because both will be part of an ""all-island regulatory zone"". But it adds to the checks between the rest of the UK - which will not necessarily be sticking to EU single market rules - and Northern Ireland. This will be done by UK officials at ""points of entry"" into Northern Ireland, but the EU will have the right to have its own officials present. It seems those EU officials may be able to overrule UK officials. The agreement states that EU representatives will be able to ask UK authorities to take certain steps in individual cases and they will have to do so. Because Northern Ireland will be set apart from the rest of the UK when it comes to customs and other EU rules, the deal gives its Assembly a vote on these new arrangements. But this vote would not happen until four years after the end of the transition period (the time after Brexit when everything stays the same to allow everyone to prepare for the changes while the UK's future relationship with the EU is discussed). The transition period is due to run until at least the end of 2020. So the four-year period would run until the end of 2024. If the Northern Ireland Assembly votes against the new arrangements, they would stop applying two years later, during which time the ""joint committee"" would make recommendations to the UK and EU on what to do about this. If there were to be no agreement during this two year period, some form of hard border could re-emerge in Ireland, but it's unlikely that would be allowed to happen. If the Assembly accepts the continuing provisions by a simple majority, they will then apply for another four years. If the deal has ""cross-community support"" then they will apply for eight years. The deal defines cross-community support as more than 50% of unionist and nationalist Assembly members voting in favour, or at least 40% of members from each designation if in total at least 60% of members have voted in favour. The UK government has said that if the Northern Ireland Assembly is still not sitting at that point,it will make alternative arrangements to make sure a vote can take place.,external The new agreement says thatEU law on value added tax,external(VAT - a tax added when you make purchases) will apply in Northern Ireland, but only on goods, not services. But it also allows Northern Ireland to have different VAT rates to the rest of the UK, which would not normally be allowed under EU law. For example, if the UK decided to reduce the VAT on household fuel to zero, Northern Ireland would still have to keep it at 5%, which is the EU minimum. It also means that Northern Ireland may get the same VAT rates on certain goods as the Republic of Ireland, to stop there being an unfair advantage on either side of the border. Much of Mrs May's original Brexit deal will remain as part of the overall agreement. Some of the key areas are: The transition - a period of time during which all of the current rules stay the same allowing the UK and the EU to negotiate their future relationship - is due to last until the end of December 2020. The UK will need to abide by EU rules and pay into the EU budget, but will lose membership of its institutions. The transition can be extended, but only for a period of one or two years. Both the UK and EU must agree to any extension. UK citizens in the EU, and EU citizens in the UK, will retain their residency and social security rights after Brexit. Freedom of movement rules will continue to apply during transition. This means that UK nationals will be able to live and work in EU countries (and EU nationals will be able to live and work in UK) during this period. Anyone who remains in the same EU country for five years will be allowed to apply for permanent residence. (UPDATE: 13 December 2019 - This piece has been updated and reflects the delay of the Brexit date to the end of January 2020.) The UK will have to settle its financial obligations to the EU. There is no precise figure but the biggest part of this ""divorce bill"" will be the UK contributions to the EU budget until the end of the transition period at the end of 2020. When Brexit was delayed it meant that some of that money was paid as the UK's normal membership contributions, so less of it was part of the divorce bill. When the Brexit date was 31 October 2019, the Office for Budget Responsibility (OBR)estimated,externalthat the bill was about Â£32.8bn (down from Â£39bn). To reach an estimate of what the bill would be for departure on 31 January 2020, you could subtract the Â£1.62bn thatthe OBR said,externalwas left to pay in membership fees in 2019 and 14% of the Â£10.69bn for the whole of 2020 (it's more than one twelfth because the EU usually requests a higher proportion of the contributions earlier in the year). That gives a total of just under Â£30bn. The OBR expects that most of the money - about three-quarters of the total - would be paid by 2022, with some relatively small payments still being made in the 2060s. This is addressed in the political declaration.This text, which is not legally binding, has also been revised by UK/EU negotiators.,external It says that both sides will work towards a Free Trade Agreement (FTA) and a high-level meeting will happen in June 2020 to see how that work is going. The text also contains a new paragraph on the so-called ""level playing field"" - the degree to which the UK will agree to stick closely to EU regulations in the future. The references to a ""level playing field"" were removed from the legally-binding withdrawal agreement and put in the political declaration, which is not binding. It says that both sides will keep the same high standards on state aid, competition, social and employment standards, the environment, climate change, and ""relevant tax matters"".

EU papers' anguish at UK Brexit dramaA simple guide to Brexit,"Europe's papers see ongoing Brexit turmoil in the UK European newspapers have been taking stock of Saturday's drama at Westminster and Boris Johnson's appeal to Brussels to block an extension to the Brexit deadline. ""The fight over Brexit will continue for even longer"" declares Germany'sDie Zeit,external. Italy'sCorriere della Sera,externalbelieves ""this unprecedented 'game of two letters' seriously embarrasses the EU: it will have to decide whether to give Britain an extension that parliament is asking for but the British government does not want"". NRC Handelsblad,externalin the Netherlands says, ""Saturday cannot be viewed as a failure for Johnson. It is likely that the 306 members of parliament who voted against the Letwin act will also support him next week."" DutchDe Volkskrant,externalagrees: ""It is understandable that there were cheers from the opposition benches and the thousands of anti-Brexit protesters in Parliament Square. But this could prove to be a pyrrhic victory."" In France,Le Figaro,externalsays: ""It should have been a day of clarification; it has been a moment of additional confusion. British MPs have added an incredible episode to the already lengthy Brexit series - by deciding not to decide anything."" French liberal weeklyLe Point,externalnotes: ""And so, Boris Johnson is back at square one. We should soon know if his future at the head of the country is guaranteed until the general elections, for which he is the favourite, or whether he will have contented himself with running around in circles. Until then, the Brexit series continues."" Spain'sEl Mundo,externalsees yesterday's amendment vote as a ""blow of enormous scale"" to Mr Johnson, and ""another unpredictable scenario of this labyrinth"".  An editorial in the paper says ""while parliament was trying to win time and narrow down the result of hard Brexit, over a million of protesters demanded another referendum at its doorstep. Political chaos and social discontent - the effects of populism."" ""House of Commons forces Johnson and EU into Brexit overtime"" declares the headline in  Austria'sDer Standard,external. Noting the police escorts for MPs, it says ""The dark side of the Brexit debate appeared once again: polarisation and hatred for the opposite side"". Meanwhile, an analysis on Germany's centre-left news websiteSpiegel Online,externalnotes: ""Just when you think it cannot get any crazier, the British parliament adds another thing: yet again, it has outmanoeuvred its own government. With that, Brexit, which was almost within reach, is uncertain again."" ""Only one thing can be said with certainty. It is far from being over,"" the article says.

"PM 'trying to frustrate' Brexit delay law, says SNP","Boris Johnson has been accused of trying to ""frustrate"" the law that required him to seek a Brexit extension if a deal had not been agreed. The prime minister has sent an unsigned letter to Brussels asking for a delay, along with a second letter saying he believed any delay was a mistake. Leading SNP MP Joanna Cherry said the second letter, which was signed, may be a violation of the so-called Benn Act. Scotland highest court is due to meet on Monday to consider the matter. PM 'has the numbers' to pass Brexit deal Boris Johnson's Brexit letters in full Ms Cherry told the BBC the fact that Mr Johnson had been forced to send an extension request was a victory for campaigners seeking to rule  out a no-deal Brexit. But she pointed out that at the Court of Session earlier this month, the government gave an undertaking not to frustrate the act. The court had been asked to sign a letter on the prime minister's behalf if he failed to do so, but delayed giving a ruling until Monday to allow the political debate to play out. Ms Cherry added: ""As a matter of law it is arguable that the prime minister's signed letter seeks to frustrate what the Benn Act sets out to do. The principle of frustration is well recognised in law. ""When we were in court in Edinburgh the prime minster gave promises that not only would he obey the Benn Act but that he wouldn't seek to frustrate it. Now arguably that is what he has done."" Joanna Cherry has played a leading role in legal challenges to the government over Brexit Scottish Conservative MP Luke Graham said he was ""cautiously optimistic"" that Boris Johnson's deal would be passed in the Commons next week and he insisted the prime minister had complied with the law. He told Sunday Politics Scotland: ""The prime minister has written his letter in accordance with the law and now we are focusing on getting a deal."" He added: ""We want to try to get a deal and we've got one on the table. It's time for MPs across the House of Commons to come together to vote for that deal so we can move forward."" Labour has said it plans to amend the deal when the legislation is brought to Parliament, for example by demanding a UK-wide customs union with the EU and single market alignment. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer also said Labour would support an amendment requiring the deal to be put to another referendum. The SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford said the priority should be to seek a Brexit extension and, once that was secured, his party would press for a no-confidence vote. ""Once we have got that position of safety, once the extension is in place, I would call on all opposition parties to come together. The SNP is prepared to accept its responsibility,"" he said.

Pound slips in early trading after Brexit non-voteThe pound eased in Asia trading and could see a stronger move when parliament votes on the Brexit deal.Business,"The pound slipped against the dollar as currency markets got their first chance to react to MPs backing a move to delay approval of the Brexit deal. Many banks in London had called in extra staff, expecting volatile trading after the first Saturday sitting in the House of Commons for 37 years. But the pound's reaction was muted, slipping 0.6% against the dollar to $1.29, and down 0.4% against the euro. On Friday, the pound had been trading at its highest level for five months. Jeffrey Halley, senior market analyst at Oanda, said the fall in the currency was limited because ""despite more twists and turns than any other soap opera in history, a hard Brexit is now highly unlikely"". Jane Foley, senior foreign exchange strategist at Rabobank, told the BBC's Today programme: ""[Investors] are a little bit more anxious certainly than they were at the end of last week. There was a lot of confidence going in to Saturday's vote that there would be something a little bit more constructive. ""Instead, of course, we've got this delay, so the lower pound this morning reflects the delay. But sterling hasn't sold off very much. If we go back 10 to 12 days, we were trading at $1.22, so we are significantly higher and this is of course related to optimism that Boris Johnson's government may have the numbers to push this deal through. This could still be done in a very short period of time. ""But of course, if we look at the medium term, there is still plenty of scope for volatility, there is still plenty of risk."" Deutsche Bank, like many other banks, had set up additional staff to come in on Sunday expecting a strong reaction to Saturday's vote. But it scaled back numbers after the weekend's events - which saw Prime Minister Boris Johnson send an unsigned request to the EU for a further delay, accompanied by another letter - signed this time - clarifying that was not his own personal position. Events serious enough to require extra staffing out of normal trading hours are relatively rare in currency trading, normally linked to a big infrequent event such as an election with an uncertain outcome, for example. But Russell Lascala, global head of FX at Deutsche Bank, said that, since the Brexit referendum, there had been five or six such events. ""The uncertainty has been going on for years. The market is begging for clarity, to be able to invest or not invest."" Sir Ian Cheshire, chairman of Barclays' UK operations, told the BBC that the deal on offer was ""acceptable"". ""No deal is perfect, but this deal is actually doable and it is, I think, very frustrating to see what appears to be a protracted process when most business leaders would like to see some certainty and get on,"" he said. ""The chances of yet another round of negotiations are extremely unlikely to yield anything significantly different and now the delay is beginning to affect consumer confidence, particularly investment confidence, and I think we have to push ahead and make the best of what we've got coming down the track."" Currency analysts say they expect the next strong movement in the pound to be when the Brexit deal is voted on in Parliament. However, after Saturday's vote, many believe a no-deal Brexit is now less likely. US investment bank Goldman Sachs, which issues regular updates to its clients, now thinks there is a 5% chance of a no-deal Brexit, down from 10% previously.

"Pollution 'triggers hundreds more heart attacks'People also suffer more strokes and asthma attacks on days when air quality is poor, academics say.Health","Higher air pollution in the UK trigger hundreds more heart attacks, strokes and acute asthma attacks each year, research suggests. A team at King's College London looked at data from London, Birmingham, Bristol, Derby, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Oxford and Southampton. They calculated days with above average pollution levels would see an extra 124 cardiac arrests over the year. NHS England boss Simon Stevens said it was evidence of ""a health emergency"". The figure is based on ambulance call data and does not count heart attacks suffered by patients already in hospital. It points to significant short-term health risks caused by air pollution, on top ofcontributing to almost 500,000 premature deathsin Europe every year. What does air pollution do to our bodies? UK faces European court over dirty air Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? On days with high pollution levels, across the nine cities in total, they calculated that there would be a total of 231 additional hospital admissions for stroke, with an extra 193 children and adults taken to hospital for asthma treatment. Dr Heather Walton, of King's College London's Environmental Research Group, said air pollution reduction policies concentrated in the main on effects connected to life expectancy. ""However, health studies show clear links with a much wider range of health effects,"" she added. The research suggests the problem is most acute in London In London, high-pollution days would see an extra 87 cardiac arrests per year, an extra 144 strokes, and 74 children and 33 adults ending up in hospital with asthma-related issues. In Birmingham the figure would be 12 more out-of-hospital cardiac arrests, 27 additional admissions for stroke and 26 more for asthma. Bristol, Liverpool, Manchester, Nottingham, Oxford and Southampton would see between two and six more out-of-hospital heart attacks and up to 14 extra hospital admissions for both stroke and asthma. Only in Derby would there be no apparent increase. Among the long-term risks associated with high pollution levels are stunted lung growth and low birth weight. The King's College research also suggests cutting air pollution by a fifth would decrease incidents of lung cancer by between 5% and 7% across the nine cities surveyed. Mr Stevens said: ""It's clear that the climate emergency is in fact also a health emergency. ""Since these avoidable deaths are happening now - not in 2025 or 2050 - together we need to act now."" The figures were published ahead of Wednesday's International Clean Air Summit hosted by Mayor of London Sadiq Khan and the UK100 network of local government leaders. UK100 director Polly Billington said: ""Local government needs additional powers and resources to address this public health crisis."" The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs said it was ""taking urgent action to improve air quality and tackle pollution"" and that new legislation will ""increase local powers to address key sources of air pollution"". ""We are already working hard to reduce transport emissions and are investing Â£3.5 billion to clean up our air."" Researchers sometimes struggle to make their statistics human. This team worries that ""life years lost"" are too abstract. So they have looked at things that might hit closer to home like heart attacks or asthma attacks that hospitalise children. Using already published studies, they have worked out how many more of these events to expect on days with above-average pollution. The numbers might not knock your socks off: in London, for every 100 cardiac arrest ambulance callouts on low-pollution days, they would expect to see 102 on high-pollution days. But the numbers add up and reinforce the case for further reductions in air pollution. What does air pollution do to our bodies?

Lebanon 'set for reform deal' amid huge protestsThe country is in the grips of the largest anti-government demonstrations in years.,"This video can not be played From flag waving and calls for revolution, watch how anti-government protests have unfolded in Lebanon Lebanon's government has approved a package of economic reforms as it attempts to quell the biggest protests to sweep the country in over a decade. Measures include steps to cut Lebanon's huge deficit, slashing politicians' salaries by half and giving financial help to families in poverty. In a televised address, PM Saad Hariri said the protesters had been heard. It comes as demonstrators took part in a fifth day of protests and widespread strikes. Hundreds of thousands of Lebanese have taken to the streets, angry at corruption and austerity measures. The Lebanese economy is struggling with low growth and high debt, and a deteriorating infrastructure has made power cuts and piles of uncollected rubbish part of daily life. The Lebanese cabinet passed the raft of measures at an emergency meeting on Monday. Mr Hariri had hinted at resigning if the package was not approved. Lebanese President Michel Aoun (R) chaired a cabinet meeting on Monday The prime minister appeared on television immediately afterwards, acknowledging protesters' grievances. ""These decisions are not designed as a trade-off,"" he said, ""They are not to ask you to stop expressing your anger. That is your decision to make."" ""Your movement is what led to these decisions that you see today,"" he added. Meanwhile, protesters blocked main roads in central Beirut and held fresh demonstrations. Many schools, banks and universities were closed. People blocked main roads in Beirut ahead of the cabinet meeting "" Lebanon is getting ruined more and more, day after day because of all the politicians,"" Sara, a 17-year-old protester, told the BBC. 'We are protesting for our rights. And we are going to win.' ""That's why the Lebanese are standing hand in hand against the corruption and against the bad economical state. This revolution is the key to a better Lebanon."" The demonstrations began on Thursday, when a proposed $6 (Â£4.60) monthly tax on WhatsApp voice calls was announced. The tax was scrapped, but the unrest escalated and demonstrators turned their focus to wider grievances with the government, including widespread corruption, economic mismanagement and poor public services. Lebanon scraps WhatsApp tax as protests rage Calls for revolution at Lebanon protests Lebanon battles worst wildfires in decades On Sunday, hundreds of thousands people gathered in in the capital and other cities for the biggest demonstrations seen in Lebanon since 2005. Lebanon's economic situation has worsened in recent weeks, with the local currency losing value against the US dollar for the first time in two decades. Tens of thousands of people gathered in downtown Beirut on Sunday The Lebanese pound has been pegged at 1,500 to the dollar since 1997, but a shortage of dollars at local banks has led to the black market exchange rate rising to about 1,650. Lebanon has one of the world's highest levels of public debt. At $86bn, it is equivalent to more than 150% of gross domestic product (GDP). Before Monday's protests people helped clear up rubbish left on the streets The country's economy has also stagnated. Real GDP growth was only 0.2% in 2018 and is estimated to be -0.2% in 2019, according to the World Bank. Last year, international donors pledged $11bn of aid and loans to boost Lebanon's economy. In return, the government committed to implement reforms that would help reduce its debt. Lebanon's public infrastructure, which was already stretched before more than one million refugees arrived from neighbouring Syria, is also ailing. Electricity and water supplies are disrupted frequently and rubbish often piles up on the streets. This video can not be played Lebanon protesters: ""We can make a change"" Observers say one of the striking features of the protests has been how demonstrators have remained above the sectarian divides that have caused so much conflict in the past. Lebanon has long had a political system designed to balance power between the country's main religious groups.

Lallana saves Liverpool at Man UtdAdam Lallana rescues a late point for Liverpool at Manchester United to keep them unbeaten in the Premier League - but their run of 17 league victories comes to an end.BBC SportComments,"Adam Lallana's equaliser was his first Premier League goal since May 2017 Adam Lallana's late equaliser rescued a point for Liverpool at Old Trafford as Manchester United ended the leaders' flawless start to the Premier League season. Liverpool were in search of their 18th successive league win to equal Manchester City's top-flight record set between August and December 2017 but had to settle for a point after a scrappy encounter. Marcus Rashford's hotly-contested first-half goal, allowed after a video assistant referee check for a foul by Victor Lindelof on Divock Origi, looked to be condemning Liverpool to their first league loss since they went down at Manchester City in January. Rashford finished neatly from Daniel James' cross in the 36th minute but Liverpool, who saw a first-half strike from Sadio Mane ruled out by VAR for handball, struck back when substitute Lallana arrived unmarked at the far post to score from Andy Robertson's cross five minutes from time. The draw means Liverpool's advantage at the top of the table has been cut to six points. Analysis - how Solskjaer found a way to stop Liverpool Klopp: Man Utd always set up to defend against us Was Liverpool's run always destined to end at Man Utd? Discover how you rated the players This video can not be played Man Utd 1-1 Liverpool: Jurgen Klopp takes issue with tackle on Divock Origi Liverpool's relentless start to the season ended here at Old Trafford, an arena where they always struggle to produce their best. They have failed to win on their past six visits to Manchester United, comprising three losses and three draws, meaning manager Jurgen Klopp is still searching for his first win here with Liverpool. Robbed of the injured Mohamed Salah, Liverpool started with Origi on the left and rarely displayed the intensity and attacking verve that has become their trademark in a strangely subdued performance. They had 68% of the ball but barely created any clear-cut opportunities in a match that swiftly became a war of attrition. Liverpool, however, are sustained by a fierce determination even when not in top gear and Lallana was on the mark after a lengthy spell of possession to score his first league goal for over two years. Klopp's side even threatened to snatch victory, but substitute Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's shot flashed inches wide. Klopp was furious about the decision to award Rashford's goal but he must also accept that this was a below-par Liverpool performance and in the end they and their fans, who taunted their United counterparts with inflatable Champions League trophies and the number ""6"", were grateful for a draw that means they still have a healthy advantage at the Premier League summit. This video can not be played Danny Murphy believes Man Utd's performance against Liverpool is something to 'build on' Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer will be bitterly disappointed they could not hang on for five more minutes for what would have been a hugely satisfying landmark win. He will, however, be delighted with the fight, spirit and organisation shown by his side, especially as the five-man defensive system United had been working on this week was disrupted minutes before kick-off when Axel Tuanzebe was injured in the warm-up and replaced by Marcos Rojo. They subdued Liverpool until they switched off carelessly late on when Rojo went missing and Ashley Young failed to spot the danger from Lallana in behind him. Overall, however, this was a huge improvement simply in terms of resilience and character. Goalscorer Rashford worked tirelessly while Scott McTominay continues to mature in midfield, and the Stretford End showed their appreciation at the final whistle. This is a mediocre Manchester United side but there was no shortage of effort and they deserved a point that Solskjaer will hope provides a platform for a rise up the table. Some 35% of Marcus Rashford's Premier League goals have come against 'big six' sides (11/31) Manchester United manager Ole Gunnar Solskjaer:""It's important to get results. That's the only way to grow confidence. A win would have been great but a draw is a step in the right direction. ""As a manager you want results now - you can't lose four, five or six games on the bounce. We're looking to win games as soon as possible."" On the lack of a free-kick to Liverpool in the build-up to Rashford's goal:""It's maybe a slight touch but it's not a clear and obvious error. It's still a man's game with tackles allowed, and the second one [Sadio Mane's disallowed goal] was a handball. Today we were on the right end of the VAR decisions."" This video can not be played Man Utd 1-1 Liverpool: Solskjaer praises referee Atkinson Liverpool manager Jurgen Klopp:""The result is OK. It's not what we wanted but we have to be happy given how the game developed. The first half I didn't like because we gave United the chance to do what they want to do - to put us under pressure and be aggressive. They were not better than we were but they did what they wanted to do. ""They scored a goal which shows all the problems with VAR. Mr Atkinson let the game run I'm sure because there is VAR. For me it was a clear foul. It's a general problem. VAR looks and says 'you decided like this'. But it was a foul. Then we scored a goal that was disallowed. Pretty much everything went against us but we still didn't lose so that is OK. ""We were in charge 100% towards the end. We wanted a different result but to do that you have to play better."" Liverpool failed to win for the first time in 18 Premier League games, since a goalless draw with Everton in March. No side has dropped more points from winning positions in the Premier League this season than Manchester United (8, level with Aston Villa). United registered their second lowest possession figure (32.1%) in a Premier League home match since 2003-04, second only to 32.06% against Liverpool in March 2018. Five of the past seven Premier League meetings between United and Liverpool have ended level (one win each) - just four of the previous 36 between the sides had been drawn. English players scored for both Manchester United and Liverpool in a Premier League meeting for the first time since November 2001 (David Beckham and Michael Owen). Since the start of last season, Liverpool have scored 28 Premier League goals in the final 15 minutes of games, more than any other side. Man Utd boss Ole Gunnar Solskjaer is the only manager Jurgen Klopp has faced more than once in the Premier League and failed to beat (P2 D2). 35% of Marcus Rashford's 31 Premier League goals for Manchester United have come against 'big six' opponents (11/31). Liverpool's Adam Lallana netted his first goal in 29 Premier League appearances, since scoring against Middlesbrough in May 2017. Since the start of 2017-18, Liverpool's Andrew Robertson has registered 19 assists in the Premier League, more than any other defender. Liverpool visit Genk in the Champions League on Wednesday, with United at Partizan Belgrade in the Europa League on Thursday. Next Sunday in the Premier League, Liverpool host Tottenham with United at Norwich City.

"Chile looters torch factory, killing five","This video can not be played Protesters and security forces clashed for a third day in Santiago The number of people killed in violent protests against rising living costs in Chile has risen to 11, Santiago Governor Karla Rubilar said on Monday. At least five people died after looters torched a factory near the capital. The military and police used tear gas against protesters, and a curfew was imposed in major cities for a third night on Monday. A state of emergency already in place in Santiago is to be extended to cities in the country's north and south. The unrest, sparked by a now suspended metro fare hike, widened to reflect anger over living costs and inequality. Why protesters are on the streets worldwide Is inequality becoming worse in Chile? Ahead of major disruption expected on Monday, Chile's President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era said the country was ""at war"" with a violent enemy. But the head of national security, Gen Javier Iturriaga, played down such talk. After taking a helicopter flight over the city to assess the situation, he told journalists on Monday morning he was satisfied with the situation. ""To tell you the truth, I'm not at war with anyone,"" he said. ""I'm a happy man."" Firefighters say they found five bodies inside the garment factory burned by rioters in a suburb of Santiago. Three more people are also reported to have died on Sunday although no details have so far been given about the circumstances of their deaths. Earlier reports suggestedthree people had died in a supermarket fire in Santiago on Saturday, bringing the total of people killed since the protests started to 11. Santiago has been seething with unrest There had been 70 ""serious incidents of violence"", including 40 lootings of supermarkets and other businesses. Two people also suffered gunshot wounds after a clash with police, officials say. ""We're facing a real escalation that is undoubtedly organised to cause serious damage to our country and the lives of each of its citizens,"" Interior Minister AndrÃ©s Chadwick said. Some 10,500 police and soldiers have been deployed on the streets, he added, while officials report more than 1,400 arrests. In several cities on Sunday, protesters set more buses on fire, smashed up metro stations and clashed with riot police. A state of emergency will be applied to Antofagasta, ValparaÃ­so, Valdivia, ChillÃ¡n, Talca, Temuco and Punta Arenas, allowing authorities to restrict people's freedom of movement and their right to assembly. In pictures: Santiago in state of emergency Chile country profile In Santiago, almost all public transport was suspended and some flights at the international airport were cancelled or rescheduled because of insufficient crew. Hundreds of travellers have been affected by flight cancellations At least one line of the city's metro was expected to reopen on Monday after the entire system was closed on Friday because of damage. Mr PiÃ±era, a billionaire conservative, has been criticised for his response to the protests, the most severe crisis of his current term. In a TV speech, he said people who were causing fires, setting up barricades and looting were ""criminals"". Profile: Sebastian PiÃ±era ""We're very aware that [those behind the riots] have a degree of organization, logistics, typical of a criminal organization,"" he said. ""I call on all my compatriots to unite in this battle against violence and delinquency."" The protests were sparked by a now suspended metro fare hike Mr PiÃ±era - who took office in March 2018 after having served as president between 2010 and 2014 - has deployed soldiers and tanks for the first time since 1990, when Chile returned to democracy after the dictatorship of Augusto Pinochet. Michelle Bachelet, a former president of Chile and now the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said she was ""deeply disturbed"" by the violence in her home country. She said all deaths must be independently investigated amid ""disturbing allegations of excessive use of force by security and armed forces"" - but also lamented injuries suffered by security forces. ""The use of inflammatory rhetoric will only serve to further aggravate the situation, and risks generating widespread fear,"" she said. Analysis by Vanessa BuschschlÃ¼ter, BBC News Online Latin America editor ""We're at war against a powerful and implacable enemy who doesn't respect anything or anyone, and who's willing to use limitless violence and criminal acts."" That is how President PiÃ±era described the protests late on Sunday. While some of the footage of violent clashes between the security forces and protesters do resemble those coming out of a war zone, other reaction to Mr PiÃ±era's description has been scathing with opposition politicians calling it ""pathetic"" and ""irresponsible"". But more important is the effect those words have had on the protesters. If they already felt ignored by the government, President PiÃ±era labelling them as criminals in their eyes proves how little he cares about their concerns. With the protest movement gaining momentum while still lacking clear leaders and Mr PiÃ±era's language further stoking the flames, the chance of any meaningful dialogue seems to slip further away. The unrest has exposed divisions in the nation, one of the region's wealthiest but also one of its most unequal, and intensified calls for economic reforms. It followssimmering discontent in some of the country's universities and schools over lack of resources and underfunding. Protester Constanza Gonzalez told the BBC: ""This isn't about political parties. I think people are angry and this was a thing that had been coming for quite a long time."" Mr PiÃ±era suspended the rise in the Santiago metro fare on Saturday, saying he had listened ""with humility"" to ""the voice of my compatriots"". What's driving Chile's protests?

"PM has numbers to pass Brexit deal, says Raab","The moment an amendment is passed by MPs delaying Brexit The government says it will push ahead with efforts to pass its Brexit deal, despite a major setback to its plans. Boris Johnson had to ask the EU for an extension to the UK's 31 October exit date afterMPs backed a move to delay approval of the dealon Saturday. But Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said he was confident enough MPs would back the deal next week, and Brexit would still happen by the deadline. Labour, however, has said it will back moves to put the deal to a referendum. No 10 said the PM sent ""Parliament's letter"" to Brussels - unsigned - and accompanied it with a second letter - which was signed - explaining why he believed a delay would be a mistake. The government has vowed to press ahead with the legislation - the Withdrawal Agreement Bill (WAB) - to implement the Brexit deal next week. Having reached a new Brexit deal with the EU last week, the prime minster had intended to bring it to Parliament and ask MPs to approve it in a so-called ""meaningful vote"". However, in the first Saturday sitting in the Commons for 37 years, MPs instead voted in favour of an amendment withholding approval of the deal until all the necessary legislation to implement it had been passed. Brexitcast: Super(ish) Saturday... Brexit date downplayed in government ad shift Tabled by Independent MP Sir Oliver Letwin, the amendment was intended to ensure that Mr Johnson would comply with the terms of the so-called Benn Act designed to eliminate any possibility of a no-deal exit on 31 October. Under that act, Mr Johnson had until 23:00 BST on Saturday to send a letter requesting a delay to the UK's departure - something he did, albeit without his signature. ANALYSIS: Chances of agreement still strong, says Laura Kuenssberg IN BRIEF: What happened on Saturday? EXPLAINED: How another delay would work IN GRAPHICS:  What happens now? Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr show that ""notwithstanding the parliamentary shenanigans, we appear to have now the numbers to get this through"". He said there were ""many people in the EU"" who were ""deeply uncomfortable"" about a further delay to Brexit and urged MPs to ""get on, get it through the House of Commons, and move on."" This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says he's confident the UK will leave the EU on 31 October His colleague, Michael Gove, chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, accused those who backed the Letwin amendment of voting ""explicitly to try to frustrate this process and to drag it out"". He told Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday ""we have a deal that allows us to leave"" on 31 October, but the government would now triggerOperation Yellowhammer- its contingency plan to handle a no-deal Brexit - because there was no guarantee the EU would grant an extension. The government is set to ask for a further meaningful vote on Monday,presenting MPs with a binary choice to approve or oppose the deal in principle. However, it will be up to Commons Speaker John Bercow to decide whether to allow that vote. BBC Deputy Political Editor John Pienaar says the thinking at Westminster is that Mr Bercow will not permit a re-run of the vote. He says to ""expect a good row about that"", adding that the Speaker has been clear in the past that he sees no reason to repeat a debate ""just because the loser doesn't like losing"". Labour had planned to vote against Boris Johnson's deal - although a few rebels would likely have backed it - arguing it would be bad for the economy, jobs, workers' rights and other areas like the environment. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer accused the prime minister of ""being childlike"" by sending a second letter to the EU contradicting the first stipulated by the Benn Act. He told Andrew Marr his party would seek to amend the deal when the WAB is brought to Parliament, for example by demanding a UK-wide customs union with the EU and single market alignment. This video can not be played Labour's Keir Starmer says Boris Johnson has been ""childlike"" with his unsigned letter He said Labour would look for ways to avoid ""a trapdoor to no-deal at the end of 2020"" - some critics of Mr Johnson's agreement fear there are no provisions to prevent a no-deal exit at the end of the transition period if no free trade agreement has been reached with the EU. Sir Keir also said his party would support an amendment requiring the deal to be put to another referendum. He said he believed that would most likely be tabled by a backbencher, but insisted: ""It's got to go back to the public."" Organising another public vote would take a minimum of 22 weeks, according to experts at the Constitution Unit at University College London (UCL), and Sir Keir accepted that sort of timescale was reasonable. A government also cannot just decide to hold a referendum. Instead, a majority of MPs and Lords would need to agree and vote through the rules, and there would likely be deep divisions over the wording of the question, the number of options on the ballot paper and the voting system. Lucy Powell, Labour MP for Manchester Central, told Sky News ""those advocating a second referendum know the numbers aren't there"". The PM's deal was ""now likely to pass"", she continued, adding that next few days and weeks ""are our final chance to shape Brexit"". EU Council President Donald Tusk has acknowledged receipt of the UK's extension request and said he would consult EU leaders ""on how to react"". Ambassadors from the 27 EU nations met for about 15 minutes in Brussels on Sunday morning and continued the legal process of ratifying the Brexit deal on the EU side. EU papers' anguish at UK Brexit drama Adler: Reluctant EU considers delay request The EU's Chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, told diplomats the passage of the Letwin amendment did not mean that the deal had been rejected. This video can not be played Sir Oliver Letwin: Brexit deal ""is not perfect but it will do"" Mr Letwin himself told the BBC's Andrew Marr on Sunday his amendment was ""an insurance policy"" and now it had passed, he would give his full support to the prime minister's deal. All 27 EU nations must agree to any extension to Brexit, and French President Emmanuel Macron has already signalled he believed a new Brexit extension was not good for anyone. However, BBC Europe editor Katya Adler said if the alternative was a no-deal Brexit, the EU was unlikely to refuse - although it would want to know what any extension was for - a general election, another referendum, or merely a bit more time needed to pass Brexit-related legislation? Just weeks after the Supreme Court ruled Mr Johnson's prorogation of Parliament was unlawful, some suggest his attempts to undermine the Benn Act with a second letter could see him back there again. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell suggested the PM could be ""in contempt of Parliament or the courts"". That was echoed by SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford, although he refused to be drawn on any court action this week. Scotland highest court, the Court of Session, is due to meet on Monday to consider the matter. It was asked earlier this month to sign a letter fulfilling the terms of the Benn Act on the prime minister's behalf if he failed to do so, but judges delayed giving a ruling to allow the political debate to play out. The SNP's Joanna Cherry pointed out that the government gave an undertaking to the court not to frustrate the act, butshe said ""now arguably that is what he has done"". The government insists it has complied with the requirements of the Benn Act. The UK needs to pass a law to implement the withdrawal agreement - the part of the PM's Brexit deal which will take the country out of the EU - in UK law. It has to secure the backing of a majority of MPs and peers, and a vote for the Brexit deal itself is no guarantee of a vote for the legislation required to implement it. The bill gives legal effect to any agreed transition period and fulfils requirements on the rights of EU citizens in the UK after Brexit. It will also allow ministers to make ""divorce payments"" to the EU foreseen under the current deal. MPs will be able to vote on amendments - changes or add-ons - to the bill, for instance stipulating Parliament's role in the future relationship negotiation, or for the deal to be put to a referendum. If the government cannot get the WAB through Parliament the default legal position is that the UK cannot ratify the deal, and so would leave on 31 October without a deal. However, that is dependent on no extension beyond that date having been already agreed with the EU.

Scientists seek clues to 'birth of cancer'Cancer researchers from the UK and US are teaming up to search for the very earliest signs of cancer.Health,"British and American scientists are teaming up to search for the earliest signs of cancer in a bid to detect and treat the disease before it emerges. They plan to ""give birth"" to cancer in the lab to see exactly what it looks like ""on day one"". It is just one of the research priorities of the new International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection. Working together on early detection of cancer will mean patients benefitting more quickly, it says. Cancer Research UK has teamed up with the Universities of Cambridge, Manchester, University College London, and Stanford and Oregon in the US, to share ideas, technology and expertise in this area. Together, the scientists are aiming to develop less invasive tests, such as blood, breath and urine tests, for monitoring high-risk patients, improve imaging techniques for detecting cancer early and look for virtually undetectable signs of the disease. But they admit this is ""like looking for a needle in a haystack"" and could be 30 years off. ""The fundamental problem is that we never get to see a cancer being born in a human being,"" says Dr David Crosby, head of early detection research at Cancer Research UK. ""By the time it's found, it's already established."" A blood test for cancer has long been sought after by scientists Researchers from Manchester, for example, are growing human breast tissue in the lab with synthetic immune cells to see if they can spot the very earliest, subtle changes that could lead to cancer. Prof Rob Bristow said it was akin to a ""living tissue bank outside patients"". Yet there is always the danger of over-diagnosis, because not all early cell changes turn into cancers. So the cancer researchers say they must be more precise, also looking at the genes people are born with and the environment they grow up in, to work out an individual's unique personal risk of different cancers. Only then will they know when to intervene. To date, scientists say research on early detection has been small-scale and disconnected, lacking the power of trials in big populations of people. Dr Crosby said the collaboration would ""induce a sea-change in our health systems, shifting it from expensive firefighting of late-stage disease, to being able to intervene at its earliest point and deliver rapid, cost-effective treatment"". Figures show that 98% of breast cancer patients live for five years or more if the disease is diagnosed at stage 1 - the earliest stage- compared to just 26% at stage 4, the most advanced stage. But, at present, only around 44% of breast cancer patients are diagnosed at the earliest stage. Hyper-polarised MRI scans could be the future for diagnosing prostate cancer In the UK, screening programmes exist for breast, bowel and cervical cancers, when people reach a particular age. However, there are currently no reliable screening tools for other cancers, such as pancreas, liver, lung and prostate, which means survival rates are often much lower. Prof Mark Emberton, from UCL, said the growth of imaging, such as MRI, was a ""silent revolution"" which could replace needles, used in biopsies, in the diagnosis of prostate cancer. ""Imaging only sees the aggressive cells, it overlooks the stuff you don't want to find and addresses over-diagnosis,"" he said, but he warned it was expensive and took time, and was ""not ready for prime time yet"". More accurate hyper-polarised MRI scans and photo acoustics, where laser light is delivered to the tumour, creating sound waves which are analysed to produce images, are the next advances being tested in imaging. Scientists are searching for new ways of detecting prostate cancer Prof Emberton said the next goal was to see which cancers lent themselves to this type of imaging. At the University of Cambridge, Prof Rebecca Fitzgerald is developing an advanced endoscope to detect pre-cancerous lesions in the food pipe and colon. She said early detection hadn't been given the attention it deserved, and some tests for cancer could be very simple and inexpensive. Prof Fitzgerald said she looked forward to working with international colleagues to take ideas ""all the way from the bench to the bedside"". Cancer Research UK is investing Â£40m in the International Alliance for Cancer Early Detection over the next five years, with $20m being contributed by Canary Center at Stanford University and the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute in Oregon.

Two teenage boys stabbed to death at house party,"Police have asked anyone with information to come forward Two 17-year-old boys have been stabbed to death at a house party. Police and paramedics were called to a house in Archford Croft in Milton Keynes at about midnight on Saturday. The teenagers have been named locally as Dom Ansah and Ben Gillham-Rice, as relatives said their ""hearts are broken"". One of the boys died at the scene and the other in hospital. Thames Valley Police said no arrests had been made in the double murder inquiry. A 17-year-old boy and a 23-year-old man were also hurt and were taken to hospital with serious but not life-threatening injuries, the force said. Det Ch Supt Ian Hunter said the stabbings happened ""at a private house party"" and  those involved in the violence ""are all likely to have known each other"". He said police believed the victims had been invited to the party, which was attended by 15 to 20 people. Officers are carrying out inquiries and have cordoned off the area Officers are expected to remain at the scene, which is on a cul-de-sac in a housing estate in the Emerson Valley area, for several days. Stains of what appeared to be blood could be seen on the front door of a house inside the police cordon. Two of Dom Ansah's cousins laid flowers at the cordon on Sunday afternoon. ""He's come here with his long-time best friend since childhood, comes to a party and both of their lives just got ripped away from them,"" said one, who did not give her name. ""He was just so respectful to like his family and friends. Many, many people's hearts are broken."" Family members visited the scene on Sunday to leave flowers for the two boys A neighbour said she believed the gathering was a party for a teenage girl living in the house, while others said a birthday banner had been hanging at the door earlier in the evening. She said she saw police cars and ambulances at the scene after being woken by her husband during the night. ""I was so terrified,"" she said. ""I've never seen such a scene until today."" Another neighbour, who lives in an adjacent cul-de-sac, said: ""This gang of kids have been hanging around Archford Croft, it's all gang-related. ""I think it's just because there was a house party and then the trouble started from there."" Milton Keynes South MP Iain Stewart said he would offer assistance to the families affected.
