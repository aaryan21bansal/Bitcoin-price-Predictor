Police have described the killing of three people in Reading's Forbury Gardens as an ""horrific act"". Counter Terrorism Policing South East (CTPSE) said in a statement: ""Our thoughts and prayers
continue to be with the families who will be mourning loved ones after this
horrific act, and to all those who have been affected by it."" They added the investigation ""continues to move at a fast pace"". Police cordons will continue to remain in place in Reading town centre while detectives work through the crime scene. They also confirmed that the 25-year-old man from
Reading, who was arrested initially on suspicion of murder, has now
been re-arrested under Section 41 of the Terrorism Act 2000 by detectives from
CTPSE, which gives them more time to hold him in custody.  Khairi Saadallah held over three deaths came to the attention of security services in 2019, sources say. Andre Rhoden-PaulBBC News Some of Reading's busiest streets and thoroughfares lay eerily quiet this afternoon, as a maze of police cordons around the town blocked them off to the public. Those cordons with a view of Forbury Gardens attracted onlookers: not for its tranquil and pruned gardens but as a place now associated with three killings being treated as a ""terrorist incident"". Photographers could be seen snapping pictures of scene of crime officers in white boiler suits, while TV news crews - some from foreign networks - were using the park as a backdrop for live reports. Reading is front and centre-stage. Tomorrow's lessons have been cancelled at the school were James Furlong worked. The Holt School will remain open and counsellors will be available for all pupils and staff. Support staff will also be on hand for all year groups at the site in Wokingham between 08:30 and 15:15 BST on Monday. Meanwhile, the nearby St Paul's Church will be open from 09:00, for pupils wishing to light a candle, say a prayer, or talk. The school says it will create
a book of memories for Mr Furlong, to which members of the school can contribute. Pupils taught by James Furlong and their parents, have paid tribute to him after the news he was killed in the Reading terror attack. Jade Simon, a pupil at The Holt school from 2012-2017, told the PA news agency: ""He really was an incredible teacher. ""He was funny and kind and always made history fun and entertaining. History was always one of my favourite subjects and Mr Furlong always encouraged it."" Keith Power, whose daughter attends the school, said: ""He was a wonderful man. He was so helpful and supportive of my daughter. He had a real passion for history and teaching and was so caring of his pupils. ""It's so senseless. So much hatred in the world right now. I fear for my kids' futures."" ""He truly inspired everyone he taught,"" wrote co-heads Anne Kennedy and Katie Pearce, of their head of history James Furlong. In a letter to parents they added: ""He was determined that our students would develop a critical awareness of global issues
and in doing so, become active citizens and have a voice."" Mr Furlong wasone of three people killed in the attackon Saturday. James Furlonghas been named as one of the victimsof the attack in Reading. Mr Furlong was a teacher at Holt School in Wokingham, where he was head of history, government and politics. A letter was sent to parents of children at the school describing him as ""a very kind and gentle man"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Linda SerckBBC South As a police helicopter flies overhead, people in Reading have been reacting to the news that last night's stabbings are being considered a terror incident. Oliver Connor, from Tilehurst, Reading said the attacks were ""shocking"". ""It's not something you expect
from a town like Reading. I think people have been so preoccupied by the
pandemic that people forget that this sort of risk exists,"" she added. Belle Tunheim, from Slough, said: ""I'm in disbelief. It could
be that he might have a mental issue. You can never tell until it's been
investigated properly."" Harry McCarthy, who has lived in Reading for eight years,
said: ""I'm disgusted with the way things are going in this country. What's going on in our society?"" The UK prime minister says that if there are lessons to learn after the terror attack the government will learn them. Police and counter terror officers have urged members of the public not to post footage or images of the attack on social media. Assistant commissioner for Metroplitan Police, Neil Basu, instead asked for footage to be shared with police. He said the risk of terror attacks remained ""substantial"". However, he said members of the public should be ""alert not alarmed"" and report anything suspicious. Dominic CascianiHome Affairs Correspondent Security sources have told the BBC that the man
suspected of carrying out the Reading attack was brought to the attention of
MI5 in 2019. Sources say that Khairi Saadallah came to the attention of the
security services after they received information that he had aspirations to
travel abroad, potentially for terrorism. When the information was further
investigated, as the first stage of looking into a potential lead, no genuine
threat or immediate risk was identified. No case file was opened which would
have made him a target for further investigation. Greg Wilton said he was having a picnic in the park with his wife and friends when the attacks happened. He said: ""At
one point without much noise we noticed a commotion on the other side of the
park. ""We ran over and without seeing an attacker we found three men lying on the
floor bleeding profusely from what we thought was their heads, necks or body. ""Another member of the public took off his T-shirt and tried to stop the
bleeding alongside someone we assume to be his girlfriend. ""Me and my friend Tom
put a second victim in the recovery position and tried to stem his bleeding
from his ear with my canvas shopping bag. ""His breathing became increasingly
irregular, and shallower until the police and paramedic arrived to help us. ""Another friend of mine Ranveer helped an Asian man who had also been stabbed in
the face. ""This was in another part of the park from the victims we were helping
and so we were separated. ""My wife Amy and I are obviously very shocked and
shaken by what happened."" Three people have died in a stabbing attack in Reading's town centre. Here is what we also know, so far: Lawrence Wort told the BBC he saw a man stab several people in Forbury Gardens in the town. He said he thought it was a scuffle between the attacker and a group in the park. ""He stood up and I saw a massive knife in his hand. Probably at least 5in minimum. ""And then he turned and started looking towards us and that's when I just started shouting 'run'."" This video can not be played The Labour leader Sir Keir
Starmer has said ""people are united in their grief"" following the terror
attack in Reading. ""This was a horrific
incident, our thoughts and our hearts go out to all those affected,
particularly the family and friends of those who tragically died,"" he said. ""I think
across Reading, across the country, people are united in their grief at this
incident.â ""Itâs very important that the
investigation runs its course, but I will want to work with the government in
response to this, to look at whether thereâs lessons that can be learned,
whether there need to be changes to the law. ""This is not a time for party
politics."" Chief Constable John Campbell from Thames Valley Police said ""lives have been devastated"" by the attack in Reading. He said a suspect was apprehended within five minutes of the attack starting and praised the bravery of his officers. ""A number of members of the public"" also helped at the scene, he said, thanking them. He said there was ""no wider risk to the public"" and it was believed ""no-one else is involved"". People have left flowers and messages near the scene of the stabbings in Reading. One reads: ""There are no words that anyone can say to express how horrible and senseless this was."" While another simply states: ""Reading weeps."" Three people died and three others were taken to hospitalafter the attack in Forbury Gardens on Saturday evening. On Sunday morning large parts of the town centre remained cordoned off as police continue their investigation. Police have arrested one man and declared the stabbings that left three people dead a terrorist incident. Â© 2025 BBC.

A 25-year-old man from Reading has been arrested on suspicion of murder after being detained at the scene. The attack happened at Forbury Gardens at about 19:00 BST where several people were stabbed. Police are not currently treating the incident as terror-related, but counter terrorism officers were called. Security sources have told the BBC a man arrested at the scene is thought to be Libyan. Home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said he had been told the man had previously been in prison in the UK for a relatively minor conviction, not a terrorism offence. What we know so far In pictures One eyewitness told the BBC how he saw a man moving between groups of people in the park, trying to stab them. There were reports a police officer had ""rugby tackled"" the suspect to the ground, according tothe Sunday Mirror,external. Police gather at a cordon close to the scene Det Chf Supt Ian Hunter, from Thames Valley Police, said police were not looking for any other people in connection with the attack, adding that officers were ""keeping an open mind as to the motivation for the incident"". Police have asked anyone with mobile phone footage of the attack to come forward and people have been urged not to share videos and photos online ""out of respect for the victims' families"". Thames Valley Police said the incident was not connected to an earlier Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest in the park. At 20:00 BST, officers arrived at a block of flats in Basingstoke Road in Reading and secured the scene, leaving residents waiting outside. More than a dozen armed police officers carrying shields were seen entering the block at about 23:00 BST. BBC News Home Affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, who was outside the block of flats, said he heard a loud bang at the scene about an hour and a half later, after which several armed officers left. By Linda Serck, BBC News A large cordon remains in place following the incident Reading appears desolate and in mourning this morning. Large areas outside the gardens are taped up and there are not many people here, mainly journalists and their TV cameras. A strong wind is rattling litter in grey, deserted streets, most of which are being patrolled by armed police. Commuters are struggling to get to work as so many roads have been cordoned off with police tape. The few people arriving from Reading station expressed ""shock"". Marie Castro from Slough works at a Costa coffee shop in Reading and said: ""I was scared to be here but I have to be here for work."" The attack ""doesn't seem right for Reading"", she added. ""It's multicultural and really friendly. I was really shocked when I heard the news"". Prime Minister Boris Johnsonsaid,externalhis ""thoughts are with all of those affected by the appalling incident in Reading"". ""My thanks to the emergency services on the scene,"" he added. Emergency air ambulances were called to the scene and five ambulance crews from South Central Ambulance Service attended. Laurence Wort, 20, who was visiting Reading for the day, told the BBC he was about 10m away when the attack started. ""The park was pretty full, a lot of people sat around drinking with friends when one lone person walked through, suddenly shouted some unintelligible words and went round a large group trying to stab them. ""He stabbed three of them and then turned and started running towards me, when we turned and started running. ""When he realised that he couldn't catch us he tried to stab another group sat down. ""He got one in the back of the neck and then when he realised everyone was starting to run, he ran out the park."" This video can not be played Armed police went to a block of flats in Reading following the stabbings in Forbury Gardens Claire Gould, a freelance journalist who lives in Reading, said she walked past Forbury Gardens at about 18:40 BST ""and everything seemed calm"". She then saw an air ambulance land in King's Meadow - another park close to the scene - at about 19:00 BST, followed by a second about 10 minutes later. ""There were multiple sirens from 19:00 going on for the next couple of hours and police helicopters [were] circling,"" she added. Police at Forbury Gardens in Reading town centre Home Secretary Priti Pateltweeted,externalto say she was ""deeply concerned"" about the incident. Ms Patel later issued a statement condemning the stabbings as a ""senseless attack on people simply enjoying a Saturday evening with family and friends"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said the stabbing was ""very concerning"". The leader of Reading Council, Jason Brock, said it was ""an entirely senseless and horrific attack"" in ""a very busy area with lots of people socialising"". ""Reading is an incredibly strong community, it celebrates its diversity and I would expect that - just as in all trying times - people in Reading will come together and they wont allow themselves to be divided,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live.

X Factor star reveals 'heartbreaking' racism,"Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin ""to look whiter"". After winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would ""have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin"". Ina 15-minute Instagram video,external, she recalls being told: ""You can't have braids, you can't have an afro. ""You have to have hair... that appeals to white people."" The 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as ""heartbreaking"". Burke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestantMisha B, who recently spoke out about ""being devalued""at the hands of the music industry. Misha B claimed the X Factor projected ""this angry black girl narrative"", using words such as ""feisty"" and ""bully"" to describe her after one live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal. ""I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,"" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media. The music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she ""comes across aggressive"". She said she was told: ""You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that"", and added: ""I am so upset with myself that I allowed that."" Burke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard. The singer said was told: ""Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner"". ""It's hurtful,"" she added. Burke went on to become a runner-up on Strictly Come Dancing in 2017 She was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing. She recalled how one journalist accused her of ""being a diva"" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died. ""That was the image they had of me, because of the papers."" she said. ""I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. ""I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. ""I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone."" She said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because ""the truth is all we've got"". ""I just feel like people need to not see colour,"" said Burke. ""My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. ""People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind.""

Lockdown forces historic family shop's closure,"Lee Longlands built the art-deco store on Broad Street in Birmingham in 1932 An historic furniture company has gone into administration due to coronavirus after almost 120 years in business. Lee Longlands was established in 1902 and opened its flagship store in Birmingham 30 years later. The family-run business said it had been forced into administration as a result of the ""the devastating impact of the coronavirus lockdown"". The firm has a number of showrooms across the Midlands and was described as ""a household name"" in the region. The company's shops have not been able to trade for three months because of lockdown Its shops in Birmingham, Leamington Spa, Kidderminster, Abingdon, Derby and Cheltenham were closed for three months and have only just re-openedas lockdown restrictions eased. Robert Lee is the fourth generation to run the business, which was established by Robert Lee and George Longland. ""For almost 120 years our family business and our employees have put our customers at the heart of everything we do,"" he said, adding that the company would be working to fulfil orders ""to restore our short term finances"". The company's founders were pioneers - in 1907 they became the first store outside of London to install window display lighting after closing time. Its flagship store in Birmingham was used to store food rations during the Second World War, and the company also contributed to the war effort by producing ""blackout fabric"" to cover windows, making it harder for enemy bombers to identify targets. ""Lee Longlands is a household name across the Midlands,"" Matt Ingram, from administrator Duff and Phelps said. ""The fact that the appointment of administrators has been necessary, demonstrates the devastating financial impact that this pandemic will leave in its wake.""

Hundreds attend anti-racism rally in Glasgow,"This video can not be played Anti-racism rally held despite 'stay away' warning Hundreds of people staged an anti-racism rally in Glasgow city centre despite appeals to stay away due to the lockdown restrictions. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, the city council and Police Scotland hadcalled on the publicnot to gather for the Say No To Racism demonstration. There was a heavy police presence in the square followingviolent scenesfrom a far-right group on Wednesday. Officers later confirmed one man was arrested in the nearby Gallowgate area. A police spokesman said the 42-year-old allegedly obstructed officers. A second man, aged 62, was arrested in Edinburgh for threatening and abusive behaviour. That arrest is believed to be in connection with aseparate protest in the capital. Many protesters wore masks to attend the event Police surround members of the Green Brigade At about midday a group of protesters from the Green Brigade - a group of ultras who follow Celtic football club - were hemmed in by police in the centre of Glasgow's George Square. Anti-racism activists outside the cordon chanted: ""Let them go."" Ch Supt Alan Murray, said: ""We identified a group as football risk supporters, who we believed posed a threat to public safety. ""We spoke with this group and, at their request, escorted them to the Gallowgate area of the city where they dispersed."" Loyalists and members of a far-right group announced online on Friday night that they planned to head to the square to ""protect statues"". A small group gathered at the war memorial during the rally as lines of riot police separated the two. Police officers separated the rally from a small group of loyalists who also gathered in George Square. More than 500 people attended the rally, with stewards asking them to stick to social distancing guidelines by following markings on the square. Supporters include Stand Up To Racism, Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees, Positive Action in Housing, Afghan Human Rights Foundation and unions. They had also been asked to wear masks and not to travel farther than public health advice allows.At the start of the rally, the crowd took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Later, names of people who died in police custody were read out and attendees chanted ""no justice, no peace, no racist police"". Speakers said they ""didn't come here for a fight"" and spoke of securing greater rights for refugees and asylum seekers.They added ""no-one welcomes"" the far-right group and called on police to ""do their job"". There were some minor scuffles as police controlled people arriving and leaving but the rally was peaceful. A number of speakers addressed the anti-racism rally Chief Supt Murray said: ""Significant police resources were deployed at George Square to prevent the disgraceful scenes of violence and disorder witnessed in recent days. ""Those who turned up to protest were facilitated with an appropriate policing response and I would like to thank all officers involved for their professionalism in preventing trouble and maintaining public safety."" ""Our robust response will continue across the country and anyone intent on causing violence and disorder should expect arrest."" Charlotte Ahmed, of Stand Up to Racism, Scotland said: ""Today's demonstration was a magnificent expression of the unity, the anti-racism and the anti-fascism of the people of Glasgow. ""Here, in George Square, the very place where thousands of us welcomed Nelson Mandela to Scotland, we have made it clear: refugees are welcome here, Black Lives Matter, no racists in Glasgow."" Police arrived at George Square early on Saturday Elsewhere, a protest was held at the statue of Henry Dundas, whodelayed the abolition of the slave trade, at St Andrew Square, Edinburgh. And the Loyalist Defence League staged a ""protect the statues"" demonstration at the Paisley War Memorial. On Friday, Ch Supt Hazel Hendren, divisional commander, said: ""Please do not come to George Square."" She said: ""The lockdown restrictions remain in place and people should leave their homes only for very limited purposes. ""Anyone who wants to protest should find another way of doing so that keeps everyone safe."" At least six people were arrested on Wednesday following scenes labelled ""disgraceful"" by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Far-right loyalists targeted a rally in the city's George Square which was calling for improved living conditions for refugees. The organisers vowed the rally would ""send a positive anti-racist message from Glasgow's George Square to the world"".

'Three dead' after park stabbing incident,"This video can not be played Eyewitness Lawrence Wort on Reading stabbing attack: 'I saw a massive knife in his hand... at least five inches minimum' Three people have died and three more have been seriously injured after stabbings in a park in Reading, police confirmed. A 25-year-old man from Reading has been arrested on suspicion of murder after being detained at the scene. The attack happened at Forbury Gardens at about 19:00 BST where several people were stabbed. Police are not currently treating the incident as terror-related, but counter terrorism officers were called. Security sources have told the BBC a man arrested at the scene is thought to be Libyan. Home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford said he had been told the man had previously been in prison in the UK for a relatively minor conviction, not a terrorism offence.

Thames Valley Police said the incident was not connected to an earlier Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest in the park. At 20:00 BST, officers arrived at a block of flats in Basingstoke Road in Reading and secured the scene, leaving residents waiting outside. More than a dozen armed police officers carrying shields were seen entering the block at about 23:00 BST. BBC News Home Affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, who was outside the block of flats, said he heard a loud bang at the scene about an hour and a half later, after which several armed officers left. By Linda Serck, BBC News A large cordon remains in place following the incident Reading appears desolate and in mourning this morning. Large areas outside the gardens are taped up and there are not many people here, mainly journalists and their TV cameras.

""The park was pretty full, a lot of people sat around drinking with friends when one lone person walked through, suddenly shouted some unintelligible words and went round a large group trying to stab them. ""He stabbed three of them and then turned and started running towards me, when we turned and started running. ""When he realised that he couldn't catch us he tried to stab another group sat down.

"Hundreds attend anti-racism rally in GlasgowPolice, politicians and Glasgow's council had asked members of the public to avoid George Square.Glasgow & West Scotland","This video can not be played Anti-racism rally held despite 'stay away' warning Hundreds of people staged an anti-racism rally in Glasgow city centre despite appeals to stay away due to the lockdown restrictions. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, the city council and Police Scotland hadcalled on the publicnot to gather for the Say No To Racism demonstration. There was a heavy police presence in the square followingviolent scenesfrom a far-right group on Wednesday. Officers later confirmed one man was arrested in the nearby Gallowgate area. A police spokesman said the 42-year-old allegedly obstructed officers. A second man, aged 62, was arrested in Edinburgh for threatening and abusive behaviour. That arrest is believed to be in connection with aseparate protest in the capital. Many protesters wore masks to attend the event Police surround members of the Green Brigade At about midday a group of protesters from the Green Brigade - a group of ultras who follow Celtic football club - were hemmed in by police in the centre of Glasgow's George Square. Anti-racism activists outside the cordon chanted: ""Let them go."" Ch Supt Alan Murray, said: ""We identified a group as football risk supporters, who we believed posed a threat to public safety. ""We spoke with this group and, at their request, escorted them to the Gallowgate area of the city where they dispersed."" Loyalists and members of a far-right group announced online on Friday night that they planned to head to the square to ""protect statues"". A small group gathered at the war memorial during the rally as lines of riot police separated the two. Police officers separated the rally from a small group of loyalists who also gathered in George Square. More than 500 people attended the rally, with stewards asking them to stick to social distancing guidelines by following markings on the square. Supporters include Stand Up To Racism, Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees, Positive Action in Housing, Afghan Human Rights Foundation and unions. They had also been asked to wear masks and not to travel farther than public health advice allows.At the start of the rally, the crowd took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Later, names of people who died in police custody were read out and attendees chanted ""no justice, no peace, no racist police"". Speakers said they ""didn't come here for a fight"" and spoke of securing greater rights for refugees and asylum seekers.They added ""no-one welcomes"" the far-right group and called on police to ""do their job"". There were some minor scuffles as police controlled people arriving and leaving but the rally was peaceful. A number of speakers addressed the anti-racism rally Chief Supt Murray said: ""Significant police resources were deployed at George Square to prevent the disgraceful scenes of violence and disorder witnessed in recent days. ""Those who turned up to protest were facilitated with an appropriate policing response and I would like to thank all officers involved for their professionalism in preventing trouble and maintaining public safety."" ""Our robust response will continue across the country and anyone intent on causing violence and disorder should expect arrest."" Charlotte Ahmed, of Stand Up to Racism, Scotland said: ""Today's demonstration was a magnificent expression of the unity, the anti-racism and the anti-fascism of the people of Glasgow. ""Here, in George Square, the very place where thousands of us welcomed Nelson Mandela to Scotland, we have made it clear: refugees are welcome here, Black Lives Matter, no racists in Glasgow."" Police arrived at George Square early on Saturday Elsewhere, a protest was held at the statue of Henry Dundas, whodelayed the abolition of the slave trade, at St Andrew Square, Edinburgh. And the Loyalist Defence League staged a ""protect the statues"" demonstration at the Paisley War Memorial. On Friday, Ch Supt Hazel Hendren, divisional commander, said: ""Please do not come to George Square."" She said: ""The lockdown restrictions remain in place and people should leave their homes only for very limited purposes. ""Anyone who wants to protest should find another way of doing so that keeps everyone safe."" At least six people were arrested on Wednesday following scenes labelled ""disgraceful"" by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Far-right loyalists targeted a rally in the city's George Square which was calling for improved living conditions for refugees. The organisers vowed the rally would ""send a positive anti-racist message from Glasgow's George Square to the world"".

Q&A: How will schools in Wales reopen?,"Primary school teachers have been measuring distances inside classrooms in preparation Wales is moving towards reopening schools for the first time since the lockdown restrictions came into force in March. Education is devolved so the decision rests with the Welsh education minister. All pupils will be able toreturn for limited periods during the week from 29 June- but only a third of pupils would be allowed into school at any time. Here are a few of the main questions answered, from what we know so far: The Welsh Government had made clear they had an ""ambition"" for some pupils to return before the summer break in mid-July and this gives a taste of school for all pupils before September. The message is now: ""Check in, catch up, prepare for summer and September"" with a stress on the importance of pupils' wellbeing, being able to get back into something of a routine and see friends. It says teachers should not try to ""catch up"" on everything but have a clear focus on preparing children to learn again, when there would be a blend of ""'in school' and 'out of school' learning driven by a single curriculum"". ""We will use the last weeks of the summer term to make sure pupils, staff and parents are prepared - mentally, emotionally and practically - for the new normal in September,"" said Education Minister Kirsty Williams. But she was also conscious about the loss of schooling already and said waiting until September would be ""detrimental to the wellbeing, learning progress and mental health of our young people"". Some pupils returned to primary school in England from 1 June but the move proved controversial -and there was a ""highly variable"" level of attendanceand plans for all to open before the summer have now been dropped Nursery, reception, Year 1 and Year 6 children were first to go back in England - but the Welsh Government is looking to give all pupils a taste before the summer. Schools in Wales will have a brief return until the break-up for the summer holidays on 24 July. At least three-quarters of Wales' state schools are only returning for three weeks from 29 June. It follows talks with unions, councils and government stalling. Butschools in Conwy, Pembrokeshire and Powys are going back for four weeks. David Evans, secretary for the National Education Union Cymru, said the fourth week was for teachers to work on a voluntary basis. ""It is up to local authorities about their decisions to open on the fourth week, taking account of their local circumstances and the challenges of wider opening, as you would expect. ""We know our members have been working hard to try and get as many children back to school in the weeks after 29 June."" Pupils queue to wash their hands The risk of coronavirus to pupils in the classroom is ""very, very small, but not zero"", according to UK government's scientific advisory group Sage. Risk expert Prof Sir David Spiegelhalter, of Cambridge University, told the BBC in May: ""Based on the data so far there have been extremely low risks to children. ""Out of seven million five to 14-year-olds in England and Wales, so far there has been one death with covid marked on the death certificate. ""Now there will be more but it's still an unbelievably low risk. And we must remember this group of kids are staggeringly safe in general - less than one in 10,000 die every year. I don't think any [group] has been safer in the history of humanity."" This video can not be played Can children catch and spread coronavirus? Sage has said the role of children in the transmission of Covid-19 was uncertain, while Prof Spiegelhalter also urged caution about claims that children could spread infection, as some of the evidence presented so far had been weak. A study by the University of Edinburgh and the Usher Institutesaid there was a risk of transmission by infected children,,externalalthough there was no evidence of children being a main source of infection. The Welsh Government's scientific advisory group Tac issued a briefing,externalsaying how staggered returns of smaller classes had the benefit of reducing transmission ""if groups do not mix (including staff), but this requires more analysis"". It went on to say: ""Staff and parents will also be directly impacted; it is probable that opening of schools will increase transmission in these groups. Any relaxation of closures will also need to consider how to reduce risk from the potential mixing of adults at school gates, in the staff room etc, and have protocols in place for vulnerable groups."" Schools are being asked to carry out a risk assessment for Covid-19 to identify ""sensible measures to control the risks"" but for paperwork to be kept to a minimum. Ministers say more details will be developed in the autumn, while taking account of the latest scientific advice. A classroom in north London set up for new socially-distant learning With fewer pupils going into school at any one time, it will make it easier to re-arrange classrooms with fewer desks. The idea is that although classes will be smaller - and children confined to their group - that allows for more intensive teaching, followed by more online learning at home. The Welsh Government's promise is ""much smaller classes, providing secure dedicated time with teachers and classmates"". ""This time will include online and personalised classroom experience, getting children and teachers ready for a similar experience in September."" It also wants to ""maximise the time learners spend outdoors"", which it sees as having both learning and health benefits, particularly as the risk of infection is believed to be reduced outdoors, while social distancing is easier to manage. Schools have also been asked to think of using temporary buildings or additional spaces nearby such as local community buildings. Staffing is a concern for headteachers if they have to split classes into smaller groups. They are worried that some staff may not be available because they are shielding or may have children they have to care for and who may not be among the groups returning to school. Classroom space is another issue. This may not be a problem with groups of children in school at different times, but the education minister has indicated they are looking at options to increase the space available to schools by using other buildings such as village halls or leisure centres. Schools are being asked to think about whether a third of pupils attend for a week or over a three-week cycle. They might be asked to attend in blocks or cohorts, such as a different group of learners each week. But the guidance says it does not necessarily need to be decided by year groups so it means children from the same household can attend at the same time. This video can not be played Coronavirus cross border school decisions 'difficult' There have been issues raised about how children travel to school - on buses for example. Also, what if the school corridors are narrow? There may need to be a ""traffic"" system. And if we look around at practice already elsewhere, we might expect no more than 15 children in a classroom. Pupils will be asked to wash hands more often than normal and not to share books and toys as much - and not take them home. There is guidance on hygiene now to cover hand washing, including when pupils arrive and leave, before and after handling food or objects and equipment used by others and when there has been any physical contact. Expect staggered break and lunch times, and even timetables and times to arrive and leave. Parents might be asked not to gather at the school gates when they collect their children and to only enter school buildings by appointment. It is up to staff and pupils as ""a matter of personal choice"" whether to wear face masks, although the wellbeing of younger pupils or those who are deaf or with special needs should be considered. Chief medical officer Dr Frank Atherton said he did not think that schools would need to use personal  protective equipment (PPE) but they would be required and encouraged to ""look at the environment and make sure that people are able to properly socially distance"". The guidelines say PPE will not be needed routinely in schools but there may be a need to consider it if staff are involved in washing, toileting, or first aid with pupils. There is also a set of recommendations on cleaning within schools in the new guidance. How and when should Welsh schools reopen? Read more: How schools might be different Key evidence on opening schools revealed Tough school decisions for families on the border This school sports hall in Germany has been converted into a classroom The guidance recognises that it is ""not practicable"" to expectprimary pupilsto maintain 2m social distancing but staff should however seek to ensure ""some distancing"" between learners. It suggests primary pupils are allowed to mix in groups of up to eight. But insecondary schools, pupils should keep to 2m distances and ideally when indoors, remain in the same room and avoid moving from room to room as they normally would. Socially-distancing will also apply to pupils using toilets. In Denmark, pupils are split into small groupsof about 12 and are ""cocooned"" in these in class, at break times and at lunch. Read more: How could social distancing in schools work? Navigating the first morning at school since March One Cardiff head teacher has said he does not want his school to ""look like a huge wasp"", with masses of yellow and black warning posters and floor markings and ""staff barking orders whenever a child strays off the permitted route to class"". ""They will have been traumatised enough by this,"" says the head of Eastern High School, Armando di Finizio. ""I'd rather we took our time to embed good habits in a calm supportive way."" Tim Newbould, head teacher at Ysgol Penycae Community Primary School in Wrexham, said: ""The advice seems to be putting the child at the centre of the plans. ""Children have to be healthy before they can do anything else. From my point of view it needs to be as flexible as it seems to be, because every school is different, every building is different, the pupils are different. ""With social distancing, we knew that already - children will forget, particularly the younger children. They would need constant reminders. ""This could be a frightening experience for some children. So we really do need to get this right."" There has been a mixed response from unions so far. NASUWT said in terms of large schools in particular, social distancing would be ""nigh on impossible."" Some schools have been open for key workers' children and vulnerable children throughout. School staff have been providing childcare though not formal education for children, usually working on a rota basis. There has been an increase in the number of children attending since the Easter holidays, but it is still only about 1.2% of the school population. It's clear the government expects schools to have to work in a different way and, in the words of Education Minister Kirsty Williams, for what would be for a ""very, very long time"". Remote learning is likely to remain alongside face-to-face teaching. Some see an opportunity in the crisis to rethink the way schools work, including looking at how the school day and term times are organised. Before the pandemic hit, a group of experts were working on ""reimagining"" schools in Wales, including options for staggering school holidays for pupils and staff. Ms Williams said the system of a combination of online and face-to-face learning needed to be tested ""because unless something radically changes, that's what we're going to be faced with in September"". Families will not be fined if they do not send their children to school this term. There is an obvious sensitivity to parents and their own instincts and feelings about risks around the virus. Children and teachers who are shielding or at more risk, including pregnant staff, are not expected to return this term. This also applies for pupils and teachers who live with relatives who are shielding. This is not seen as an issue, with councils saying all schools will be ready to open. However ministers will be assessing the situation in the coming three weeks. The guidance says teachers should not try to ""catch up"" on everything but have a clear focus on preparing children to learn again, when there would be a blend of ""'in school' and 'out of school' learning driven by a single curriculum"". There is a concern that more disadvantaged pupils in particular will be at risk from lost schooling. One report, commissioned by the UK government,is worried that the attainment gap between richer and poorer students, which had been closing, will grow. ""Making up for lost time is almost certain to be the biggest challenge facing Wales' education system in the coming months and years,"" says Gareth Evans, director of education policy at the University of Wales Trinity Saint. ""Some children will have gone eight weeks and counting with no access to online learning, and there is little doubt that those from more deprived backgrounds will have fallen further behind their more affluent peers. ""Talk of a 'lost generation' is entirely legitimate and the widening of the attainment gap should be a worry for us all."" He believes there needs to be a ""thorough evaluation"" of how pupils have progressed or otherwise since lockdown and learning programmes tailored to individual need, not to mention sensitive assessment of health and wellbeing. Children of key workers will continue to get the same care as they do now, however, they will be returning to their own schools, rather than staying at the hubs. ""We would expect children attending hubs provision to move back to their own school or setting,"" says the guidance. There is no expectation that schools continue hubs provision during the summer holidays but councils can make alternative provision. Schools will also be on stand-by for the hub model to return, in the event of a second wave of the virus and a further lockdown.

Thames Valley Police said the incident was not connected to an earlier Black Lives Matter (BLM) protest in the park. At 20:00 BST, officers arrived at a block of flats in Basingstoke Road in Reading and secured the scene, leaving residents waiting outside. More than a dozen armed police officers carrying shields were seen entering the block at about 23:00 BST. BBC News Home Affairs correspondent Dominic Casciani, who was outside the block of flats, said he heard a loud bang at the scene about an hour and a half later, after which several armed officers left.

""The park was pretty full, a lot of people sat around drinking with friends when one lone person walked through, suddenly shouted some unintelligible words and went round a large group trying to stab them. ""He stabbed three of them and then turned and started running towards me, when we turned and started running. ""When he realised that he couldn't catch us he tried to stab another group sat down.

When can I go on holiday in the UK?,"Going abroad is not straightforward at the moment, so many people are choosing to holiday in the UK this summer. What are the current rules? You can travel freely between England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, unlessyou have to self-isolatebecause you have Covid symptoms or have tested positive. All holiday accommodation - including hotels, hostels, B&B, caravans and boats - can operate across the UK. If you have to cancel a trip because of Covid, you may be entitled to a refund or to rearrange for a later date, but this will depend on the terms and conditions of your booking, so you will need to discuss this with your holiday provider. Anyone planning a trip to the Scottish islands is asked to take two lateral flow tests - one on the day of travel and one three days before. People travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK are also advised to test before departure and after arrival, but this is not law. Some UK cruise operators are insisting passengers do a rapid test before boarding.SagaandP&Ohave said all cruise passengers must be fully vaccinated. How do I get my free Covid tests? How can I prove I'm fully vaccinated? There is no longer any requirement for social distancing, and no limits on how many people can stay together in holiday accommodation or private homes inEngland,ScotlandorWales. However people are still advised to meet others outdoors or in well-ventilated spaces wherever possible. There are still some restrictions in place inNorthern Ireland: 10 people from three households can meet and stay indoors in private dwellings and holiday accommodation Unlimited households can meet outdoors Social distancing of 1m (3ft) remains for many indoors activities, including restaurants, retail and shopping centres No social distancing laws outdoors, or on public transport, but 1m (3ft) recommended The Northern Ireland Executive is due to discuss easing remaining restrictions at its next meeting on 1 September. What can you now do across the UK? How are social distancing rules changing now? Five ways to avoid catching coronavirus indoors Face coverings are no longer required by law inEngland, although the government ""expects and recommends"" that they are worn in crowded and enclosed spaces. However, a number of transport operators in England are still asking customers to wear masks, as are a number of shops and supermarkets. Wearing a face covering remains compulsory in many public indoor spaces inWales,Scotland, andNorthern Ireland, including on public transport, so you will be expected to use a mask on any cross-border plane, train or bus journey, unless you are exempt. Where do I still need to wear a mask? Museums, galleries, amusement parks, leisure centres, cinemas, theatres, stately homes and gardens can open across the UK. However, some venues are still not operating at full capacity, and you may need to pre-book tickets, so you should check before you visit. You may still be asked to wear a face covering or physically distance from other people. Businesses in Wales are required to carry out risk assessments to decide if social distancing measures are still needed. Indoor hospitality venues in Scotland must continue tocollect customer contact details,external. Organisers of outdoor events for more than 5,000 people and indoor events for more than 2,000 have to apply for permission to go ahead. Nightclubs are still closed in Northern Ireland.

Police and protesters packed into Glasgow's George Square Hundreds of people have staged an anti-racism rally in Glasgow city centre despite appeals to stay away because of lockdown restrictions. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, the city council and Police Scotland had called on the public not to gather for the Say No To Racism demonstration. There was a heavy police presence followingviolent scenesfrom a far-right group on Wednesday, but there have been no reports of any trouble. A group of around 50 loyalists who went to the Cenotaph were kept apart from the main crowd, while a group of protesters from the Green Brigade - a group who follow Celtic Football Club - were hemmed in by police in the centre of the square. In Edinburgh's St Andrew Square, a protest was held at the statue of Henry Dundas, who delayed the abolition of the slave trade. Meanwhile, the Loyalist Defence League has been staging a ""protect the statues"" demonstration at the Paisley War Memorial. Read more. Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News A Covid-19 tracing software tool has appeared in the settings of both Android phones and iPhones as part of an update of their operating systems. The ""exposure notification"" tool is switched off by default, and is not a tracing app itself. It enables an app to run in the background while still using Bluetooth. This lets the app measure the distance between two handsets - and then alert the phone owner if someone near them later tests positive for Covid-19. In the UK there is currently no available contact-tracing app. The update has caused some confusion, with people querying the new addition to their handsets on social media. ""This is not a new app but is an extra element added to the phones' operating systems to enable approved developers to build apps that can potentially warn of proximity to infected individuals,"" said computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward, of Surrey University.

The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. But how do governments borrow money and when does it have to be paid back? Read on forthe full story It is not the end of
term they would have wanted, but pupils at one Edinburgh school have a new way to
mark it by holding an art auction on their playground railings. Bruntsfield Primary
pupils are hanging 120 paintings, created during lockdown, on
the iron palings outside their building to raise funds for their school. Works by children as young as five are being displayed alongside pieces donated by some professional artists and will be sold online next week. Parent curator Fiona Reid has
arranged a rota of parents on duty to ensure social distancing. Celtic captain Scott Brown ponders Scottish football's return without supporters in attendance. The Scottish Premiership hopes to kick off the new season on 1 August after last term was curtailed due to the coronavirus. This video can not be played 'It's always difficult without full stadium' - Celtic captain Brown on return to football Glasgow City Council says it will tackle a food waste pile-up after many households failed to comply with cancelled services. It was announced on 24 March that food bins would cease to be emptied from flats as lockdown measures impacted on services. However, officials say residents have continued to use them. Councils which kept the service include Edinburgh City, which noted food waste would become a ""public health hazard"" if left to build up. Others, such as Dundee and Aberdeen, scrapped the service altogether. Read more At age 91, Alex McLean is a stoic individual - fond of the phrase ""what's for you won't go by you"". He has lived on his own in East Kilbride for three years after his wife Betty died following a battle with dementia. But despite his hardy nature, the toll of lockdown was noticed by his daughter Carol Ann Hanna. The two have now formed an ""extended household group"" in line with new Scottish government guidelines - and the reunion was ""precious"". Read more here. The total number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus is 42,589, as of 17:00 (BST) on Friday. It is an increase of 128 deaths from the previous 24 hours, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Scotland's hotels, restaurants and pubs have been given new guidance as they prepare to reopen. The tourism and hospitality industry is set to emerge from almost four months of lockdown on 15 July. But businesses will have to adopt to the new reality through measures ranging from social distancing to improved hand hygiene. Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said: ""The coming months will be extremely challenging."" The new advice includes establishing physical distancing which takes account of ""organisational capacity, queue management, signage and markings"". It will also detail ""enhanced hand hygiene measures and cleaning practice"" and advice for employers on issues including training and equality issues. Read more Allow Twitter content?

The Scottish FA has written to Heart of Midlothian and Partick Thistle to ask why they have opted to take legal action against their respective relegations. The two clubs filed a petition at the Court of Session on Wednesday after the Scottish Professional Football League ended the season early because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In that, they have asked for a judge to scrap promotions and relegations throughout all four of Scotland's divisions. That sparked a robust response from Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers, who would stay down despite being named champions. In a joint statement, the ""extremely unhappy"" trio say that could ""potentially have catastrophic financial implications"" not just for them, but for each of the SPFL's 42 clubs and confirm they have instructed lawyers to act for them.

This video can not be played Campaigners say a four-day week would improve people's mental health and wellbeing A group of MPs wants UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak to consider a
four-day working week to aid recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Backed by campaigners and the Communication Workers Union,
Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the SNP's Mhairi Black and Green
MP Caroline Lucas want a commission to be set up to mirror one established in
Scotland. They say the shorter week would improve mental health and
wellbeing and boost the economy, democracy and the environment. ""It's in no-one's interests to return back to the pressure
and stress that people were under before this pandemic,"" they wrote in a
letter to the chancellor. New Zealand has already floated the idea of a four-day week to
aid the economy. The 4 Day Week Campaign group says shorter working hours is a ""credible and historic solution"" to mass unemployment. It wrote in a tweet: ""Work can be fairly distributed through shortening hours. It happened during the Great Depression [and] led to the normalisation of the [eight-hour] day."" The R rate, or reproduction rate, for Covid-19 has jumped to 1.79 in Germany, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health has said. The rate, published in RKI's daily situation report, compares with a value of 1.06 on Friday. The R number is the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average. An R value of less than 1 is needed to gradually contain the disease. Butthe RKI report,externalpoints out that the value ""reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual outbreaks"".

Chile is one of Latin America's worst-hit countries Chile has announced it will add 3,069 deaths to the country's coronavirus death toll under a new counting methodology. The country is one of the worst-hit in Latin America with nearly 237,000 confirmed cases. The revised number means the death toll will pass 7,000. The new methodology will also include probable deaths, or those which have not been confirmed by lab tests, said Rafael Araos, chief epidemiologist at the health ministry. This comes a week after Jaime Manalich was replaced as health minister amid a controversy over the official figures. Infections are on the rise in Chile and the centre-right government of President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era has extended for 90 days a state of catastrophe, which gives the authorities extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement among other measures.

Lee Longlands built its flagship store on Birmingham's Broad Street in 1932 After almost 120 years of business, a historic family-run furniture company hasgone into
administration due to the coronavirus crisis. Lee Longlands was established in 1902 and opened its flagship store in Birmingham 30 years later. The art-deco Birmingham shop was used to store food rations during World War Two, and the company also contributed to the war effort by producing ""blackout fabric"" to cover windows, making it harder for enemy bombers to identify targets. The firm, a household name across the Midlands, said it has been forced into administration as a result of ""the devastating impact of the coronavirus lockdown"".

Britain is to be included in a list of nations from which people can enter the country freely, the Spanish government has confirmed to the BBC. Spain's Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya says the decision has been made ""out of respect"" for the 400,000 Brits who have second homes in Spain. She said discussions were continuing with the UK government about exempting Spanish visitors from quarantine rules in the UK. The current rules state that anyone returning to - or entering - the UK still has to self-isolate for 14 days. It is understood the UK's quarantine restrictions will be reviewed on 29 June.

Lynsey, from Surrey, has lost her job during the lockdown ""Working in the events industry, there's not a glimmer of when that's going to get up and running again. It's a big black hole."" Lynsey is one of the many young people in the UK to have lost their jobs during lockdown. Some people, like her, have been helped financially by anti-poverty charity Turn2Us. It has told the BBC the amount it has paid out in grants to those aged under 31 has ballooned in recent months as the economic effects of lockdown has hit young workers. We've been hearing some of their storiesand finding out why experts are warning of a ""poverty trap"" ahead. Victoria GillScience reporter The science of social distancing is pretty straightforward - the further away you are, the lower the risk. So two metres IS safer than one. The virus is transmitted through droplets from coughing, sneezing or even speaking - so the further back you stand, the more likely those droplets will have fallen to the ground before they can reach you. Based on that, the government's scientific advisers say that being one metre apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being two metres apart. But, with background infection levels now much lower, the chances of a face-to-face encounter with someone who has the virus are small. And other measures - ones that many shops and restaurants could operate with - reduce the risk, too. Limiting thetimepeople spend face to face, being outside, screens, even keeping noise levels low, so no-one has to shout - all these things help prevent droplets passing from person to person. But while coronavirus is still around, we will all have to factor it into the choices we make because there is no such thing as zero risk. Not too close: children may have to stand back from Santa for photos this year Well, it may be June but we all know that Christmas planning starts early if you want to get tickets booked to your favourite Santa experience or pantomime. We've seen Easter parties and summer festivals cancelled thanks to the coronavirus pandemic - butwill Christmas outings suffer the same fate, asks our colleague Emma Kasprzak. While many events have started taking bookings, it remains to be seen whether or not they will go ahead if social distancing remains in place or the virus has a second peak. On Friday, Delhi recorded the biggest daily increase in cases since the pandemic began Only hours after it was announced, Delhi has reversed a decision which would have seen anyone infected with Covid-19, and who did not need to go to hospital, quarantined in official premises. There were fears that people might avoid getting tested if they thought they might be sent to an institution for five days of quarantine. There were also concerns the policy could put strain on already stretched resources. The quarantine rule was first announced by Delhiâs Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) after a record spike in infections on Friday. The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Anil Baijal, said the lack of monitoring of those in home quarantine was proving problematic. But the state government  criticised the move, calling it ""arbitrary"" and touting the success of its home-quarantine programme. Delhi's  cases jumped by 3,137 to 53,116 on Friday, the biggest daily increase since the pandemic began.

Now local officials say more than 1,000 workers there have tested positive. The number of confirmed cases linked to the factory rose by 226 from 803 on Saturday, regional official Sven-Georg Adenauer told German media. ""We have no significant introduction of coronavirus into the general population,"" the official said, as reported by Germany's dpa news agency.

France's annual Festival of Music will go ahead on Sunday, albeit in a scaled-back form. Usually, millions of people take to the streets across the country to play and listen to music outside in public spaces and parks.

This video can not be played Campaigners say a four-day week would improve people's mental health and wellbeing A group of MPs wants UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak to consider a
four-day working week to aid recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Backed by campaigners and the Communication Workers Union,
Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the SNP's Mhairi Black and Green
MP Caroline Lucas want a commission to be set up to mirror one established in
Scotland. They say the shorter week would improve mental health and
wellbeing and boost the economy, democracy and the environment. ""It's in no-one's interests to return back to the pressure
and stress that people were under before this pandemic,"" they wrote in a
letter to the chancellor. New Zealand has already floated the idea of a four-day week to
aid the economy. The 4 Day Week Campaign group says shorter working hours is a ""credible and historic solution"" to mass unemployment. It wrote in a tweet: ""Work can be fairly distributed through shortening hours. It happened during the Great Depression [and] led to the normalisation of the [eight-hour] day."" The R rate, or reproduction rate, for Covid-19 has jumped to 1.79 in Germany, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health has said. The rate, published in RKI's daily situation report, compares with a value of 1.06 on Friday. The R number is the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average. An R value of less than 1 is needed to gradually contain the disease. Butthe RKI report,externalpoints out that the value ""reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual outbreaks"". ""This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new cases is small,"" it says. Read moreabout the R rate here.  Chile is one of Latin America's worst-hit countries Chile has announced it will add 3,069 deaths to the country's coronavirus death toll under a new counting methodology. The country is one of the worst-hit in Latin America with nearly 237,000 confirmed cases. The revised number means the death toll will pass 7,000. The new methodology will also include probable deaths, or those which have not been confirmed by lab tests, said Rafael Araos, chief epidemiologist at the health ministry. This comes a week after Jaime Manalich was replaced as health minister amid a controversy over the official figures. Infections are on the rise in Chile and the centre-right government of President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era has extended for 90 days a state of catastrophe, which gives the authorities extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement among other measures.

Lee Longlands built its flagship store on Birmingham's Broad Street in 1932 After almost 120 years of business, a historic family-run furniture company hasgone into
administration due to the coronavirus crisis. Lee Longlands was established in 1902 and opened its flagship store in Birmingham 30 years later. The art-deco Birmingham shop was used to store food rations during World War Two, and the company also contributed to the war effort by producing ""blackout fabric"" to cover windows, making it harder for enemy bombers to identify targets. The firm, a household name across the Midlands, said it has been forced into administration as a result of ""the devastating impact of the coronavirus lockdown"".

Britain is to be included in a list of nations from which people can enter the country freely, the Spanish government has confirmed to the BBC.

She said discussions were continuing with the UK government about exempting Spanish visitors from quarantine rules in the UK.

Lynsey, from Surrey, has lost her job during the lockdown ""Working in the events industry, there's not a glimmer of when that's going to get up and running again. It's a big black hole."" Lynsey is one of the many young people in the UK to have lost their jobs during lockdown. Some people, like her, have been helped financially by anti-poverty charity Turn2Us. It has told the BBC the amount it has paid out in grants to those aged under 31 has ballooned in recent months as the economic effects of lockdown has hit young workers. We've been hearing some of their storiesand finding out why experts are warning of a ""poverty trap"" ahead. Victoria GillScience reporter The science of social distancing is pretty straightforward - the further away you are, the lower the risk. So two metres IS safer than one. The virus is transmitted through droplets from coughing, sneezing or even speaking - so the further back you stand, the more likely those droplets will have fallen to the ground before they can reach you. Based on that, the government's scientific advisers say that being one metre apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being two metres apart. But, with background infection levels now much lower, the chances of a face-to-face encounter with someone who has the virus are small. And other measures - ones that many shops and restaurants could operate with - reduce the risk, too. Limiting thetimepeople spend face to face, being outside, screens, even keeping noise levels low, so no-one has to shout - all these things help prevent droplets passing from person to person. But while coronavirus is still around, we will all have to factor it into the choices we make because there is no such thing as zero risk. Not too close: children may have to stand back from Santa for photos this year Well, it may be June but we all know that Christmas planning starts early if you want to get tickets booked to your favourite Santa experience or pantomime. We've seen Easter parties and summer festivals cancelled thanks to the coronavirus pandemic - butwill Christmas outings suffer the same fate, asks our colleague Emma Kasprzak. While many events have started taking bookings, it remains to be seen whether or not they will go ahead if social distancing remains in place or the virus has a second peak. On Friday, Delhi recorded the biggest daily increase in cases since the pandemic began Only hours after it was announced, Delhi has reversed a decision which would have seen anyone infected with Covid-19, and who did not need to go to hospital, quarantined in official premises. There were fears that people might avoid getting tested if they thought they might be sent to an institution for five days of quarantine. There were also concerns the policy could put strain on already stretched resources. The quarantine rule was first announced by Delhiâs Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) after a record spike in infections on Friday. The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Anil Baijal, said the lack of monitoring of those in home quarantine was proving problematic. But the state government  criticised the move, calling it ""arbitrary"" and touting the success of its home-quarantine programme.

Police and protesters packed into Glasgow's George Square Hundreds of people have staged an anti-racism rally in Glasgow city centre despite appeals to stay away because of lockdown restrictions. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, the city council and Police Scotland had called on the public not to gather for the Say No To Racism demonstration. There was a heavy police presence followingviolent scenesfrom a far-right group on Wednesday, but there have been no reports of any trouble. A group of around 50 loyalists who went to the Cenotaph were kept apart from the main crowd, while a group of protesters from the Green Brigade - a group who follow Celtic Football Club - were hemmed in by police in the centre of the square. In Edinburgh's St Andrew Square, a protest was held at the statue of Henry Dundas, who delayed the abolition of the slave trade. Meanwhile, the Loyalist Defence League has been staging a ""protect the statues"" demonstration at the Paisley War Memorial. Read more. Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News A Covid-19 tracing software tool has appeared in the settings of both Android phones and iPhones as part of an update of their operating systems. The ""exposure notification"" tool is switched off by default, and is not a tracing app itself. It enables an app to run in the background while still using Bluetooth. This lets the app measure the distance between two handsets - and then alert the phone owner if someone near them later tests positive for Covid-19. In the UK there is currently no available contact-tracing app. The update has caused some confusion, with people querying the new addition to their handsets on social media. ""This is not a new app but is an extra element added to the phones' operating systems to enable approved developers to build apps that can potentially warn of proximity to infected individuals,"" said computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward, of Surrey University.

The UK's debt is now worth more than its economy after the government borrowed a record amount in May. But how do governments borrow money and when does it have to be paid back? Read on forthe full story It is not the end of
term they would have wanted, but pupils at one Edinburgh school have a new way to
mark it by holding an art auction on their playground railings. Bruntsfield Primary
pupils are hanging 120 paintings, created during lockdown, on
the iron palings outside their building to raise funds for their school. Works by children as young as five are being displayed alongside pieces donated by some professional artists and will be sold online next week. Parent curator Fiona Reid has
arranged a rota of parents on duty to ensure social distancing. Celtic captain Scott Brown ponders Scottish football's return without supporters in attendance.

It was announced on 24 March that food bins would cease to be emptied from flats as lockdown measures impacted on services. However, officials say residents have continued to use them. Councils which kept the service include Edinburgh City, which noted food waste would become a ""public health hazard"" if left to build up. Others, such as Dundee and Aberdeen, scrapped the service altogether. Read more At age 91, Alex McLean is a stoic individual - fond of the phrase ""what's for you won't go by you"". He has lived on his own in East Kilbride for three years after his wife Betty died following a battle with dementia. But despite his hardy nature, the toll of lockdown was noticed by his daughter Carol Ann Hanna. The two have now formed an ""extended household group"" in line with new Scottish government guidelines - and the reunion was ""precious"". Read more here. The total number of people who have died in hospitals, care homes and the wider community in the UK after testing positive for coronavirus is 42,589, as of 17:00 (BST) on Friday. It is an increase of 128 deaths from the previous 24 hours, according to the Department of Health and Social Care. Scotland's hotels, restaurants and pubs have been given new guidance as they prepare to reopen. The tourism and hospitality industry is set to emerge from almost four months of lockdown on 15 July. But businesses will have to adopt to the new reality through measures ranging from social distancing to improved hand hygiene. Tourism Secretary Fergus Ewing said: ""The coming months will be extremely challenging."" The new advice includes establishing physical distancing which takes account of ""organisational capacity, queue management, signage and markings"". It will also detail ""enhanced hand hygiene measures and cleaning practice"" and advice for employers on issues including training and equality issues. Read more Allow Twitter content?

The Scottish FA has written to Heart of Midlothian and Partick Thistle to ask why they have opted to take legal action against their respective relegations. The two clubs filed a petition at the Court of Session on Wednesday after the Scottish Professional Football League ended the season early because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In that, they have asked for a judge to scrap promotions and relegations throughout all four of Scotland's divisions. That sparked a robust response from Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers, who would stay down despite being named champions. In a joint statement, the ""extremely unhappy"" trio say that could ""potentially have catastrophic financial implications"" not just for them, but for each of the SPFL's 42 clubs and confirm they have instructed lawyers to act for them.

Victoria GillScience reporter The science of social distancing is pretty straightforward - the further away you are, the lower the risk. So two metres IS safer than one. The virus is transmitted through droplets from coughing, sneezing or even speaking - so the further back you stand, the more likely those droplets will have fallen to the ground before they can reach you. Based on that, the government's scientific advisers say that being one metre apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being two metres apart. But, with background infection levels now much lower, the chances of a face-to-face encounter with someone who has the virus are small. And other measures - ones that many shops and restaurants could operate with - reduce the risk, too. Limiting thetimepeople spend face to face, being outside, screens, even keeping noise levels low, so no-one has to shout - all these things help prevent droplets passing from person to person. But while coronavirus is still around, we will all have to factor it into the choices we make because there is no such thing as zero risk. Not too close: children may have to stand back from Santa for photos this year Well, it may be June but we all know that Christmas planning starts early if you want to get tickets booked to your favourite Santa experience or pantomime. We've seen Easter parties and summer festivals cancelled thanks to the coronavirus pandemic - butwill Christmas outings suffer the same fate, asks our colleague Emma Kasprzak. While many events have started taking bookings, it remains to be seen whether or not they will go ahead if social distancing remains in place or the virus has a second peak. On Friday, Delhi recorded the biggest daily increase in cases since the pandemic began Only hours after it was announced, Delhi has reversed a decision which would have seen anyone infected with Covid-19, and who did not need to go to hospital, quarantined in official premises. There were fears that people might avoid getting tested if they thought they might be sent to an institution for five days of quarantine. There were also concerns the policy could put strain on already stretched resources. The quarantine rule was first announced by Delhiâs Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) after a record spike in infections on Friday. The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Anil Baijal, said the lack of monitoring of those in home quarantine was proving problematic. But the state government  criticised the move, calling it ""arbitrary"" and touting the success of its home-quarantine programme. Delhi's  cases jumped by 3,137 to 53,116 on Friday, the biggest daily increase since the pandemic began. More than 3,000 workers at the GÃ¼tersloh plant have been tested so far Over the last few days we have been coveringan outbreak of coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in north-west Germany. Now local officials say more than 1,000 workers there have tested positive. The number of confirmed cases linked to the factory rose by 226 from 803 on Saturday, regional official Sven-Georg Adenauer told German media. ""We have no significant introduction of coronavirus into the general population,"" the official said, as reported by Germany's dpa news agency. Operations at the TÃ¶nnies meat processing plant in North Rhine-Westphalia have been suspended since Wednesday afternoon. A quarantine order has been issued for all 6,500 workers and managers at the plant. About half of those employees have been tested so far. In response to the outbreak, local authorities have suspended schools and childcare centres in the region until the end of the month. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she ""welcomed"" the measures to prevent the further spread of the virus in the area. This video can not be played UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the outcome of a review into the two-metre social distancing rule would be announced this week. He added that he was ""very understanding"" of the calls for action on the rule ""particularly for our hospitality industry"". Lockdown restrictions have gradually been lifted in France An outdoor music festival and the reopening of cinemas are the latest entertainment activities to excite France, as the country makes the most of summer amid a phased easing of Covid-19 restrictions. France's annual Festival of Music will go ahead on Sunday, albeit in a scaled-back form. Usually, millions of people take to the streets across the country to play and listen to music outside in public spaces and parks. French electronic music legend Jean-Michel Jarre has been billed as one of the highlights of the festival. His gig has been described as the world's first live virtual ""avatar"" concert. Then, at the stroke of midnight on Sunday, cinemas will be allowed to start screening films again. Cinema-goers are required to wear masks in theatres, and screening rooms can never be more than half full, authorities said. Still, excitement is building for the return of the silver screen in France, a cinema-obsessed nation.

Lynsey is one of the many young people in the UK to have lost their jobs during lockdown. Some people, like her, have been helped financially by anti-poverty charity Turn2Us. It has told the BBC the amount it has paid out in grants to those aged under 31 has ballooned in recent months as the economic effects of lockdown has hit young workers. We've been hearing some of their storiesand finding out why experts are warning of a ""poverty trap"" ahead. Victoria GillScience reporter The science of social distancing is pretty straightforward - the further away you are, the lower the risk. So two metres IS safer than one. The virus is transmitted through droplets from coughing, sneezing or even speaking - so the further back you stand, the more likely those droplets will have fallen to the ground before they can reach you. Based on that, the government's scientific advisers say that being one metre apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being two metres apart. But, with background infection levels now much lower, the chances of a face-to-face encounter with someone who has the virus are small. And other measures - ones that many shops and restaurants could operate with - reduce the risk, too. Limiting thetimepeople spend face to face, being outside, screens, even keeping noise levels low, so no-one has to shout - all these things help prevent droplets passing from person to person. But while coronavirus is still around, we will all have to factor it into the choices we make because there is no such thing as zero risk. Not too close: children may have to stand back from Santa for photos this year Well, it may be June but we all know that Christmas planning starts early if you want to get tickets booked to your favourite Santa experience or pantomime. We've seen Easter parties and summer festivals cancelled thanks to the coronavirus pandemic - butwill Christmas outings suffer the same fate, asks our colleague Emma Kasprzak. While many events have started taking bookings, it remains to be seen whether or not they will go ahead if social distancing remains in place or the virus has a second peak. On Friday, Delhi recorded the biggest daily increase in cases since the pandemic began Only hours after it was announced, Delhi has reversed a decision which would have seen anyone infected with Covid-19, and who did not need to go to hospital, quarantined in official premises. There were fears that people might avoid getting tested if they thought they might be sent to an institution for five days of quarantine. There were also concerns the policy could put strain on already stretched resources. The quarantine rule was first announced by Delhiâs Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) after a record spike in infections on Friday. The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Anil Baijal, said the lack of monitoring of those in home quarantine was proving problematic. But the state government  criticised the move, calling it ""arbitrary"" and touting the success of its home-quarantine programme. Delhi's  cases jumped by 3,137 to 53,116 on Friday, the biggest daily increase since the pandemic began. More than 3,000 workers at the GÃ¼tersloh plant have been tested so far Over the last few days we have been coveringan outbreak of coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in north-west Germany. Now local officials say more than 1,000 workers there have tested positive. The number of confirmed cases linked to the factory rose by 226 from 803 on Saturday, regional official Sven-Georg Adenauer told German media. ""We have no significant introduction of coronavirus into the general population,"" the official said, as reported by Germany's dpa news agency. Operations at the TÃ¶nnies meat processing plant in North Rhine-Westphalia have been suspended since Wednesday afternoon. A quarantine order has been issued for all 6,500 workers and managers at the plant. About half of those employees have been tested so far. In response to the outbreak, local authorities have suspended schools and childcare centres in the region until the end of the month. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she ""welcomed"" the measures to prevent the further spread of the virus in the area. This video can not be played UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the outcome of a review into the two-metre social distancing rule would be announced this week. He added that he was ""very understanding"" of the calls for action on the rule ""particularly for our hospitality industry"". Lockdown restrictions have gradually been lifted in France An outdoor music festival and the reopening of cinemas are the latest entertainment activities to excite France, as the country makes the most of summer amid a phased easing of Covid-19 restrictions. France's annual Festival of Music will go ahead on Sunday, albeit in a scaled-back form. Usually, millions of people take to the streets across the country to play and listen to music outside in public spaces and parks. French electronic music legend Jean-Michel Jarre has been billed as one of the highlights of the festival. His gig has been described as the world's first live virtual ""avatar"" concert. Then, at the stroke of midnight on Sunday, cinemas will be allowed to start screening films again. Cinema-goers are required to wear masks in theatres, and screening rooms can never be more than half full, authorities said. Still, excitement is building for the return of the silver screen in France, a cinema-obsessed nation. ""I only have one word - finally,"" Emmanuel Delesse, one of the directors of cinema chain UGC, told AFP news agency. Â© 2025 BBC.

"X Factor star reveals 'heartbreaking' racismAlexandra Burke says she was told to bleach her skin and style her hair ""to appeal to white people"".Entertainment & Arts","Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin ""to look whiter"". After winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would ""have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin"". Ina 15-minute Instagram video,external, she recalls being told: ""You can't have braids, you can't have an afro. ""You have to have hair... that appeals to white people."" The 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as ""heartbreaking"". Burke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestantMisha B, who recently spoke out about ""being devalued""at the hands of the music industry. Misha B claimed the X Factor projected ""this angry black girl narrative"", using words such as ""feisty"" and ""bully"" to describe her after one live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal. ""I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,"" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media. The music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she ""comes across aggressive"". She said she was told: ""You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that"", and added: ""I am so upset with myself that I allowed that."" Burke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard. The singer said was told: ""Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner"". ""It's hurtful,"" she added. Burke went on to become a runner-up on Strictly Come Dancing in 2017 She was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing. She recalled how one journalist accused her of ""being a diva"" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died. ""That was the image they had of me, because of the papers."" she said. ""I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. ""I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. ""I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone."" She said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because ""the truth is all we've got"". ""I just feel like people need to not see colour,"" said Burke. ""My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. ""People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind.""

Greta: Climate change 'as urgent' as coronavirus,"This video can not be played Greta Thunberg talks about how she has spent lockdown in Sweden Greta Thunberg says the world needs to learn the lessons of coronavirus and treat climate change with similar urgency. That means the world acting ""with necessary force"", the Swedish climate activist says in an exclusive interview with BBC News. She doesn't think any ""green recovery plan"" will solve the crisis alone. And she says the world is now passing a ""social tipping point"" on climate and issues such as Black Lives Matter. Listen to Greta talk to Justin ""People are starting to realise that we cannot keep looking away from these things"", says Ms Thunberg, ""we cannot keep sweeping these injustices under the carpet"". She says lockdown has given her time to relax and reflect away from the public gaze. Ms Thunberg has shared with the BBC the text of a deeply personal programme she has made for Swedish Radio. In the radio programme, which goes online this morning, Greta looks back on the year in which shebecame one of the world's most high-profile celebrities.,external The then 16-year-old took a sabbatical from school to spend a tumultuous year campaigning on the climate. What does Greta Thunberg want? We can't all be Greta, but your actions have a ripple effect Greta Thunberg calls out the 'haters' She sailed across the Atlantic on a racing yacht to address a special UN Climate Action summit in New York in September. She describes world leaders queuing to get pictures with her, with Angela Merkel asking whether it was okay to post her photo on social media. The climate activist is sceptical of some world leaders' motives The climate campaigner is sceptical of their motives. ""Perhaps it makes them forget the shame of their generation letting all future generations down"", she says. ""I guess maybe it helps them to sleep at night."" It was in the UN that she delivered her famous ""how dare you"" speech. ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words"", she told the world leaders gathered in the UN Assembly. She appeared on the verge of tears as she continued. ""People are dying,"" she said, ""and all you can talk about is money and fairy tales of eternal economic growth. How dare you?"" She knew it was a ""lifetime moment"" and decided not to hold anything back, she says now. ""I am going to let my emotions take control and to really make something big out of this because I won't be able to do this again"". She describes travelling back from the UN to her hotel on the subway and seeing people watching the speech on their phones, but says she felt no urge to celebrate. ""All that is left are empty words"", she says. The phrase reflects her deep cynicism about the motives of most world leaders. ""The level of knowledge and understanding even among people in power is very, very low, much lower than you would think,"" she told the BBC. This video can not be played Greta sailed to New York on a zero-emissions yacht in 2019 She says the only way to reduce emissions on the scale that is necessary is to make fundamental changes to our lifestyles, starting in developed countries. But she doesn't believe any leaders have the nerve to do that. Instead, she says, they ""simply refrain from reporting the emissions, or move them somewhere else"". She claims the UK, Sweden and other countries do this by failing to account for the emissions from ships and aircraft and by choosing not to count the emissions from goods produced in factories abroad. As a result, she says in her radio programme, the whole language of debate has been degraded. ""Words like green, sustainable, 'net-zero', 'environmentally friendly', 'organic', 'climate-neutral' and 'fossil-free' are today so misused and watered down that they have pretty much lost all their meaning. They can imply everything from deforestation to aviation, meat and car industries,"" she said. Ms Thunberg says the only positive that could come out of the coronavirus pandemic would be if it changes how we deal with global crises: ""It shows that in a crisis, you act, and you act with necessary force."" She says she is encouraged that politicians are now stressing the importance of listening to scientists and experts. ""Suddenly people in power are saying they will do whatever it takes since you cannot put a price on human life."" She hopes that will open up a discussion about the urgency of taking action to help the people who die from illnesses related to climate change and environmental degradation right now as well as in the future. But she remains deeply pessimistic about our ability to keep any temperature increases within safe boundaries. She says that, even if countries actually deliver the carbon reductions they've promised, we'll still be heading for a ""catastrophic"" global temperature rise of 3-4 degrees. The teenager believes the only way to avoid a climate crisis is to tear up contracts and abandon existing deals and agreements that companies and countries have signed up to. ""The climate and ecological crisis cannot be solved within today's political and economic systems"", the Swedish climate activist argues. ""That isn't an opinion. That's a fact."" Thunberg talks movingly of a road-trip she and her father took through North America in an electric car borrowed from Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Hollywood actor turned politician and climate campaigner. She visited the charred remains of Paradise, the Californian town destroyed by a wildfire in November 2018. She is shocked by the carbon-intensive lifestyles she saw in the US.  ""Apart from a few wind power plants and solar panels,"" she says, ""there are no signs whatsoever of any sustainable transition, despite this being the richest country in the world."" But the social inequities struck her just as forcefully. She describes meeting poor black, Hispanic and indigenous communities. ""It was very shocking to hear people talk about that they can't afford to put food on the table"", she explained. Yet Greta Thunberg says she has been inspired by the way people have been responding to these injustices, particularly the Black Lives Matter protests following the death of George Floyd in May. She believes society has ""passed a social tipping point, we can no longer look away from what our society has been ignoring for so long whether it is equality, justice or sustainability"". She describes signs of what she calls an ""awakening"" in which ""people are starting to find their voice, to sort of understand that they can actually have an impact"". That is why Greta Thunberg says she still has hope. ""Humanity has not yet failed"", she argues. She concludes her radio documentary in powerful form. ""Nature does not bargain and you cannot compromise with the laws of physics,"" the teenager asserts. ""Doing our best is no longer good enough. We must now do the seemingly impossible. And that is up to you and me. Because no one else will do it for us."" A longer version ofJustin Rowlatt's interview with Greta Thunbergwill be available next week.

Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the SNP's Mhairi Black and Green
MP Caroline Lucas want a commission to be set up to mirror one established in

aid the economy. The 4 Day Week Campaign group says shorter working hours is a ""credible and historic solution"" to mass unemployment.

The R rate, or reproduction rate, for Covid-19 has jumped to 1.79 in Germany, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health has said.

Chile is one of Latin America's worst-hit countries Chile has announced it will add 3,069 deaths to the country's coronavirus death toll under a new counting methodology. The country is one of the worst-hit in Latin America with nearly 237,000 confirmed cases. The revised number means the death toll will pass 7,000.

There were fears that people might avoid getting tested if they thought they might be sent to an institution for five days of quarantine. There were also concerns the policy could put strain on already stretched resources. The quarantine rule was first announced by Delhiâs Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) after a record spike in infections on Friday. The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Anil Baijal, said the lack of monitoring of those in home quarantine was proving problematic. But the state government  criticised the move, calling it ""arbitrary"" and touting the success of its home-quarantine programme. Delhi's  cases jumped by 3,137 to 53,116 on Friday, the biggest daily increase since the pandemic began. More than 3,000 workers at the GÃ¼tersloh plant have been tested so far Over the last few days we have been coveringan outbreak of coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in north-west Germany.

The number of confirmed cases linked to the factory rose by 226 from 803 on Saturday, regional official Sven-Georg Adenauer told German media. ""We have no significant introduction of coronavirus into the general population,"" the official said, as reported by Germany's dpa news agency. Operations at the TÃ¶nnies meat processing plant in North Rhine-Westphalia have been suspended since Wednesday afternoon. A quarantine order has been issued for all 6,500 workers and managers at the plant. About half of those employees have been tested so far.

Lockdown restrictions have gradually been lifted in France An outdoor music festival and the reopening of cinemas are the latest entertainment activities to excite France, as the country makes the most of summer amid a phased easing of Covid-19 restrictions. France's annual Festival of Music will go ahead on Sunday, albeit in a scaled-back form. Usually, millions of people take to the streets across the country to play and listen to music outside in public spaces and parks. French electronic music legend Jean-Michel Jarre has been billed as one of the highlights of the festival. His gig has been described as the world's first live virtual ""avatar"" concert. Then, at the stroke of midnight on Sunday, cinemas will be allowed to start screening films again. Cinema-goers are required to wear masks in theatres, and screening rooms can never be more than half full, authorities said. Still, excitement is building for the return of the silver screen in France, a cinema-obsessed nation.

four-day working week to aid recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Backed by campaigners and the Communication Workers Union,
Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the SNP's Mhairi Black and Green
MP Caroline Lucas want a commission to be set up to mirror one established in
Scotland. They say the shorter week would improve mental health and
wellbeing and boost the economy, democracy and the environment. ""It's in no-one's interests to return back to the pressure
and stress that people were under before this pandemic,"" they wrote in a
letter to the chancellor. New Zealand has already floated the idea of a four-day week to
aid the economy. The 4 Day Week Campaign group says shorter working hours is a ""credible and historic solution"" to mass unemployment. It wrote in a tweet: ""Work can be fairly distributed through shortening hours. It happened during the Great Depression [and] led to the normalisation of the [eight-hour] day."" The R rate, or reproduction rate, for Covid-19 has jumped to 1.79 in Germany, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health has said. The rate, published in RKI's daily situation report, compares with a value of 1.06 on Friday. The R number is the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average. An R value of less than 1 is needed to gradually contain the disease. Butthe RKI report,externalpoints out that the value ""reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual outbreaks"".

Chile is one of Latin America's worst-hit countries Chile has announced it will add 3,069 deaths to the country's coronavirus death toll under a new counting methodology. The country is one of the worst-hit in Latin America with nearly 237,000 confirmed cases. The revised number means the death toll will pass 7,000. The new methodology will also include probable deaths, or those which have not been confirmed by lab tests, said Rafael Araos, chief epidemiologist at the health ministry. This comes a week after Jaime Manalich was replaced as health minister amid a controversy over the official figures. Infections are on the rise in Chile and the centre-right government of President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era has extended for 90 days a state of catastrophe, which gives the authorities extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement among other measures.

administration due to the coronavirus crisis. Lee Longlands was established in 1902 and opened its flagship store in Birmingham 30 years later. The art-deco Birmingham shop was used to store food rations during World War Two, and the company also contributed to the war effort by producing ""blackout fabric"" to cover windows, making it harder for enemy bombers to identify targets.

Lynsey is one of the many young people in the UK to have lost their jobs during lockdown. Some people, like her, have been helped financially by anti-poverty charity Turn2Us. It has told the BBC the amount it has paid out in grants to those aged under 31 has ballooned in recent months as the economic effects of lockdown has hit young workers. We've been hearing some of their storiesand finding out why experts are warning of a ""poverty trap"" ahead. Victoria GillScience reporter The science of social distancing is pretty straightforward - the further away you are, the lower the risk. So two metres IS safer than one. The virus is transmitted through droplets from coughing, sneezing or even speaking - so the further back you stand, the more likely those droplets will have fallen to the ground before they can reach you. Based on that, the government's scientific advisers say that being one metre apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being two metres apart. But, with background infection levels now much lower, the chances of a face-to-face encounter with someone who has the virus are small. And other measures - ones that many shops and restaurants could operate with - reduce the risk, too. Limiting thetimepeople spend face to face, being outside, screens, even keeping noise levels low, so no-one has to shout - all these things help prevent droplets passing from person to person. But while coronavirus is still around, we will all have to factor it into the choices we make because there is no such thing as zero risk. Not too close: children may have to stand back from Santa for photos this year Well, it may be June but we all know that Christmas planning starts early if you want to get tickets booked to your favourite Santa experience or pantomime. We've seen Easter parties and summer festivals cancelled thanks to the coronavirus pandemic - butwill Christmas outings suffer the same fate, asks our colleague Emma Kasprzak. While many events have started taking bookings, it remains to be seen whether or not they will go ahead if social distancing remains in place or the virus has a second peak.

"X Factor star reveals 'heartbreaking' racismAlexandra Burke says she was told to bleach her skin and style her hair ""to appeal to white people"".","Singer Alexandra Burke has spoken out about her experiences of racism in the music industry, revealing she was asked to bleach her skin ""to look whiter"". After winning X Factor, Burke said she was told she would ""have to work 10 times harder than a white artist, because of the colour of your skin"". Ina 15-minute Instagram video,external, she recalls being told: ""You can't have braids, you can't have an afro. ""You have to have hair... that appeals to white people."" The 31-year-old star, who won the TV talent show in 2008 at the age of 19, described the experiences as ""heartbreaking"". Burke, who refused to bleach her skin, said she was inspired to tell her story by fellow X Factor contestantMisha B, who recently spoke out about ""being devalued""at the hands of the music industry. Misha B claimed the X Factor projected ""this angry black girl narrative"", using words such as ""feisty"" and ""bully"" to describe her after one live performance on the show. The 2011 contestant said it left her feeling suicidal. ""I could have spoken up much earlier, but was too scared to,"" said Burke, whose Instagram post has attracted a lot of attention, and sympathy, on social media. The music star revealed the micro-aggressions she experienced at the hands of record labels, being told regularly that she ""comes across aggressive"". She said she was told: ""You can't release this kind of music, because white people don't understand that"", and added: ""I am so upset with myself that I allowed that."" Burke, whose hit singles Hallelujah, Bad Boys and All Night Long were all nominated for Brit Awards, also played the lead in the critically acclaimed West End musical The Bodyguard. The singer said was told: ""Because you're a black girl, you won't make it that far in the industry... if you were white, you would be bigger than what you are now, you could sell more records, you'd be a Brit Award-winner"". ""It's hurtful,"" she added. Burke went on to become a runner-up on Strictly Come Dancing in 2017 She was raised in north London by her mother, Soul II Soul singer Melissa Bell, who died in August 2017 - just before Burke was due to take part in Strictly Come Dancing. She recalled how one journalist accused her of ""being a diva"" when she asked not to do any publicity on the show's red carpet, which happened to be taking place on the same day as her mother died. ""That was the image they had of me, because of the papers."" she said. ""I was so scared on that show. So many trolls, telling me all kinds of stuff. ""I have no idea how I got through it. I don't even like thinking about that experience. It's simply because of me being a black, strong woman. ""I can speak up for myself because that's how I've been taught. But I would never do it in a way that offends people or hurts anyone."" She said the Black Lives Matter movement had persuaded her to share her experiences because ""the truth is all we've got"". ""I just feel like people need to not see colour,"" said Burke. ""My mum always raised me to never see colour. I will continue that way because that's what makes me happy. ""People are people. We are all human, we all have feelings. So be kind.""

Border clash a 'deliberate provocation' - China,"Indian troops near the border with China China has accused Indian troops of a ""deliberate provocation"" in its first official comments on Monday's deadly clash at a disputed Himalayan border. Foreign ministry spokesman Lijian Zhao said the troops had crossed into Chinese territory and attacked, triggering ""fierce physical conflicts"". However he did not give details of any Chinese casualties. On Friday Indian PM Narendra Modi said no foreign soldiers had crossed India's borders and no territory had been lost. Mr Modi vowed that India would defend its border with military force if necessary. India and China downplay reports of soldier release The fake news about India and China's border clash Twenty Indian soldiers were killed in the clash in the Galwan Valley. India has said that both sides suffered losses during the fighting. In aseries of tweets,external, Mr Zhao said the Galwan Valley was on the Chinese side of the Line of Actual Control (LAC), the poorly demarcated border between the two nuclear-armed powers. He said the clash occurred at a time when tension had been easing after India demolished infrastructure it had built on the Chinese side of the LAC in May and withdrew personnel, following an agreement between Chinese and Indian officers. But on 15 June Indian troops ""once again crossed the Line of Actual Control for deliberate provocation when the situation in the Galwan Valley was already easing"", Mr Zhao said. ""India's front-line troops even violently attacked the Chinese officers and soldiers who went there for negotiation, thus triggering fierce physical conflicts and causing casualties,"" he said. India has been building ""roads, bridges and other facilities"" at the LAC in Galwan Valley since April, Mr Zhao said. In a televised statement on Friday, Mr Modi said there had been no incursion into Indian territory. ""Nobody has intruded into our border, neither is anybody there now, nor have our posts been captured,"" he said. India's armed forces had been ""given a free hand to take all necessary steps"" to protect Indian territory, he added. ""The entire country is hurt and angry at the steps taken by China,"" he said, adding: ""India wants peace and friendship, but upholding sovereignty is foremost."" His government had previously blamed China for the clash, with the foreign ministry releasing a statement on Wednesday saying it had been sparked after ""the Chinese side sought to erect a structure in Galwan valley on our side of the LAC"". Media reports said troops clashed on ridges at a height of nearly 4,300m (14,000 ft) on steep terrain, with some soldiers falling into the fast-flowing Galwan river in sub-zero temperatures. At least 76 Indian soldiers were reportedly injured in addition to the 20 dead. China has not released any information about Chinese casualties. The fighting took place without any firearms because of a 1996 agreement barring guns and explosives from the area. An image that emerged on Thursday purportedly showed some of the crude weapons used in the fight. An image passed to the BBC by an Indian military official shows crude weapons purportedly used in the fight The photograph, which appears to show iron rods studded with nails, was passed to the BBC by a senior Indian military official on the India-China border, who said the weapons had been used by the Chinese. The image was widely shared on Twitter in India, prompting outrage from many social media users. Neither Chinese or Indian officials have commented on it. The Galwan river valley in Ladakh, with its harsh climate and high-altitude terrain, is close to Aksai Chin, a disputed area claimed by India but controlled by China. This is not the first time the two nuclear-armed neighbours have fought without conventional firearms on the border. India and China have a history of face-offs and overlapping territorial claims along the more than 3,440km (2,100 mile), poorly drawn LAC separating the two sides. The last firing on the border happened in 1975 when four Indian soldiers were killed in a remote pass in the north-eastern state of Arunachal Pradesh. The clash was variously described by former diplomats as an ambush and an accident. But no bullets have been fired since. This video can not be played Funerals held for Indian soldiers killed in China Ladakh clash At the root of this is a 1996 bilateral agreement that says ""neither side shall open fire... conduct blast operations or hunt with guns or explosives within two kilometres of the Line of Actual Control"". But there have been other tense confrontations along the border in recent weeks. In May Indian and Chinese soldiers exchanged physical blows on the border at Pangong Lake, also in Ladakh, and in the north-eastern Indian state of Sikkim hundreds of miles to the east. India has accused China of sending thousands of troops into the Galwan Valley and says China occupies 38,000 sq km (14,700 sq miles) of its territory. Several rounds of talks in the last three decades have failed to resolve the boundary disputes.

Anti-racism rally held despite 'stay away' warning,"This video can not be played Anti-racism rally held despite 'stay away' warning Hundreds of people staged an anti-racism rally in Glasgow city centre despite appeals to stay away due to the lockdown restrictions. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf, the city council and Police Scotland hadcalled on the publicnot to gather for the Say No To Racism demonstration. There was a heavy police presence in the square followingviolent scenesfrom a far-right group on Wednesday. Officers later confirmed one man was arrested in the nearby Gallowgate area. A police spokesman said the 42-year-old allegedly obstructed officers. A second man, aged 62, was arrested in Edinburgh for threatening and abusive behaviour. That arrest is believed to be in connection with aseparate protest in the capital. Many protesters wore masks to attend the event Police surround members of the Green Brigade At about midday a group of protesters from the Green Brigade - a group of ultras who follow Celtic football club - were hemmed in by police in the centre of Glasgow's George Square. Anti-racism activists outside the cordon chanted: ""Let them go."" Ch Supt Alan Murray, said: ""We identified a group as football risk supporters, who we believed posed a threat to public safety. ""We spoke with this group and, at their request, escorted them to the Gallowgate area of the city where they dispersed."" Loyalists and members of a far-right group announced online on Friday night that they planned to head to the square to ""protect statues"". A small group gathered at the war memorial during the rally as lines of riot police separated the two. Police officers separated the rally from a small group of loyalists who also gathered in George Square. More than 500 people attended the rally, with stewards asking them to stick to social distancing guidelines by following markings on the square. Supporters include Stand Up To Racism, Glasgow Campaign to Welcome Refugees, Positive Action in Housing, Afghan Human Rights Foundation and unions. They had also been asked to wear masks and not to travel farther than public health advice allows.At the start of the rally, the crowd took a knee in support of the Black Lives Matter movement. Later, names of people who died in police custody were read out and attendees chanted ""no justice, no peace, no racist police"". Speakers said they ""didn't come here for a fight"" and spoke of securing greater rights for refugees and asylum seekers.They added ""no-one welcomes"" the far-right group and called on police to ""do their job"". There were some minor scuffles as police controlled people arriving and leaving but the rally was peaceful. A number of speakers addressed the anti-racism rally Chief Supt Murray said: ""Significant police resources were deployed at George Square to prevent the disgraceful scenes of violence and disorder witnessed in recent days. ""Those who turned up to protest were facilitated with an appropriate policing response and I would like to thank all officers involved for their professionalism in preventing trouble and maintaining public safety."" ""Our robust response will continue across the country and anyone intent on causing violence and disorder should expect arrest."" Charlotte Ahmed, of Stand Up to Racism, Scotland said: ""Today's demonstration was a magnificent expression of the unity, the anti-racism and the anti-fascism of the people of Glasgow. ""Here, in George Square, the very place where thousands of us welcomed Nelson Mandela to Scotland, we have made it clear: refugees are welcome here, Black Lives Matter, no racists in Glasgow."" Police arrived at George Square early on Saturday Elsewhere, a protest was held at the statue of Henry Dundas, whodelayed the abolition of the slave trade, at St Andrew Square, Edinburgh. And the Loyalist Defence League staged a ""protect the statues"" demonstration at the Paisley War Memorial. On Friday, Ch Supt Hazel Hendren, divisional commander, said: ""Please do not come to George Square."" She said: ""The lockdown restrictions remain in place and people should leave their homes only for very limited purposes. ""Anyone who wants to protest should find another way of doing so that keeps everyone safe."" At least six people were arrested on Wednesday following scenes labelled ""disgraceful"" by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. Far-right loyalists targeted a rally in the city's George Square which was calling for improved living conditions for refugees. The organisers vowed the rally would ""send a positive anti-racist message from Glasgow's George Square to the world"".

Top US prosecutor resists attempt to oust him,"Top US prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said he has ""no intention of resigning"" A top federal prosecutor has issued a statement saying he has not resigned, despite the US justice department announcing he was stepping down. Geoffrey Berman, the US Attorney in Manhattan, said he learned he was ""stepping down"" in a press release issued by US Attorney-General William Barr on Friday evening. Mr Barr gave no reason for the move. He said Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Jay Clayton would be nominated to succeed Mr Berman. Mr Berman has overseen the prosecution of a number of US President Donald Trump's associates since he took office in 2018. They include President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who has served a prison sentence for lying to Congress, the US legislature, and election campaign finance fraud. Mr Berman's department has also been investigating the conduct of Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's current personal lawyer. He is also leading the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and who earlier this monthaccused Prince Andrew of ""shutting the door"" on his probe. In his statement, Mr Berman said had ""no intention of resigning"", adding he would only step down when a successor had been confirmed by Congress. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Berman was appointed to his position by a court, making it unclear whether President Trump has the legal authority to remove him, BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher says. Senior Democrats have accused Mr Barr of politicising the US Justice Department and making legal decisions at the behest of President Trump. The row comes days after former National Security Adviser John Bolton said in a book that President Trump had pressed Mr Berman's office to halt an investigation into the Turkish Halkbank in a bid to make a deal with Turkey's president. The ten biggest claims in John Bolton's book In his statement,external, Mr Barr - a close ally of the president - said Mr Berman was ""stepping down"" after two-and-a-half years in the post. Mr Barr said Mr Berman had ""done an excellent job"", achieving ""many successes on consequential civil and criminal matters"", but gave no explanation for his resignation. Mr Trump intended to nominate Mr Clayton, a man who has never served as a federal prosecutor, as Mr Berman's successor, Mr Barr said. Mr Berman said he would only step aside when a replacement had been appointed by the Senate Mr Clayton's ""management experience and expertise in financial regulation give him an ideal background"" to lead the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Mr Barr said. The US attorney in New Jersey, Craig Carpenito, will serve as acting head of the office until Mr Clayton has been confirmed. In his statement, Mr Berman said: ""I learned in a press release from the Attorney General tonight that I was 'stepping down' as United States Attorney. I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position."" He said judges for the Southern District of New York appointed him to the role, and would only step down when a presidentially appointed nominee was confirmed by the Senate. Mr Berman added: ""Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption. I cherish every day that I work with the men and women of this office to pursue justice without fear or favour - and intend to ensure that this office's important cases continue unimpeded."" Mr Berman, 60, was appointed in January 2018 after Mr Trump fired his predecessor, Preet Bharara, who had refused to resign. Preet Bharara, high-profile US prosecutor, says he was fired Lawmakers investigate Trump, Giuliani and Ukraine Mr Berman is a long-time Republican donor, including to Mr Trump's presidential campaign. He is reportedly investigating the business dealings of President Trump's personal lawyer, Mr Giuliani, who used to work for the same law firm as Mr Berman. Mr Berman is also the prosecutor in charge of the investigation into sex offender Jeffrey Epsteinand has previously expressed frustration over the Duke of York's role in the inquiry. Earlier this month, Mr Berman said Prince Andrew - a former friend of Epstein - had ""repeatedly declined our request"" to schedule an interview. The duke's lawyers reject claims he has not co-operated. Geoffrey Berman is not going quietly. Attorney-General Barr may have thought replacing a top US prosecutor would be a smooth process. But Mr Berman - by refusing to resign - has shown he has other ideas. Mr Berman also may have the law on his side, as this particular US attorney was appointed to his position by a court, not the president, making it unclear whether President Trump has the legal authority to remove him. A court may have to sort this out, too, creating a procedural headache the White House surely hoped to avoid. Looming over all of this is the question of why the president, and his attorney general, felt compelled to do this now, just five months before election day. The suddenness of the dismissal, coupled with the fact that Mr Berman is overseeing an investigation into the president's personal lawyer, Mr Giuliani, amid other corruption inquiries are already prompting accusations of impropriety. In the months since being acquitted in his impeachment trial, Trump has removed a number of government officials for apparently insufficient loyalty. Mr Berman may be the latest target - albeit a stubborn one. Read more from Anthony:Four reasons why this was a bad week for Trump Writing on Twitter, Mr Bharara, said that the timing and manner of the move to replace Mr Berman was strange. ""Why does a president get rid of his own hand-picked US Attorney in SDNY (Southern District of New York) on a Friday night, less than five months before the election?"" Mr Bharara said. Democrat Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Chairman, said he was not surprised by the move, accusing Mr Barr of repeatedly interfering in ""criminal investigations on Trump's behalf"". ""We have a hearing on this topic on Wednesday,"" said Mr Nadler. ""We welcome Mr Berman's testimony and will invite him to testify."" Allow Twitter content?

"'Having my identity stolen cost me Â£10,000'","Gemma Combellack says she was refused a mortgage after criminals stole her identity ""It just seemed to go on and on, it's just been really upsetting."" Gemma Combellack, 30, is talking about her six month fight to reclaim her identity after it was stolen by criminals last year. She discovered she'd become a victim of ID theft when she was refused a mortgage over a payday loan in her name that she knew nothing about. A bank account had also been opened by fraudsters using her identity. ""I've been in tears at my desk at work in terms of the impact it's had on me and my stress levels. ""At the time it made me so angry, the fact that we were having to go through all this trauma and stress and no one could give me answer. ""It's just that it was so out of our control and that's the most frustrating thing about it."" Gemma's not alone. Last year ID theft happened more than 223,000 times, up 18% on the year before,according to Cifas,external, the counter fraud organisation which runs the National Fraud Database and works with police and financial institutions to try to tackle fraud. 'Lucrative business' Its chief executive, Mike Haley, says there are a number of factors fuelling that rise. ""Criminals are using more sophisticated methods, more of us are doing more things online and we're all using cash less which is something fraudsters are able to exploit. ""Criminals are targeting ID fraud as a lucrative business model and they're getting sophisticated in their use of social engineering [on the phone, text messages or on social media] which involves persuading people to give up personal information,"" Mr Haley said. Combined with large scale data breaches and data theft from companies and organisations, ""and you have the raw ingredients [for ID theft],"" he added. Very often criminals carrying out these attacks on people in the UK aren't even based here. ""This can all be done at a distance,"" he said. ""Now you can sit behind a computer anywhere in the world and commit crime on a vast scale."" Also, there is very little risk of getting caught as ""criminals are able to use the anonymity of the internet,"" he said. 2015: 169,592 2016: 172,918 2017: 174,523 2018: 189,108 2019: 223,163 Cifas For Gemma, the personal cost of having her identity stolen ran into thousands of pounds. ""In terms of the financial implications we weren't able to get a mortgage and therefore had to continue to pay rent on our property for six months. ""We'd also instructed a solicitor and had the flat valued so, overall, the costs are looking at the Â£10,000 mark. ""It just feels like I haven't progressed in nine months. It feels like we've just been really financially hit by something that was completely out of our hands, and it just seems really unfair."" Gemma says it took her months of stress and anxiety before she was able to reclaim her identity Gemma's also worried about her financial future. ""If it can happen once it can happen again,"" she said. ""It's made me really, really nervous about it happening again because there are no signs, you don't know it's happening to you."" Mike Haley says he expects the number of ID thefts to be even higher this year and next as criminals look to exploit people's vulnerabilities during the coronavirus pandemic. He said: ""During this period criminals haven't taken a holiday, they've been using this time to harvest information. ""They've been upping their activity to capitalise on the crisis, we all have our guard down because, understandably, we're all worried about other things. The advice from experts is always avoid clicking on links or replying to text messages and phone calls that come out of the blue. There is also anational campaign,externaltrying to raise awareness of fraud and advice for people on how they can try to help themselves to avoid becoming a victim.

Hard-hit Brazil passes one million virus casesThe country becomes the second to hit the mark amid warnings the outbreak's peak is still weeks away.,"Health experts say the outbreak in Brazil is still weeks away from its peak Brazil has become the second country in the world to confirm more than one million cases of Covid-19, as the disease continues to spread. The health ministry also posted a record number of new cases in the past 24 hours - more than 54,000. In addition, there were more than 1,200 deaths for the fourth consecutive day, taking the total to nearly 49,000. A lack of testing suggests the true figures are higher and experts say the outbreak is weeks away from its peak. The new figure was revealed hours after the World Health Organization (WHO) warned that the pandemic was entering a ""new and dangerous"" phase, with its director general Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus warning that cases were rising at the same time as people are growing weary of lockdowns and governments are seeking to restart their economies. What are the numbers out of Latin America? Latin America is among the areas currently seeing a spike in infections. There are major outbreaks in a number of countries, including Chile and Peru, while Mexico became the seventh country to officially surpass 20,000 virus-related deaths on Friday. But only the US has seen more infections than Brazil, where far-right President Jair Bolsonaro has been heavily criticised for his response to the crisis. He has repeatedly clashed with state governors and mayors who have adopted strict restrictions to curb the spread of the virus, shutting down major cities. Mr Bolsonaro argues that the economic impact of the measures will be much bigger than the virus itself, a position shared by many. But his overall approach to the crisis has led to the resignation of two doctors as health minister. Jair Bolsonaro has long-admired Donald Trump and his way of doing politics. The two men have much in common - not least the way they have handled the pandemic in their own countries. The figures in the US are staggering - but Brazil, too, is frightening. They are now exclusive members of a club nobody wants to join. Such a massive spike in the numbers - even if it was down to inaccurate reporting earlier this week - reveals how out of control the virus still is here. This, at a time when big cities are reopening and people are returning to work. For a long time, there was a stand-off between President Bolsonaro and state governors - he was angry that they were imposing tough quarantine measures that he said would damage the economy. But fast forward three months and that pressure from the top seems to have filtered down. With millions of people struggling and out of work, there is a desire to return to some kind of normality. But it feels like a dangerous plan - Brazil has not yet reached its peak. As there was no national lockdown, states and cities adopted their own measures. After months of restrictions, some are slowly being lifted, even though the infection level remains high. There is still concern that the health system will be unable to cope in some places, and that the disease is spreading faster in deprived neighbourhoods and remote areas, such as indigenous communities, where access to adequate care is difficult. This video can not be played Ordinary people in Brazil are taking on extraordinary roles to help their cities cope At the same time, there is a widespread wish to restart the economy as analysts forecast a contraction between 6% and 8% this year with millions of jobs lost. The government has introduced temporary payments to help people affected by the pandemic but large numbers are expected to be thrown into poverty. On Friday, Brazil's health ministry confirmed a total of 1,032,913 cases. It said that the large spike in the number of infections was due, in part, to several states having trouble with reporting data on Thursday. The US has the world's highest numbers of cases - more than 2.2 million - and nearly 119,000 deaths, according to Johns Hopkins University, which is tracking the disease globally. LETTER FROM BRAZIL:How pandemic turned political AT THE HEART OF AMAZON:Disease meets deforestation REALITY CHECK:The crisis in Latin America in numbers RECOVERY:How long does it take to get better? The coronavirus has become a highly political issue in Brazil. Experts say the president's refusal to follow scientific advice - including those set by the WHO, such as social distancing - is partially responsible for the severity of the crisis. At the start, Mr Bolsonaro repeatedly said the risk posed by the virus had been exaggerated, and even joined some anti-lockdown rallies organised by his supporters, undermining the message of his own health ministry against crowds. Mr Bolsonaro has accused state governors of using the issue for political gain as many who have taken stricter measures oppose his government. JoÃ£o Doria, governor of Brazil's richest state SÃ£o Paulo and an ally-turned-rival, has previously described the president's views on tackling the disease as ""Bolsonarovirus"". Jair Bolsonaro originally said the risk of coronavirus was exaggerated The president has also strongly supported the use of hydroxychloroquine for the treatment of patients, a drug the WHO says does not reduce death rates. After two health ministers quit, the government's response is now being led by an army general who has no experience in public health. Meanwhile, Mr Bolsonaro and his allies have turned against the media, claiming an excessive focus on the number of victims.The health ministry removed data about the virus from a government websiteearlier this month, but was forced to reverse the decision after a Supreme Court order and accusations of trying to manipulate the figures. Amid the pandemic,Mr Bolsonaro is facing a growing political crisis. He is under investigation for allegedly trying to interfere with the police for political motives, which he denies, while the Supreme Court is carrying out two separate inquiries into his allies.

This video can not be played Campaigners say a four-day week would improve people's mental health and wellbeing A group of MPs wants UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak to consider a
four-day working week to aid recovery from the coronavirus crisis. Backed by campaigners and the Communication Workers Union,
Labour's former shadow chancellor John McDonnell, the SNP's Mhairi Black and Green
MP Caroline Lucas want a commission to be set up to mirror one established in
Scotland. They say the shorter week would improve mental health and
wellbeing and boost the economy, democracy and the environment. ""It's in no-one's interests to return back to the pressure
and stress that people were under before this pandemic,"" they wrote in a
letter to the chancellor. New Zealand has already floated the idea of a four-day week to
aid the economy. The 4 Day Week Campaign group says shorter working hours is a ""credible and historic solution"" to mass unemployment. It wrote in a tweet: ""Work can be fairly distributed through shortening hours. It happened during the Great Depression [and] led to the normalisation of the [eight-hour] day."" The R rate, or reproduction rate, for Covid-19 has jumped to 1.79 in Germany, the Robert Koch Institute (RKI) for public health has said. The rate, published in RKI's daily situation report, compares with a value of 1.06 on Friday. The R number is the number of people that one infected person will pass the virus on to, on average. An R value of less than 1 is needed to gradually contain the disease. Butthe RKI report,externalpoints out that the value ""reacts sensitively to short-term changes in case numbers, such as those caused by individual outbreaks"". ""This can lead to relatively large fluctuations, especially if the total number of new cases is small,"" it says. Read moreabout the R rate here.  Chile is one of Latin America's worst-hit countries Chile has announced it will add 3,069 deaths to the country's coronavirus death toll under a new counting methodology. The country is one of the worst-hit in Latin America with nearly 237,000 confirmed cases. The revised number means the death toll will pass 7,000. The new methodology will also include probable deaths, or those which have not been confirmed by lab tests, said Rafael Araos, chief epidemiologist at the health ministry. This comes a week after Jaime Manalich was replaced as health minister amid a controversy over the official figures. Infections are on the rise in Chile and the centre-right government of President SebastiÃ¡n PiÃ±era has extended for 90 days a state of catastrophe, which gives the authorities extraordinary powers to restrict freedom of movement among other measures. A total lockdown has been imposed on the capital, Santiago, where soldiers have been deployed to enforce the restrictions.

Lee Longlands built its flagship store on Birmingham's Broad Street in 1932 After almost 120 years of business, a historic family-run furniture company hasgone into
administration due to the coronavirus crisis. Lee Longlands was established in 1902 and opened its flagship store in Birmingham 30 years later. The art-deco Birmingham shop was used to store food rations during World War Two, and the company also contributed to the war effort by producing ""blackout fabric"" to cover windows, making it harder for enemy bombers to identify targets. The firm, a household name across the Midlands, said it has been forced into administration as a result of ""the devastating impact of the coronavirus lockdown"".

Britain is to be included in a list of nations from which people can enter the country freely, the Spanish government has confirmed to the BBC. Spain's Foreign Minister Arancha GonzÃ¡lez Laya says the decision has been made ""out of respect"" for the 400,000 Brits who have second homes in Spain. She said discussions were continuing with the UK government about exempting Spanish visitors from quarantine rules in the UK. The current rules state that anyone returning to - or entering - the UK still has to self-isolate for 14 days. It is understood the UK's quarantine restrictions will be reviewed on 29 June.

Lynsey, from Surrey, has lost her job during the lockdown ""Working in the events industry, there's not a glimmer of when that's going to get up and running again. It's a big black hole."" Lynsey is one of the many young people in the UK to have lost their jobs during lockdown. Some people, like her, have been helped financially by anti-poverty charity Turn2Us. It has told the BBC the amount it has paid out in grants to those aged under 31 has ballooned in recent months as the economic effects of lockdown has hit young workers. We've been hearing some of their storiesand finding out why experts are warning of a ""poverty trap"" ahead. Victoria GillScience reporter The science of social distancing is pretty straightforward - the further away you are, the lower the risk. So two metres IS safer than one. The virus is transmitted through droplets from coughing, sneezing or even speaking - so the further back you stand, the more likely those droplets will have fallen to the ground before they can reach you. Based on that, the government's scientific advisers say that being one metre apart carries up to 10 times the risk of being two metres apart. But, with background infection levels now much lower, the chances of a face-to-face encounter with someone who has the virus are small. And other measures - ones that many shops and restaurants could operate with - reduce the risk, too. Limiting thetimepeople spend face to face, being outside, screens, even keeping noise levels low, so no-one has to shout - all these things help prevent droplets passing from person to person. But while coronavirus is still around, we will all have to factor it into the choices we make because there is no such thing as zero risk. Not too close: children may have to stand back from Santa for photos this year Well, it may be June but we all know that Christmas planning starts early if you want to get tickets booked to your favourite Santa experience or pantomime. We've seen Easter parties and summer festivals cancelled thanks to the coronavirus pandemic - butwill Christmas outings suffer the same fate, asks our colleague Emma Kasprzak. While many events have started taking bookings, it remains to be seen whether or not they will go ahead if social distancing remains in place or the virus has a second peak. On Friday, Delhi recorded the biggest daily increase in cases since the pandemic began Only hours after it was announced, Delhi has reversed a decision which would have seen anyone infected with Covid-19, and who did not need to go to hospital, quarantined in official premises. There were fears that people might avoid getting tested if they thought they might be sent to an institution for five days of quarantine. There were also concerns the policy could put strain on already stretched resources. The quarantine rule was first announced by Delhiâs Disaster Management Authority (DDMA) after a record spike in infections on Friday. The Lieutenant Governor of Delhi, Anil Baijal, said the lack of monitoring of those in home quarantine was proving problematic. But the state government  criticised the move, calling it ""arbitrary"" and touting the success of its home-quarantine programme. Delhi's  cases jumped by 3,137 to 53,116 on Friday, the biggest daily increase since the pandemic began. More than 3,000 workers at the GÃ¼tersloh plant have been tested so far Over the last few days we have been coveringan outbreak of coronavirus at a slaughterhouse in north-west Germany. Now local officials say more than 1,000 workers there have tested positive. The number of confirmed cases linked to the factory rose by 226 from 803 on Saturday, regional official Sven-Georg Adenauer told German media. ""We have no significant introduction of coronavirus into the general population,"" the official said, as reported by Germany's dpa news agency. Operations at the TÃ¶nnies meat processing plant in North Rhine-Westphalia have been suspended since Wednesday afternoon. A quarantine order has been issued for all 6,500 workers and managers at the plant. About half of those employees have been tested so far. In response to the outbreak, local authorities have suspended schools and childcare centres in the region until the end of the month. Chancellor Angela Merkel said she ""welcomed"" the measures to prevent the further spread of the virus in the area. This video can not be played UK Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the outcome of a review into the two-metre social distancing rule would be announced this week. He added that he was ""very understanding"" of the calls for action on the rule ""particularly for our hospitality industry"". Lockdown restrictions have gradually been lifted in France An outdoor music festival and the reopening of cinemas are the latest entertainment activities to excite France, as the country makes the most of summer amid a phased easing of Covid-19 restrictions. France's annual Festival of Music will go ahead on Sunday, albeit in a scaled-back form. Usually, millions of people take to the streets across the country to play and listen to music outside in public spaces and parks. French electronic music legend Jean-Michel Jarre has been billed as one of the highlights of the festival. His gig has been described as the world's first live virtual ""avatar"" concert. Then, at the stroke of midnight on Sunday, cinemas will be allowed to start screening films again. Cinema-goers are required to wear masks in theatres, and screening rooms can never be more than half full, authorities said. Still, excitement is building for the return of the silver screen in France, a cinema-obsessed nation.

Top US prosecutor blocks attempt to oust him,"Top US prosecutor Geoffrey Berman said he has ""no intention of resigning"" A top federal prosecutor has issued a statement saying he has not resigned, despite the US justice department announcing he was stepping down. Geoffrey Berman, the US Attorney in Manhattan, said he learned he was ""stepping down"" in a press release issued by US Attorney-General William Barr on Friday evening. Mr Barr gave no reason for the move. He said Securities and Exchange Commission chairman Jay Clayton would be nominated to succeed Mr Berman. Mr Berman has overseen the prosecution of a number of US President Donald Trump's associates since he took office in 2018. They include President Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen, who has served a prison sentence for lying to Congress, the US legislature, and election campaign finance fraud. Mr Berman's department has also been investigating the conduct of Rudy Giuliani, Mr Trump's current personal lawyer. He is also leading the investigation into Jeffrey Epstein and who earlier this monthaccused Prince Andrew of ""shutting the door"" on his probe. In his statement, Mr Berman said had ""no intention of resigning"", adding he would only step down when a successor had been confirmed by Congress. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Berman was appointed to his position by a court, making it unclear whether President Trump has the legal authority to remove him, BBC North America correspondent Anthony Zurcher says. Senior Democrats have accused Mr Barr of politicising the US Justice Department and making legal decisions at the behest of President Trump. The row comes days after former National Security Adviser John Bolton said in a book that President Trump had pressed Mr Berman's office to halt an investigation into the Turkish Halkbank in a bid to make a deal with Turkey's president. The ten biggest claims in John Bolton's book In his statement,external, Mr Barr - a close ally of the president - said Mr Berman was ""stepping down"" after two-and-a-half years in the post. Mr Barr said Mr Berman had ""done an excellent job"", achieving ""many successes on consequential civil and criminal matters"", but gave no explanation for his resignation. Mr Trump intended to nominate Mr Clayton, a man who has never served as a federal prosecutor, as Mr Berman's successor, Mr Barr said. Mr Berman said he would only step aside when a replacement had been appointed by the Senate Mr Clayton's ""management experience and expertise in financial regulation give him an ideal background"" to lead the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District of New York, Mr Barr said. The US attorney in New Jersey, Craig Carpenito, will serve as acting head of the office until Mr Clayton has been confirmed. In his statement, Mr Berman said: ""I learned in a press release from the Attorney General tonight that I was 'stepping down' as United States Attorney. I have not resigned, and have no intention of resigning, my position."" He said judges for the Southern District of New York appointed him to the role, and would only step down when a presidentially appointed nominee was confirmed by the Senate. Mr Berman added: ""Until then, our investigations will move forward without delay or interruption. I cherish every day that I work with the men and women of this office to pursue justice without fear or favour - and intend to ensure that this office's important cases continue unimpeded."" Mr Berman, 60, was appointed in January 2018 after Mr Trump fired his predecessor, Preet Bharara, who had refused to resign. Preet Bharara, high-profile US prosecutor, says he was fired Lawmakers investigate Trump, Giuliani and Ukraine Mr Berman is a long-time Republican donor, including to Mr Trump's presidential campaign. He is reportedly investigating the business dealings of President Trump's personal lawyer, Mr Giuliani, who used to work for the same law firm as Mr Berman. Mr Berman is also the prosecutor in charge of the investigation into sex offender Jeffrey Epsteinand has previously expressed frustration over the Duke of York's role in the inquiry. Earlier this month, Mr Berman said Prince Andrew - a former friend of Epstein - had ""repeatedly declined our request"" to schedule an interview. The duke's lawyers reject claims he has not co-operated. Geoffrey Berman is not going quietly. Attorney-General Barr may have thought replacing a top US prosecutor would be a smooth process. But Mr Berman - by refusing to resign - has shown he has other ideas. Mr Berman also may have the law on his side, as this particular US attorney was appointed to his position by a court, not the president, making it unclear whether President Trump has the legal authority to remove him. A court may have to sort this out, too, creating a procedural headache the White House surely hoped to avoid. Looming over all of this is the question of why the president, and his attorney general, felt compelled to do this now, just five months before election day. The suddenness of the dismissal, coupled with the fact that Mr Berman is overseeing an investigation into the president's personal lawyer, Mr Giuliani, amid other corruption inquiries are already prompting accusations of impropriety. In the months since being acquitted in his impeachment trial, Trump has removed a number of government officials for apparently insufficient loyalty. Mr Berman may be the latest target - albeit a stubborn one. Read more from Anthony:Four reasons why this was a bad week for Trump Writing on Twitter, Mr Bharara, said that the timing and manner of the move to replace Mr Berman was strange. ""Why does a president get rid of his own hand-picked US Attorney in SDNY (Southern District of New York) on a Friday night, less than five months before the election?"" Mr Bharara said. Democrat Jerry Nadler, the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Chairman, said he was not surprised by the move, accusing Mr Barr of repeatedly interfering in ""criminal investigations on Trump's behalf"". ""We have a hearing on this topic on Wednesday,"" said Mr Nadler. ""We welcome Mr Berman's testimony and will invite him to testify."" Allow Twitter content?

Zoe KleinmanTechnology reporter, BBC News A Covid-19 tracing software tool has appeared in the settings of both Android phones and iPhones as part of an update of their operating systems. The ""exposure notification"" tool is switched off by default, and is not a tracing app itself. It enables an app to run in the background while still using Bluetooth. This lets the app measure the distance between two handsets - and then alert the phone owner if someone near them later tests positive for Covid-19. In the UK there is currently no available contact-tracing app. The update has caused some confusion, with people querying the new addition to their handsets on social media. ""This is not a new app but is an extra element added to the phones' operating systems to enable approved developers to build apps that can potentially warn of proximity to infected individuals,"" said computer scientist Prof Alan Woodward, of Surrey University.

Mr Anderson, who now works in South St Andrew Street as a communications consultant, says the centre of Edinburgh is not the place he once governed. Read more here. Allow Twitter content?

The Scottish FA has written to Heart of Midlothian and Partick Thistle to ask why they have opted to take legal action against their respective relegations. The two clubs filed a petition at the Court of Session on Wednesday after the Scottish Professional Football League ended the season early because of the Covid-19 pandemic. In that, they have asked for a judge to scrap promotions and relegations throughout all four of Scotland's divisions. That sparked a robust response from Dundee United, Raith Rovers and Cove Rangers, who would stay down despite being named champions. In a joint statement, the ""extremely unhappy"" trio say that could ""potentially have catastrophic financial implications"" not just for them, but for each of the SPFL's 42 clubs and confirm they have instructed lawyers to act for them.

Construction safety is 'broken' say fire chiefs,"Some construction firms still canât be trusted to make buildings that are safe from fire, the National Fire Chiefs Council (NFCC) has warned. Its safety head Nick Coombe said some building firms had barely improved since the Grenfell disaster in 2017. The Federation of Master Builders, which represents small contractors, said it was trying to create a safer industry, with licensed firms. Build UK, which represents the wider industry, declined to comment. The National Fire Chiefs Council said the construction industry was âbrokenâ and couldnât be trusted to follow rules. Grenfell fears prevent timber building boom Mr Coombe said many reforms were needed, especially to building regulations, which allow builders to choose an inspector to certify their building safety. The current inspection system was devised by the government in the 1980s to speed up the timetable for buildings. Ministers were concerned that local council inspectors were delaying projects, so they allowed private inspectors to compete on speed of approval and cost. Tower block ""free-for-all"" The builder effectively employs the safety inspector: critics say itâs like students choosing who theyâll pay to mark their exams â except peopleâs lives are risk. Mr Coombe said: âThis doesn't drive standards up. It means the developer controls the amount of visits from a building inspector. We have had people shopping around for building controllers who would accept their work. âIf you build a house extension the local authority are all over you. If you build a tower block or a shopping centre thereâs a free-for-all.â Mr Coombeâs comments amplify a recent NFCC submission to a post-Grenfell review of building regulations. In that document the fire council warn: âIt is our opinion that some within the wider industry are not acting responsibly when designing and approving buildings. âBanning things [such as flammable cladding] is no guarantee that people will follow the rules, and it is our view that much of the combustible cladding on the side of buildings is already banned under the current regime. âTo date, there is little evidence of a culture change [since Grenfell]. There is much more to be done to ensure the safety of building occupants, now and in the future. âNFCC advocates that the current building control system is overhauled to ensure that it is robust, independent of client and market influence, and has sufficient teeth to enforce appropriate fire safety standards as necessary.â Safety disagreements The response to the horrific Grenfell fire has had some side-effects. Some building firms report huge delays to construction, while developers, architects and builders argue over liability for safety. The Grenfell effect has also deterred architects from designing buildings with wood in the wall construction. Governments in the USA, Canada and Europe are promoting the use of timber in buildings to help combat climate change, because it locks in CO2 that trees have taken from the atmosphere. The USA, for instance, has certified 17-storey wood framed buildings after extensive fire testing. Meanwhile in the UK the government proposes that the maximum height of buildings with wood in the walls to be no more than four storeys. Fires tests needed Mr Coombe said the NFCC didnât want to block the use of wood in buildings, but insisted that fire safety tests should be done in the UK to prove the safety of design. A government spokesperson said: âThe Grenfell Tower fire was a devastating tragedy and we are as determined as ever to ensure this can never happen again. âSafety is paramount â thatâs why weâve announced the biggest changes to building safety in a generation which will deliver meaningful and lasting change for residents. âWe are carefully considering the responses to our consultation and will respond in due course.â Brian Berry from the Federation of Master Builders said: âOur members, the vast majority of whom work in domestic repair and maintenance or are small house builders, know that quality and safety must be at the heart of building projects. âWe are leading moves to create a more professionalised industry and advocate licensing of all UK construction companies.â BuildUK has a very broad membership across the industry and on some issues its members find it difficult to reach a consensus.
