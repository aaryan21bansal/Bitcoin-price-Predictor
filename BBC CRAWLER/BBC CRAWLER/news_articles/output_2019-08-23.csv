France threatens to block trade over Amazon fires,"This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land France and Ireland say they will not ratify a huge trade deal with South American nations unless Brazil does more to fight fires in the Amazon. French leader Emmanuel Macron said President Jair Bolsonaro had lied to him about his stance on climate change. Tens of thousands of fires have burned across a wide area of the Amazon rainforest this year. Environmental groups say the fires are linked to Mr Bolsonaro's policies, which he denies. European leaders have also expressed dismay over the fires. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson called the fires ""not only heartbreaking"" but ""an international crisis"". ""We stand ready to provide whatever help we can to bring them under control and help protect one of Earth's greatest wonders,"" he added. German Chancellor Angela Merkel has called the fire an ""acute emergency... shocking and threatening not only for Brazil and the other affected countries, but also for the whole world"". Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? What is the 'historic' EU-Mercosur trade deal? Mr Bolsonaro said on Friday that he was considering options for fighting the fires, including deploying the military. However, he has also accused Mr Macron of meddling for ""political gain"", and previously said calls to discuss the fires at this weekend's G7 summit in Biarritz, France - which Brazil is not participating in - showed ""a misplaced colonialist mindset"". Very -the EU-Mercosur trade dealhas been described as the EU's biggest deal to date. It took 20 years of negotiations to strike the agreement with the South American bloc, consisting of Argentina, Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay. The EU is Mercosur's second biggest partner in trade in goods, accounting for 20.1% of the total in 2018. By contrast, EU exports to Mercosur accounted for 2.3% of the EU's total exports in 2018. The trade includes food and beverages, tobacco and farm products from the South American side and machinery, chemicals and pharmaceutical products from the EU. On Friday, Mr Bolsonaro appeared to strike a defiant tone, saying on Twitter that Mercosur had reached a trade deal with Efta - a European free trade group of Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein. Analysis by Daniel Gallas, BBC News, SÃ£o Paulo Mr Bolsonaro is often called the ""Trump of the Tropics"" because of his unpredictable and brash manners. So it is anyone's guess whether he will back down or carry on with this stance. Back in June, he hailed the Mercosur-EU trade deal as ""historic"" and ""one of the most important trade deals of all time"". Now his own words and actions are threatening the deal - which still needs to be approved by parliaments of all Mercosur and EU countries. The deal explicitly says countries have to commit to tackling climate change. Mr Bolsonaro's son - who wants to become Brazil's ambassador in Washington - retweeted a video calling Mr Macron an idiot. But even Mr Bolsonaro's agriculture minister and the country's farmers associations have suggested there needs to be a change of tone from the president. Meanwhile, Finland's finance minister has called on the EU to consider banning Brazilian beef imports. Finland is currently president of the Council of the EU - a role which is rotated among member states every six months. Protesters outside the Brazilian embassy in London Environmental groups have called for protests in cities across Brazil on Friday to demand action to combat the fires. Hundreds of protesters also gathered outside the Brazilian embassies around the world, including in London, Berlin, Mumbai and Paris. ""We can't stand around waiting for the sky to turn black all the way here in London too,"" protester Laura Villares House, 33, told BBC Brasil.

Amazon: Lungs of the planet Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) has shownan increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil,external, most of them in the Amazon region. This is the highest number of fires since 2010, though some way off the record in 2005. Mr Bolsonaro has brushed off the latest data, arguing that it was the season of the ""queimada"", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting. However, Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. Conservationists say Mr Bolsonaro has encouraged loggers and farmers to clear the land. During his campaign, he pledged to limit fines for damaging the rainforest and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency. Mr Bolsonaro has suggested that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) started the fires, but admitted he had no evidence for this claim. In comments on Thursday, he acknowledged that farmers might be involved in setting fires in the region, according to Reuters news agency.

Brazil sends army to tackle Amazon fires,"This video can not be played Worldwide protests over Brazilian government inaction on Amazon fires Brazil's leader has ordered the armed forces to fight forest fires in the Amazon, amid international outrage over rising deforestation. President Jair Bolsonaro deployed soldiers in nature reserves, indigenous lands and border areas beset by fires. The move is an apparent reversal from Mr Bolsonaro, who has been accused of emboldening miners and loggers. Other countries had threatened to target Brazil's economy if the nation did not act to stop the fires. France and Ireland have said they will not ratify a large trade deal with South American nations and Finland's finance minister has called on the EU to consider banning Brazilian beef imports. In a televised address to the nation on Friday, Mr Bolsonaro said forest fires ""exist in the whole world"" and ""cannot serve as a pretext for possible international sanctions"". Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? What is the 'historic' EU-Mercosur trade deal? Many of the fires are thought to have been started deliberately, with suspicion falling on farmers who may benefit by having more available land. Mr Bolsonaro has scorned environmental activists and declared staunch support for the clearing of areas of the Amazon for agriculture and mining. Experts and campaigners say his administration has given a green light to rainforest destruction. Environmental groups held protests in cities across Brazil on Friday to demand action to combat the fires, and protesters gathered outside the Brazilian embassies around the world. This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It is known as the ""lungs of the world"" and is home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. In his televised address, Mr Bolsonaro confirmed that he had authorised the armed forces to help fight the fires. ""I've learned as a military man to love the Amazon forest and I want to help protect it,"" he said. The decree itself was fairly vague in its wording, but specified that the military would be deployed to nature reserves, indigenous lands and border areas in the region. This video can not be played One campaigner called the forest fires a ""vicious cycle"" The deployment of soldiers would be left down to regional governors who can request ""preventive action... against environmental crimes"" and ask the army to ""survey and combat fire outbreaks"", it said. Defence Minister Fernando Azevedo e Silva said in a press conference on Saturday that 700 members of the armed forces would initially be sent to the Amazon region. Up to 28bn Brazilian reais ($6.8bn; Â£5.5bn) would be made available to put out the fires, he said. Mr Bolsonaro has faced deepening international criticism for his handling of the fires. German Chancellor Angela Merkel, French President Emmanuel Macron and UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson have called the fires an international crisis. Ms Merkel called it an ""acute emergency"" and Mr Macron tweeted: ""Our house is burning."" Both said the issue must be discussed at this weekend's G7 summit in Biarritz. Amazon: Lungs of the planet Speaking in Biarritz on Saturday, European Council President Donald Tusk said the EU ""stands by the EU-Mercosur agreement but it is hard to imagine a process of ratification as long as the Brazilian government allows for the destruction"" of the Amazon. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres said on Thursday: ""In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity. The Amazon must be protected."" US President Donald Trump said that he spoke to President Bolsonaro on Friday evening. ""I told him if the United States can help with the Amazon Rainforest fires, we stand ready to assist!"" Mr Trump tweeted. Brazil's president has hit back at criticism and accused leaders such as Mr Macron of meddling for ""political gain"". Earlier this week, he even suggested that non-governmental organisations had started fires in the rainforest - despite admitting he had no evidence for this claim. This video can not be played President Bolsonaro accuses NGOs of starting Amazon wildfires In his Friday television address, Mr Bolsonaro criticised those spreading ""baseless information"" about Brazil's commitment to preservation, insisting the country had ""modern legislation"" to protect most of its forest. ""We need to bear in mind that more than 20 million Brazilians live in that region,"" he said. ""We need to give opportunity for development. It's not only about protection."" He also described the wildfires as within an ""average"" range for the past 15 years. ""We are in a traditionally hot and dry season, with high winds, when every year we have wildfires,"" he said. ""In hotter years, wildfires are more common.""

Johnson and Trump speak ahead of G7 meeting,"Mr Johnson will meet Mr Trump for one-on-one talks on Sunday The UK will not ""retreat"" from the international community as it leaves the EU, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister was speaking ahead of this weekend's G7 in France, his first international summit as leader. There Mr Johnson will discuss his plans for Brexit with European Council President Donald Tusk and hold trade talks with US President Donald Trump. On Friday, he and Mr Trump spoke by phone and discussed ""foreign policy issues and global trade"". The G7 meeting in Biarritz - a get together of most of the leaders of the world's largest economies - comes with just over two months until the UK is scheduled to leave the EU on 31 October. Mr Johnson will meet Mr Tusk on Sunday in their first face-to-face meeting and spell out his absolute commitment to getting the UK out of the EU by that date. Ahead of the summit he insisted the UK would be an ""energetic partner"" on the world stage after Brexit. Mr Johnson said: ""Some people question the democratic decision this country has made, fearing that we will retreat from the world. Some think Britain's best days are behind us. ""To those people I say: you are gravely mistaken."" His comments come after French President Emmanuel Macron suggested a post-Brexit trade deal with the US could see Britain as a ""junior partner"" in a position of ""historic vassalisation"". What is the G7 and what does it do? Trump-Johnson relationship 'will be sensational' Mr Trump, who hasconsistently praised Mr Johnson, has predicted a speedy US-UK trade deal after Brexit. But the British side is adamant it wants to secure the right deal rather than a quick agreement. In any future trade deal, the UK wants protections for the NHS and animal welfare standards, but also wants to cover issues such as opening up agricultural markets, services and public procurement. A UK government spokesman said: ""Of course we want to move quickly, but we want to get the right deal that works for both sides."" A No 10 spokesman said Mr Johnson and Mr Trump ""looked forward to speaking further"" during one-on-one talks on the sidelines of the summit on Sunday morning. Mr Johnson met with Mr Macron at the Elysee Presidential Palace this week The G7 summit follows a hectic week of diplomacy for Mr Johnson,who visited Paris and Berlinin an effort to persuade the EU to amend the withdrawal agreement it reached with his predecessor Theresa May. The prime minister wants to renegotiate the Irish backstop - a key Brexit sticking point which is part of the agreement and aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit. The EU has consistently ruled this out. If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some rules of the EU single market, should the UK and the EU not agree a trade deal after Brexit. Mr Johnson previously said that would mean ""signing away"" the UK's ""economic independence"". Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? At a news conference on Wednesday with Mr Johnson,German Chancellor Angela Merkel suggested an alternative to the backstop might be achievable, adding that the onus was on the UKto find a workable plan. But the next day Mr Macron said it was""indispensable"" to preserving political stability and the single market. After visiting his counterparts, Mr Johnson said there was ""new mood music"", butreaching a new dealwould not be ""a cinch"". He has insisted the UK will leave the EU by the end of October, whether or not a new deal is reached. Meanwhile, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn accused the prime minister of putting the UK at ""the mercy"" of a US administration that ""threatens peace, prosperity and the future of our planet"". He also accused G7 governments of being key drivers of global inequality and called for them to do more to tackle climate change and reduce inequality. ""The UK should use its position in the G7, on the UN Security Council and the international financial institutions to promote policies to tackle the climate emergency and that are proven to reduce inequality and improve lives around the world, including universal healthcare, education and social security,"" he said. ""Instead, this weekend we'll see the ugly spectacle of our prime minister pursuing his Trump-first policy, putting us at the mercy of a US administration that threatens peace, prosperity and the future of our planet."" The G7 summit, which comprises the UK, Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan and the United States, runs from Saturday to Monday. Issues on the agenda include the global economy, tackling inequality and responding to the challenges of the digital age and the rise of artificial intelligence. On Friday, Mr Macron - who is hosting the summit - and Mrs Merkelsaid the ongoing firesin Brazil's Amazon rainforest must be discussed among the G7 leaders this weekend.

"Johnson: New Brexit deal won't be a cinchPM says progress is being made, but people ""shouldn't hold their breath"" over a breakthrough with the EU.","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""This is not going to be easy."" Boris Johnson has said it will not be ""a cinch"" to persuade the EU to change its Brexit deal with the UK. Speaking in Devon, the prime minister said the government was ""making progress"", but would ""have to prepare to come out without an agreement"". Mr Johnson wants to renegotiate the backstop - which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - but the EU has ruled this out. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator said it will analyse ""realistic"" proposals. Mr Johnson insists the backstop - part of the withdrawal agreement reached by his predecessor Theresa May and the EU, but not ratified by Parliament - must be ditched if a new deal with Brussels is to be reached before then. On Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkelsaidthe onus was on the UK to find a workable alternative plan. Backstop indispensable, Macron tells Johnson Did Boris Johnson put his foot in it in France? Brexit, the border and 'alternative arrangements' During a visit to Torbay Hospital, Mr Johnson, who held talks in Berlin and Paris earlier this week, said: ""It was interesting that there a was a lot of new mood music... from our friends and partners."" He added: ""They can see that we want a deal. They can see the problems with the backstop."" But the prime minister also said: ""This is not going to be a cinch. This is not going to be easy. We will have to work very hard to get this done... ""I'm afraid we will have to prepare to come out without an agreement. We can do that. We are very confident."" Michel Barniersaid in a tweet,externalthat the withdrawal agreement was ""the best deal possible, based on UK red lines"". He added: ""We are ready to analyse UK proposals that are realistic, operational & compatible with our principles. EU wants an orderly withdrawal but is ready for any outcome."" The message followed a meeting on Friday in The Hague with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some of the EU's single market rules, if the UK and the EU do not agree a trade deal after Brexit. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Mr Johnson argues that the backstop could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, contrary to the result of the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of voters opted to leave. But the EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mrs May, including the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Speaking as he met Mr Johnson on Wednesday in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macronsaidhe was ""very confident"" the UK and EU would be able to find a solution within 30 days - a timetable suggested by Mrs Merkel - ""if there is a good will on both sides"". But, were any new agreement reached, it would not be ""very different from the existing one"", he added, given the timescale. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is meeting the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party next week to discuss ways of avoiding a no-deal Brexit. Hehas proposedthat MPs should help him defeat the government in a no-confidence motion and install him as a caretaker prime minister. If he wins the vote, he plans to delay Brexit, call a snap election and campaign for another referendum. While on a visit to Swansea on Friday, Mr Corbyn said: ""We'll be discussing all the options. We will obviously discuss a legislation option [to prevent a no-deal Brexit] as well as a motion of no confidence. ""They're not mutually exclusive things to do. They are both possibilities and both things we'll be discussing."" On Saturday, Mr Johnson will attend the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, alongside other leaders including US President Donald Trump.

Billionaire Republican donor David Koch dies,"Billionaire David Koch, a major donor to the Republican party, has died aged 79. He had been suffering from cancer. The former majority owner of Koch Industries was ranked by Forbes, jointly with brother Charles, as the 11th richest person in the world. Koch wielded huge political influence, bankrolling conservative causes for small government, low regulation and climate change scepticism. He was also a major donor to medical research, education and the arts. The brothers' political network funnelled hundreds of millions of dollars to Republican candidate Mitt Romney's failed presidential bid in 2012, only to fall out with President Donald Trump over his immigration policy and tariffs. 'Blood and money': The story of the Koch brothers In 2018 Koch stepped down from Koch Industries - which refines crude oil, produces fertiliser, and manufactures household products - citing his declining health. He had been a philanthropist to the arts, especially ballet, and donated to New York's Lincoln Center and Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center hospital. He ran for vice-president as a Libertarian in 1980, calling for the abolishment of many federal government agencies. According to Forbes, he is estimated to be worth $42.4bn (Â£34.7bn). The Koch brothers are despised among liberal Americans The news of his death was confirmed in a statement from Charles Koch, who said that his brother was first diagnosed with prostate cancer 27 years ago and given only a few years to live. ""David liked to say that a combination of brilliant doctors, state-of-the-art medications and his own stubbornness kept the cancer at bay,"" Charles Koch wrote, adding that in those years he married his wife Julia Flesher and had three children. He also described David as having a ""giant personality and passion for life"" and noted his ""institution changing philanthropic commitments to hospitals, cancer research, education and the arts"". Analysis by Tara McKelvey, White House reporter David Koch, who was born in Wichita, once said: ""Hell, everybody from Kansas is a Republican."" In fact, there are plenty of Democrats in Kansas. But he was right about this - conservatism permeates the state. Kansas is a place where people believe in the individual spirit, free trade and free markets - and like to rail against Washington. A libertarian, Koch fostered his economic ideas on a national level through organisations such as Americans for Prosperity, a right-wing advocacy group. Over several decades, he helped to reshape conservatism in the US, pushing the Republican party to the right and inspiring leaders of the Tea Party movement who eventually helped to elect Trump. A wealthy man who invested in both science (a dinosaur gallery at the American Museum of Natural History is named after him) and in libertarian, Kansas-bred economic ideas, Koch has had a profound impact on conservative thought in this country. The company founded by Charles and David Koch - the second largest privately owned business in the US - has interests ranging from pipelines to paper towels. According to the Koch Industries website, they have more than 120,000 employees between all their businesses and subsidiaries. They have previously put money into groups denying climate change and attacking unions and workers' rights. The brothers' political clout made them bogeymen for many on the political left. But the Kochs have also pushed for criminal justice reform and made large donations to the American Civil Liberties Union.

British man dies in 'noise row' Thai hotel fight,"Amitpal Singh Bajaj and his wife Bandhna had been staying at the five-star Centara Grand Hotel A British man died in a fight at a Thai hotel after telling another guest to keep the noise down as his wife and son tried to sleep, his family said. Amitpal Singh Bajaj, 34, from London, complained about noise from the next room at the five-star Centara Grand Hotel in Phuket. His family claims a man forced his way into their room via the balcony early on Wednesday and strangled Mr Bajaj. His wife said her husband ""sacrificed his life"" to save her and their son. The Foreign Office confirmed it was assisting a family in the area. In a statement Mr Bajaj's wife Bandhna Kaur Bajaj said: ""My husband sacrificed his life to save my son's life and mine. He will always be our hero."" Mrs Bajaj, also 34, told how the attacker ""barged"" into their room naked and ""just started charging at my husband"". ""My husband tried to block the man and move me and my son away. As the man was kicking, punching and just, beating him up, my husband told me to please leave and save our son,"" she said. Mrs Bajaj, from Southall, said she grabbed the couple's two-year-old son Veer Singh and fled the hotel room to look for help. She ran down a staircase and hid under a tree with her son in her arms while calling the reception from her mobile to tell them what had happened. She said: ""I asked the reception to please make sure someone attends to my husband - 'please give him some medical help, I'm very scared, I've escaped'. ""I could still hear [the attacker] screaming. I didn't want to be attacked."" An ambulance and police then arrived at the hotel, in the Karon part of the city, and took Mr Amitpal to Patong Hospital where he was confirmed dead. The Norwegian Foreign Ministry confirmed that a Norwegian citizen has been arrested in Thailand and is being provided consular assistance.

"Johnson: New Brexit deal won't be a cinchPM says progress is being made, but people ""shouldn't hold their breath"" over a breakthrough with the EU.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""This is not going to be easy."" Boris Johnson has said it will not be ""a cinch"" to persuade the EU to change its Brexit deal with the UK. Speaking in Devon, the prime minister said the government was ""making progress"", but would ""have to prepare to come out without an agreement"". Mr Johnson wants to renegotiate the backstop - which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - but the EU has ruled this out. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator said it will analyse ""realistic"" proposals. Mr Johnson insists the backstop - part of the withdrawal agreement reached by his predecessor Theresa May and the EU, but not ratified by Parliament - must be ditched if a new deal with Brussels is to be reached before then. On Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkelsaidthe onus was on the UK to find a workable alternative plan. Backstop indispensable, Macron tells Johnson Did Boris Johnson put his foot in it in France? Brexit, the border and 'alternative arrangements' During a visit to Torbay Hospital, Mr Johnson, who held talks in Berlin and Paris earlier this week, said: ""It was interesting that there a was a lot of new mood music... from our friends and partners."" He added: ""They can see that we want a deal. They can see the problems with the backstop."" But the prime minister also said: ""This is not going to be a cinch. This is not going to be easy. We will have to work very hard to get this done... ""I'm afraid we will have to prepare to come out without an agreement. We can do that. We are very confident."" Michel Barniersaid in a tweet,externalthat the withdrawal agreement was ""the best deal possible, based on UK red lines"". He added: ""We are ready to analyse UK proposals that are realistic, operational & compatible with our principles. EU wants an orderly withdrawal but is ready for any outcome."" The message followed a meeting on Friday in The Hague with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some of the EU's single market rules, if the UK and the EU do not agree a trade deal after Brexit. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Mr Johnson argues that the backstop could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, contrary to the result of the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of voters opted to leave. But the EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mrs May, including the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Speaking as he met Mr Johnson on Wednesday in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macronsaidhe was ""very confident"" the UK and EU would be able to find a solution within 30 days - a timetable suggested by Mrs Merkel - ""if there is a good will on both sides"". But, were any new agreement reached, it would not be ""very different from the existing one"", he added, given the timescale. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is meeting the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party next week to discuss ways of avoiding a no-deal Brexit. Hehas proposedthat MPs should help him defeat the government in a no-confidence motion and install him as a caretaker prime minister. If he wins the vote, he plans to delay Brexit, call a snap election and campaign for another referendum. While on a visit to Swansea on Friday, Mr Corbyn said: ""We'll be discussing all the options. We will obviously discuss a legislation option [to prevent a no-deal Brexit] as well as a motion of no confidence. ""They're not mutually exclusive things to do. They are both possibilities and both things we'll be discussing."" On Saturday, Mr Johnson will attend the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, alongside other leaders including US President Donald Trump.

'My teenage daughter is terrified in adult unit',"A mother has said her teenage daughter is ""terrified"" of the adult men in the secure psychiatric care unit where she is being treated. Gillian, not her real name, told the BBC her 17-year-old daughter felt sexually vulnerable and unsafe in a mixed unit with eight adult men. A tribunal heard evidence from her psychiatrist that the unit was an ""unsuitable environment"". However, there are no secure in-patient units in Scotland for adolescents. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman told BBC Scotland she had recognised the national need for secure child and adolescent mental health inpatient facilities in Scotland and a new unit was planned. Ms Freeman said it was ""very rare"" for a young person to be put in an adult unit but it was for clinicians to decide where it was safest to put them. Gillian's daughter has been in an adult Intensive Psychiatric Care Unit (IPCU) in Edinburgh for a week. IPCUs are designed to look after patients who cannot be managed on open wards due to the level of risk they pose to themselves or others. She was moved there from a Child and Adolescent Mental Health (CAMH) unit after incidents led her psychiatrist to believe she needed more secure care. But Gillian said the unit she was placed in was totally unsuitable for a vulnerable young girl. She said the men looked at her daughter in sexually inappropriate ways and followed her around the unit. Gillian said she feared for her daughter's safety Gillian said that on her first visit to the unit there was one man in his 50s flicking his tongue ""in a sexually inappropriate manner"" and another who was ""shouting aggressively"". ""I did not feel safe and I was scared and petrified for my daughter,"" she said. ""I was shaking like a leaf and I felt I was going to be sick."" She said her young daughter was feeling extremely sexually vulnerable and uncomfortable at having to share communal spaces with older men with serious mental health issues. ""My daughter told the tribunal judge she is absolutely terrified and scared men will slash her face,"" Gillian said. ""She's terrified to even eat with them."" Last year 14 young people were admitted to adult IPCUs, including five under-16s, according to watchdog the Mental Welfare Commission (MWC). It said adult psychiatric wards were unsuitable places to treat young people with mental health issues because they have to be looked after alongside adults who are themselves very unwell or high risk. However, Dr Moira Connolly, from the MWC, said the patient should stay closely linked to the staff who had supported them in the CAMH adolescent unit and a care plan should be in place. Earlier this week, a Mental Health Tribunal decided that a Compulsory Treatment Order for Gillian's daughter was correct but it heard evidence that even her own psychiatrist considered the IPCU an ""unsuitable environment"". In the weeks before her admission to the IPCU, Gillian's daughter had been in an adolescent mental health unit. Gillian said her daughter's generalised anxiety disorder had not been treated and she had entered the first stage of psychosis. She was not responding to the anti-psychotic medication and she was moved to a different drug. Although she seemed to respond better, there was an incident in the adolescent unit that led to fears for Gillian's daughter's safety and that of other patients. The 17-year-old was held in ""seclusion"" within the adolescent ward, meaning she was not allowed to leave her room and nurses were stationed by her door. After a number of days she was moved to the intensive psychiatric care unit (IPCU). Her psychiatrist told the tribunal he had been ""very reluctant to admit her to IPCU but it was less restrictive than seclusion"". He said that although the patient had responded well to treatment and change in medication, she was still not well enough to return to the CAMH adolescent ward. Gillian believes it is ""appalling"" that there are no intensive psychiatric care units in Scotland to deal with adolescents. She said she thought her daughter could have been treated at a unit within the CAMH ward, where she could have been placed until her medication had ""bedded in"". ""There is no adolescent IPCU in the whole of Scotland, it's diabolical,"" she said. Scotland has only has three specialist units for in-patient treatment for children and adolescents, with 48 beds. Health Secretary Jeane Freeman said she understood people's concern and anxiety Health Secretary Jeane Freeman told BBC Scotland she understood people's concern and anxiety at where adolescent patients were placed. She said: ""We have always said there needs to be an additional provision of secure units for children and adolescents and indeed one is being built in Ayrshire and Arran."" The new national inpatient unit is scheduled to open in 2021. Ms Freeman added: ""We are looking at what more we need to do for child and adolescent mental health across the whole spectrum from counselling to very specialist support."" Prof Alex McMahon, nurse director at NHS Lothian, said he could not comment on individual patient cases. He said: ""In psychiatric services there are occasional circumstances where due to the severity of a patient's illness, they may require a short period of more intensive care and treatment in a more controlled environment. ""Any decision would be taken following clinical assessment, to ensure the continued safety and welfare of the patient and of other patients and staff."" Prof McMahon added that any young person who is moved to an IPCU will have one-to-one intensive nursing at all times and is allocated to single bedroom accommodation.

Costa Coffee workers 'not treated like humans',"Costa Coffee workers have made numerous claims alleging poor working conditions across 29 franchise stores. The BBC has spoken to 26 employees of Costa Coffee franchise stores managed by Goldex Essex Investments Ltd and Bristal Investments Ltd. Complaints include managers' alleged refusal to pay for sickness or annual leave, working outside of contracted hours and the retention of tips. A Costa Coffee spokeswoman said an independent audit has been launched. ""Given the serious nature of the allegations, we have today informed all of our Individual Franchise Partners that we will be launching an independent audit into the legal and ethical compliance of their operations, including employment matters,"" she said on Thursday. The latest allegations surfaced after the BBC reported that staff at Costa stores, managed by Kafeel Khan's Goldex Essex Investments Ltd, were beingcharged a minimum of Â£200 for their own training. A previous complaint against the Costa franchise partner,externalby ex-employee Daniel Gyori, for withholding wages, was upheld in court in the claimant's favour. An anonymous former employee at a store under Goldex Essex Investments Ltd claims they had almost Â£1,000 of their holiday pay deducted from their salary, despite being contracted to work 48 hours a week. The employee claimed they worked, on average, 60 hours per week because of the expectation to arrive at the store at 05:30 in the morning. The employee says they had accrued the necessary days to claim annual leave - as stated in the contract seen by the BBC - but still had pay deducted. The complainant outlined a number of other working conditions that they found distressing. They say they found it ""impossible"" to find time to see their children due to the ""long hours"", and suffered a severe amount of emotional distress as a result. A franchise is a type of licence that allows a third-party partner to have access and rights to a larger business's logo, name and model, so that the partner can sell a product or provide a service under the business's name. Three Bristal Investments Ltd employees working under Emilio Aleo alleged they regularly worked 13-hour shifts with 20-minute breaks. Mr Aleo says: ""We do not obligate staff to work more than 44 hours per week without their agreement. He added that breaks ""are given in accordance with the hours worked"" and that the franchisee ""fully [complies] with [his] statutory obligations"". Another former employee at a Costa store managed by Mr Aleo's Bristal Investments Ltd claimed that gratuity money earned by staff for good customer service was used to purchase presents for Mr Aleo and his wife and co-Director Kerry Morgan. Mr Aleo says he is unaware of how tip money is spent. ""This is left to the store manager and his/her team of staff to administer. We are not aware of the quantum of any tips/gratuities enjoyed by the staff in each store,"" he said. A second employee at Mr Aleo's Costa Coffee store claimed that employees ""were not treated like human beings"" and complained of a ""complete lack of empathy and consideration of our feelings"". In an email, leaked to the BBC by a third employee, a staff member asked if she could keep her mobile phone with her to keep in contact with her father who had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. The manager refused to let the employee keep her phone, and suggested she give the Costa Coffee store number to the hospital instead. The person who leaked the emails said the affected employee was ""very upset"" and ""shocked"" because she had worked there for seven years. Mr Aleo said: ""We reject the suggestion of a lack of empathy towards staff, and could cite numerous examples of granting compassionate leave when appropriate."" Baristas and employees at managerial level have complained about the numerous deductions outlined in Costa Coffee contracts written by franchise partners. One former manager at Goldex Essex Investments lost ""Â£150 from [her] wages because [she] was five minutes late to opening the store"", she said. Other fines outlined in the contracts were for used uniform that was damaged when returned to the employer, excessive waste and till discrepancies. Contracts issued by Costa Coffee Bristal Investments Ltd include an appendix outlining deductions Seema Gill, a consultant employment solicitor at My Business Counsel says the deductions may be legally contentious. Deductions for ""maintenance and cleanliness of store equipment"" led one anonymous employee at Goldex Essex Investments Ltd to ""clean concrete posts and pull weeds out by fences next to the store"". When the BBC approached Mr Khan for comment, he said he found it ""extremely upsetting to hear the allegations about unhappy team members"". He said: ""There would be no repercussions for any employee who wanted to question their pay, holiday days etc and if a mistake had occurred we would rectify it immediately. We have recently re-communicated to staff all the ways they can contact us or raise any questions."" But he added that he could not address the problems without reviewing the evidence. In response to all of the allegations, a Costa Coffee spokeswoman added: ""We take any allegations of this nature very seriously and would like to reassure team members and customers that we will not tolerate illegal and unethical behaviour in any circumstances under the Costa Coffee brand.""

Trump says US firms 'hereby ordered' to quit China,"This video can not be played Jay Powell or Xi Jinping: Which chairman is Trump's enemy? President Donald Trump says he has ""hereby ordered"" American companies to leave China, after Beijing announced plans to slap new tariffs on US goods. The White House did not immediately say what authority the president had to compel private firms to quit a country. President Trump announced a 5% increase on tariffs on Chinese imports, after China unveiled plans for duties of 10% on $75bn (Â£61bn) of US goods. The latest salvos in the trade war sent global financial markets tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 620 points, or 2.4%, while London's FTSE 100 and the German DAX also turned negative. ""In the spirit of achieving Fair Trade, we must Balance this very unfair Trading Relationship,"" President Trump tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China,"" Mr Trump tweeted earlier on Friday. China's new tariffs will range between 5% and 10% and apply to more than 5,000 goods coming from the US. Agricultural goods, crude oil and small aircraft are among the targeted items. Mr Trump hit back, tweeting that $250bn of Chinese imports, currently taxed at 25%, would from now on be taxed at 30%. Beijing also said it would revive a 25% tariff on US car imports that it lifted earlier in 2019 in a goodwill gesture as the two countries tried to negotiate a trade agreement. Carmakers warned that the tax would put US jobs at risk. ""When these tariffs were initially imposed by China in 2017, American exports of finished vehicles dropped by 50%,"" said John Bozzella, who represents car manufacturers. ""We can't let that happen to American workers again."" On 1 August,President Trump unveiled a further 10% tariff on $300bn of Chinese goods, blaming China for not following through on promises to buy more American agricultural products. That tariff was expected to be introduced on 1 September, but less thantwo weeks later Mr Trump delayed that date to 15 December, partly due to concerns it might hit Christmas shoppers. China said it planned to impose its new tariffs in two stages on 1 September and 15 December. US-China trade war: 'We're all paying for this' Trump reacts with fury at Fed chief's speech Mr Trump also turned his fire on Friday against the head of the US central bank after he spoke out about the economic risks of a trade war with China. The president questioned whether Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was a greater ""enemy"" than China's leader Xi Jinping. At a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday Mr Powell warned that trade tensions were hitting the global economy. He also said the Fed - the world's most powerful central bank - didn't have a ""rulebook"" to deal with the fallout. Donald Trump said the US economy was ""strong and good"" The White House moved to play down the new tariffs. President Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told CNN that the Chinese duties were ""well signalled,"" adding: ""This isn't breaking news."" He said that talks between the two countries were on schedule and argued that the tariffs were not hurting Americans. ""Consumers aren't feeling the pain [of the trade war] and we are focused on making sure they [China] feel the pain not us."" He added that the economic slowdown was the fault of the US Federal Reserve, which has drawn criticism from Mr Trump for not making bigger cuts in interest rates. Mr Navarro said the central bank should lower the benchmark interest rate further to stimulate growth. US bond markets have recently sent warning signals of an impending recession. However, equities are trading at near record highs and employment is at its highest level in almost 50 years. Mr Trump also said on Twitter on Friday that the economy was ""strong and good"", while ""the rest of the world is not doing so well"". Stock markets in the US fell following news of China's tariffs, but then recovered, only to fall again in response to Mr Trump's tweets. TheDow Jones Industrial Averageclosed down 2.4% at 25,629.The S&P 500dropped 2.6% while theNasdaqwas 3% lower.

Bury owner Dale says club has been sold,"All six of Bury's scheduled fixtures this season have been suspended by the EFL Bury are waiting to hear if a last-ditch offer to buy the League One club will save them from being expelled from the English Football League. Owner Steve Dale told BBC Radio Manchester he had agreed a deal with analytics company C&N Sporting Risk, led by Henry Newman and Rory Campbell. The EFL said it had been notified of an offer being accepted by Dale. Bury had been given until 23:59 BST on Friday to prove their financial viability. Football Daily special: The day Bury survived? The EFL is now considering an extension to the deadline. ""We are currently in discussions with the potential purchaser and await information to allow the board to consider a request for an extension to Friday's deadline,"" said an EFL spokesperson. Bury needed to show they could pay off creditors and had funding to complete the season, or risk expulsion from the EFL. The EFL's previous update,issued at 17:00 BST on Friday, said ""limited progress"" had been made by Dale in either providing the evidence they required or finding a new owner, but it would ""keep working to find a resolution"". In a statement given to PA Media, Newman and Campbell said: ""We can confirm that over the past 10 weeks we have been in discussions with Bury FC, the EFL and others with a view to putting forward a proposal to buy the club. ""It is a very complicated scenario and there remain a number of outstanding legal and other issues that have to be addressed. ""Our background is in football and data analytics and it should therefore not be surprising that we are taking a very detailed forensic look at the realities of Bury FC's finances. ""A club like Bury ought to have a viable long-term future even if the short-term future is clearly very challenging. To that end we have been in discussions with the EFL about an extension so that we can continue to explore the prospects for a purchase."" This video can not be played The club is facing potential expulsion from the Football League Dale told the BBC earlier on Friday that he had found a ""prospective buyer"" who was ""waiting for the EFL to come back to him on a few points"". He carried out numerous media interviews throughout the day and had earlier asked members of the public to pledge money to help ""save a football club"". EFL chief executive Debbie Jevans said earlier this week thata short extension to the deadline may be grantedif a buyer could be found. And Bury North MP James Frith, who had earlier claimed a bidder he had been liaising with was going to submit the relevant documentation to the EFL on Friday, said Dale's announcement was a ""massive step forward"". He told BBC Radio 5 Live: ""This is not over the line fully, there are a lot of questions to be answered about the complexity of the financial situation, but it is their (Newman and Campbell) bid that Dale is referencing. ""I don't think the EFL have any reason now not to extend the deadline. ""It is a time to breathe a sigh of relief, but it's not 100% due diligence watertight."" The Shakers have had their first five league games of the season suspended by the EFL and they were also withdrawn from the Carabao Cup. No club has been removed from the EFL since Maidstone were liquidated in 1992.

Trump to hit back as China escalates trade war,"This video can not be played Jay Powell or Xi Jinping: Which chairman is Trump's enemy? President Donald Trump says he has ""hereby ordered"" American companies to leave China, after Beijing announced plans to slap new tariffs on US goods. The White House did not immediately say what authority the president had to compel private firms to quit a country. President Trump announced a 5% increase on tariffs on Chinese imports, after China unveiled plans for duties of 10% on $75bn (Â£61bn) of US goods. The latest salvos in the trade war sent global financial markets tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 620 points, or 2.4%, while London's FTSE 100 and the German DAX also turned negative. ""In the spirit of achieving Fair Trade, we must Balance this very unfair Trading Relationship,"" President Trump tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China,"" Mr Trump tweeted earlier on Friday. China's new tariffs will range between 5% and 10% and apply to more than 5,000 goods coming from the US. Agricultural goods, crude oil and small aircraft are among the targeted items. Mr Trump hit back, tweeting that $250bn of Chinese imports, currently taxed at 25%, would from now on be taxed at 30%. Beijing also said it would revive a 25% tariff on US car imports that it lifted earlier in 2019 in a goodwill gesture as the two countries tried to negotiate a trade agreement. Carmakers warned that the tax would put US jobs at risk. ""When these tariffs were initially imposed by China in 2017, American exports of finished vehicles dropped by 50%,"" said John Bozzella, who represents car manufacturers. ""We can't let that happen to American workers again."" On 1 August,President Trump unveiled a further 10% tariff on $300bn of Chinese goods, blaming China for not following through on promises to buy more American agricultural products. That tariff was expected to be introduced on 1 September, but less thantwo weeks later Mr Trump delayed that date to 15 December, partly due to concerns it might hit Christmas shoppers. China said it planned to impose its new tariffs in two stages on 1 September and 15 December. US-China trade war: 'We're all paying for this' Trump reacts with fury at Fed chief's speech Mr Trump also turned his fire on Friday against the head of the US central bank after he spoke out about the economic risks of a trade war with China. The president questioned whether Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was a greater ""enemy"" than China's leader Xi Jinping. At a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday Mr Powell warned that trade tensions were hitting the global economy. He also said the Fed - the world's most powerful central bank - didn't have a ""rulebook"" to deal with the fallout. Donald Trump said the US economy was ""strong and good"" The White House moved to play down the new tariffs. President Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told CNN that the Chinese duties were ""well signalled,"" adding: ""This isn't breaking news."" He said that talks between the two countries were on schedule and argued that the tariffs were not hurting Americans. ""Consumers aren't feeling the pain [of the trade war] and we are focused on making sure they [China] feel the pain not us."" He added that the economic slowdown was the fault of the US Federal Reserve, which has drawn criticism from Mr Trump for not making bigger cuts in interest rates. Mr Navarro said the central bank should lower the benchmark interest rate further to stimulate growth. US bond markets have recently sent warning signals of an impending recession. However, equities are trading at near record highs and employment is at its highest level in almost 50 years. Mr Trump also said on Twitter on Friday that the economy was ""strong and good"", while ""the rest of the world is not doing so well"". Stock markets in the US fell following news of China's tariffs, but then recovered, only to fall again in response to Mr Trump's tweets. TheDow Jones Industrial Averageclosed down 2.4% at 25,629.The S&P 500dropped 2.6% while theNasdaqwas 3% lower.

'Praying' for the Amazon,"Darkness descends on Sao Paulo at 16:00 (20:00 GMT) due to smoke from forest fires A daytime blackout in a Brazilian city has prompted millions of people to voice their concerns for the welfare of the Amazon rainforest. Sao Paulo was blackened for around an hour on Monday after strong winds and a cold front brought in smoke from forest fires burning in the states of Amazonas and Rondonia, more than 2,700km (1,700 miles) away. Sao Paulo resident Gianvitor Dias told the BBC what it was like in the city during the smoke-filled blackout on Monday afternoon. ""It was as if the day had turned into night,"" he said. ""Everyone here commented, because even on rainy days it doesn't usually get that dark. It was very impressive."" The hashtag #PrayForAmazonia started to be widely used on Tuesday as a result and there have been more than three million tweets since. Allow Twitter content?

People have taken to social media to criticise reports of a massive yearly increase in forest fires.

The most widely shared tweet using the #PrayForAmazonia tag - with more than a million likes and retweets - includes two aerial images of forest fires, neither of which show the current situation.

A video of a Pataxo woman angrily accusing illegal ranchers of starting fires has almost five million views. But the video has been shared on social media since at least July. So while it may point to one potential reason for the reported increase in forest fires, it's not necessarily a depiction of the present situation. Some of the most popular tweets online are also criticising President Jair Bolsonaro for not taking action. Scientists from Brazil's National Space Research Institute (INPE) say theAmazon has suffered lossesat an accelerated rate since Mr Bolsonaro took office in January. But the president responded by saying the data ""doesn't relate to the reality"" and accused them of smearing the country's reputation abroad.

'Football pitch' lost every minute,"An area of Amazon rainforest roughly the size of a football pitch is now being cleared every single minute, according to satellite data. The rate of losses has accelerated as Brazil's new right-wing president favours development over conservation. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. A senior Brazilian official, speaking anonymously, told us his government was encouraging deforestation. Usually by bulldozers, either pushing against the trunks to force the shallow roots out of the ground, or by a pair of the machines advancing with a chain between them. In one vast stretch of recently cleared land, we found giant trees lying on their sides, much of the foliage still green and patches of bare earth drying under a fierce sun. Later, the timber will be cleared and sold or burned, and the land prepared for farming. In other areas, illegal loggers carve new tracks through the undergrowth to reach particularly valuable hardwood trees which they sell on the black market, often to order. Satellite images show a sharp increase in clearances of trees over the first half of this year, since Jair Bolsonaro became president of Brazil, the country that owns most of the Amazon region. The most recent analysis suggests a staggering scale of losses over the past two months in particular, with about a hectare being cleared every minute on average. The single biggest reason to fell trees, according to official figures, is to create new pastures for cattle, and during our visit we saw countless herds grazing on land that used to be rainforest. Over the past decade, previous governments had managed to reduce the clearances with concerted action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But this approach is being overturned by Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers who have criticised the penalties and overseen a dramatic fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes. The forest holds a vast amount of carbon in its billions of trees, accumulated over hundreds or even thousands of years. Every year, the leaves also absorb a huge quantity of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be left in the atmosphere adding to the rise in global temperatures. Jair Bolsonaro swept to power on a populist agenda By one recent estimate, the trees of the Amazon rainforest pulled in carbon dioxide equivalent to the fossil fuel emissions of most of the nine countries that own or border the forest between 1980-2010. The forest is also the richest home to biodiversity on the planet, a habitat for perhaps one-tenth of all species of plants and animals. And it is where one million indigenous people live, hunting and gathering amid the trees. According to a senior Brazilian environment official, the impact is so ""huge"" that he took the risk of giving us an unauthorised interview to bring it to the attention of the world. We had to meet in secret and disguise his face and voice because Mr Bolsonaro has banned his environment staff from talking to the media. Over the course of three hours, a startling inside picture emerged of small, under-resourced teams of government experts passionate about saving the forest but seriously undermined by their own political masters. Farming organisations argue that the network of protected areas of forest is too restrictive Mr Bolsonaro swept to power on a populist agenda backed by agricultural businesses and small farmers, many of whom believe that too much of the Amazon region is protected and that environment staff have too much influence. He has said he wants to weaken the laws protecting the forest and has attacked the civil servants whose job it is to guard the trees. The result, according to the environment official, is that ""it feels like we are the enemies of the Amazon, when in fact we should be seen in a completely different way, as the people trying to protect our ecological heritage for future generations"". ""They don't want us to speak because we'll say the truth, that conservation areas are being invaded and destroyed, there are many people marking out areas that should be protected."" The official believes the figures for deforestation could be even worse than officially recognised. ""There's a government attempt to show the data is wrong, to show the numbers don't portray the reality,"" he told me. Ministers are considering hiring an independent contractor to handle information from satellite images of the region, questioning the work of the current government agency. One million indigenous people live in the forest Also, the rainy season is only now coming to an end, and because deforestation typically takes place in the drier months of the year, the official fears that the pace of losses could pick up speed. ""In truth, it can be even worse,"" he said, because many of the areas recently damaged haven't yet been picked up by satellite images. ""People need to know what's happening because we need allies to fight against invasions, to protect areas, and against deforestation."" We made repeated requests for interviews with the ministers for environment and agriculture but were refused. Earlier this year, Mr Bolsonaro, who's known as the ""Trump of the Tropics"", invited the US president to be a partner in exploiting the resources of the Amazon. Last month, in an interview with BBC Brasil, the environment minister Ricardo Salles, said landowners should be rewarded for preserving forest and that developed nations should foot the bill. And there's an assertive response when voices in the outside world call for the forest to be saved. The president's top security adviser, General Augusto Heleno Pereira, told Bloomberg last month that it was ""nonsense"" that the Amazon was part of the world's heritage. ""The Amazon is Brazilian, the heritage of Brazil and should be dealt with by Brazil for the benefit of Brazil,"" he said. For decades, farming organisations have argued that the network of protected areas of forest, including reserves for indigenous people, is too restrictive for a developing country that needs to create jobs. A leading figure in the farmers' union  in the city of Santarem, a hub for soya and cattle, told me that other countries had cleared their trees for agriculture but now wanted Brazil not to do the same. Vanderley Wegner said that the US and Europe, which buy produce from the Amazon region, have far less stringent controls on their forests, and that Europe ""has very little forest left"" anyway. ""We have to develop the Amazon. More than four million people live here and they need development too, it's a constitutional right of every Brazilian citizen,"" he said.

Johnson: New Brexit deal won't be a cinch,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""This is not going to be easy."" Boris Johnson has said it will not be ""a cinch"" to persuade the EU to change its Brexit deal with the UK. Speaking in Devon, the prime minister said the government was ""making progress"", but would ""have to prepare to come out without an agreement"". Mr Johnson wants to renegotiate the backstop - which aims to prevent a hard border on the island of Ireland after Brexit - but the EU has ruled this out. The EU's chief Brexit negotiator said it will analyse ""realistic"" proposals. Mr Johnson insists the backstop - part of the withdrawal agreement reached by his predecessor Theresa May and the EU, but not ratified by Parliament - must be ditched if a new deal with Brussels is to be reached before then. On Wednesday, German Chancellor Angela Merkelsaidthe onus was on the UK to find a workable alternative plan. Backstop indispensable, Macron tells Johnson Did Boris Johnson put his foot in it in France? Brexit, the border and 'alternative arrangements' During a visit to Torbay Hospital, Mr Johnson, who held talks in Berlin and Paris earlier this week, said: ""It was interesting that there a was a lot of new mood music... from our friends and partners."" He added: ""They can see that we want a deal. They can see the problems with the backstop."" But the prime minister also said: ""This is not going to be a cinch. This is not going to be easy. We will have to work very hard to get this done... ""I'm afraid we will have to prepare to come out without an agreement. We can do that. We are very confident."" Michel Barniersaid in a tweet,externalthat the withdrawal agreement was ""the best deal possible, based on UK red lines"". He added: ""We are ready to analyse UK proposals that are realistic, operational & compatible with our principles. EU wants an orderly withdrawal but is ready for any outcome."" The message followed a meeting on Friday in The Hague with the Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. Why is the Irish border blocking Brexit? And what is the backstop? If implemented, the backstop would see Northern Ireland staying aligned to some of the EU's single market rules, if the UK and the EU do not agree a trade deal after Brexit. It would also see the UK stay in a single customs territory with the EU, and align with current and future EU rules on competition and state aid. These arrangements would apply until both the EU and UK agreed they were no longer necessary. Mr Johnson argues that the backstop could leave the UK tied to the EU indefinitely, contrary to the result of the 2016 referendum, in which 52% of voters opted to leave. But the EU has repeatedly said the withdrawal deal negotiated by Mrs May, including the backstop, cannot be renegotiated. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. Speaking as he met Mr Johnson on Wednesday in Paris, French President Emmanuel Macronsaidhe was ""very confident"" the UK and EU would be able to find a solution within 30 days - a timetable suggested by Mrs Merkel - ""if there is a good will on both sides"". But, were any new agreement reached, it would not be ""very different from the existing one"", he added, given the timescale. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn is meeting the Liberal Democrats, SNP, Change UK, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party next week to discuss ways of avoiding a no-deal Brexit. Hehas proposedthat MPs should help him defeat the government in a no-confidence motion and install him as a caretaker prime minister. If he wins the vote, he plans to delay Brexit, call a snap election and campaign for another referendum. While on a visit to Swansea on Friday, Mr Corbyn said: ""We'll be discussing all the options. We will obviously discuss a legislation option [to prevent a no-deal Brexit] as well as a motion of no confidence. ""They're not mutually exclusive things to do. They are both possibilities and both things we'll be discussing."" On Saturday, Mr Johnson will attend the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, alongside other leaders including US President Donald Trump.

The fake baby Instagram adoption scam,"When US couples want to adopt a baby they often post ads online and search social media for women pregnant with a child they aren't planning to keep. Sometimes it works - but there are dangers. One young scammer has tricked countless couples, just for fun, by stealing the identity of a pregnant woman. It's early February 2019, half way through one of the coldest Michigan winters in recent history. The grey sky threatens snow. Thirty-three-year-old Samantha Stewart is in her pyjamas at home in Wixom, just outside Detroit, doing Sunday morning chores. There's a full washing basket, a house to be cleaned and dogs to walk. It's just after 11:00 when she receives a direct message request on Instagram from @ashleymamabear2019. It's not anyone she knows - but she accepts the message and starts reading. ""Are you looking to adopt still?"" are the opening words. It's six years since Sam had a hysterectomy. Throughout her 20s she underwent a series of operations in an attempt to control her endometriosis, a condition that causes the womb lining to grow in other parts of the body and can lead to crippling pain. They didn't work. By the time she was 27 it had become clear she would have to lose her womb - and the chance of carrying a child. It took time for Sam to recover from the stress and the heartache. Though she longed for a family, it was only at the end of last year that she and her husband, Dave, felt ready to contact an adoption agency and begin the laborious process of adopting a child. They passed their home study, an assessment of their suitability to be parents, and underwent training. Then they set up an Instagram account, @findingbabystewart, posting requests for birth parents to contact them, illustrated by an empty cot in a freshly painted nursery. Sam examines @ashleymamabear2019's Instagram feed. Ashley is 16, from a small town outside Atlanta, Georgia. She posts mirror photos, love notes to her boyfriend Chris, and selfies with Snapchat filters. Her hair is straight and honey-blonde and a backwards cap usually covers his. But there is one thing that sets them apart from thousands of other American teen couples - the occasional shots of Ashley's figure, her face beaming as Chris places his hand against her swollen, round belly. This is the baby Ashley is offering to Sam and Dave. The women begin messaging, but not before Sam has excitedly called Dave, her parents and Dave's parents. She doesn't spend much time wondering why they look so happy about the pregnancy, bearing in mind that it is unwanted. They're young, she thinks. ""Are you guys talking to any other adoptive families?"" ventures Sam. ""I'm just scared of being hurt. I want to be a mom so badly."" ""Nope,"" comes the reply. Minutes later, Sam shoots back: ""I'm crying."" Ashley's life had been harrowing. Her parents were abusive, her mother killed herself. She was raped by her brother at the age of 14, resulting in a premature baby, a little girl who was placed for adoption. The adoptive parents shut Ashley out, preventing her from seeing her child. It would be hard to write a bleaker story. The contact is constant. Sometimes Chris takes over texting because Ashley is feeling sick. When they talk on the phone, Sam finds Ashley's conversation immature, makes her excuses and hangs up after half an hour. They text about adoption plans late into the evening. The temperature has now dropped to -5C, and a light snow is falling. Sam is exhausted from messaging. She explains that she's heading out for dinner, and so won't be on her phone for a few hours. She passes on her adoption agency's details. But then, suddenly, Ashley becomes abusive. She tells Sam she would be a bad parent. Shocked and hurt, Sam stops replying. The adrenaline that has kept her going all day suddenly drains away, and she crashes on to the sofa. ""It's just - it's devastating. There's no other way to describe it,"" she says later, remembering this moment. Sam assumes she will never hear from Ashley again. She and Dave consider deleting their Instagram posts appealing for pregnant women to contact them. Sam begins to feel that adopting a baby will take a long, long time. Then, exactly a month later, as icy patches of ground are beginning to thaw, a message arrives. Ashley tells Sam the baby has been born early, at 31 weeks. Exasperated, Sam tells Ashley to contact her adoption agency, or leave her family alone: ""Have a nice life and don't contact me."" It only takes 14 messages, though, for Ashley to persuade Sam that there really is a premature baby waiting for adoption. She names the medical centre where she gave birth and Sam and Dave get ready to fly there. Ashley sends a photograph of her cuddling a premature baby, wrapped in a white towel, wires trailing from the small body. It's captioned, ""She's yours."" ""Omg I'm literally losing it. I can't wait to meet her,"" Sam replies. ""I can't wait to spoil that pretty little baby!"" There are three days of non-stop talking. Then Ashley blocks Sam on Instagram. When Sam calls, Ashley doesn't pick up. There is no explanation, just silence. Distressed, frantic, but already sensing that Ashley has been getting a thrill out of tormenting her, Sam posts a drawing of a broken heart on Instagram. ""They don't ask for money, they don't ask for material things like a lot of scams do. They want your time, emotional investment and quite frankly someone to talk to while promising you what you are desperate to find: your future child,"" she writes in the caption. ""We need to talk about this."" The comments start coming in. Sam is not the only one whom Ashley has tricked. In many countries, social media would be the last place anyone would look for a baby to adopt. In the US, though, most states allow something called private adoption, where couples hoping to adopt and birth mothers find each other independently. The arrangement is then formalised by an attorney or an adoption agency. When Sam and Dave first signed up at their adoption agency, they were number 21 on the list of prospective adoptive parents. The agency warned them to expect a long wait and said they might get quicker results advertising themselves on the internet. Pregnant women who don't intend to keep their child have the same choice - to approach adoption agencies, or search for adoptive parents online. Apparently, many feel that by making contact with parents directly they have more control. At the time of writing, #hopingtoadopt is hashtagged 44,892 times on Instagram; #waitingtoadopt is mentioned 18,844 times and #hopefuladoptiveparents 10,758. Images of letter boards jostle for the attention of birth mothers: No Bump, Still Pumped, We're Adopting; Share This Photo and Help Our Family Grow; We are Officially a Waiting Family. There aren't enough babies to go round, though, so many of these thousands of hopeful parents will be disappointed. The problem has got worse since countries that once provided large numbers of babies for adoption, such as Russia, China and Guatemala, clamped down. ""Most countries have ceased to allow the adoption of their children internationally, so the raw numbers have plummeted over the last 10 to 15 years by huge margins,"" says Adam Pertman, president of the National Centre on Adoption and Permanency. Unplanned pregnancies have also become less common in the US - and the reduced stigma around single parenthood means that, when they do occur, the mothers are more likely to keep the child. The National Council for Adoption's last survey estimates that less than 0.5% of babies are placed for adoption. Couples hoping to adopt may already have spent years trying to conceive, and even if they haven't, the long wait for a baby to become available for adoption can be frustrating and lead to impatience. ""Urgency creates desperation, and desperation creates sometimes decisions not being made with enough thought,"" says adoption specialist Dawn Smith Pleiner. ""Even though in the back of your head you know that it's probably not real, there's that glimmer, that feeling that there's a 1% chance it could be,"" says Sam. ""And you go with it anyway."" The comments stack up under Sam's broken-heart Instagram post. In Utah, Kristen and Michael Johnson have also been contacted by Ashley and Chris, though this time the teenagers from Georgia have used a different account. In Kentucky, Ashley Middleton and her husband Brian have received messages from this second account. Another woman says she has been contacted by both Instagram accounts. (It is most often women who are approached - two couples say that Ashley refused to speak to their male partner.) The photos all feature the same pregnant blonde-haired young woman from Georgia, offering up her child. Kristen starts getting messages from Ashley on 14 March, the day after - unbeknown to her - Ashley has ghosted Sam. Over rambling, intense phone-calls, Ashley urges Kristen to visit her 31-week-old prematurely born baby. ""One time, I talked to her for four hours. It's a long time. I don't even talk to my own mother for that long, ever,"" says Kristen. Ashley hits the Johnsons at a particularly vulnerable moment. They've been waiting two-and-a-half years to adopt one more child. ""We were so tired and sick of trying to adopt, and wanting it to be done,"" Kristen says. ""We got highly emotional about it instead of thinking more rationally."" Kristen books flights to Atlanta for $500. In the frantic scrum to find a babysitter, she realises that Ashley hasn't sent any documents from the hospital. She rings to double check. It's a brief phone call: the charge nurse tells her there is no 15-year-old called Ashley, no father called Chris - and no baby. ""My stomach just dropped and I was literally sick. We cried a lot. My husband cried,"" she says. ""We couldn't believe, after everything we had been through, that we still fell for it."" There was a Facebook group where couples shared stories like this - the internet has made it easier to carry out a scam, but also harder to sustain one. The names used by many scammers all over the country are shared and circulated quickly. Ashley, it turns out, uses a number of names and accounts: Alyssa and Josh, Ciara and Daniel, Mackenzie and Matt. Each couple's story has familiar elements, either the same abusive parents, the mum lost to suicide or the connection to Georgia. Usually, it's all three. Messages are incessant, phone calls come at strange times, and conversations drag out over hours. Sometimes the ruse lasts for a day, sometimes a few. It typically ends in tears. Sam thinks the scammer's real name is Melissa, because a couple of the fake Instagram accounts have tagged someone with this name. Melissa has square-framed glasses, tangled red hair, and looks as though she's in her late 20s. Kristen isn't convinced. She has a hunch the scammer is a spiteful middle-aged woman. Both agree, though, that the perpetrator is probably based somewhere not far from Atlanta, because she knows the area so well. Other victims have different theories. Some wonder if the scammer is in fact a group of people, because of the amount of time it must take to send so many messages - perhaps a group of anti-adoption activists, whose aim is to keep hopeful parents busy, to demoralise them and to hinder their search for real birth mothers. The same image of Ashley, posted to a different Instagram account Juli Wisotsky, an adoption attorney based in Athens, Georgia, says she too has had her time wasted. In March, an adoption agency from another state asked her to talk to a pregnant girl who had matched with one of their couples. Although Juli was about to go on a platinum wedding anniversary trip with her husband, she delayed it to talk. She and the 15-year-old exchanged messages through the night, as the girl claimed she was being admitted to hospital. Despite her 23 years' experience in the job, it took Juli nearly 24 hours to realise she was being conned. The final giveaway was an ultrasound image, stripped of all identifying details. ""It's partly my fault as I'm a very nurturing person. So I'm trying to nurture her and help her,"" Juli says. And the same scammer has remained active. Since March, Juli says, she and her colleagues have been called by families from Georgia, Colorado, Texas, Alaska, New York, Minnesota, Alabama, Illinois and Utah. All of the families were approached on Instagram by a young woman from Georgia. ""The emotional scams took me - when I was younger - completely off-guard,"" says Dawn Smith Pleiner, who has run the Vermont-based Friends in Adoption agency for nearly four decades. Long before the arrival of the internet, women would call for ""hour-long-talking-with-your-best-friend conversations"", she says, and it was ""never ever to do with money - never"". ""Then you realise that the due date is long gone, and you're still talking. ""There are so many lonely people out in this world today that just want some attention."" It's a scam that's  hard to prosecute. Most states still don't have the legal tools. Since September 2018 there have been laws in place in Georgia to stop financial adoption fraud, but not the emotional kind. ""It's very frustrating,"" says Juli Wisotsky. One option could be to raise a civil case for intentional infliction of emotional distress. ""But, does somebody want to get involved in a lawsuit for that?"" she asks. ""Or do they just want to let it go and try to heal and grieve what is a loss to them? Even though there was no baby there, they thought there was a baby. It's a grief."" Traumatised couples regularly report this scam to the FBI's Internet Crime Complaint Centre. In a statement, the FBI told the BBC that although they were aware of emotional adoption scams, these were still uncommon. None of the parents have received a follow-up call. But it's not only the potential parents who have been hurt, there's another person too. Because Ashley isn't just a fake Instagram profile, cobbled together from some images and an active imagination. Ashley is a real 22-year-old, who lives in Georgia. Her name is Ashley King - and her identity has been stolen. Sam, playing detective, finds Ashley's profile easily - the pictures are all public. She messages her to warn her that her photographs are being used to trick people. And she points out that whoever runs the fake Instagram accounts knows intimate details about her life, her husband and her baby. Ashley's voice lowers as she describes the shock of seeing photos of her newborn child on another person's Instagram account. ""The woman had loads of people thinking that they were going to adopt my daughter,"" she says. ""It's a really scary thought. Why would someone do that?"" She immediately files a report with Gwinnett County Police. What the scammer says about Ashley's childhood is completely false, she explains, but when it comes to her daughter the impostor even knows what hospital she was born in. ""King stated the only information that was incorrect on her daughter was that she was listed as being born premature at 2lb 8oz when in reality she was born at 2lb 12oz,"" reads the police report. ""All other information was correct."" Ashley King with her husband Chris Sam thinks it's likely that the fake Ashley knows the real one. ""I don't live in a very big town but if you picked a random woman out of my town and expected me to know her life story, I wouldn't know it,"" she says. ""You would only know those details if you actually knew someone."" But Ashley has no idea who it might be, and this makes her nervous. ""Now I have to look over my shoulder making sure this woman isn't watching my kid, because she knows about where I lived,"" she says. ""It's really scary."" (Ashley and her family have since moved house.) Georgia has a law on identity theft, but it's debatable whether it is applicable in this case. A few states have already passed legislation to tackle online impersonation, but prosecutions may not succeed if no money has changed hands. Who can put a value on a broken heart? Gwinnett County Police say they are not currently investigating. It must be hard for the scammer to remember exactly what she has said to different couples. When Sam is first contacted it's by someone pretending to be 16 years old. But a month later, Ashley says she will get her dad to call the adoption attorney ""since I am only 15"". The scammer tells another couple that her middle name is Lorraine. Later, they suggest Olivia Lorraine as a potential name for the baby. She then replies, ""Olivia is my middle name! Sounds perfect to us!"" But these are not her biggest mistakes. To call or text hopeful parents, the scammer uses non-fixed Voice over IP (VoIP) telephone numbers, the technical name for calls that go over the internet, created through companies such as Google or Skype. These numbers require very little information on sign-up, making them difficult to trace. But just occasionally she gets careless. One of the numbers used to contact Juli and Kristen isn't an internet number. It's a real mobile number, from Georgia, and registered to someone called Harry. Type the number into Google and it immediately pops up - on a very pink website selling homemade slime. Thick, gluey and intensely squishable, slime was the toy of 2017 (the same year the site was last updated). The shop sells slime for $5, shipping is the same again. It also, inexplicably, sells six cupcakes for $18. And there is an email address with a name - Gabby. The homepage of the slime website When I call the number, it doesn't go well. After my first question Gabby goes silent. Then she hangs up. Jessica Simmons, a mother of two adopted children, both of whom she found on Facebook, knows the name Gabby, and that telephone number, all too well. In August 2016, a young woman contacted her on Facebook, saying she was pregnant. She began to fill in forms with Jessica's adoption agency, giving her name and address: a small town outside Atlanta. Her age: 23. ""After about a month of talking to her every day, I reached out to one of her family members by private message,"" says Jessica. The family member told her this was not the first time Gabby had pretended to be pregnant, and not to trust her. There was ""nothing anybody could do to stop her"" Jessica was told. Three years later, a pregnant 16-year-old from Georgia called a Google Voice number on a Minnesotan couple's adoption page. As they talked with her for hours, they inadvertently recorded part of a conversation. Listening back to the recording, the young woman's nasal voice still gets to the wife, making her anxious. ""She spoke very low and quiet,"" she remembers. ""She was very needy and demanding and it made me very uncomfortable."" As well as the fake Instagram accounts, Gabby also has a personal one. Photos of a curly-haired girl with glasses sit alongside slime-making videos, in which her voice can be heard - it's the same as in the recording, and it's the one I heard on the telephone. Nothing has been posted on this Instagram account since June 2018. There is no mention of babies, adoption or pregnancy. The list of people she is following is revealing, however. It includes Ashley King. By the time I speak to Ashley a second time, she herself has come to suspect Gabby may be the woman impersonating her, after stumbling across a bizarre series of messages from her on Facebook, most of which she doesn't remember having received. A small selection of the images sent to Ashley King The first message congratulates Ashley on the birth of her daughter. Then they keep coming, asking for baby pictures and updates on the child's health, month after month. At one point Gabby says: ""Can you send me a video of yourself saying, 'Hey'? Then I'll leave you alone. ""Or 'Hey I'm Ashley.'"" Although that request goes unanswered, Ashley does occasionally send short, polite replies. And once or twice she even responds to Gabby's strange demands - for example by sending a photo of her post-baby stomach. A photo which, of course, ends up on Instagram. At the time, Ashley points out, she had a newly born premature baby and passed much of her time in a sleep-deprived haze. It was only later that she realised just how many messages she'd received from this random Facebook friend, whom her husband had known vaguely when they were younger. ""When I was going through them, I was like, 'Oh my goodness, I should've seen this a long time ago, when it first started happening,'"" says Ashley. ""I was very angry at myself. How I could not have caught it before?"" Juli Wisotsky can't quite believe it when she ends up on the phone with Gabby again on 31 July, four months after their first conversation. From her law office, she takes a call from a 15-year-old named Mackenzie on behalf of a couple in New York, with a story she feels like she's heard before. After one minute 20 seconds the girl hangs up and blocks her number. This call comes more than two weeks after I started messaging Gabby and asking questions about her conversations with couples hoping to adopt. A number of fake accounts Gabby used were reported to Instagram by her victims, but they remained online for months, until the BBC started asking Instagram why. Then they were deleted. An Instagram spokesman said: ""Keeping people safe on Instagram is one of our biggest priorities. We're aware of this issue and will disable any further accounts in violation of our policies. We encourage anyone to report content they think is against our guidelines using our in-app tools."" ""It is breaking people's hearts,"" says Juli. ""It's just wrong and it's evil. And that's a strong word to use. But I believe it is."" ""The more I think about her and who she probably is - she probably has a very sad existence,"" says Sam. ""Part of me thinks that she might not even realise what she's doing is wrong."" Sam just wishes she would stop. It is another rainy Sunday in Wixom, this time in May. An Instagram message from a private account comes through to Samantha Stewart's phone. ""Here we go again,"" she thinks. ""I was super suspicious. But it was much different on the phone with her,"" remembers Sam. The woman ""asked all the right questions. She wanted to know about me and my husband. About our house."" The next day, the sun comes out. Sam and Dave drive for three-quarters of an hour to meet the young woman with their adoption agency worker. Twelve days later the couple are at home with their new baby, Parker. ""The instant he took his first breath everything was healed,"" Sam sobs. ""Every bit of heartache and worry, it all disappears. I wouldn't want this type of scam or anything like this to deter people. Because even though it's horrible, you won't regret it. It won't matter. ""You bring your baby home and none of it matters.""

"'Limited progress' made by Bury, says EFL","This video can not be played The club is facing potential expulsion from the Football League There has been ""limited progress"" made in Bury's bid to avoid expulsion from the English Football League, the organisation has said. Bury have been asked to provide evidence they can pay off creditors and have the funding needed to survive the season by 23:59 BST on Friday. Owner Steve Dale has said he has found a ""prospective buyer"" for the club. The EFL said it would ""keep working to find a resolution"" with the League One side in an update issued at 17:00 BST. ""As of 5pm there has been limited progress made either by the current ownership providing the required evidence in regard to outstanding financial information, or through a change of control being achieved with new owners,"" the EFL said in a statement. ""The EFL will continue to provide all support available and will keep working to find a resolution to the ongoing issues ahead of the notice of withdrawal deadline, which remains at 11.59pm on Friday, 23 August. ""If a successful solution is not found ahead of tonight's deadline, the club's share in the EFL will be withdrawn and its membership in the league will come to an end."" Bury demise disgraceful, says England women's boss Neville The Shakers have had six successive matches suspended at the start of 2019-20, while they have also been withdrawn from the Carabao Cup. Owner Dale has told BBC Radio Manchester that he had found a ""prospective buyer"" who was ""waiting for the EFL to come back to him on a few points"". Dale, who carried out numerous media interviews throughout Friday, had earlier asked members of the public to pledge money to help ""save a football club"". Meanwhile, speaking to BBC Radio 5 Live, Bury North MP James Frith claimed that he has been liaising with a separate ""credible bidder"" who will submit their offer before Friday's deadline and provide the required documentation to the EFL. EFL chief executive Debbie Jevans told BBC Sport on Thursday that if a buyer did come forward they would consider giving them more time - but that ""it's very difficult to see how we can postpone more matches"". ""The clock is ticking, there's no question,"" said Jevans. ""Nobody wants to see this club disappear out of the league, least of all me, which is why we are working 24/7 to try to stop that happening."" At the end of April, Bury were celebrating promotion back to the third tier of English football, but they were already enduring a torrid time off the pitch. Players and staff had often been paid late, while a winding-up petition filed against the club was adjourned three times before eventually being dismissed by the High Court on 31 July. By then, creditors had approved a company voluntary arrangement (CVA) put forward by Dale, which was proposed to help settle some of their debts. The CVA meant unsecured creditors, including HM Revenue & Customs, would be paid 25% of the money owed - but also triggered a 12-point deduction in the League One table under EFL rules. Furthermore, the EFL has been unsatisfied Bury have given enough evidence of their ""financial viability"", leading to a string of postponed fixtures while the organisation awaited ""the clarity required"". The Shakers were given a 14-day deadline to provide the necessary information on 9 August, which is due to expire at 23:59 on Friday. If the club are unable to satisfy the EFL's request, their only other hope is that a buyer comes in with a rescue plan at the 11th hour. Owner Dale said he would consider selling Bury after the club's staff""implored""him to accept an offer last week - but then reportedlyrejected a fresh bidon Tuesday. Dale told BBC Radio Manchester on Thursday there were four interested parties - one of which has his backing - but time appears to be against any takeover going through. The EFL reiterated this week that ""if a solution is not found by the deadline, the board will authorise the necessary share transfer on behalf of Bury FC which shall be legally binding on all parties and result, regretfully, in the club no longer being a member of the League"". In other words, the Shakers will be expelled from the EFL. The club would then ""be free to make an application to the Football Association to rejoin league competition further down the English football pyramid from season 2020-21"", according to the EFL. The EFL has already outlined how it intends to balance the leagues if Bury are expelled: The current League One season would be completed with 23 teams, with the number of relegation places reduced to three. Four teams will still be promoted from League Two this season, ensuring League One is rebalanced in 2020-21. Only one team will be relegated from League Two, with two to be promoted from the National League as usual. EFL chief executive Jevans has confirmed they would consider extending Friday's deadline by ""24 to 48 hours"" if a solution appeared to be imminent. However, she also said a ""long delay"" was ""not possible"", stressing that once a decision has been made Bury will ""cease to be a member of the league"", meaning an appeal would appear unlikely. With the deadline set for 23:59, there is not likely to be any confirmation regarding Bury's future from the EFL until Saturday morning. But, if the EFL does decide to grant a short deadline extension, there may yet be an update on Friday. It is 27 years since an EFL club was unable to complete a season, with Maidstone and Aldershot both liquidated in 1992. No club has ever dropped out of the third tier before and Bury would also become the first FA Cup winners to have been expelled by the EFL.

Amazon fires: Ten of your questions answered,"Inpe said it had detected more than 72,000 fires so far this year Swathes of the Amazon rainforest in Brazil are on fire. The sky in SÃ£o Paulo turned black due to smoke drifting from the fires 2,700 km (1,700 miles) away.Politicians and environmental activists are taking a stand against Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro, blaming the fires on his policies. But it's a complex story, and online discussion of it has been riddled with misinformation, misleading photos and errors. We asked you to send us your questions on the Amazon fires, so we could fill in the gaps and clear up some common myths. We chose a sample of the many questions we received and where we didn't know the answer, we enrolled the experts. 1) Why are there fires? Is it Bolsonaro's men doing it to clear rainforest for mining/farming etc? - Alex Brazilian journalist Silio Boccanera argues that some fires at this time of year - the dry season in Brazil - are to be expected. But many of the fires burning through the Amazon are believed to have been started deliberately. President Bolsonaro has not condemned deforestation and supports clearing the Amazon for agriculture and mining. ""So it's a combination of natural phenomena with locals feeling comfortable enough to do it because the government has not made any effort to prevent it,"" Mr Boccanera says. Smoke rising through the rainforest He thinks that smaller groups of people are more responsible for starting the fires than big corporations selling beef and soy, which could run the risk of being boycotted. Although the big corporations are not innocent, they are better informed, he says. But smaller groups - who benefit from destroying areas of the forest for farming - have gone ahead because they have not been stopped by authorities, Mr Boccanera explains. Although deliberate fire-starting has always been a problem, it has never been seen to this extent. Mr Boccanera says perpetrators now know that if they are caught, they won't be punished. 2) The number of fires seems like a bad metric, because the size of fires varies. Is there year-on-year data on the total area affected? - Peter This is a fair point. On 20 August, Brazil's satellite agency said there had been an 84% increase in the number of fires compared with the same period in 2018. It's the highest number since 2010, but significantly less than in 2005 during the same period, when the number of fires was at its highest. This year, the satellite agency detected more than 74,000 fires in Brazil between January and 20 August. Most of those were in the Amazon, and the New York Times reports most of those fires were on land already cleared for agricultural use. But does this mean more land is being burned than ever before? After all, we could be looking at tens of thousands of tiny fires. The truth is we don't know yet, but the evidence points towards more land being consumed by fire. We don't have the full picture at the moment, partly because many fires are still burning. We asked Copernicus, the European Union's earth observation programme, and they said the best way to assess how destructive these fires are is to look at how much carbon dioxide is being released. So far this year, the equivalent of 228 megatonnes has been released, according to the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service. This is the highest level since 2010. At some point in the future, there should be more detailed satellite information about how much land had been burned, but that information isn't available yet. 3) What's being done to stop the fires? - Paul President Bolsonaro is coming under growing political pressure to end the burning of the Amazon -France's President Emmanuel Macron even threatened to scrap a huge trade dealbetween the European Union and South America as a result. But warnings by themselves don't put out fires, and a few days after the satellite data was revealed, Brazil's government stepped up its response. In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? Mr Bolsonaro has called in the armed forces, who have more resources to tackle the fires, including the use of helicopters and aeroplanes to drop water. However, journalist Silio Boccanera believes the attitude at the top of government needs to change. Before, people believed deforestation needed to be prevented.  But now ""people are burning without fear"", he says. 4) The coverage on this subject has only come to light recently because of the #PrayforAmazonas and #PrayforAmazonia hashtag. Why have you not reported it? - Jake We and other news outlets published several reports this summer about the extent of deforestation in the Amazon -here's one report we wrote on 2 July,another from 20 Julyandanother from 2 August. But the extent of the fires has only recently become clear. It was not even being reported very widely in Brazil. The first real sign vast burning was taking place came when a daytime blackout, caused by smoke from the Amazon, hit Sao Paulo on Monday, 19 August. We first publishedan article a day later, justa few hours after our colleagues at BBC Brasil, and we've kept updating it ever since. This video can not be played Worldwide protests over Brazilian government inaction on Amazon fires The #PrayforAmazonas hashtag was first used in the early hours of Wednesday, UK time. This, and others such as #prayforrondonia have become trending topics around the world. 5) Is this a natural, healthy way the forest self-clears for new growth? - Lucy As Lucy suggests, there is a case to be made that some fire-adapted forests benefit from fires - they can help clear the forest and allow trees space to grow stronger. But this is not the situation right now in the Amazon, says Yadvinder Malhi, Professor of Ecosystem Science at the University of Oxford. ""These are fires that we are concerned about,"" he says. The humid forests of the Amazon have no adaptation to fire and suffer immense damage. Almost all fires in humid forests are started by people. He believes the driving force behind the fire is human rather than natural. While statistics show that 2016 also saw a significant number of fires in the Amazon, this was considered a ""drought year""- when there is naturally less rain so the forest is drier and therefore more fire-prone. But 2019 has not been a drought year. Professor Malhi says there is such a large number of fires because people have lit them. 6) How quickly does the Amazon rainforest regenerate after a fire? - Emily ""The forest takes around 20-40 years if it's allowed to regenerate,"" says Prof Malhi. But any fires that are currently burning will leave the surviving trees more vulnerable to drought and repeated fires. 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute Prof Malhi is worried that if the Amazon is hit by fires every few years large parts of it will shift to a degraded shrubby state. ""Once you've had multiple fires there's the chance of permanent damage,"" he says. 7) If this current trend were to continue at its present rate, how long would the Amazon rainforest area survive? - Christopher ""We are at an early stage where we can still do lots to save the forest,"" says Prof Malhi. About 80% of the Amazon is still intact. But he says that climate change and deforestation are a dangerous combination. A reduction in rainfall would create dry conditions for fires to spread. If 30-40% of the Amazon was cleared, then there would be a danger of changing the forest's entire climate, he says. In the years before 2005, Brazil had an extremely high rate of deforestation. Photos from 2003 showing aggressive deforestation in Brazil ""If Brazil were to return to that, it would take around 50-60 years to deforest 40% of the Amazon,"" Prof Malhi says. ""But in eastern and southern Amazonia it would take only 20-30 years to reach that threshold."" 8) What percentage of oxygen does the Amazon supply? - Tom Our colleagues from BBC Reality Check spent a whole day getting to the bottom of this. Many claim on social media that the Amazon produces about 20% of the world's oxygen. It's widely quoted - by campaign groups and well-known figures, including Emmanuel Macron and footballer Cristiano Ronaldo. But academics say this is a very common misconception, and that the figure is less than 10%. Oxygen is released by plants during the process of photosynthesis, where carbon dioxide and water are converted into energy in the form of carbohydrates using sunlight. A large proportion of the world's oxygen is produced by plankton, explains Professor Malhi. He says of the oxygen produced by land-based plants, about 16% comes from the Amazon. But this isn't the whole story. In the long run, the Amazon absorbs about the same amount of oxygen as it produces, effectively making the total produced net zero. Professor Jon Lloyd from Imperial College London says although the Amazon produces a lot of oxygen during the day through photosynthesis, it absorbs about half of it back through the process of respiration to grow. Further oxygen is used up by the forest's soil, animals and microbes. The fires are also emitting carbon monoxide- a gas released when wood is burned and does not have much access to oxygen. 9) Will the smoke from these fires have an effect on global weather in future months? - David Prof Malhi says the immediate effect of the fires will be on the climate of South America. Reduced rain fall is likely, leading to a more intensive dry season. ""The carbon emission could contribute to global warming,"" he adds, but the longer term global impact is ""more difficult to pin down"". In the long-term, scientists have told the BBC the fires could make the Paris climate target more difficult to achieve. The global treaty aims to limit average temperature rise to well below two degrees Celsius to avoid dangerous climate change. 10) How are these fires affecting the indigenous people? - Samantha In just one week in mid-August, 68 fires were registered in indigenous territories and conservation areas, the majority in the Amazon, according to Jonathan Mozower from Survival International,which campaigns for indigenous rights,external. ""It's hard to overstate the importance of these forests for indigenous peoples,"" he says. ""They depend on them for food, medicines, clothing and a sense of identity and belonging. But the incentives to steal these resources are high and ""sadly it's not a question of one or two rogue actors"", Mr Mazower says. He says this could be the ""worst moment for the indigenous people of the Amazon"" since the military dictatorship, which ended in the 1980s.

Girl's before-and-after school photos go viralLucie's new school uniform is on the dishevelled side by the end of the five-year-old's first day.Glasgow & West Scotland,"When asked what she had been up to to get her new uniform in such a ""state"", Lucie, five, said: ""Nothing much"" Before-and-after photos of a five-year-old's first day back at school have been shared thousands of times online after her mother posted the ""really funny"" images on Facebook. Lucie, from East Renfrewshire, ""likes to be clean"" and looked immaculate before she left home, mother Jill said. But by the end of a day of playing with her friends, her clothes were ""a mess"". The photos were liked more than 10,000 times after Jill agreed to let a local newspaper put them on their page. ""She absolutely loves school and this was her first day in P2 so she absolutely loved having her new things on,"" Jill said. When Jill saw the ""state"" of her daughter on Monday afternoon, she asked what Lucie had been up to. ""Nothing much,"" Lucie said. ""The wonders of primary two,"" Jill said. ""The teachers are really good, they do a lot of active learning and things with them - so I take it it was down to that."" ""She'd obviously had a really fun day,"" she added. Jill said she often likes to take pictures ""off-cue"" because they are less ""posed"". ""I knew if I'd asked her for a picture, she would have said no, because of the mess of her. She likes to be clean and things,"" she added. Harper, four, also looked slightly less tidy by the end of her first day at school Jill, a mother of three, sent Lucie's father the photo after he asked how her first day back had been. ""He thought it was really funny so we shared it with friends and family on our Facebook,"" Jill said. After that, they sent the photos toBarrhead News,external, which said the images were its ""favourite"" set of back-to-school pictures. ""I don't think they quite anticipated how it would spread,"" Jill said. She said Lucie has ""taken it in her stride"" and has been telling everyone ""Oh, I'm famous"". ""I think she's still just a bit too young to understand,"" Jill added. Lots of parents responded to the post with their own before-and-after photos. Laura's four-year-old daughter Harper was ""so excited"" for her first day at school near their home in Broxburn - and looked a little worse for wear by home time.

China escalates US trade row with new tariffs,"This video can not be played Jay Powell or Xi Jinping: Which chairman is Trump's enemy? President Donald Trump says he has ""hereby ordered"" American companies to leave China, after Beijing announced plans to slap new tariffs on US goods. The White House did not immediately say what authority the president had to compel private firms to quit a country. President Trump announced a 5% increase on tariffs on Chinese imports, after China unveiled plans for duties of 10% on $75bn (Â£61bn) of US goods. The latest salvos in the trade war sent global financial markets tumbling. The Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 620 points, or 2.4%, while London's FTSE 100 and the German DAX also turned negative. ""In the spirit of achieving Fair Trade, we must Balance this very unfair Trading Relationship,"" President Trump tweeted. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""Our great American companies are hereby ordered to immediately start looking for an alternative to China,"" Mr Trump tweeted earlier on Friday. China's new tariffs will range between 5% and 10% and apply to more than 5,000 goods coming from the US. Agricultural goods, crude oil and small aircraft are among the targeted items. Mr Trump hit back, tweeting that $250bn of Chinese imports, currently taxed at 25%, would from now on be taxed at 30%. Beijing also said it would revive a 25% tariff on US car imports that it lifted earlier in 2019 in a goodwill gesture as the two countries tried to negotiate a trade agreement. Carmakers warned that the tax would put US jobs at risk. ""When these tariffs were initially imposed by China in 2017, American exports of finished vehicles dropped by 50%,"" said John Bozzella, who represents car manufacturers. ""We can't let that happen to American workers again."" On 1 August,President Trump unveiled a further 10% tariff on $300bn of Chinese goods, blaming China for not following through on promises to buy more American agricultural products. That tariff was expected to be introduced on 1 September, but less thantwo weeks later Mr Trump delayed that date to 15 December, partly due to concerns it might hit Christmas shoppers. China said it planned to impose its new tariffs in two stages on 1 September and 15 December. US-China trade war: 'We're all paying for this' Trump reacts with fury at Fed chief's speech Mr Trump also turned his fire on Friday against the head of the US central bank after he spoke out about the economic risks of a trade war with China. The president questioned whether Federal Reserve chairman Jerome Powell was a greater ""enemy"" than China's leader Xi Jinping. At a symposium of central bankers in Jackson Hole, Wyoming, on Friday Mr Powell warned that trade tensions were hitting the global economy. He also said the Fed - the world's most powerful central bank - didn't have a ""rulebook"" to deal with the fallout. Donald Trump said the US economy was ""strong and good"" The White House moved to play down the new tariffs. President Trump's trade adviser, Peter Navarro, told CNN that the Chinese duties were ""well signalled,"" adding: ""This isn't breaking news."" He said that talks between the two countries were on schedule and argued that the tariffs were not hurting Americans. ""Consumers aren't feeling the pain [of the trade war] and we are focused on making sure they [China] feel the pain not us."" He added that the economic slowdown was the fault of the US Federal Reserve, which has drawn criticism from Mr Trump for not making bigger cuts in interest rates. Mr Navarro said the central bank should lower the benchmark interest rate further to stimulate growth. US bond markets have recently sent warning signals of an impending recession. However, equities are trading at near record highs and employment is at its highest level in almost 50 years. Mr Trump also said on Twitter on Friday that the economy was ""strong and good"", while ""the rest of the world is not doing so well"". Stock markets in the US fell following news of China's tariffs, but then recovered, only to fall again in response to Mr Trump's tweets. TheDow Jones Industrial Averageclosed down 2.4% at 25,629.The S&P 500dropped 2.6% while theNasdaqwas 3% lower.

"Amazon fires an emergency, say Merkel and Macron","This video can not be played Members of Brazil's indigenous Mura tribe vow to defend their land The French and German leaders say the huge number of fires in Brazil's Amazon rainforest is an international crisis which must be discussed at this weekend's G7 summit. German Chancellor Angela Merkel said the ""acute emergency"" belonged on the agenda, agreeing with French President Emmanuel Macron's earlier rallying cry. ""Our house is burning,"" he tweeted. Environmental groups say the fires are linked to Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's policies, which he denies. Mr Bolsonaro has also accused Mr Macron of meddling for ""political gain"". He said calls to discuss the fires at the G7 summit in Biarritz, France, which Brazil is not participating in, evoke ""a misplaced colonialist mindset"". The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. It is also home to about three million species of plants and animals, and one million indigenous people. In graphics: How bad are the Amazon fires? 'Football pitch' of Amazon forest lost every minute Satellite data published by the National Institute for Space Research (Inpe) has shownan increase of 85% this year in fires across Brazil,external, most of them in the Amazon region. It is the highest number of fires in Brazil since 2010. Conservationists say Mr Bolsonaro has encouraged loggers and farmers to clear the land. Mr Bolsonaro has suggested that non-governmental organisations (NGOs) started the fires, but admitted he had no evidence for this claim. In comments on Thursday, he acknowledged that farmers might be involved in setting fires in the region, according to Reuters news agency. Environmental groups have called for protests in cities across Brazil on Friday to demand action to combat the fires. Mr Macron, who will host the G7 summit of leading industrial nations at the weekend, warned that the health of the Amazon was a matter of international concern. ""Our house is burning. Literally. The Amazon - the lungs which produce 20% of our planet's oxygen - is on fire,""Mr Macron tweeted,external, using the hashtag #ActForTheAmazon. ""It is an international crisis. Members of the G7 summit, let's discuss this emergency."" This video can not be played One campaigner called the forest fires a ""vicious cycle"" Mrs Merkel described the fires as ""shocking and threatening"" and said she was convinced the issue should be on the G7's agenda, her spokesman said. Mr Bolsonaro responded by accusing the French president of using a Brazilian domestic issue for ""personal political gain"". Smoke from fires burning in the Amazon can be seen from space ""The French president's suggestion that Amazonian issues be discussed at the G7 without the participation of the countries of the region evokes a misplaced colonialist mindset, which does not belong in the 21st Century,"" he wrote on social media. Brazil wildfires prompt 'prayers' for the Amazon rainforest Is the honeymoon period over for Brazil's Bolsonaro? UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has also said he is ""deeply concerned"" about the fires in the Amazon. ""In the midst of the global climate crisis, we cannot afford more damage to a major source of oxygen and biodiversity. The Amazon must be protected,"" he tweeted. Analysis by Daniel Gallas, BBC News, Sao Paulo Brazilian presidents shrugging off international concern about the Amazon is nothing new. Others before Mr Bolsonaro have dismissed international NGOs and European leaders as foreign meddlers into national affairs. But Mr Bolsonaro has taken this to a new level by suggesting NGOs may be responsible for encouraging wildfires to sabotage him. His words may shock some international audiences, but they ring true to his supporters at home, where he remains a popular leader. Surprisingly the one reproving voice that could influence this debate is that of Brazilian farmers. One would think that they would support policies to promote more farming in the Amazon. But some agricultural leaders fear Mr Bolsonaro's poor handling of Brazil's image abroad could hurt exports of soybeans and beef. Some farmers have already urged a change of tone from the government. These are voices the president may be open to hearing. Mr Bolsonaro has said that the country is not equipped to fight the fires. ""The Amazon is bigger than Europe, how will you fight criminal fires in such an area?"" he asked reporters as he left the presidential residence on Thursday. ""We do not have the resources for that."" The Amazon rainforest covers an estimated 5.5m sq km (2,100,000 sq mi), about half the size of Europe. During his campaign, Mr Bolsonaro pledged to limit fines for damaging the rainforest and to weaken the influence of the environmental agency. He also suggested that Brazil could pull out of the 2015 Paris Agreement on climate change, saying its requirements compromise Brazil's sovereignty over the Amazon region. This video can not be played President Bolsonaro accuses NGOs of starting Amazon wildfires Recently he has suggested that NGOs may have started fires as revenge for his government slashing their funding. Asked on Thursday who was responsible, he said: ""The Indians, do you want me to blame the Indians? Do you want me to blame the Martians?... Everyone is a suspect, but the biggest suspects are NGOs."" When asked if there was any proof of this, he replied: ""Did I accuse NGOs directly? I just said I suspect them."" Mr Bolsonaro has further angered those concerned over the spike in fires by brushing off the latest data. He argued that it was the season of the ""queimada"", when farmers burn land to clear it before planting. However, Inpe has noted that the number of fires is not in line with those normally reported during the dry season. It is not the first time that Mr Bolsonaro has cast doubt on figures suggesting that the Amazon is deteriorating rapidly. Last month,he accused Inpe's director of lying about the scale of deforestationthere. It came after Inpe published data showing an 88% increase in deforestation in the Amazon in June compared with the same month a year ago. The director of the agency laterannounced that he was being sacked amid the row. Climate activists and conservationists have been scathing about the Bolsonaro government and its policies, which favour development over conservation. They say that since President Bolsonaro took office, the Amazon rainforest has suffered losses at an accelerated rate. Their anger was further fuelled by satellite data showing a steep rise in fires in the Amazon region this year. Environmental group Greenpeace said Mr Bolsonaro's encouragement to farmers to clear swathes of rainforest led to two days of deliberate blazes nearly two weeks ago which are now out of control. Forest campaigner Juman Kubba told the BBC that world powers had to stop trade deals involving countries in the Amazon region until the rainforest was protected. The figures and satellite images showing most of the state of Roraima, in northern Brazil, covered by smoke have shocked many Brazilians andtriggered a global Twitter trend under the hashtag #prayforamazonia. This video can not be played How is the rainforest helping to limit global warming? US space agency Nasa, meanwhile, has said thatoverall fire activity across the Amazon basin this year has been close to the average,externalcompared to the past 15 years. Wildfires often occur in the dry season in Brazil but they are also deliberately started in efforts to illegally deforest land for cattle ranching. ""The dry season creates the favourable conditions for the use and spread of fire, but starting a fire is the work of humans, either deliberately or by accident,"" Inpe researcher Alberto Setzer told Reuters news agency. Ricardo Mello, head of the WWF Amazon Programme, said the fires were ""a consequence of the increase in deforestation seen in recent figures"". This article initially stated there was a record number of fires in Brazil this year. After more satellite data was made accessible, it has been updated to reflect the fact the fires are instead the worst since 2010.

Tower block flat fire near site of Grenfell blaze,"This video can not be played A witness filmed smoke coming from a flat in the tower block in Notting Hill, with Grenfell tower seen in the foreground A fire broke out in a high-rise flat a short distance from the site of the Grenfell Tower disaster. Ten fire engines and 70 firefighters were sent to the scene in Darfield Way, the London Fire Brigade said. The fire on the 12th floor of Markland House was brought under control by 12:55 BST and no injuries have been reported. Its cause is not yet known. The block of flats is under a mile from Grenfell Towerwhere seventy-two people died on 14 June 2017. About 70 firefighters were called to the tower block in Darfield Way, Notting Hill Resident Dhin Chittenden said she cried as she ran down the steps from her flat on the 11th floor of the tower block. The 26-year-old receptionist, who has lived in the building with her husband for a month, said she was already fearful about another Grenfell Tower-type tragedy before the fire broke out. ""I kept thinking about that. If it's happened somewhere else then it could happen again,"" she said. Billy Hunt, who had been sleeping after a night shift but was woken by the smell, said he did not feel safe living in the tower block. Mr Hunt, who knocked on neighbours' doors on his way out to alert them to the blaze, said he heard no alarms, adding: ""They should be going off all over the place, especially after Grenfell."" The 57-year-old, who has lived in Markland House for 27 years, said someone told him the fire hose had only reached the fifth floor, and called that ""ridiculous"". Around 70 firefighters tackled the blaze on a 12th floor balcony Samantha Findley, 41, smelled what she thought was burning plastic in the tower block before immediately fleeing her 10th floor flat. ""I smelled it. So I thought 'let me get out, I'm out'. I grabbed my keys, my phone. I'm out. I'm not seeing where it is or anything. I'm out."" Miguel Alves, who survived the Grenfell Tower blaze in 2017, was passing the area when he saw fire engines and police. He said: ""I feel shocked because it's only 200 metres or 300 or 400 metres anyway from Grenfell Tower. It's on the same area. It's difficult to believe something happened again on the same area."" London Ambulance Service urged people living near the scene of the fire to keep their windows shut. A cordon is in place around the tower and a roll-call of residents was taken to ensure everyone was out of the building. London Fire Brigade policy states,external: ""If the fire isn't in your own flat and your flat is not affected by smoke from a fire elsewhere in the building, it's often safer to stay put.""

Eddie Stobart chief leaves as shares suspended,"Eddie Stobart has suspended trading in its shares and announced that its chief executive will stand down with immediate effect, as the firm looks into accounting discrepancies. The firm also warned its results for the first half of 2019 would be ""significantly lower"" than forecast. The transport company, known for its green and red lorries, revealed a Â£2m error in its 2018 results last month. A review of past accounts uncovered the problem. The review is being undertaken by chief financial officer, Anoop Kang, who joined in April, alongside auditors PwC. It found that in 2018 operating profits were overstated by about 4%. Publication of the firm's results for the six months to 31 May has also been delayed, They were due to be released on 29 August, but are now expected in early September. The firm warned that profits for that six-month period were likely to be revised down from recent projections, and that it is ""applying a more prudent approach to revenue recognition"". The group's dividend policy would also be reviewed, it said. In December last year, Eddie Stobart announced that PwC had been appointed as its auditor, replacing KPMG. KPMG resigned from the role,stating in a letter,externalthat there had been a ""breakdown"" in the relationship between the firms, and citing ""difficulties in obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence,"" although that information was ""ultimately obtained"". Eddie Stobart have declined to comment on the letter. How did Eddie Stobart become so famous? Outgoing chief executive Alex Laffey, who spent four years at Eddie Stobart, will be replaced by Sebastien Desreumaux. Mr Desreumaux, formerly head of the group's retail delivery arm iForce, joined the company in July 2018. The accounting revisions are likely to add to pressure on high-profile investment manager Neil Woodford, who is the largest shareholder in Eddie Stobart, with a 22.9% stake. In June this year, Mr Woodfordsuspended trading in his largest fundafter rising numbers of investors asked for their money back. Eddie Stobart shares, listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), a less regulated alternative to the main FTSE exchanges, have nearly halved over the past year. Founded by Edward Stobart in 1970, the firm operates 2,700 vehicles and 43 logistical hubs in the UK and Europe, and employs around 6,600 people, according to its website. Its distinctive lorries are a mainstay on British motorways, while its merchandise spin-off offers a wide range of branded goods including model trucks, teddy bears, watches and wrapping paper.

Fringe's female performers 'sexually harassed',"Lizzie said one man ""moved his hand, quite forcefully, up my skirt"" Women working on shows at the Edinburgh Festival Fringe have reported facing sexual harassment on a daily basis while out promoting their performances, the BBC has been told. Some reported being groped, while others said lewd comments had left them feeling vulnerable. The actors' union Equity said it was receiving reports of ""more and more"" incidents each year. Police Scotland said it had not received any reports of harassment. It said it had an increased police presence. It is estimated that more than 30,000 male and female artists perform at the Fringe each year, across 3,500 shows. Lizzie - whose surname we are not using - said that the sexual harassment she received made her alter her behaviour to try to avoid unwanted attention, while continuing to promote her show. She told the Victoria Derbyshire programme that while handing out flyers, one man ""pretended to brush something off my thigh and then moved his hand, quite forcefully, up my skirt"". She said on another occasion she was ""cornered"" by three men, who appeared to be twice her age, who said they would ""only buy a ticket or take a flyer in exchange for my phone number"". On other occasions, men would make comments about her appearance or ""invade"" her personal space ""so their grope could go unnoticed"", she added. Lizzie said she wished handing out flyers was not necessary, but that it was by far the most effective means of selling tickets for lesser-known productions. Fi said she felt under pressure to ""laugh off"" harassment Most of the abuse is thought to take place on the Royal Mile - a busy street at the heart of the city. Fi said she had felt under pressure to ""laugh off"" any harassment she endured, such as having her bottom pinched, because she was ""trying to get customers"". And one woman, who did not wish to be named, said that while handing out flyers: ""A man stopped me on the street and started staring at me. When I asked him if he wanted a flyer he said, 'no, I just want to stare at you'."" Another woman said many like her felt pressured into putting up with the unacceptable behaviour of show reviewers - who can make a great difference in getting more people to watch their performances. She said: ""One reviewer would come up to me while I was flyering every day, being overly complimentary and holding a review over my head for the whole run of the Fringe. ""He made me feel really uncomfortable."" Performers and showgoers flock to Edinburgh throughout August Police Scotland said it had set up two mobile police stations for the duration of the month and had increased high-visibility patrols. It added that it had not received any complaints regarding sexual harassment. The actors' union, Equity, said many female performers had become accustomed to abuse - but it encouraged them to report all incidents to police. Its president, Maureen Beattie, said a ""slight level of hysteria"" at the Fringe ""seems to release this kind of underbelly of bad behaviour"". ""It is completely and utterly unacceptable. ""We are a workforce, and you must respect us,"" she added. Maureen Beattie said Equity had seen ""more and more"" reports of harassment each year ""Somebody recently had their bum grabbed, and that's supposed to be all right?"" she questioned. ""Would you do that to anyone else who was out on the street?"" Edinburgh Festival's Fringe Society, which supports the running of the month-long event, said: ""Everyone who is part of the Fringe - be they a performer, member of the crew, producer, audience member, critic and so on - has the right to feel safe and supported."" It added that it ""takes matters of this nature very seriously"" and urged those who experienced inappropriate behaviour to contact police.

Bank holiday travellers warned of delays,"This video can not be played How do you avoid holiday traffic jams? Drivers are being warned of hour-long delays on some roads as traffic builds over the August bank holiday weekend. Rush-hour motorists in much of the UK awoke to early morning fog, although conditions were expected to improve. Congestion is expected to build between 11:00 BST and 18:30 as millions take to the roads. Rail travellers have also been warned to expect delays, with the closure of London King's Cross and reduced services on parts of the rail network. This video can not be played King's Cross station closed over bank holiday London North Eastern Railway (LNER) issued passengers with a ""do not travel warning"" for the route between London and Scotland, with the line between the capital and Peterborough closed completely for the first time in 20 years on Saturday and Sunday. It means potential disruption for people heading to events like the Ashes at Headingley, the Leeds Festival and the Ebor Festival in York. The RAC said the best time to travel on Friday would be after 21:00 BST.

This is up from 7.3 million for the August bank holiday in 2018 and the most since the research began in 2012. Among the popular events on this weekend are Notting Hill Carnival in west London; Edinburgh Fringe festival; Reading and Leeds Festivals; Manchester Pride and Creamfields, near Warrington in Cheshire. All of the worst-affected routes over the bank holiday are in England, according to traffic data company Inrix. There is no bank holiday this weekend in Scotland.

Inrix said the section between Warrington and Wigan, would be likely to have 21-minute delays on Saturday afternoon, while the M25 between Gatwick Airport and the M40 could have a 26-minute delay on Sunday afternoon. On Monday the M6 southbound between Wigan and Stafford could have delays of an hour, with traffic particularly bad at about 14:15. Delay forecasts are based on previous summer getaways as well as planned road closures and events taking place over the weekend. Most roadworks will have been lifted ahead of the bank holiday Highways England said most work would have been completed or lifted with 97% of motorways ""free from roadworks"". But it said more than 50 sets of roadworks would stay in place.

Grenfell bonfire film outcome 'appalling',"The model was burned at a bonfire party in south London on 3 November 2018 A court's move to clear a man who filmed a cardboard effigy of Grenfell Tower being burned on a bonfire has been branded ""appalling"". Paul Bussetti, 47, was cleared on Thursday of posting""grossly offensive"" material at a London partyin 2018. Campaign group Justice 4 Grenfell said ""no justice had been served for the 72 people who had needlessly died"". Mr Bussetti was found not guilty after magistrates said they could not be sure the film was taken by him. The clip of the cardboard building, which had ""Grenfell Tower"" written on it, was recorded at a party attended by about 30 people in south London on 3 November, Westminster Magistrates' Court heard. It was later uploaded to YouTube and sparked outrage, with a relative of one of the 72 people who died in the blaze on 14 June 2017 calling it ""revolting"". Moyra Samuels, of Justice 4 Grenfell, said she was appalled by the court's decision Moyra Samuels, of Justice 4 Grenfell, said: ""I am just appalled. ""For someone who has caused so much offence by mocking the needless deaths of 72 people... if they cannot be found guilty of causing offence, then it raises questions about whether the judicial system is able to give justice to the bereaved."" Paul Bussetti told the court he had never intended the video to go further At the end of the two-day trial, defence barrister Mark Summers QC revealed he had just been made aware of evidence that a second video was recorded. He argued it meant there was ""absolutely no way"" to know which piece of footage had made its way onto YouTube and gone viral. On this, Ms Samuels said: ""This case highlights a weakness within the police's role in making this case as well as the CPS. Why was this evidence presented so late? ""I believe the outcome of the case would have been different if this evidence was presented earlier."" Mr Bussetti, of South Norwood, told magistrates the effigy had been created by his friend, and the characters featured on the model were meant to represent ""the majority of people that were at the party"", not people who died in the disaster. The father-of-two said he shared the footage with about 20 people on two WhatsApp groups but he had never intended it to go further. The CPS has been contacted for comment.

A North Korean defector's 'death by indifference',"Han Sung-ok has the recognition in death she never received in life Han Sung-ok, 42, seemed determined to pick through nearly every lettuce on the market stand. She turned each one over and examined it while her six-year-old son clambered on the fence nearby. The vegetable seller in the southern Seoul suburb looked on, annoyed. This was one picky customer and she didn't even buy a lot of vegetables - only one or two items for as little as she could pay. On this occasion it was a lettuce for 500 won (about $0.40; Â£0.33). Uttering only a few words, Han handed over her money and left with her son. Just a few weeks later, both were dead. Having fled food shortages in her native North Korea and dreaming of a new life, Han and her son are believed to have starved to death in one of the wealthiest cities in Asia. Their bodies lay undiscovered for two months until someone came to read the water meter and noticed a bad smell. Mother and son were found apart on the floor. The only food in their tiny rented apartment was a bag of red pepper chilli flakes. One of the last people to see her alive was the vegetable vendor in the street outside her apartment complex. She saw her in spring - around the same time the police say Han withdrew the last 3,858 won ($3.20; Â£2.60) in her bank account. ""Thinking back, it gives me shivers,"" she said. ""At first I hated her for being picky, but now I think about it, I am sorry for her. ""If only she'd asked nicely, I would have just given her some lettuce."" She's one of many we spoke to who are asking questions which begin with the phrase ""If only"". If only the authorities had noticed her plight. If only the government had done more to help defectors. If only she'd asked for help. Their horrific deaths have prompted outrage and anger and a great deal of soul searching. Han's journey to freedom as a North Korean defector should have made her remarkable, but in this city of 10 million people, she appears to have been invisible. Very few people knew her. Those who did, say she spoke very little and would walk around almost disguising herself with a hat and avoiding all eye contact. But this city knows her now. Her photograph has been placed among flowers and gifts in a makeshift shrine in Gwanghwamun in the centre of Seoul. Dozens of mourners are shouting her name through loudspeakers, though few there knew her personally. ""It just doesn't make sense that after going through all that hardship and challenges to come to South and she dies of starvation. It breaks my heart,"" one defector mourning at the shrine told us. ""When I first heard the news, it was too absurd to believe. ""This cannot happen in South Korea. Why did nobody know about this until they died?"" But one of the reasons no-one knew is because Han appears to have wanted to stay hidden. Escaping North Korea can feel almost impossible. More people have attempted to scale Mount Everest this year than leave the impoverished state. Even if you get past the soldiers and surveillance at the border, defectors face a journey of thousands of miles through China. Their aim is to get to a South Korean embassy in a third country. Usually in Thailand, Cambodia or Vietnam. But getting through China is a huge risk. If caught, they're sent back to North Korea and could face a lifetime of hard labour in one of its notorious gulags. Female defectors who hand money to disreputable brokers hoping for help often find themselves imprisoned and sold as brides or sex workers. In Han's case, it is difficult to verify how and when she left North Korea. Two defectors who claim to have spoken to her believe she was sold to a Chinese man as a bride and had a son with him. We cannot verify this account. But she arrived in Seoul alone, 10 years ago, and certainly didn't open up to many of her classmates at the Hanawon centre. All defectors face a mandatory 12-week basic education at such a centre, affiliated with Seoul's Unification Ministry, to adjust to life in the South. Han's class was one of the largest since the centre had been set up. It had more than 300 people in it. They all knew how hard it was to get through China. ""I knew she went to China first. I knew because even when she laughed and was bright, there was a dark side,"" one of her classmates told us. ""I asked her what was wrong but she brushed me off. ""I'm the type of person not to push too much on personal matters, so I said, 'I don't know what it is, but if you go outside, as long as you work hard you can live a good life. South Korea is a place that you get what you work for. You're young and beautiful, you won't have a hard life. Whatever you do don't be ashamed and live with your head up'."" Han appeared to do well in her new life at first. The authorities help defectors find subsidised apartments, and she along with six of her classmates were settled in the same neighbourhood, Gwanak-gu. ""She was so pretty and feminine,"" her classmate said. ""I believe she was the second person after me in our class to get a job. At first, she worked briefly at a coffee shop in Seoul University. Even there, I heard she made a good impression. What we remember is that she was smart, feminine and we thought she was someone who would be able to take care of herself. ""We didn't expect this to happen."" Like all defectors Han had help finding a new place to live in Seoul It is difficult to find out how, from this promising start, Han ended up destitute. She was so private. Two defectors in her apartment complex told us they believe she had persuaded her Chinese husband to move to South Korea. As a family, they relocated south to Tongyeong where he worked at a shipyard. She had a second son who was born with learning difficulties. Eventually it is thought her husband went back to China without her, taking the eldest son with him. She was left alone with no job and caring for a disabled child. Her neighbours say she missed her older son terribly. She moved back to where her South Korean life had started - the subsidised housing apartments in Gwanak-gu in Seoul. She applied for help at the community centre in October last year and received 100,000 won ($94) each month in child allowance.  12weeks of adaptation training $6,000-$32,400settlement benefits (depending on size of household) $13,300-$19,100Housing subsidy Freeeducation in public schools and universities It is at this time that Han and her son appear to have fallen through a gap in the welfare system. She could have claimed much more than the universal child benefit. A single parent is entitled to six to seven times that amount each month. But that would have required a divorce certificate and it is our understanding that she didn't have one. The community centre staff said they visited her apartment for their annual welfare check in April but she wasn't home. They were not aware of her son's condition. She hadn't paid the rent of her subsidised apartment or her bills for some time. In some other countries this would have raised a red flag to social services. It doesn't appear to have happened in South Korea. She was also no longer eligible for help as a North Korean defector because the protection period of five years had expired. When they gathered at the shrine in Gwanghwamun, in front of Han's smiling portrait, the debate among the defector community continued. ""This is absurd, how ironic a North Korean escapes hunger and comes to South to die of starvation!"" ""What did the South Korean government do? This is death by abandonment."" ""This is a death by indifference."" ""Where is the system, where is the police?"" Tributes are left to Han and her son from people who never knew them However her former classmate said this is not how she wants her friend to be remembered. ""I don't want to cause a row, pointing fingers at whose fault this is. We should just come together as one and vow to never let this happen again. It really hurts my heart how things are turning out, how people are taking advantage of this for their purpose."" So what lessons can be learned? The last reports we received about Han from a neighbour claim she was distracted and anxious. A far cry from the bright woman who arrived at the Hanawon centre 10 years ago. At no point did Han ask for help. But should help have come to her? Mental health care for North Korean refugees is one area that could be improved, according to defectors and psychiatrists. Most defectors have suffered a number of human rights violations and trauma ranging from extreme hunger, sexual assault, being forced to witness public executions and the fear of human traffickers in China. The rate of psychological trauma is higher among those who have travelled through China, according to a study by the National Human Rights Commission of Korea. This video can not be played Four defectors talk about what life is like in North Korea Dr Jun Jin-yong from the National Centre for Mental Health said it is common for defectors to suffer anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. But because there are so many stigmas associated with mental health in the North, many aren't aware that they're suffering or that help is available. Anyone suffering mental illness in North Korea is sent to a hospital in the mountains called Number 49. Most never return. It is perhaps understandable that North Koreans are unaware that psychiatric help is available. ""We need services that are more defector-friendly and to guide defectors to find these services,"" Dr Jun said. ""Defectors have a lower approachability than South Koreans on mental health issues because they have a prejudice against mental health. So we should continue to advertise mental health support to defectors so that they can receive help."" According to a settlement survey of North Korean refugees in South Korea, about 15% admit to having suicidal thoughts. That's about 10% higher than the South Korean average. Most say economic hardship is the main reason they feel unable to cope. Joseph Park built a new life in Seoul, but many defectors struggle to make their way There is also more of a sense of community in North Korea. We've been told that, north of the border, Han and her son would not have been allowed to shut themselves away in their apartment. Joseph Park who also escaped from North Korea 15 years ago, decided to run coffee shops in Seoul to cultivate a community for defectors. He believes the shocking deaths of Han and her son were not caused by a lack of government policy, but can be partly blamed on certain aspects of South Korean culture. ""South Korea is a society where you can live without relationships. In North Korea you need relationships to survive,"" he told us. ""I think that's the big difference. In South Korea, you can survive without having a relationship with your neighbour. But in North Korea, you need relations with your neighbour and the system forces you to have relations as well. ""For example, in North Korean schools, if someone doesn't come to class, the teacher would send all the classmates to the missing student's house. So naturally, there can't be anyone left out. In North Korea it would be not possible for someone to be out of touch for a month like that."" Thousands of North Koreans live hugely successful and fulfilling lives in the South. But it does require them to change and to adapt to their neighbours' ways. Defectors have told numerous studies they are made to feel different, and face discrimination. The results of a post-mortem on Han and her son are expected soon, but South Korea's Unification Ministry is already examining Han's case in the hope lessons can be learned. What is clear is that those from North and South often still feel separate  - even when they live in the same city. Perhaps Han's story should give pause for thought for all in Seoul in the hope that this society will never again have to ask itself, if only.

Girl's before and after school photos go viral,"When asked what she had been up to to get her new uniform in such a ""state"", Lucie, five, said: ""Nothing much"" Before-and-after photos of a five-year-old's first day back at school have been shared thousands of times online after her mother posted the ""really funny"" images on Facebook. Lucie, from East Renfrewshire, ""likes to be clean"" and looked immaculate before she left home, mother Jill said. But by the end of a day of playing with her friends, her clothes were ""a mess"". The photos were liked more than 10,000 times after Jill agreed to let a local newspaper put them on their page. ""She absolutely loves school and this was her first day in P2 so she absolutely loved having her new things on,"" Jill said. When Jill saw the ""state"" of her daughter on Monday afternoon, she asked what Lucie had been up to. ""Nothing much,"" Lucie said. ""The wonders of primary two,"" Jill said. ""The teachers are really good, they do a lot of active learning and things with them - so I take it it was down to that."" ""She'd obviously had a really fun day,"" she added. Jill said she often likes to take pictures ""off-cue"" because they are less ""posed"". ""I knew if I'd asked her for a picture, she would have said no, because of the mess of her. She likes to be clean and things,"" she added. Harper, four, also looked slightly less tidy by the end of her first day at school Jill, a mother of three, sent Lucie's father the photo after he asked how her first day back had been. ""He thought it was really funny so we shared it with friends and family on our Facebook,"" Jill said. After that, they sent the photos toBarrhead News,external, which said the images were its ""favourite"" set of back-to-school pictures. ""I don't think they quite anticipated how it would spread,"" Jill said. She said Lucie has ""taken it in her stride"" and has been telling everyone ""Oh, I'm famous"". ""I think she's still just a bit too young to understand,"" Jill added. Lots of parents responded to the post with their own before-and-after photos. Laura's four-year-old daughter Harper was ""so excited"" for her first day at school near their home in Broxburn - and looked a little worse for wear by home time.

University's 'bold' move to pay back slave profits,"Glasgow University has agreed to raise and spend Â£20m in reparations after discovering it benefited by millions of pounds from the slave trade. It is believed to be the first institution in the UK to implement such a ""programme of restorative justice"". The money will be raised and spent over the next 20 years on setting up and running the Glasgow-Caribbean Centre for Development Research. It will be managed in partnership with the University of the West Indies. The centre, to be co-located in Glasgow and the Caribbean, will sponsor research work and raise awareness of the history of slavery and its impact around the world. Prof Sir Hilary Beckles, vice-chancellor of the University of the West Indies, said the university's decision was a ""bold, moral, historic step"" in recognising the slavery aspect of its past. The University of Glasgow benefited from millions of pounds of slave trade profits The move comes almost a year after a study by the university looked at thousands of donations it received in the 18th and 19th Centuries.,external It found many were from people whose wealth came from slavery. University bosses said that although it never owned enslaved people or traded in the goods they produced, it was clear it had received significant financial support. In total, the money it received is estimated as having a present day value of between Â£16.7m and Â£198m. The University of Glasgow is one of the oldest in the world but its new building was completed in the late 19th Century Donations to the 1866-1880 campaign to build the university's current campus at Gilmorehill found 23 people who gave money had some financial links to the New World slave trade. Dr Stephen Mullen, co-author of the report, ""Slavery, Abolition and the University of Glasgow"", said the city of Glasgow in the 18th Century contained major tobacco lords and the sugar aristocracy, many of whom were university alumni. He said the university benefited greatly from gifts and bequests from people associated with slave economies in Jamaica and the Caribbean. Dr Mullen said the research was the first report of its type in British history and Glasgow was the first university to acknowledge financial income from slavery on such a scale. Dr Stephen Mullen said he was not expecting the global reaction his report received He said reaction to the report had been positive. ""I don't think I was expecting the global reaction but I knew it was an important, landmark piece of work,"" he said. 'Glasgow should own up to its dark secret' Since the report into Glasgow's past, other universities have begun to investigate whether they benefited from the slave trade. Cambridge University has started its own investigation and will consider how it might make reparation for any links to the legacy of the slave trade. This video can not be played Many streets in Glasgow city centre are named after slave-owning plantation owners. Bristol University is to advertise for a permanent academic post examining the history of slavery and overseeing its efforts to uncover its historical links to the trade. The University of East London's chair of governors, Geoff Thompson, thinks reparations should take the form of a Â£100m fund for BAME (Black, Asian and Minority Ethnic) students. Speaking last year, he said: ""It is about how seriously we take the past to inform our future, and what we can do to help change lives."" However, Glasgow's decision to begin a programme of reparations has not been universally welcomed. Author and academic Joanna Williams said the past is the past Author and academic Joanna Williams said: ""For me, the number one problem with this is that it suggests people who are alive today bear some historical responsibility for what their ancestors did in the past. ""[These were] truly barbaric and criminal acts, but to suggest that people alive today are responsible for the sins of their ancestors is a step too far."" She added: ""It also suggests that other people who are alive today are victims of what happened to their ancestors. There comes a point we all need to move on from that and say that the past is the past."" From about 1500 to about 1865, millions of Africans were enslaved and transported across the Atlantic by Europeans and Americans as a labour force to work, especially on plantations Ships carried millions of enslaved Africans across, with the vast majority going to the Caribbean, and returned to Europe with goods such as sugar, cotton, coffee and tobacco The Abolition of Slave Trade Act, which made it illegal to trade slaves throughout the British Empire and banned British ships from involvement in the trade, was passed by the British Parliament on 25 March 1807 Source:The International Slavery Museum,external A ceremony will be held later to mark the signing of the final Memorandum of Understanding between Glasgow University and the University of the West Indies. Poet Jackie Kay, the third Scottish Makar or poet laureate, will read a specially-commissioned poem and an exhibition looking at the University of Glasgow's links to the slave trade will be officially opened in the University's Chapel. The ceremony coincides with Unesco's International Day of Remembrance of the Slave Trade. Donations from people with links to the slave trade included Â£100 from Archibald Smith II to Glasgow University in 1870 Glasgow University's research found it had received ""significant financial gifts and support from people who derived some, or occasionally much, of their wealth from slavery."" However, it noted that many of its staff ""adopted a clear anti-slavery position"" during the era of slavery. It campaigned against the institution of racial slavery through petitions sent to Parliament and awarded an honorary degree to William Wilberforce - the leading figure of abolition - in 1791. The slave trade was abolished by an Act of Parliament in 1807 but slavery remained legal in the British Colonies until 1838.

"Bank holiday travellers warned of delaysAs millions prepare to hit the roads and railways, where will it be busiest over the weekend?England","This video can not be played How do you avoid holiday traffic jams? Drivers are being warned of hour-long delays on some roads as traffic builds over the August bank holiday weekend. Rush-hour motorists in much of the UK awoke to early morning fog, although conditions were expected to improve. Congestion is expected to build between 11:00 BST and 18:30 as millions take to the roads. Rail travellers have also been warned to expect delays, with the closure of London King's Cross and reduced services on parts of the rail network. This video can not be played King's Cross station closed over bank holiday London North Eastern Railway (LNER) issued passengers with a ""do not travel warning"" for the route between London and Scotland, with the line between the capital and Peterborough closed completely for the first time in 20 years on Saturday and Sunday. It means potential disruption for people heading to events like the Ashes at Headingley, the Leeds Festival and the Ebor Festival in York. The RAC said the best time to travel on Friday would be after 21:00 BST. Its survey of 1,900 drivers suggested about 16.5 million journeys would be made for holidays and day trips between Friday and Monday. 23 - 26 August 11:00 - 18:30Friday 10:30 - 14:00Saturday 12:30 - 14:00Sunday 12:00 - 14:30Monday A survey by tourism agency VisitEngland suggested that 8.6 million Britons were planning an overnight trip in the UK this weekend. This is up from 7.3 million for the August bank holiday in 2018 and the most since the research began in 2012. Among the popular events on this weekend are Notting Hill Carnival in west London; Edinburgh Fringe festival; Reading and Leeds Festivals; Manchester Pride and Creamfields, near Warrington in Cheshire. All of the worst-affected routes over the bank holiday are in England, according to traffic data company Inrix. There is no bank holiday this weekend in Scotland. Inrix said drivers should prepare for delays of about 55 minutes on Friday afternoon on the M25 anticlockwise between J4 at Bromley and J1 Swanscombe. The M6 north between Knutsford and Ashton-in-Makerfield is expected to see similar delays. Inrix said the section between Warrington and Wigan, would be likely to have 21-minute delays on Saturday afternoon, while the M25 between Gatwick Airport and the M40 could have a 26-minute delay on Sunday afternoon. On Monday the M6 southbound between Wigan and Stafford could have delays of an hour, with traffic particularly bad at about 14:15. Delay forecasts are based on previous summer getaways as well as planned road closures and events taking place over the weekend. Most roadworks will have been lifted ahead of the bank holiday Highways England said most work would have been completed or lifted with 97% of motorways ""free from roadworks"". But it said more than 50 sets of roadworks would stay in place. A spokeswoman said: ""To help people have smoother journeys we have removed as many roadworks as possible, leaving only essential work in place. However, it is not possible to remove all roadworks due to safety reasons."" The longest sets of roadworks staying in place between Friday and Monday include: M4 J7 to J12 (near Wokingham and Reading) - 32 miles M6 J13 to J15 (near Stafford) - 18 miles M20 J2 to J7 (near Maidstone) - 16 miles M27 J4 to J11 (near Southampton) - 15 miles M1 J13 to J15 (near Milton Keynes)  - 15 miles M6 J2 to J4 (near Birmingham - 14 miles Drivers heading towards Wales will also find roadworks on the M48 westbound entry slip at J1, near Aust and Chepstow.

"Ryanair rated 'greedy and arrogant' by customersRyanair has been rated worst for customer service out of 100 big British brands, according to Which?.","Thousand of Ryanair flights were cancelled or delayed due to strikes last summer Ryanair has come bottom in an annual Which? survey rating the customer services of 100 popular UK brands. The budget airline achieved a customer satisfaction score of only 45% for 2019. It is the sixth year in a row that Ryanair has come last. Given a choice of 50 terms to describe the airline, many respondents picked ""greedy"", ""sneaky"" and ""arrogant"". It comes as Ryanair pilots in the UK strike for a second day over pay and conditions. The BBC has contacted the airline for comment. Ryanair flights take off despite pilots' strike Ryanair compensation claims to go to court What's going on with my holiday flights? The Which? survey asked around 4,000 members of the public to rate the customer services at up to three of 100 well-known brands. This included how the companies made them feel, how helpful and knowledgeable their staff were, and how well they handled complaints. After Ryanair the worst performers included Scottish Power, BT, TalkTalk and Virgin Media. Words used to describe Scottish Power included ""arrogant"", while respondents said that BT's staff were ""aloof"" and that Virgin Media was ""greedy"". Other airlines did badly too, with British Airways coming 83rd on the list and EasyJet ranked 79th. Marks and Spencer, which came second in the survey, was described as having ""well-mannered"" staff Meanwhile, telephone and online bank First Direct came top, followed by kitchenware retailer Lakeland, supermarket chains Marks & Spencer and Waitrose, and book retailer Waterstones. ""It's those firms that have gone out of their way to prioritise customer service as a key part of their business that have topped the survey,"" said Harry Rose, editor of Which? magazine. He told the BBC that retailers had done particularly well, while service providers such as energy and telecoms companies had struggled. ""There's a bit of complacency in some of these companies,"" Mr Rose said. ""Customers should hold them to higher standards, they shouldn't put up with it."" Ryanair's poor customer service rating comes as its UK pilots stage a 48-hour walkout this week over pay and conditions. Passengers had been braced for disruption, but the carrier said 97% of flights took off as normal on Thursday, the first strike action day. Another 48-hour walkout is planned by the British Airline Pilots Association union in early September to coincide with the end of the summer holidays. Strikes at Ryanair caused thousands of flights to be cancelled or delayed last summer, angering passengers. The airline has so far not compensated customers, saying the strikes amounted to ""extraordinary circumstances"". But in December theCivil Aviation Authority launched legal action against the airline, saying this breached EU law. Mr Rose said: ""Ryanair has never done well in these surveys, but they've been struggling particularly in the last 18 months with the staff strikes and flight cancellations, so the ill-feeling has only intensified.""

Eddie Stobart chief to leave as shares suspended,"Eddie Stobart has suspended trading in its shares and announced that its chief executive will stand down with immediate effect, as the firm looks into accounting discrepancies. The firm also warned its results for the first half of 2019 would be ""significantly lower"" than forecast. The transport company, known for its green and red lorries, revealed a Â£2m error in its 2018 results last month. A review of past accounts uncovered the problem. The review is being undertaken by chief financial officer, Anoop Kang, who joined in April, alongside auditors PwC. It found that in 2018 operating profits were overstated by about 4%. Publication of the firm's results for the six months to 31 May has also been delayed, They were due to be released on 29 August, but are now expected in early September. The firm warned that profits for that six-month period were likely to be revised down from recent projections, and that it is ""applying a more prudent approach to revenue recognition"". The group's dividend policy would also be reviewed, it said. In December last year, Eddie Stobart announced that PwC had been appointed as its auditor, replacing KPMG. KPMG resigned from the role,stating in a letter,externalthat there had been a ""breakdown"" in the relationship between the firms, and citing ""difficulties in obtaining sufficient appropriate audit evidence,"" although that information was ""ultimately obtained"". Eddie Stobart have declined to comment on the letter. How did Eddie Stobart become so famous? Outgoing chief executive Alex Laffey, who spent four years at Eddie Stobart, will be replaced by Sebastien Desreumaux. Mr Desreumaux, formerly head of the group's retail delivery arm iForce, joined the company in July 2018. The accounting revisions are likely to add to pressure on high-profile investment manager Neil Woodford, who is the largest shareholder in Eddie Stobart, with a 22.9% stake. In June this year, Mr Woodfordsuspended trading in his largest fundafter rising numbers of investors asked for their money back. Eddie Stobart shares, listed on the Alternative Investment Market (AIM), a less regulated alternative to the main FTSE exchanges, have nearly halved over the past year. Founded by Edward Stobart in 1970, the firm operates 2,700 vehicles and 43 logistical hubs in the UK and Europe, and employs around 6,600 people, according to its website. Its distinctive lorries are a mainstay on British motorways, while its merchandise spin-off offers a wide range of branded goods including model trucks, teddy bears, watches and wrapping paper.

Its survey of 1,900 drivers suggested about 16.5 million journeys would be made for holidays and day trips between Friday and Monday. 23 - 26 August 11:00 - 18:30Friday 10:30 - 14:00Saturday 12:30 - 14:00Sunday 12:00 - 14:30Monday A survey by tourism agency VisitEngland suggested that 8.6 million Britons were planning an overnight trip in the UK this weekend. This is up from 7.3 million for the August bank holiday in 2018 and the most since the research began in 2012. Among the popular events on this weekend are Notting Hill Carnival in west London; Edinburgh Fringe festival; Reading and Leeds Festivals; Manchester Pride and Creamfields, near Warrington in Cheshire. All of the worst-affected routes over the bank holiday are in England, according to traffic data company Inrix. There is no bank holiday this weekend in Scotland. Inrix said drivers should prepare for delays of about 55 minutes on Friday afternoon on the M25 anticlockwise between J4 at Bromley and J1 Swanscombe. The M6 north between Knutsford and Ashton-in-Makerfield is expected to see similar delays. Inrix said the section between Warrington and Wigan, would be likely to have 21-minute delays on Saturday afternoon, while the M25 between Gatwick Airport and the M40 could have a 26-minute delay on Sunday afternoon. On Monday the M6 southbound between Wigan and Stafford could have delays of an hour, with traffic particularly bad at about 14:15. Delay forecasts are based on previous summer getaways as well as planned road closures and events taking place over the weekend. Most roadworks will have been lifted ahead of the bank holiday Highways England said most work would have been completed or lifted with 97% of motorways ""free from roadworks"". But it said more than 50 sets of roadworks would stay in place. A spokeswoman said: ""To help people have smoother journeys we have removed as many roadworks as possible, leaving only essential work in place. However, it is not possible to remove all roadworks due to safety reasons."" The longest sets of roadworks staying in place between Friday and Monday include: M4 J7 to J12 (near Wokingham and Reading) - 32 miles M6 J13 to J15 (near Stafford) - 18 miles M20 J2 to J7 (near Maidstone) - 16 miles M27 J4 to J11 (near Southampton) - 15 miles M1 J13 to J15 (near Milton Keynes)  - 15 miles M6 J2 to J4 (near Birmingham - 14 miles Drivers heading towards Wales will also find roadworks on the M48 westbound entry slip at J1, near Aust and Chepstow.

'Football pitch' of forest lost every minute,"An area of Amazon rainforest roughly the size of a football pitch is now being cleared every single minute, according to satellite data. The rate of losses has accelerated as Brazil's new right-wing president favours development over conservation. The largest rainforest in the world, the Amazon is a vital carbon store that slows down the pace of global warming. A senior Brazilian official, speaking anonymously, told us his government was encouraging deforestation. Usually by bulldozers, either pushing against the trunks to force the shallow roots out of the ground, or by a pair of the machines advancing with a chain between them. In one vast stretch of recently cleared land, we found giant trees lying on their sides, much of the foliage still green and patches of bare earth drying under a fierce sun. Later, the timber will be cleared and sold or burned, and the land prepared for farming. In other areas, illegal loggers carve new tracks through the undergrowth to reach particularly valuable hardwood trees which they sell on the black market, often to order. Satellite images show a sharp increase in clearances of trees over the first half of this year, since Jair Bolsonaro became president of Brazil, the country that owns most of the Amazon region. The most recent analysis suggests a staggering scale of losses over the past two months in particular, with about a hectare being cleared every minute on average. The single biggest reason to fell trees, according to official figures, is to create new pastures for cattle, and during our visit we saw countless herds grazing on land that used to be rainforest. Over the past decade, previous governments had managed to reduce the clearances with concerted action by federal agencies and a system of fines. But this approach is being overturned by Mr Bolsonaro and his ministers who have criticised the penalties and overseen a dramatic fall in confiscations of timber and convictions for environmental crimes. The forest holds a vast amount of carbon in its billions of trees, accumulated over hundreds or even thousands of years. Every year, the leaves also absorb a huge quantity of carbon dioxide that would otherwise be left in the atmosphere adding to the rise in global temperatures. Jair Bolsonaro swept to power on a populist agenda By one recent estimate, the trees of the Amazon rainforest pulled in carbon dioxide equivalent to the fossil fuel emissions of most of the nine countries that own or border the forest between 1980-2010. The forest is also the richest home to biodiversity on the planet, a habitat for perhaps one-tenth of all species of plants and animals. And it is where one million indigenous people live, hunting and gathering amid the trees. According to a senior Brazilian environment official, the impact is so ""huge"" that he took the risk of giving us an unauthorised interview to bring it to the attention of the world. We had to meet in secret and disguise his face and voice because Mr Bolsonaro has banned his environment staff from talking to the media. Over the course of three hours, a startling inside picture emerged of small, under-resourced teams of government experts passionate about saving the forest but seriously undermined by their own political masters. Farming organisations argue that the network of protected areas of forest is too restrictive Mr Bolsonaro swept to power on a populist agenda backed by agricultural businesses and small farmers, many of whom believe that too much of the Amazon region is protected and that environment staff have too much influence. He has said he wants to weaken the laws protecting the forest and has attacked the civil servants whose job it is to guard the trees. The result, according to the environment official, is that ""it feels like we are the enemies of the Amazon, when in fact we should be seen in a completely different way, as the people trying to protect our ecological heritage for future generations"". ""They don't want us to speak because we'll say the truth, that conservation areas are being invaded and destroyed, there are many people marking out areas that should be protected."" The official believes the figures for deforestation could be even worse than officially recognised. ""There's a government attempt to show the data is wrong, to show the numbers don't portray the reality,"" he told me. Ministers are considering hiring an independent contractor to handle information from satellite images of the region, questioning the work of the current government agency. One million indigenous people live in the forest Also, the rainy season is only now coming to an end, and because deforestation typically takes place in the drier months of the year, the official fears that the pace of losses could pick up speed. ""In truth, it can be even worse,"" he said, because many of the areas recently damaged haven't yet been picked up by satellite images. ""People need to know what's happening because we need allies to fight against invasions, to protect areas, and against deforestation."" We made repeated requests for interviews with the ministers for environment and agriculture but were refused. Earlier this year, Mr Bolsonaro, who's known as the ""Trump of the Tropics"", invited the US president to be a partner in exploiting the resources of the Amazon. Last month, in an interview with BBC Brasil, the environment minister Ricardo Salles, said landowners should be rewarded for preserving forest and that developed nations should foot the bill. And there's an assertive response when voices in the outside world call for the forest to be saved. The president's top security adviser, General Augusto Heleno Pereira, told Bloomberg last month that it was ""nonsense"" that the Amazon was part of the world's heritage. ""The Amazon is Brazilian, the heritage of Brazil and should be dealt with by Brazil for the benefit of Brazil,"" he said. For decades, farming organisations have argued that the network of protected areas of forest, including reserves for indigenous people, is too restrictive for a developing country that needs to create jobs. A leading figure in the farmers' union  in the city of Santarem, a hub for soya and cattle, told me that other countries had cleared their trees for agriculture but now wanted Brazil not to do the same. Vanderley Wegner said that the US and Europe, which buy produce from the Amazon region, have far less stringent controls on their forests, and that Europe ""has very little forest left"" anyway. ""We have to develop the Amazon. More than four million people live here and they need development too, it's a constitutional right of every Brazilian citizen,"" he said.

Brazil wildfires prompt 'prayers' for the Amazon rainforest,"Darkness descends on Sao Paulo at 16:00 (20:00 GMT) due to smoke from forest fires A daytime blackout in a Brazilian city has prompted millions of people to voice their concerns for the welfare of the Amazon rainforest. Sao Paulo was blackened for around an hour on Monday after strong winds and a cold front brought in smoke from forest fires burning in the states of Amazonas and Rondonia, more than 2,700km (1,700 miles) away. Sao Paulo resident Gianvitor Dias told the BBC what it was like in the city during the smoke-filled blackout on Monday afternoon. ""It was as if the day had turned into night,"" he said. ""Everyone here commented, because even on rainy days it doesn't usually get that dark. It was very impressive."" The hashtag #PrayForAmazonia started to be widely used on Tuesday as a result and there have been more than three million tweets since. Allow Twitter content?

So while it may point to one potential reason for the reported increase in forest fires, it's not necessarily a depiction of the present situation. Some of the most popular tweets online are also criticising President Jair Bolsonaro for not taking action. Scientists from Brazil's National Space Research Institute (INPE) say theAmazon has suffered lossesat an accelerated rate since Mr Bolsonaro took office in January.

What are 'alternatives'?,"The aim is to keep border crossings like this one at Strabane/Lifford free of checkpoints The prime minister believes ""alternative arrangements"" for the Irish border are the key to scrapping the controversial backstop plan and unlocking a Brexit deal. But what are they and why are they necessary? If Brexit happens, the UK's only land border with the European Union (EU) would be between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In theory, that would mean checks on certain products because rules and standards may not stay the same. The worry is this could lead to a so-called hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, with infrastructure installed so checks could be carried out. To address this problem, Theresa May negotiated a solution called the Irish backstop. But it proved controversial as many Conservative MPs felt this plan would keep the UK too closely tied to the EU after Brexit with no way of getting out of it. The political opposition to the backstop eventually led to Mrs May's resignation. Boris Johnson, the new Prime Minister, has vowed to scrap it. Boris Johnson has praised a report written by theAlternative Arrangements Commission,external, led by Conservative MPs Greg Hands and Nicky Morgan. The commission's purpose is finding a way of avoiding checks while not having to stick to the EU's rules and standards. This is important to Brexit supporters who want the UK to leave the EU's customs union and be able to strike trade deals around the world. At the heart of the Alternative Arrangements report is a reliance on existing technology and trusted traders schemes. Boris Johnson has previously said there are ""abundant"" technological solutions It recognises companies that are reliable and trustworthy in dealing with customs - the process where businesses declare what goods they're trading. Once on the trusted-trader scheme, approved businesses are allowed to avoid many checks and benefit from fast-track processes. The most common trusted-trader arrangements areAuthorised Economic Operator (AEO),externalschemes. Getting AEO status can be costly and time consuming, so new schemes would be needed for small businesses. For UK traders to benefit from any scheme, the EU would need to recognise it. Some trade experts have also cautioned that it would not guarantee the end of all checks. Another idea is to allow custom checks at a lorry's destination - rather than the border. Technology could aid the process, with satellite navigation systems tracking lorries as they cross from Northern Ireland into the Republic. Mobile inspection teams would then meet the lorries and scan the goods once they had completed their journey. However, such a system would increase costs and complexity, especially for small businesses. Strict EU rules mean food products entering from a non-EU countrymust be subject to checks at the point of entry. For example, a consignment of chicken arriving in the UK from Thailand has to be physically inspected to make sure what's written in the documents matches what's inside the containers. In the event of a no-deal Brexit, the same inspection regime would be required for goods crossing from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland. British Veterinary Association president Simon Doherty says this would be a ""nightmare scenario"" for some producers. ""Take pizza,"" he says. ""Imagine it's produced in Northern Ireland and exported to the Republic of Ireland and each ingredient comes from a different country. ""Let's say it has chicken from Thailand, chorizo from Spain and cheese from Ireland. Each of these individual ingredients will require their own audit trail if the rules are enforced."" Trusted-trader schemes and technological solutions are no real help with this issue as they deal with customs and not product inspections. To get round this, the Alternative Arrangements Commission suggested these checks should take place away from the border. But this wouldn't be allowed under current EU law. The Alternative Arrangements Commission concedes that some way of keeping rules and standards the same is the best way to tackle this issue. The EU has committed to working on alternative arrangements. Germany's Chancellor, Angela Merkel, has said the withdrawal agreement would not need to be reopened if a practical solution to the backstop could be found. It committed to fast-tracking negotiations on replacing the backstop. RTÃ's Brussels correspondent Tony Connolly has reported that EU officials have suggested that any alternative arrangements would have to meet five tests: Avoiding a hard border Complying with the EU customs code Complying with EU principles Complying with WTO rules Protecting the all-island economy But even if the EU agreed to an alternative solution, each one would take time, perhaps years, to implement and would require the cooperation of Ireland and the EU. The Irish government remains sceptical technical and administrative proposals would be enough to eliminate border checks. It has also emphasised any solution must not introduce new checks - even away from the border. It points to the 2017 Joint Report of the EU and UK, a interim deal, in which there was a commitment to avoid a hard border, ""including any physical infrastructure or related checks and controls"". Some Brexit supporters say this would prohibit checks and controls at the border only. The Irish government disagrees.
