Hunger strike over UK's Rwanda deportation notices,"An excerpt of the document given to the asylum seekers by the Home Office to inform them they will be flown to Rwanda on 14 June. Asylum seekers at an immigration detention centre in the UK say they went on hunger strike after being told they would be deported to Rwanda. Seventeen asylum seekers at Brook House detention centre near Gatwick Airport, Sussex, have told the BBC of an atmosphere of distress and despair among detainees. In April the government announced plans tosend some asylum seekers to Rwanda. But the UK Home Office says detainee welfare is of the ""utmost importance"". The asylum seekers have shared with the BBC details of the removal notices issued. One document, dated 1 June, identifies an asylum seeker detained in Brooke House for imminent removal to the Rwandan capital Kigali. It says he cannot appeal this decision. Home Secretary Priti Patel has said the first deportation flight, to take people who arrived in the UK without authorisation, is to leave on 14 June - a week later than first announced. Following the introduction of the Nationality and Borders Act in April, the government will transfer to a ""safe third country"" - Rwanda - responsibility for providing asylum to those who arrive in the UK by irregular routes, such as crossing the English Channel in a boat from France. The measure to fly these asylum seekers 4,500 miles (7,240km) to Rwanda is part of a Â£120m ($151m) deal with the central African nation. This video can not be played A tour of the Rwandan hotel where some UK asylum seekers will stay Speaking to the BBC, one asylum seeker said he was among a group of 17 who ended a five-day hunger strike on Wednesday evening, after guards stopped providing them with sugar to mix with their water while abstaining from food. Ali, who says he has family in the UK, told the BBC that his last meeting with immigration officials was about ending his hunger strike. ""The final thing they told me was 'eat so you can get on the aeroplane in good health'."" Those who went on hunger strike include Egyptian asylum seekers, among an estimated 100 arrivals notified by the Home Office that they are to be deported to Rwanda. One group received a removal notice on Wednesday about a 14 June flight. The deal to send asylum seekers to Rwanda has been criticised by opposition leaders, charities and religious leaders The detainees said that authorities at Brook House had prohibited phones with cameras, confiscating their smartphones and providing them only with phones without access to the internet. The BBC managed to receive a full copy of the removal notice that details their situation. The letter, more than 20 pages long, was only issued in English. However one section notes that an interpreter was present to explain its contents to an asylum seeker. The document repeatedly misspelled the man's name. Two separate asylum seekers asked our reporter about the contents of the document, which requires their signature, due to their inability to understand its details in English. The document says the reason for the deportation is the people arrived on an ""RHIB"" - a rigid-hull inflatable boat - and they had no documentation to prove entitlement to be in the UK The Home Office has not confirmed how many people have been issued with removal notices. However the charity Care4Calais estimates that around 100 asylum seekers who have arrived over the last month have been warned of imminent removal from the UK. Care4Calais has identified and is offering support to more than 60 of them. A man from Syria, who is wanted for military service at home, told the BBC he was ""ready to die, but not be moved to Rwanda"". He said: ""When I heard the news that we will be deported to Rwanda and that we will receive a five-year residence permit there I started hitting myself."" In response to questions about the hunger strike inside Brook House, a Home Office spokesperson said: ""The health and welfare of those in immigration detention is of the utmost importance. ""We take every step to prevent self-harm or suicide, including a dedicated welfare team on site at each immigration removal centre, responsible for identifying vulnerable individuals and providing assistance to support individuals' needs."" An Egyptian man told the BBC he was among the 17 who had gone on hunger strike. ""I didn't get a meeting with the Home Office without going on a hunger strike twice,"" he said. ""I had to leave my country for family disputes. I have a mental health problem from what I've witnessed in Libya on the journey here."" UK Home Secretary Priti Patel travelled to Rwanda to sign the deal As part of Tuesday's announcement on flights beginning in mid-June, Home Secretary Priti Patel said ""we know attempts will now be made to frustrate the process and delay removals; I will not be deterred and remain fully committed to delivering what the British public expect."" However, Steven Galliver-Andrew, a barrister working in immigration law, has told the BBC he believes the government will not keep to 14 June for the first deportation flight. He said: ""The law which allows the government to do this doesn't appear to come into force until the 28th of June 2022. ""What they are doing can and will be challenged - and they know and expect that.""

Investors seek millions from Woodford fund collapse,"Robin McConnachie, pictured here with his wife, invested Â£12,000 in Neil Woodford's fund Three years ago, Robin McConnachie suddenly found himself unable to access money he'd invested with famed fund manger Neil Woodford. ""I was shocked,"" said the retired City banker, who had invested Â£12,000 in the fund which eventually collapsed. On Friday, lawyers will file a case against the fund's administrators Link Fund Solutions, alleging they failed to properly supervise the investments. But Link says it acted within the rules and will ""vigorously defend itself"". Mr Woodford was one of the UK's most high profile stockpickers and when he set up his own managed fund, he came with an impressive reputation. At Invesco Perpetual, where he made his name, anyone investing a pension fund of Â£10,000 with him at the start of his time there would have seen it grow to Â£250,000 by the time Mr Woodford resigned to launch his own business 26 years later. The spectacular fall of money manager Neil Woodford Investors, ranging from ordinary people to pension funds, put money into the Woodford Equity Income Fund. At its peak, the fund was reportedly managing more than Â£10bn. But as investors became increasingly worried about the investments being made on their behalf, many withdrew their money. More than Â£500m was taken out in just four weeks. Then on 3 June 2019 - three years ago today - Link froze the fund, which later collapsed. ""Link was in place to act as the referee,"" said Daniel Kerrigan, senior associate at the London firm Harcus Parker, which is bringing the case. ""They let the fund go off the rails."" Lawyers from the firm will argue Link had a duty to investors to ensure the fund was prudently managed and not overly risky. They say those duties were breached, for instance when the fund invested in unlisted start-ups instead of in large, dividend-paying stocks. But Link says it will be ""vigorously defending"" the charges. ""A key responsibility of Link ... was, and is, to act in the best interests of all investors in the Woodford Equity Investment Fund,"" a Link spokesperson said. He added: ""Link takes this and its other responsibilities very seriously and considers that it has acted at all times in accordance with applicable rules, as well as in the best interests of all investors, and it will continue to do so."" It will be up to the High Court to decide whether the fund's eventual collapse in October 2019 was Link's fault. Neither Mr Woodford himself, nor his company, is targeted by the litigation. Neil Woodford was once known as a star stockpicker A sale of the fund's assets has already allowed some money to be returned to investors. Mr McConnachie has so far received just under Â£8000 in that process but he's hoping the lawsuit can return the rest. Having invested into Mr Woodford's fund at Invesco Perpetual, he decided to diversify his holdings and direct some of his money in his new venture. ""He was regarded as a high-flying fund manager,"" Mr McConnachie said. ""The prospectus said the new fund will be run along similar lines."" He said he was so angry by the way Link acted, he decided to join the lawsuit against them. ""What Link did or didn't do is simply not acceptable and they should be called to account."" Last year, Neil Woodford spoke publicly about the embarrassing saga,telling The Daily Telegraph,externalhe was ""very sorry for what [he] did wrong"". He added: ""I can't be sorry for the things I didn't do. I didn't make the decision to suspend the fund, I didn't make the decision to liquidate the fund. As history will now show, those decisions were incredibly damaging to investors and they were not mine."" Mr Woodford has since set up a new investment business thoughit has not been welcomed by all. The FCA has been carrying out its own investigation into the fund's collapse, and is yet to decide whether to take any action. In January, MPs urged the financial watchdog to move quickly, given the public interest in the scandal. Harcus Parker represents 7,000 investors who lost money. The initial claim against Link, lodged on Friday, represents 1,500 of those and will seek damages of an estimated Â£18m. A further claim relating to the same issue is being brought against Link by the firm Leigh Day. It will represent 12,000 investors. ""There are believed to be around 300,000 people affected by this issue out there,"" Mr Kerrigan said. ""We encourage people who have not signed up to do so.""

Nigeria bans bushmeat to prevent monkeypox spread,"Bushmeat is a delicacy in parts of Nigeria, but in other places it can be a vital source of food The Nigerian government has banned the sale of bushmeat as a precaution to stop the spread of monkeypox. Six cases have been detected in the country this month bringing to 21 the number of confirmed infections this year, the authorities said. Experts say it is possible that the virus can be caught by eating meat from an infected animal. But this is not the most common transmission route. Monkeypox, a mild viral infection, is endemic in Nigeria. It occurs mostly in remote areas, near tropical rainforests. The country has had sporadic cases since an outbreak in 2017. The virus was found mainly in the south of the country but, since 2020, it has spread to central, eastern and northern areas, the World Health Organization says. Out of the 21 confirmed cases this year, there has been one reported death of a person who had underlying conditions. But earlier this week the health authorities said ""there has been no evidence of any new or unusual transmission of the virus, nor changes in its clinical manifestation documented"". What is monkeypox and how do you catch it? Africa Live: More on this and other stories from the continent Scientists are struggling to explain a recent rise in monkeypox cases in Europe, which have not been linked to travel to the African countries where it is endemic. But there are suggestions the virus has been spreading from person to person for some time undetected. Monkeypox can be spread when someone is in close contact with an infected person. The virus can enter the body through broken skin, the respiratory tract or through the eyes, nose or mouth. Those infected in the UK have been advised to avoid having sex while they have symptoms. The animals that can pass on the virus are infected rodents, including rats and squirrels. According to health experts, this can happen if someone is bitten or touches an infected animal. Bushmeat refers to any wild animal that is killed for consumption, including antelopes, chimpanzees, fruit bats, rats, porcupines and snakes. In some remote areas of Nigeria it is a vital source of food, while in others it has become a delicacy. There are many bushmeat markets in Nigeria and it is unclear how the ban will be implemented. The ministry of agriculture also directed vets and its other officials to increase surveillance aimed at detecting any possible cases of monkeypox in animals. Operators of zoos, parks, conservation areas and recreational centres were reminded to make sure there was no contact between animals and humans Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Keir Starmer and Kemi Badenoch clash over UK economy at PMQs Red Sea dive-boat survivors accuse authorities of cover up Chris Mason: Political heat map flashes red over Treasury They hired Banksy for Â£50 then painted over his mural 'We sing to them': LA stables turn Noah's Ark for fire rescue animals Fatbergs turned into perfume - inside Britain's bizarre new industrial revolution Gaza 'humanitarian zone' struck almost 100 times since May, BBC Verify finds LA fire victims fear new housing crisis Trapped in the dark for 35 hours - Red Sea dive-boat survivors tell of terrifying escapes 'Your husband's being tortured, and it's your fault' Lily and Miquita answer your questions about respect Join lifelong friends as they discuss the world around them Dragonsâ Den returns with a new line-up of celebrity guests Can a fresh batch of entrepreneurs secure the deal of a lifetime?

JK Rowling firm in row over right-to-roam access,"JK Rowling owns Thistlelane Ltd, which has two big forestry estates in the Borders A firm controlled by Harry Potter author JK Rowling has been accused of preventing access to paths on forestry estates in the Scottish Borders. Walkers and mountain-bikers claim that navigating a historical six-mile right-of-way has been hampered by the firm. Thistlelane Ltd owns the 290-hectare Sheperdscleuh estate as well as the 306-hectare Wardlaw estate. Agents for Thistlelane rejected accusations that right-to-roam legislation had been breached. Ramblers enjoying the views from the Captain's Road before the access problems The agents, Scottish Woodlands, confirmed that talks were ongoing with community groups and access officers over ""issues"". Walkers and community leaders claim Rowling's company erected no-access signs at gates on the trail known as Captain's Road, blocked efforts to erect way-markers, threatened to lock gates, and even planted trees across the route. Mountain bike enthusiast Paul Collins, who lives in the Yarrow Valley, said ""We can't now walk or cycle the original Captain's Road because of forestry, and they keep raising concerns about using the nearby forestry road as an alternative route. ""We're now at the stage where we can't follow the Captain's Road because of the action of the landowners."" Mr Collins said forestry companies at nearby Glentress were opening up great swathes of land for walkers and mountain bikers but this small right-of-way over the hills above St Mary's Loch appeared to have been closed down. No access signs have been put on gates along the route Thistlelane Ltd is under the sole directorship of JK Rowling's husband, Dr Neil Murray, and lists the person with significant control - having at least three-quarters of the shares - as the author by her married name of Joanne Kathleen Murray. The Captain's Road, which links two droving inns, Tibbie Shiel's and Tushielaw, was one of the earliest metalled roads connecting the Ettrick and Yarrow valleys. It is named after a Napoleonic War captain, called Napier, who bought and farmed the same hills in the early 19th Century. Gordon Harrison at a section of the route for planting Following the arrival of modern-surfaced roads in the early 20th Century, it gradually became overgrown. With the growth in popularity of rambling and off-road biking the Captain's Road began to be used more regularly as a way up into the hills from the Ettrick and Yarrow valleys. In 2019 a missing link was re-established, with public and grant funding from the local authority and other organisations. The opening saw around 30 walkers cross the six-mile route - and over the following months many more hikers and bikers followed in their footsteps across the scenic pass. But during the Covid pandemic ""no access"" signs appeared. Gordon Harrison, who is a former chair of the Ettrick and Yarrow Community Council, took part in the original negotiations with landowners when re-establishing sections of the Captain's Road. He said: ""The Captain's Road has been there for a long time and when the community decided to signpost it and resurface a section, the discussions with landowners were favourable. A lengthy section of the route through a peat bog has been âmoundedâ for saplings ""We wanted to encourage people to visit the area and either walk or cycle the route between Tushielaw and St Mary's Loch - there are some spectacular views."" But Mr Harrison added: ""Something has happened and I don't know what, but more recently there has been continuous hurdles put up to prevent people using the route. ""The latest is them planting saplings across the right-of-way and not offering any alternative routes - those saplings will quickly become large trees and it will be impossible to walk or cycle through there."" Frank Garton was also heavily involved with the project to re-establish the lost section of the Captain's Road. He said: ""We are now at the stage where you can't use the right-of-way and we are not allowed to sign-post any alternative routes. ""The entire project to connect the two paths, as well as all the grant and public funding, has been a waste of time."" The right-of-way as identified by Scottish Borders Council Scottish Borders Council's access officers are currently in negotiations with Thistlelane's agents, Scottish Woodlands, about the right-of-way issues. A site visit is also due to take place between the agents and community leaders in the coming days. Charlotte Cavey-Wilcox, from Scottish Woodlands, denied that access rights had been breached. She said: ""We are currently liaising closely with Scottish Forestry, Scottish Borders Council and the Ettrick and Yarrow Community Development Company to try and resolve the issues. ""Members of the public have a right to responsible access under Scottish legislation and the terms of the Scottish Outdoor Access code and these rights have not been restricted within Shepherdscleuch Forest.""

Travel industry plea for overseas workers rejected,"The Transport Secretary has rejected a request by the aviation industry to allow them to recruit workers from overseas, aviation insiders have told the BBC. Companies asked for special immigration visas for overseas workers at a meeting with Grant Shapps on Wednesday. Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their travel plans disrupted this week after flight cancellations and delays at airports. Understaffing is to blame, say experts. The half-term break and bank holiday Jubilee weekend is the first major test the industry has faced since all Covid travel restrictions were lifted in March. Nearly 27,000 flights out of the UK have been scheduled between 27 May and 5 June, according to aviation data firm Cirium. However, the industry has struggled to recruit staff to replace those workers who lost their job or left the sector during Covid. It has resulted in long queues at airports to get through security, check-in baggage or delays in retrieving luggage. Why are flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Industry bosses suggested to Mr Shapps that one potential fix would be to allow EU workers to cover the huge number of operational vacancies as the travel sector approaches the peak summer holidays in July and August. Executives questioned why some creative industries can get special visas and aviation cannot. It is understood that the government considered changes tothe Shortage Occupation List,externalbut ministers discounted the idea. Some of the professions that are on the government's list include graphic designers, IT technicians, chefs and ballet dancers. Instead a working group is being set up ahead of the summer holidays ""to work through issues of shared concerns together"". The Department for Transport declined to comment. Steve Heapy, chief executive of holiday firm Jet2, blamed Brexit for the shortage of staff. ""Brexit has taken hundreds of thousands, if not millions of people out of the employment market and that undoubtedly is having an impact,"" he told the BBC. Following delay at airports this week, passengers are being advised they shouldtake just one carry-on bag on holiday with themand not check-in luggage to avoid delays. The GMB union, which represents aviation workers, said if people don't check-in luggage it ""limits the disruption"". Paul Charles, chief executive of travel consultancy PC Agency, said: ""The smaller the bag, the less time you spend in security queues."" Before Covid, airports and airlines across the UK employed around 140,000 people, according to industry body Airlines UK. More than 30,000 members of staff have been laid off from UK airlines alone over the past two years. The UK labour market currently has a record number of available vacancies and the lowest unemployment rate in nearly 50 years. Flights departing on Thursday appear to have done so without much incident at Gatwick, Heathrow and Manchester. There are scheduled to be 2,746 flights departing from UK on Thursday, equating to 479,383 available seats. Amsterdam, Dublin and Mallorca are the top destinations. While passengers have reported long queues again at Manchester on social media, there are no signs of cancellations. Tui said that all its flights are now operating as normal after a difficult week for the UK's largest tour operator. It cancelled six flights a day from Manchester for the entirety of June in an attempt to limit the impact of staffing levels at Swissport, which provides ground services for Tui. BA and easyJet have also cancelled flights. Tui says 80% of those who had flights cancelled have now rebooked after it kept some of its stores open until midnight to allow passengers to find alternatives.

People who met the Queen talk of their memories,"This video can not be played The Queen opened a new visitors centre in Dudley in 1994 Millions of people will celebrate the Queen's Platinum Jubilee this weekend, but for a few it will have a personal touch. Celebrations are under way as Jubilee fever is in full swing. The Queen has thanked the publicfor organising events and said ""many happy memories"" would be made. As the nation celebrates the monarch's 70-year reign, some people in the South have shared their memories of special meetings with the Queen. Harry Dymond lives near Southampton, in Hampshire, and has seen the Queen twice in his life. Harry Dymond said he was happy to see the nation celebrating the Queen's 70-year reign He was just 13 years old when he was chosen as a St John's Ambulance cadet to attend and help out at the Queen's coronation. ""I was so pleased and honoured to think that I would be at the coronation and could possibly see the Queen. I had no thought at that time, of course, that I might ever see her again,"" he said. But 62 years later, he met the Queen as he received an MBE for his services to St John's Ambulance and the community. ""For that very little time you are with her, you feel like you are the only person in the world,"" Mr Dymond said. ""She's got a marvellous ability just to make you so relaxed and able to talk to her freely and simply."" It was when Tina Nicholls was asked to volunteer at Buckingham Palace during a hot summer day that she met the Queen. Ms Nicholls said her meeting with the Queen was ""very special"" Originally from East Cowes on the Isle of Wight, Ms Nicholls travelled to London for the event. ""I went up on the day, quite nervous, not sure what to expect,"" she said. But while she was there with other volunteers, she was told she was going to meet the Queen. ""She came down the line and she spoke to each of us in turn. We had a short chat and then she moved on,"" Ms Nicholls said. ""It was the most wonderful and surreal moment of my life. I do cherish that one, it's very special to me. She is a special woman."" Steve Block now lives in Reading, Berkshire. But he was head of music at a secondary school in Stourbridge, near Dudley, when he met the Queen in 1994. Steve Block met the Queen in 1994 The composer was asked to write a piece for the opening of the visitor centre at Dudley Town Hall. But it was just before the event he found out that the Queen was going to open the visitor centre. ""On the day I was standing on a podium in front of a hundred primary school children who were going to sing and the Queen was sitting just behind me,"" he said. Mr Block performed his piece and met the Queen afterwards. ""She asked me about the choir... it was very brief but it was memorable. I shall never forget it,"" he added. John Herbert, from Poole, was 23 years old when he served in the armed forces in 1963. It was then that he met the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh. John Herbert was serving in the armed forces in the Shetland Islands when he met the Queen ""At the time I was very young and very tense,"" he said. Mr Herbert remembers being very nervous for the event and said he referred to the Duke of Edinburgh as ""your majesty"" by accident. ""I'm afraid I got completely mixed up because I was so nervous,"" Mr Herbert said. But he added: ""I was very impressed to meet the Queen.""

Jubilee beacons to be lit across Wales,"Beacons like this one on the Garth, north of Cardiff, were lit across Wales on Thursday evening Beacons have been lit across Wales to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. The Queen is the first British monarch to celebrate 70 years on the throne, and in September 2015, she surpassed Queen Victoria to become the longest reigning monarch in British history. First Minister Mark Drakeford paid tribute to her and will attend events in Cardiff and London over the weekend. He gave ""thanks and warmest congratulations"" on her ""historic milestone"". Who is on - and off - the royal balcony Gareth Bale, Bonnie Tyler and Covid staff honoured Platinum Jubilee: Queen's life in pictures Forty-two shots were fired at midday on Thursday as part of a royal gun salute in Cardiff Bay At 12:00 BST a royal gun salute in Cardiff Bay signalled the start of the Jubilee celebrations, with an hour of military music from the Regimental Band and Corps of Drums of the Royal Welsh following. As part of the event, 42 shots were fired - 21 to mark the Queen's birthday, and another 21 to mark the Jubilee. The event was important for Col SiÃ´n Walker, Deputy Commander of the 160th Welsh Brigade, as he gave the salute to allow the guns to be fired. ""I joined the Reserve Army in 1985 and was commissioned in 1991, joining the 224 Squadron in Lampeter,"" he said. Col SiÃ´n Walker said it was a ""great honour"" to oversee the tribute to the Queen ""I first met the Queen in 1992 during the yeoman's parade year as the junior officer at the Pembrokeshire Yeomanry. ""It is a great honour to oversee Wales's tribute to Her Majesty the Queen today."" Meanwhile in Holywell, Flintshire, market stalls and bunting lined the high street for the Jubilee, while the council and volunteers arranged free food for children and a tea party for older residents. A Punch and Judy show was run by the local town crier in Holywell Later in the evening, a beacon was lit outside the Pierhead building in Cardiff Bay, in co-ordinance with thousands of beacons across the UK and the capitals of 54 Commonwealth countries. There was a fireworks display to finish the celebrations in the Bay. Oystermouth Castle in Swansea, Tenby's Castle Hill, Queen Elizabeth II playing fields in Newport, Park Havard in Llanelli and Bangor Pier in Gwynedd also lit beacons as part of the celebrations. In Denbighshire, the home of the national Urdd Eisteddfod, beacons were lit in Rhyl Events Arena. In Flintshire five beacons were lit along the coastline including a striking dragon in Bagillt. Bagillt beacon, in Flintshire, will be lit as part of the celebrations ""Bagillt's beacon is a very distinctive dragon, and it's part of the landscape,"" Helen Mrowiec, the site leader for Denbighshire and Flintshire council, said before the event. ""I think it's a great thing we have these beacons as part of a national event and that it's going to be different in each locality. ""It's part of our history that the Queen has been on the throne for so long and it's important that people have the opportunity to be part of those celebrate if they want to."" Helen Mrowiec said communities were looking forward to getting together to celebrate the Jubilee The main torch was lit at a special ceremony at Buckingham Palace. But not everyone will be supporting and celebrating the Jubilee - Erwyn Jones is a republican and lives in Blaenau Ffestiniog, Gwynedd. He said he believed it was unfair people in Wales are expected to celebrate the Queen, as she is a ""rich woman"" who has no connection to Wales. ""I think it's time to ask the question, do we as a country want to continue with the monarchy?"" Erwyn Jones said he wants to be far away from any Jubilee celebrations ""I think out of a population of 66 million I'm sure we can do better than having a boss who's been from the same family for years and years. ""I certainly wouldn't celebrate the Jubilee. I will be spending my weekend going up a mountain far enough from any Jubilee celebrations,"" he added. At the Urdd Eisteddfod in Denbigh - there was a mixed review for the celebrations. Elsie Roberts from Pwllheli, Gwynedd, said: ""For everyone who loves to celebrate, I think it is good for people to have a celebration, but the jubilee might not be for everyone."" Ken Morfydd Owen has said he was not especially keen on celebrating the Jubilee, and would much rather have a public holiday for St David's Day Ken Morfydd Owen said he would be ""doing everything I can to avoid the jubilee altogether"". ""I considered going to Ireland so I didn't see anything, but it just didn't happen,"" he added. ""Turn off the TV, turn off the radio and be in a dark room I think. I'm not interested at all, it's fine for everyone to celebrate, but I'd rather have a bank holiday to celebrate St David's Day rather than the Queen.""

Driving agency cracks down on driving test resales,"The DVSA say they have started closing down accounts not linked to driving instructors The Driver and Vehicle Standards Agency (DVSA) says it has started to take action against companies exploiting learner drivers. A BBC investigation found that some learner drivers had paid over Â£200 for a practical driving test - more than double the standard fee. The number of times a test can be changed has been reduced from 10 to the pre-pandemic limit of six. Accounts not linked to instructors on the booking system are being removed. The DVSA is the official body that carries out driving tests in Great Britain. Driving test backlog sees exams sold for over Â£200 The demand for driving tests caused by a backlog due to the pandemic has seen many learners turn towards a secondary market. Some are paying a nominal fee to companies which find them cancelled tests, while others are buying from sellers offering tests for vastly inflated prices. One provider claimed to use ""AI-powered software"" to scoop up vacant test slots. Driving instructors have access to a separate part of the DVSA's booking system, which allows them to book multiple tests for their students.But the BBC found that there was little verification to check who was signing up as it was all done online. The investigation found that tests could be swapped, meaning that operators could keep a rotating stock of tests. The system was relatively simple to manipulate for profit, with tests booked in advance and then sold on with the buyers' details added. The BBC saw evidence of one company which booked tests encouraging driving instructors who bought tests from them to profit from learners. The DVSA has now stopped accepting new automatic online registrations to use the service. New applications must now be done by e-mail, where they will be thoroughly checked by the agency. Some learners face 10-month wait for driving tests Driving tests resume but learners fight for slots 'I can't get a driving test until next year' Loveday Ryder, the chief executive of the DVSA, said: ""We've already put in place measures to monitor and prevent bots from accessing our systems while also strengthening our firewall to tackle the issue. ""We will continue to work tirelessly to crack down on companies that are exploiting learner drivers. ""We've closed the system to new registrations and will rapidly close down accounts that do not belong to driving instructors and driving schools. ""We'll also be taking further steps to make sure all future accounts are linked to driving instructors and those with training businesses."" The terms and conditions of the DVSA's service are being updated to make it clear that instructors are not allowed to use it to profit from managing test bookings. It has also started removing any accounts not linked to driving instructors from the part of its site which allows multiple test bookings.

Hospitality staffing 'crisis' hits Jubilee trade,"The Harbourmaster Hotel in Aberaeron, Ceredigion, has five vacancies Staff shortages have put hospitality businesses under pressure going into the Jubilee bank holiday weekend, according to bosses. One hotel operator has limited their booking capacity as it filled only 50 of 80 vacancies in May. Stephen Leeke from Vale resort in Hensol, Vale of Glamorgan, said the hospitality industry was ""experiencing a staffing crisis"". Meanwhile, traffic analysts have warned about congestion due to the holidays. Mr Leeke said: ""It's been an uphill struggle trying to find staff for some of the jobs on the resort. ""It's been a rollercoaster ride the last year or so since reopening after Covid with all the protocols. ""Through the pandemic, a lot of the European workers went back to their home countries and with Brexit it meant they're not allowed to return so that's created a big skills shortage amongst positions like chefs, food and beverage staff."" Stephen Leeke: ""We're taking the view we will have to train people from the bottom up and actively recruit apprentices"" Jubilee celebration fantastic for trade, say firms How strong is Wales' bond with the monarchy? The Vale hotel and resort, which employs 400 people, needs to fill another 30 vacancies and train some of its newest recruits so it has had to limit capacity in some areas and with certain restaurant offerings. ""That was a real uphill struggle to get those 50 staff,"" he said. ""We spoke to job centres, schools, colleges, universities, and capital regional initiatives as well. ""The 50 we've taken on now need training there's a lot to do. ""We're managing, but only just. ""We're taking the view we will have to train people from the bottom up and actively recruit apprentices and junior staff with the view for them to become the managers of tomorrow."" In April, Vale Holiday Parks, based in Aberystwyth, said it had beganhiring chefs from Indiabecause it has been unable to fill vacant roles locally. Aberaeron and other tourist destinations are expected to be busy over the bank holiday weekend The Harbourmaster Hotel in Aberaeron, Ceredigion, also has five vacancies. ""We are looking for a deputy manager to take the pressure off myself and others,"" said general manager Dai Morgan. ""I'd like two bar people with experience, or would at least love to learn about how to make cocktails and drinks. And I'd love another couple of waiters or waitresses."" Dr Sheena Carlisle, senior lecturer in tourism management at Cardiff Metropolitan University said the perception of working in the industry needed to change to attract and retain staff. There are about 12,000 hospitality businesses across Wales with the sector worth Â£3.6bn to the Welsh economy and employing 140,000 prior to the pandemic. ""There are challenges and one of the biggest ones is the perception of the value of having a career in tourism,"" she said. ""For many people working in the sector it's an enjoyable, fulfilling role to have and, even though it can be low paid, with long hours, people might not be able to see the progression from moving from an operational job to a higher level senior management job. ""There needs to be investment in training and development,"" she said. ""It is absolutely key to help with this staff retention issue and increase quality of working in the sector. After all, it is a good sector to work in."" Music fans were caught up in traffic for hours on the M4 last week The RAC motoring company predicted roads would be very busy again this week. It has been estimated there will be 12 million UK leisure trips from Thursday to the end of the weekend with 3.6 million journeys predicted to be made on the bank holiday Friday. It comes after somefans missed Ed Sheeran's concertat Cardiff's Principality Stadium last week due to long queues on the M4 from the Severn Bridge into Wales. Can Cardiff cope with big stadium shows? Brits set to spend millions on jubilee merchandise Traffic data experts Inrix pinpointed the M4 section between Port Talbot and Swansea, the M5 south of Bristol near the Severn bridges, and Newport's M4 Brynglas tunnels as sections likely to see heavy congestion and delays. ""The fact that the double Jubilee bank holiday coincides with the end of half term for many families is only likely to add to any problems on the roads,"" said spokesman Rod Dennis. ""Our indication suggest drivers are really going to make the most of this weekend in and around Wales. ""Drivers who set off early in the morning stand the best chance of beating the queues,"" he said. ""We predict roads to be very congested for the next few days.""

Colombian 'Chess Player' drug lord dies in US jail,"Colombian prosecutors gave permission in 2003 for RodrÃ­guez Orejuela to be extradited to the United States The former head of Colombia's once-powerful Cali drugs cartel has died in prison in the United States. At one point, Gilberto RodrÃ­guez Orejuela controlled the vast majority of the world's cocaine trade and was an arch-nemesis of Pablo Escobar. The 83-year-old was even nicknamed the Chess Player for his skill at staying one step ahead of rivals and the law. But in 1995 his luck ran out - he was arrested in Colombia and eventually extradited to the US in 2004. The former cartel leader was serving a 30-year federal prison sentence in North Carolina where his family says he died of an illness on Tuesday. At the height of his powers, Gilberto RodrÃ­guez Orejuela ran the Cali drugs cartel with his brother Miguel. According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the pair's Cali gang was responsible for 80% of the world's total cocaine trade by the mid-1990s. That monopoly was only achieved after 1993, the year RodrÃ­guez Orejuela's long-time arch-nemesis - Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medellin cartel - was killed by police. In 1995 Gilberto RodrÃ­guez Orejuela was arrested at his luxury apartment in Cali, Colombia While Escobar's Cali gang had a fearsome reputation in Colombia for violence, the RodrÃ­guez Orejuela brothers tried to portray themselves as respectable businessmen. They later admitted to using bribes to secure friendly treatment from powerful politicians, many of whom they were close to, and were never pursued as actively by authorities as their MedellÃ­n rivals. RodrÃ­guez Orejuela even preferred to describe himself as an ""honest drugstore magnate"" - a reference to the chain of pharmacies owned by the family. But in practice the Cali cartel was ruthlessly violent. For years, its members battled it out with their MedellÃ­n rivals for control of lucrative cocaine markets and supply routes. The RodrÃ­guez Orejuela brothers deployed bombs and vigilantes - and were believed to be behind the Pepes group responsible for the deaths of more than 60 of Pablo Escobar's relatives and associates. Hundreds of gang members, drug dealers, and ordinary people were killed in the bloody turf conflict which gripped Colombia throughout the 1980s as a result. The Cali cartel's demise eventually began in 1995, when police arrested Gilberto RodrÃ­guez Orejuela at his luxury home in Cali, where he was reportedly crouching in a wardrobe. Within a year of his arrest, some six of the cartel's seven leaders were either dead or behind bars. His younger brother Miguel, arrested two months after Gilberto, is currently serving a prison sentence in the US.

"Colombian 'Chess Player' drug lord dies in US jailGilberto RodrÃ­guez Orejuela, 83, ran the powerful Cali cartel and was an arch-rival of Pablo Escobar.","Colombian prosecutors gave permission in 2003 for RodrÃ­guez Orejuela to be extradited to the United States The former head of Colombia's once-powerful Cali drugs cartel has died in prison in the United States. At one point, Gilberto RodrÃ­guez Orejuela controlled the vast majority of the world's cocaine trade and was an arch-nemesis of Pablo Escobar. The 83-year-old was even nicknamed the Chess Player for his skill at staying one step ahead of rivals and the law. But in 1995 his luck ran out - he was arrested in Colombia and eventually extradited to the US in 2004. The former cartel leader was serving a 30-year federal prison sentence in North Carolina where his family says he died of an illness on Tuesday. At the height of his powers, Gilberto RodrÃ­guez Orejuela ran the Cali drugs cartel with his brother Miguel. According to the US Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA), the pair's Cali gang was responsible for 80% of the world's total cocaine trade by the mid-1990s. That monopoly was only achieved after 1993, the year RodrÃ­guez Orejuela's long-time arch-nemesis - Pablo Escobar, the leader of the Medellin cartel - was killed by police. In 1995 Gilberto RodrÃ­guez Orejuela was arrested at his luxury apartment in Cali, Colombia While Escobar's Cali gang had a fearsome reputation in Colombia for violence, the RodrÃ­guez Orejuela brothers tried to portray themselves as respectable businessmen. They later admitted to using bribes to secure friendly treatment from powerful politicians, many of whom they were close to, and were never pursued as actively by authorities as their MedellÃ­n rivals. RodrÃ­guez Orejuela even preferred to describe himself as an ""honest drugstore magnate"" - a reference to the chain of pharmacies owned by the family. But in practice the Cali cartel was ruthlessly violent. For years, its members battled it out with their MedellÃ­n rivals for control of lucrative cocaine markets and supply routes. The RodrÃ­guez Orejuela brothers deployed bombs and vigilantes - and were believed to be behind the Pepes group responsible for the deaths of more than 60 of Pablo Escobar's relatives and associates. Hundreds of gang members, drug dealers, and ordinary people were killed in the bloody turf conflict which gripped Colombia throughout the 1980s as a result. The Cali cartel's demise eventually began in 1995, when police arrested Gilberto RodrÃ­guez Orejuela at his luxury home in Cali, where he was reportedly crouching in a wardrobe. Within a year of his arrest, some six of the cartel's seven leaders were either dead or behind bars. His younger brother Miguel, arrested two months after Gilberto, is currently serving a prison sentence in the US.

Elon Musk declares end to remote working at Tesla,"Tesla boss Elon Musk has ordered staff to return to the office full-time, declaring that working remotely is no longer acceptable. The new policy was shared in emails that were leaked to social media. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment on the messages, one of which appeared to be addressed to executives. People who are unwilling to abide by the new rules can ""pretend to work somewhere else"" Mr Musk said on Twitter, when asked about the policy. ""Everyone at Tesla is required to spend a minimum of 40 hours in the office per week,"" he wrote in one of the emails. ""If you don't show up, we will assume you have resigned.""

The emails said staff should report to work at one of the company's main offices, ""not a remote branch office unrelated to the job duties"". Mr Musk added that he would personally review any requests for exemptions from the policy. Mr Musk said working in the office full-time was what the company asks of its factory employees and in-person collaboration was critical to the firm's success. ""There are of course companies that don't require this, but when was the last time they shipped a great new product? It's been a while,"" he said in an email, one of two that was leaked and shared on social media. ""Tesla has and will create and actually manufacture the most exciting and meaningful products of any company on Earth. This will not happen by phoning it in."" Companies in many industries are wrestling with whether to allow the remote work practices that exploded during the coronavirus pandemic to continue. Some sectors, such as banking, signalled early on that they would expect staff to return to the office, while others, often in the tech industry, have said they will allow remote work indefinitely. Many places have opted for a mix. Office occupancy in the US is at about 43%, according to data from Kastle, which runs security card access systems at thousands of buildings across the country. Mr Musk is famously hard charging in his own attitude to work. He rarely takes holidays and during a crunch period for Tesla a few years ago, he slept on the factory floor. ""The more senior you are, the more visible must be your presence,"" he wrote in one of the emails on the remote work policy. ""That is why I lived in the factory so much - so that those on the line could see me working alongside them. If I had not done that, Tesla would long ago have gone bankrupt."" Mr Musk was previously on the record as having a dim view of remote work, writing on Twitter earlier this year that ""all the Covid stay-at-home stuff has tricked people into thinking that you don't actually need to work hard. Rude awakening inbound!"" His comments raised the potential for a fresh clash of cultures with the staff at Twitter, which he is in the process of buying for $44bn (Â£35.3bn). In March, the firm's chief executive Parag Agrawal said staff could continue to work from home ""forever"". In a note to employees posted on the social media platform, Mr Agrawal said ""As we open back up, our approach remains the same. Wherever you feel most productive and creative is where you will work and that includes working from home full-time forever."" ""Office every day? That works too. Some days in office, some days from home? Of course.""
